<TITLE>Austudy: Family Allowance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain electors of Queensland points out to the Senate that the 1990-91 Federal Budget stipulates that from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. Family Allowance will be withdrawn if net assets excluding the family home and debt exceed $300,000. Furthermore, the parental assets test threshold for Family Allowance Supplement, Austudy and Assistance for Isolated Children has been severely slashed in the 1990-91 Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the economic crisis facing rural communities in Australia, assets tests of such a nature are not viable because the assets are incapable of generating enough income to sustain families and send children away for schooling.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate to exempt the family farm from the assets test for Austudy, Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Family Farm Exemption</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senators in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government is planning to introduce an assets test on Family Allowance at a level of $500,000. It will maintain the current assets tests on Family Allowance Supplement (FAS), Austudy and Isolated Children's Allowance which are discriminating against farming families particularly during the present rural crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners ask that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Australian Government to exempt the family farm of registered primary producers who are living and working on their own farm from inclusion in the assets tests for Austudy, Family Allowance, Isolated Children's Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>

<PARA> That we, the undersigned, having great concern over the effect that increasing availability of pornographic material is having in hastening the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc. or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Resist moves to have Federal Funds granted to subsidise the production and export of X-rated videos; and</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would give effect to the wide-ranging data-matching measures announced in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The agencies involved in this exercise are the Departments of Social Security, Veterans' Affairs, Community Services and Health, Employment Education and Training, and the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA>At present there are two major areas of potential abuse of the assistance and taxation systems. These arise when people provide inconsistent information on their income and family structure to two different government agencies. It is possible, for example, for a person receiving family allowance to fail to inform the Department of Employment, Education and Training and thereby receive AUSTUDY in respect of the same child, although the payment of one of those payments should preclude payment of the other. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, a person may be evading a tax liability by failing to disclose income to the Taxation Office, although information on that income may be held in another government agency's data base. </PARA>
<PARA>We expect that by matching data it will be possible to detect where a person has provided inconsistent information to one or more agencies and is thereby receiving incorrect payments. </PARA>
<PARA>The ability to cross-check data in this way builds on provisions in the social security legislation introduced earlier this session requiring claimants for or recipients of pensions and other benefits to provide their tax file numbers to the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA>The advantages of matching data on income, family structure and tax file numbers are enormous. This facility will virtually eliminate a major cause of social security and taxation fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to emphasise that privacy considerations have been a primary concern when drafting this legislation. Data would be transferred physically-not by on-line computer connection. The program would therefore not create a new data base made up of the individual agency data bases. Furthermore, time limits would be imposed on the completion of any data-matching exercise and on any action to be taken arising from discrepancies disclosed by the exercise. At the end of three months all material produced in the data-matching program would have to have been followed up by the agencies or it would be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA>An obligation of confidentiality would be placed on all staff dealing with the information. </PARA>
<PARA>Set out in the Schedule to the Bill are the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines for the conduct of the data-matching authorised by the Bill. These are designed to ensure that there is appropriate and proper protection for individual privacy in the conduct of such data-matching. </PARA>
<PARA>These guidelines have been prepared in consultation with, and have been approved by, the Privacy Commissioner. They have been specifically developed for this particular form of data-matching. The Government proposes to develop data-matching guidelines of general application following a period of public consultation and comment which has already been started by the Privacy Commissioner. It is proposed that these general guidelines would be enacted as a schedule to the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The present guidelines contained in this Bill are not necessarily indicative of the form and content of the proposed general guidelines. If the general guidelines are seen as less protective than the guidelines in the Bill the legislation to introduce the general guidelines would provide that the present guidelines are to be retained for the purpose of the data-matching activity authorised by this Bill. The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on these guidelines and agrees with this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA>There would also be a restriction on the frequency with which data-matching can be carried out-the Bill specifies a maximum of nine occasions in one year.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Training Guarantee (Administration) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 323 and made under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, be disallowed; and</PARA>
<PARA> That the Industry Training Agents' Guidelines No. 1, ITA 1 of 1990, made under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>These motions are to disallow the regulations under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 and the Industry Training Agents' Guidelines. It has become necessary to move these motions of disallowance because, although on 18 October, in what we thought was good time, the Australian Democrats gave notice of this motion in the hope that there would be some alteration of those guidelines and perhaps a revision and presentation of guidelines which could assist the administration of the training guarantee scheme, that has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiations with the Government and the Opposition have not produced guidelines which we consider to be worth supporting. The Australian Democrats originally proposed to continue to support the establishment of registered industry training agents (RITAs). However, instead of being simple and effective the scheme which has been presented to us now, we believe, is costly, over-bureaucratic and difficult to administer. Initially, the Opposition joined with us in sharing those thoughts and it was hoped that the Government would act to improve that scheme. But it is now apparent that the Opposition, as well as the Government, has no real interest in training and no real interest in examining the many problems that were raised with regard to these proposed regulations and guidelines. Instead of simplifying and improving the RITA scheme, once again the Government and the Opposition have combined to allow a scheme that is in fact complex, artificial and difficult to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment it is not open to us or the Opposition parties to disallow only part of these instruments, and we have been forced to move a motion to disallow them in toto. It was, however, open to the Government to improve these regulations, whether by supplement or re-introduction, with the changes to be effective immediately and with no delay in the operation of the registered industry training agents scheme. As I understand it, we have a compromise between the two older parties which is in fact a matter of political expediency. It fails to correct the major flaws in both instruments, and the certain effect is that training dollars will be wasted on costly bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I think it is worth referring to the documentation supplied to us on this matter. It is symptomatic of this whole muddled exercise that the explanatory statement that was tabled along with the guidelines was in fact tabled with a page missing. We were supposed to accept that, but we did not accept it. We took it as an example of the lack of planning, proper draftsmanship and proper attitude towards this whole process by those responsible for it. Other examples of how inefficient and ineffective this whole process has been were highlighted just the other day when the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, on the basis of two sets of major defects affecting personal liberties, also gave notice of a motion to disallow. According to that notice of motion, the guidelines fail to provide for any review where registration of an agent is cancelled. The Democrats agree with the Committee's assessment that the guidelines also fail to grant the power to deregister as required by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances leading to deregistration should also be spelt out clearly. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee also noted in its criticism of the guidelines that they fail to provide appropriate safeguards when empowering officials to enter premises and copy records. These significant concerns are in fact just a fragment of the problems with these RITA provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As we understand it, the concept of registered industry training agents was to enable employers to have their training plans verified before costs are incurred, rather than relying on a retrospective tax audit. That is the concept that we supported. Five months after the commencement of the training guarantee scheme, the operation of registered industry training agents is a matter of some urgency for many employers, including those who have not taken a strong interest in training in the past. These proposed guidelines violate the need, under the Act, to keep the scheme simple. Instead of helping employers to comply with their training obligations, these guidelines limit access by employers and confuse them even more. The guidelines need to be clear and simple and to provide employers with sufficient access to properly qualified registered industry training agents; instead they are clumsy and bureaucratic. </PARA>
<PARA> A complicated grading approach jeopardises access to many significant industry and professional bodies-regardless of their quality or suitability as registered industry training agents. The Democrats support the use of categories in the proposed regulations and guidelines. We support the use of those categories to indicate the types of bodies that are intended to apply. However, we cannot accept the use of what we consider to be arbitrary figures to exclude bodies from eligibility purely on the basis of their size, regardless of the quality of advice that those bodies could offer. The new training scheme is essentially a taxation mechanism. It is designed to kick-start training in mainly small and medium sized firms. It will not live up to its design unless it is simplified. The present complications only encourage small to medium employers to give up in disgust and pay the tax anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement that I understand has been reached between the Government and the Opposition contains only one real concession, and that is the inclusion of higher education and technical and further education (TAFE) institutions as a recognised category of RITA applicant. Ironically, the Government has backflipped on this point. In order to qualify, all other categories-including the tripartite industry training bodies-must be competent and committed to training in a nominated area. But for some reason the universities and TAFE colleges do not need the same industry specific training qualifications and experience. That seems to me to be nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, thinks he can shrug his shoulders at industry and explain that this was a concession to get RITA through, he can forget about pinning that on the Democrats because originally the Democrats suggested this category on the basis of solid representation from training bodies. I will return to the reasons for their inclusion later, but I state our position now: if these institutions wish to apply, provided they qualify as everyone else needs to and demonstrate their commitment and understanding of training, of course they should be successfully registered. We never argued, and it was never intended, that tertiary institutions would be given automatic status. I think it is a major flaw that this is the only real change that has been offered to address the many faults that we have identified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed to clarify category E of the guidelines in a private letter to the Opposition. Category E provides for others to be eligible where no relevant body in a higher category has applied. Even if that other body has not been registered, that then discounts a number of other people from applying. Apparently, this matter of applying really means that others will be considered where coverage by bodies in higher categories is inadequate. If that is what it means, we need to see that interpretation spelt out. The Democrats proposed that here was a case for the Government to amend the guidelines. A new interpretation in a private letter is totally ineffective. At the very least the letter should be tabled as an undertaking on interpretation. It is just not sufficient to have private letters wandering about outside the Parliament as some indication of how things ought to be interpreted, especially on a thing such as this which has the capacity to discount, or refuse registration to, a number of people or bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Another fault in the proposed guidelines is the fact that the provision for fees charged by registered industry training agents must be amended and explained in a note. Regulation No. 4 provides for a flat fee of $200 for the issue of a training advisory certificate. This sounds simple but, in fact, it brings with it a great number of problems. The Government has agreed to amend this regulation next year to allow RITAs to charge when a certificate is refused. I fail to see why it has to be next year. The Democrats have already received legal advice that this is already possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Our advice is that the $200 refers only to the actual issuing of a certificate. RITAs would be free to charge separately for expenses, whether or not a certificate is issued-for example, for program advice, planning, discussions with the employer, travel and accommodation. In fact, the Australian Taxation Office's booklet says that this advice will be available. At page 23 of its booklet the Australian Taxation Office says:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, Registered Industry Training Agents will be working to help employers organise their training effort by giving advice on how they can best do this and by providing other training services. </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment these guidelines make allowance only for a payment of a flat fee of $200 for the issue of a training advisory certificate. We were told that any other charges would require legislative amendment; that it would not be possible; that it was a bit too hard; that it would be done next year. In fact, the Australian Taxation Office seems to think that something else is going on. If this were organised properly, the employer could claim these expenses as incidental expenditure under section 25 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Another complaint that I think should be registered about this fee is that, instead of a mandatory charge of $200, organisations, including professional associations, have indicated to us that as RITAs themselves they would like to issue certificates without charge, or at least at a reduced charge, to members. It seems to be a fairly obvious sort of service that industry associations and professional associations should be able to offer. But the prescribed fee is a flat $200. We have indicated that the prescribed fee should therefore be a maximum amount or, given the separate recovery expenses, reduced to a nominal amount. Contrary to the Government's advice, legislative amendment is not necessary to alter the fees regulation. Apart from the need to provide the $200 as a maximum amount, at the very least it is necessary to clarify what is covered by the issue of a certificate and the capacity to charge for expenses incurred. These regulations repeat the complicated double definition of `certificate' that is given in the legislation. Sections 43 and 44 refer to certificates issued by the training advisory body, which advises whether training is or is not eligible. Certificates issued by industry training agents are only affirmative. This double definition is quite troublesome to employers trying to interpret what is going on here, what they are able to achieve, so they can demonstrate that their training program is in fact eligible under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from this commitment on fees, the Government has promised a review of RITAs after 12 months. Of course, this is no excuse for providing poorly drafted guidelines now, but it seems that was an excuse which was adopted by the Minister: get the thing running. See what happens after 12 months and fix it up later. I cannot see why the concerns of industry were not taken into account now. </PARA>
<PARA> In this appalling document, a complex grading system imposes unrealistic and unworkable limits on eligible bodies. Many significant industry, professional and trade associations will not be recognised within their own categories because of arbitrary limits on size, regardless of their quality and suitability. These significant industry and professional trade associations which cannot qualify under these limits on size include the sole or major associations in the areas of computing, television, carpet manufacturing, bookbinding, glass packaging, sugar milling and goldmining. There are major activities in our economy which are excluded by this attempt to limit which groups can provide advice to participants-employers-within their industries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are professional associations without the specified numbers that are automatically relegated to a final fall-back category-that is, if nobody else has applied further up to provide advice in that area. Such professional associations include the law societies in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, acupuncturists-there are only two associations in Australia-actuaries, consulting surveyors, aerial surveyors and independent schools. These bodies, regardless of their quality, speciality and convenience to employers, are relegated to the fall-back category, and they may miss out altogether on becoming registered industry training agents and being able to provide relevant quality advice. They may not be able to do that if some other group has applied to become a training agent. </PARA>
<PARA> If categories are provided, it is reasonable to expect that industry, trade and professional groups that are normally recognised as such should fit within them. It is ludicrous that employers in smaller and sunrise industries will have to see their own organisation for specialist advice-which will still be available, of course-and then go on to a larger and remote group for certification, to prove that that advice has been worth while. Hopefully they can stay within their State. It is possible and imaginable that this final certification process may not even need to take place outside the State. As a Tasmanian, I thoroughly object to that. It could lead to the delay or possible approval of programs of doubtful relevance and increased costs to all concerned. So much for productivity. We talk about productivity on the one hand and then we come up with this mumbo jumbo on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the category for industry associations, industries with branches in different States or Territories must have sufficient numbers in each State or Territory where a RITA is required. We see immediately that Tasmania would suffer a penalty in that respect. Industry associations without the numbers in each State can be considered in the secondary fallback category only if they represent part of an industry. Whole industries and branches rather than sectors are automatically relegated to a final fall-back category. </PARA>
<PARA> Professional associations without specified numbers do not have a secondary category and fall within the `others' category. I am sure that they are not comfortable with that at all. Professional associations which should be able to provide advice on training to their members-they represent members or qualified persons-should not be defined in terms of employers, but that is how they are defined in these guidelines. Technically one could argue that they may not even be able to become registered industry training associations, even though their main mandate is to provide advice to members. </PARA>
<PARA> The improper use of arbitrary figures is particularly bad in the case of trade associations. The Australian Democrats would, if given the opportunity, remove the arbitrary figures from categories of eligible bodies, and would rely on what is already within the guidelines: that all applicants, except those in the new category, must satisfy fairly stringent criteria concerning their training qualifications and experience in a nominated industry. We think that is fair enough. In fact, a capacity to give quality advice should be the primary criteria for determining whether a person or group should be able to become a registered industry training agent. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, clauses 7.1, 7.2 and 8.1 of these regulations require applicants to maintain a knowledge of the industry, including its training needs and its infrastructure. That aspect is perfectly acceptable to us. In fact, it should be emphasised that it has the capacity to select agents who are most capable of delivering the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The other criteria that are applied through arbitrary numbers and the definition of categories are most unsatisfactory and defeat the purpose of the Act. According to the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Government's reason for imposing size limits was that the National Training Board (NTB) was concerned about having to deal with an unwieldy number of training agents. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister should table such advice from the National Training Board. If it has those concerns, we should have tangible evidence that those concerns are held or we should dismiss that, otherwise we would be subject to regulation by innuendo. </PARA>
<PARA> Under simplified guidelines one final fall back category could contain an additional hoop of whether there is already adequate coverage. This would be sufficient. Another possible clause could require smaller units to operate through larger organisations or vice versa and thus reduce the overall number of RITAs, without arbitrary limits on size. </PARA>
<PARA> If this has all been a bit too difficult to incorporate in revised guidelines in the time since 18 October, then I suggest that perhaps some training in drafting is required and certainly training in consultation for the Government is required. In the period since 18 October, the Australian Democrats have received in- numerable pieces of correspondence congratulating us on our sensibility in tackling these inadequate guidelines. I will quote from one letter I received, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note the importance placed upon and your continued support of efficient and authoritative advice provided by an effective industry training agent scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that such a scheme must not be overly bureaucratic or costly and one which ensures that it facilitates the spending of training dollars effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, we had innumerable pieces of correspondence following the same sort of trend. In the Sunday Age of 18 November the Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Management, Mr Peter Sheldrake, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The intention behind the scheme has been very good, but it hadn't been thought through in all its implications. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some discussion of the scheme, but basically they (the Government) came through with a scheme and got it implemented without enough discussion of ways in which that kind of approach could have been enhanced to better achieve their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>As I suggested, I think the amount of correspondence we received on it and the amount of agreement that we had with our position through the media validates our stand and also indicates to the Government that further and more thorough consultation would have been most beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not bad enough, the schedule to the guidelines, which lists the details to be submitted by RITA applicants, currently contains intrusive and irrelevant questions, and even that requires modification. In particular, Nos 14, 17 and 22 should be deleted. No. 14 requires unnecessary information about an applicant's income; No. 17 is already covered by clause 8.1 in the main body; and No. 22 concerns advertising as a RITA, which is really the business of the agent and has nothing to do with the administrators of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, if they wish to apply and provided they qualify, higher education and technical and further education institutions should really be registered as RITAs-not automatically, but if they qualify. It is interesting to note that, initially, professional bodies were left out and according to some industry groups perhaps should still be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> Public education and training institutions currently do the vast bulk of training that is on offer in Australia anyway and are generally well qualified to assess whether a training program has structure, objectives and designated outcomes for the purposes of this Act. The institutions' involvement in industry training includes all pre-service education for the professions, a significant amount of postgraduate and in-service training and upgrading of industry skills, and they have a knowledge of all in-service work for apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested by some critics of this inclusion that institutions should concentrate their resources on the delivery of training, rather than certifying industry proposals. This shows how little those critics know of the process of training. </PARA>
<PARA> A summary-I do not propose in four minutes to offer an expose of what training is all about-is that usually training needs are assessed, a program is devised to meet those needs, and then that program is conducted. Part of that conduct is that the program's evaluation informs of the degree to which the training needs have been met. </PARA>
<PARA> Institutions do not just deliver training classes; they develop programs and, therefore, are eminently suited to evaluate proposed programs-it is part of what they do; that is their expertise. It would not be a diminution of the resources they have available to present training classes; it would be part of the very fabric of the institution. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that illustrates the lack of knowledge that such critics have of the actual training process, which is not just a process of winding up a class and delivering it; it is a coordinated and involved process which involves the things that I have just indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry groups have stated that they will use these people in institutions to certify their training anyway because that is where they believe the expertise to judge the relevance of a training program resides. In a primary role, such institutions acting as RITAs would ensure access for employers in regional and isolated areas. They also provide an avenue for those who do not have or desire access to an industry association. </PARA>
<PARA> Many industry associations and some industry training advisory bodies also provide training and this role is expected to increase under the training levy scheme. Some industry groups have indicated that training provision and certification will be conducted from separate offices and that TAFE institutions are ideally suited to prevent any risk of conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's explanation for giving tertiary institutions automatic RITA status is to minimise the bureaucracy in line with the Act's objectives and to lessen the workload on the National Training Board. Given the complexity of the complete guidelines we have here, that is a lame excuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has limited the role of RITAs to certification only. This is an administratively simple task, and with proper supervision the number of RITAs is surely not a problem. The total number of RITAs has no bearing on the resources applied or the quality of service provided by each RITA. Costs to recipients of certificates are similarly unaffected. </PARA>
<PARA> In attempting to bring some sense to these guidelines, the achievements so far of the Australian Democrats have included the insertion of a minimum arm's length or conflict of interest provision. We have at least got to the stage where there is a standard form or certificate set by the NTB. Under our preferred guidelines, RITAs would forward a copy of each certificate to the NTB. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, the way the information is being forwarded leaves a lot to be desired. It could be possible that a RITA in Broome could be wrongly issuing certificates across Australia and this could go undetected until a summary is received or until there is a random audit. We believe it is possible--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting listening to the Australian Democrats this morning giving reasons for wanting the guidelines disallowed. Everything Senator Bell has said indicates why they should not have supported the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 in the first place. The reasons he has given this morning, and the problems he has outlined with the guidelines, flow from the Bill. They are the reasons why we opposed the Bill when it was debated in this chamber some five or six months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We pointed out at the time that we were not opposed to the concept of training and education. Far from it, we totally supported it. But the speakers for the Opposition, myself included, pointed out at great length that the Government and the Democrats were bringing into effect an Act which was to come into being and come into operation on 1 July 1990 with no guidelines in existence for us to examine. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats senator speaking this morning has indicated that it is now clear to them-it was clear to us at the time-that there had not been adequate consultation and there had not been adequate discussion and analysis of what the Government was trying to do to put it into effect properly. That has been borne out. The newspaper article that Senator Bell referred to claiming credit for their own position now, in fact, is really saying, `You shouldn't rush in with legislation and put it into effect until you know what you are doing.'. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to say that we are agreeing with the Government. That is not the case. Sometimes there is a position in between. What the Democrats do not seem to have appreciated is that to disallow these guidelines at this stage leaves the Act in operation as from 1 July this year, with the Australian Taxation Office the sole arbiter of what should happen and how it operates. That can only be the worst possible option. The guidelines that we have are defective, as our speakers in other discussions have indicated, many of them as outlined by the Democrats, and I shall briefly refer to some of them. But if we do not have any guidelines, the Tax Office is totally unfettered by any regulations in its administration of this Act. Where does that leave the businesses that are already floundering around trying to operate with something that has been in existence for some months?</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the Government has agreed to a minor amendment that we have asked for. It has not in any way met all the objections that we outlined in May when the Bill was debated. That was why we wanted it defeated at that time, because we could foresee what is happening now. Somehow, that was not to be, because the Democrats were too determined to be with the Government at that time with no regard for the consequences later if the guidelines did turn out to be as bad as, in fact, they are. </PARA>
<PARA> We have identified numerous problems which would arise as a consequence of the legislation-we pointed them out at the time, and I shall briefly refer to them-not to mention, of course, the enormous impost this is placing on businesses at a time when they are suffering mightily. We hear daily of businesses going bankrupt because they are not able to continue in business in the present economic climate. But for those that are trying to struggle on, this has been imposed upon them as well. How does the Government think businesses have got enough money to be spending on this right now, at a time when they are putting people out of work? They are putting people off their jobs. Would it not be better to keep them in employment than to add this additional burden to businesses right now? It really is an additional form of payroll tax, and there are many people who are busily shedding jobs to take themselves below the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> We dealt with-and it has been referred to I think this morning-the onus of proof on an appeal, which rests with the employer, and the difficulties faced by employers meeting the requirements of the Bill. We referred at the time to such jobs as housemaid, and on-the-job training. We referred also to the exemption of the Commonwealth Government from prosecution for non-compliance, and the double standard that it was prepared to put in print and into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no allowance made for the situation of firms that run personnel services whose payrolls are artificially high because of the system whereby they receive the total wages from their clients, and then pay them on to their employees, who are employees only in the sense that they are being introduced to work. For a personnel firm of that kind the actual income is really quite modest, but it appears that it is particularly high. No allowance has been made for that. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only limited exemptions for charitable non-profit organisations. There is the prescriptive nature of the legislation which disregards totally the merits of on-the-job training which, in most instances, is the most beneficial training that one can get. Of course, as has already been mentioned by the Australian Democrats, there are the imprecise definitions. We pointed this out at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only assume this morning that, if the guidelines had been available at the time that the Bill was debated, the Democrats would have voted against it, because they have already said this morning that what they see is wrong with it. What a pity it is that they could not see more clearly what would be the consequence of their rush to vote with the Government and bring this legislation into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> We suggested at the time that it would be better to refer this legislation to a standing committee so it could go through it and analyse all the problems that were raised, and the letters that we have all received dealing with the questions that flow from it. But, no, the Democrats would not even agree to defer it for a few months to allow these problems to be worked out and to allow the consultation that they now call for and complain was not held. We could have had a Bill that operates to the benefit of employees. We could have had a Bill with guidelines which let employers know what they are required to do. We could have had a Bill with guidelines that let the Taxation Office know what was expected of it. It is a great tragedy that we come to this situation.</PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the fact that we have had discussions with the Minister. He has not agreed to what we believe should be included. I will be introducing a private member's Bill to change the regulations and bring into being some regulations which will make this work in a much better way. The Democrats then will have their opportunity to see that the things that they have talked about this morning can be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said that it will introduce additional guidelines as soon as possible to include the eligibility category of higher education and technical and further education institutions. I seek to incorporate in Hansard the draft of the guidelines which the Minister has indicated will be brought into effect so that people at least will know what will come into effect as soon as it has been properly gazetted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has said that it will introduce legislation during the 1991 autumn session to redress the registration fee anomaly which currently prevents the registered industry training agents from charging a service fee when a training program is evaluated but deemed not eligible for certification. It has, as the Democrats have referred to, undertaken to review the guidelines after 12 months of operation. I would hope that they would be looked at much sooner than that because the problems are, I believe, quite critical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need to recognise the continuing deficiencies in the guidelines and the schedule which I, too, believe is sloppily drafted and does not answer the questions. We rang the Tax Office yesterday on a matter which I would have thought was quite simple. The response we got was, `That's a good question'. Here we are, talking about a matter where a Bill came into this place in May and into operation in July, and still in December we are being told that things are `a good question'. How much better it would have been, when we debated the Bill, to have sent it to a committee and got some of these things sorted out at the time. But, no, that was not to be because the Democrats wanted to rush on at that time and would not listen to any form of reason. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned at the fact that under the guidelines employer groups do not fit properly within their own defined categories. I refer particularly to category D which outlines eligibility of the professional and trade groups. It effectively precludes several significant organisations, such as the law societies of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory from applying under that category because of the arbitrary limits imposed. I have a letter from the President of the Law Society of the ACT which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. It is written to the Minister and is dated 12 October 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. Admittedly, the organisations that I have referred to can still become registered industry training agents under category E, but only where no other body has already successfully applied and been registered. To give an example of the sort of problem which is likely to arise, if the ACT Law Society, which has fewer than 200 employers, wishes to be registered as a training agent for its members in Canberra, it will be able to do so only under category E if there is not already a training agent registered under one of the other categories. Of course, registered under the other categories will be the relevant law society body in each of the other States. Where does that leave us? If the Law Council of Australia has already registered as a training agent for all its member States, the ACT Law Society will not be able to register under category E.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the only way that this would be possible would be for the ACT Law Society to request that, if and when a national body registers, it specifically ask that it not be registered in respect of the ACT. There is very good reason why each State law society or council or whatever would want and need to do its own training. The same applies here, but it is not to be. The Australian Labor Party is so hung up in numbers; large unions-these days big is beautiful with the Labor Party. The little groups such as the Law Society of the ACT and the Northern Territory clearly count for nothing. But we could not get an answer on that when we inquired about it. There was correspondence between the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister. I have a letter signed by Mr Dawkins, undated but received by hand on 23 November in Mr Howard's office. He gives a clarification of part of the definition of category E. It reads somewhat differently from what he says is the explanation and the definition. I seek leave to incorporate that letter in Hansard also, so what the Minister said will be on record. </PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Training Guarantee Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>I write to draw your attention to one of the effects of the proposed guidelines for the registration of industry training agents (ITA) under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines being proposed by your Department will, I understand, make provision for professional associations to become registered ITA's if inter alia they provide ``coverage for a significant number of employers''. For a State or Territory, significant coverage will be coverage for a minimum of 200 employers. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the proposed requirement for 200 employers would be to prevent this Society being registered as an ITA, and prevent the 140 employers in the legal profession in the ACT from being able to have their training programmes approved by their own professional body. This professional association or Society is to a large extent responsible for the entry standards to the profession and by statute regulates the professional standards and performance of solicitors in the ACT. It has 100% coverage of the practising profession and is the only professional association in the ACT able to judge whether proposed training programmes for legal employees meet the requirements of the Training Guarantee Scheme. Yet the proposed guidelines would prevent the Society from exercising its logical role and function in training. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to overcome the numbers problem in the smaller States and Territories, this Society suggests that significant coverage could be expressed as a percentage. If a professional association covered, say, 75%, of employers it would have significant coverage. </PARA>
<PARA>The expression of significant coverage as a percentage would avoid the unintentional discrimination against the smaller States &amp;Territories which is inherent in the present proposal. </PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Howard</PARA>
<PARA>Your office has requested clarification of the wording of 6.6 of the Guidelines, Category E: General representative; in particular reasons for the wording, ``in relation to which no person included in Category A, B, C or D has Applied for registration as an agent'' whereas Category C says ``in relation to training that are not adequately met by an agent in Category A or Category B''. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the guidelines, the National Training Board will be unable to refuse registration to any applicant who meets the requirements of clauses 6 and 7. If a particular organisation does not meet the criteria in Category A, B, C or D it must be considered under Category E. It would fail to gain registration only if some applicant offered similar coverage and fell into Category A, B, C or D. If an organisation applied under Category A, B, C or D, but failed to meet the requirements of clause 7 the applicant would not meet the eligibility criteria to be registered, and any applicant in Category E, offering similar coverage and meeting the requirements of clause 7, would be registered. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect this means that if an industry is covered by an organisation applying within Category A, B, C or D no registrations will be considered under Category E. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank the Senate. We hope that the Minister will address the discrepancy by removing the limits. That is the simple way of dealing with smaller organisations. The arbitrary representation limits will be a particular problem, not just in the two Territories that I have referred to but also perhaps in Tasmania, where some organisations that would want to operate as Tasmanian training agents would not have the required number of employers and would then be gobbled up by some other organisation. No doubt you, Mr Acting Deputy President, are very keenly interested in this matter. Hopefully, you will be able to bring some influence to bear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unclear from the guidelines how the national training board will arbitrate in the event of clashes between organisations as I have referred to. That, too, is not clearly dealt with. Where there are two or more bodies which actually meet the criteria laid down, who will decide, and on what basis, which one of them is to be preferred as a training agent above the other applicants, who will then of course be forced to be subservient to it? I hope that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) will provide some answers to these problems when he deals with this matter this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should closely and critically monitor the operation of the agents over the next 12 months; we certainly will. We will be taking a close interest because of the number of people who have raised difficult issues with us. This is the same matter that we dealt with at the time that the Bill was passed. The problems have been foreseen and review will be required. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with very serious misgivings that we vote against the disallowance motion. I reiterate that we are not doing so because we support the Government's position. I think I have made it very clear from what I said this morning that we do not support the Government's position. Deficiencies in the guidelines reflect precisely what we expected they would because of what the Government was not able to tell us in answer to the questions we put during the committee stage of the debate on the Bill when it was before us previously. </PARA>
<PARA> But to allow this Bill, which came into effect on July 1 1990 because the Australian Democrats also wanted it in effect on July 1 1990, to continue with no guidelines, absolutely unfettered, with the Australian Taxation Office doing what it will with the employers, not being able to give answers and the like, is by far the worst proposition. It is perfectly clear that there have to be many changes to the regulations that we have. As I said, we will be doing our best to bring in a Bill to see that this comes about. However, in our view it is better that there be some guidelines, hopelessly deficient as they are, than for there be none at all at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disappointing that the Australian Democrats have moved to disallow the guidelines and related regulations for the registration of industry training agents. As a Government, we believe that the Democrats' action is precipitous. It is also contrary to the views of industry, employers and others with a close interest in the registered industry training agents, known as RITAs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 provides for employers to seek certificates from RITAs, thus allowing employers to establish the eligibility of their training programs and types of expenditure before it is incurred. The certificates are then binding on the Commissioner of Taxation for that year and the following year. The legislation provides for the registration of industry training agents by the national training board. Since under the legislation the agents cannot be registered in the absence of guidelines, and since the guidelines are under threat of disallowance, it has not been appropriate for the national training board to proceed with the necessary administrative steps to ensure that the RITAs are put in place. This has meant that there have been delays, and further delays are unacceptable as businesses will not be able to take advantage of the RITA services in the initial year of the training guarantee, when the services would be most valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the guidelines and the regulations, as they now stand, take account of advice provided by the national training board as required under the Act and that they reflect wide consultation with industry and other concerned groups, including the Democrats. Given the extensive nature of the consultations and the time constraints in getting the RITAs established, the Government does not consider it appropriate to further delay the regulations and guidelines at this late stage. We do, however, give some undertakings, and both Senator Bell and Senator Reid have reflected on those in their contributions this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge the constructive comments that have come from members of parliament. We also acknowledge the cooperation of the Opposition since the guidelines and regulations were tabled in the Parliament on 18 October. As a consequence, we are prepared to give certain undertakings concerning further provisions and review of the current instruments if those instruments are not disallowed here this morning, and it looks as though they will not be. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid mentioned some undertakings that have been given and draft guidelines No. 2, which she tabled. For the sake of completeness, I seek leave to table the letter from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, to the Opposition which accompanied those guidelines setting out the context in which they should be assessed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In referring to a point made by Senator Bell in respect of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I indicate that the Minister has responded to the Committee's correspondence and has undertaken to adopt amendments which go to three points raised by that Committee. The first point is the removal of the requirement for a registered industry training agent to answer questions to ensure consistency with section 98 of the Act. The second point which will be picked up by amendment will go to the provision of procedures including appointment of authorised officers and proof of identity concerning access to premises and records of a registered industry training agent in a manner consistent with section 98 of the Act. The third point to be picked up is the need for express powers for the training advisory body to cancel registration where a registered industry training agent is of unsound mind or is undergoing imprisonment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations,</PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Howard</PARA>
<PARA>Following our discussion concerning Industry Training Agents Guidelines, I have thought further about the question of the registration of higher education and technical and further education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I have attached to this letter proposed additional guidelines providing for their registration. I am prepared to gazette and subsequently table in the Parliament these additional guidelines on the basis that the Industry Training Agents Guidelines No 1 as notified in the Commonwealth Gazette on 17 October 1990 are not disallowed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>You will appreciate that gazettal of the additional guidelines can only take place following formal consultations with the National Training Board which the Training Guarantee Act obliges me to undertake. In addition, the registration of individual TAFE institutions will be subject to the approval of the relevant State Minister, given that the administration of TAFE rests with the various State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA>I confirm that I will introduce an amendment to the legislation in the Autumn sittings of Parliament, to provide for the charging of a fee by a Registered Industry Training Agent where a certificate is refused. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>John Dawkins</PARA>
<PARA>22 November</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I go to the point of registration of universities and technical and further education (TAFE) institutions. As the Minister has confirmed with the Opposition, the Government is prepared to include public higher education and technical and further education institutions among the categories eligible for registration. Both the Minister and industry have a view that the responsibility for initiation and certification of training rests properly with industry. Therefore, it is doubtful that employers will seek certification from TAFEs and universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of concern, the Government is prepared to table new guidelines as soon as practicable to allow these institutions to be registered. In doing that, we are mindful of the fact that some State Ministers hold differing views about the appropriateness of registration of TAFE institutions as RITAs. For this reason the new guidelines will stipulate that the State or Territory Minister must agree in writing to an application for registration by a TAFE institution. The additional guidelines will be subject to formal consultations with the national training board, which the Minister is required to do under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of RITA fees, the regulations currently provide for a fee only where a certificate is given by a RITA signifying that an employer's training program meets the eligibility requirements of the Act. The Government agrees that this may give rise to some problems as it will not permit RITAs to charge a service fee for considering an application where a certificate is refused. We are also further advised that the legislation does not permit the charging of a fee for this purpose and it will be necessary to amend the Act. Such amendment will be made in the autumn sittings. As has been mentioned, we are also giving an undertaking to review the guidelines after 12 months of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other criticisms have been raised about the guidelines. Senator Bell was concerned that categories in section 6 at pages 4 and 5 will unduly exclude persons who are appropriate to register as industry training agents. We have canvassed this point this morning but I have advice that no-one is prevented from seeking registration as an industry training agent. A person applying will be registered if that person is in one of the categories in section 6 and goes on to meet the criteria in section 7. Thus, the national training board cannot prevent any person from applying and must register a person who meets the requirements of sections 6 and 7. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while restating that particular organisations which do not meet the criteria in categories A, B, C or D must be considered under category E. This is spelled out in the correspondence to the Opposition. An organisation would fail to gain registration only if an applicant offered similar coverage and fell into categories A, B, C or D. If an organisation applied under categories A, B, C or D but failed to meet the requirements of section 7, the applicant would not meet the eligibility criteria to be registered. Any applicant in category E, offering similar coverage and meeting the requirements of section 7, would be registered. I am sure honourable senators can understand that. In effect, this means that if an industry is covered by an organisation applying within categories A, B, C or D, no registrations will be considered under category E. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bell has also objected to the guidelines setting out the information required from an applicant before registration as an agent. I ask the Senate to note that the schedule took account of advice from the national training board as well as the Government's view that the information provided by applicants should be adequate for the board to carry out its registration and monitoring functions. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the regulations on which there has been some comment. The Government recognises that an amendment to the Act would be required to permit persons to be charged for registering as industry training agents. The Government intends to produce such an amendment in the autumn session. I also ask the Senate to note that the fee of $200 per certificate reflects consultations with the national training board and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, I think that the Government has agreed to suitable changes to the instruments to be introduced as soon as practicable. We have also given undertakings as to the guidelines, regulations and amendments to the Act. In the light of this, and given the very strong concerns to have the training agents in place as soon as possible, I trust that the Senate will reject this disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I was listening with considerable interest, hoping to find some indication that there would be a recognition of what we are on about here, but it was not forthcoming. If this motion of disallowance were successful today, it is not true that we would then have the Act and its operation with the Australian Taxation Office being the sole arbiter. This certainly could happen but the Government would still have the opportunity to introduce additional guidelines. It has taken five months to get this far. As Senator Reid has quite rightly pointed out, there has not been a great deal of urgency attached to what has been offered today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take exception to the inference in the speech by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) that there is some degree of blame to be attached to the Australian Democrats for the delay so far. The documents were tabled on 18 October and the requisite number of sitting days has passed. The discussion is happening today-no sooner, and no later as a result of anything that the Democrats have done. We introduced a notice of motion on the eighteenth to give the Government the opportunity to further discuss and to further amend. Of course, the Government has done that. We have evidence that there has been some modification to the Government's original proposal. If it can modify one or two things, it can modify half a dozen others. </PARA>
<PARA> We are hoping to disallow these guidelines-not guidelines per se; these particular ones-which the Opposition has agreed are manifestly inadequate, totally confusing and not helping the argument at all. They do not help employers to determine their obligation under the Act, how they satisfy that obligation and how they present to their employees a proper training program. As Senator Reid has quite rightly said, the Australian Taxation Office is not too sure about it anyway. We would hope that the Government could accept the mandate, the responsibility, to present guidelines which simplify the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, we have this mumbo jumbo and-I am disappointed with the Opposition for the position it has taken on this matter-we are told that it is better to have a useless tool than to have nothing. We would have nothing at all if, in his petulance, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, lived up to the indication he gave to us initially that if we made a fuss, we should forget it; the Government would not bother with RITAs at all. If that petulance is an indication of the Government's true attitude and lack of commitment to training, I feel very sorry for the future of this country. On the other hand, if the Government is truly interested in devising a set of guidelines which will assist employers, it still has the opportunity to bring in guidelines that work. I reject the assertion that it would leave the Tax Office as the sole arbiter. It is in the Government's hands to address the problems which have been identified by both Senator Reid and me this morning. It is certainly not a responsibility which I will accept. I will not accept the responsibility for the Government's inability to come up with a set of guidelines to achieve the Government's aim. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that the Government has demonstrated that it is willing to modify these guidelines to some extent to ensure that they get the tacit support of the Opposition so that they can stumble through this chamber. The Government has been able to modify as much as it thinks is necessary-in other words, as much as it thinks it will get away with-without addressing the real concerns of industry that have been expressed to us over this matter. It has done no more than is necessary to allow these guidelines to stumble through this chamber and, by default, arrive on the doorstep of the employers who need succinct, clear and useful guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> We will see a lot of disappointed employers who, I have already warned, will probably take a lead from the Minister and say, `We cannot be bothered. We will not try very hard-we will pay the tax anyway'. Those employers, who may have been interested in training, quite rightly will be exasperated and totally unsatisfied with the Government's attitude when they are confronted with this mumbo jumbo. </PARA>
<PARA> We were just informed by the Minister that the Government reacted very rapidly to the views of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The Government obviously was concerned about the power of that committee to embarrass it. The fact that little regard is being paid to our concerns shows that this Government is really only interested in what it can get away with. It did not think it could get away with ignoring the concerns brought to its attention by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee but it did think it could afford to ignore our concerns if it just cooked up a cosy deal with the Opposition. I am really disappointed that the Opposition has not shown a lot of backbone here. The fact is that we could insist that these regulations are inadequate and the Government could accept the responsibility for introducing amended additional guidelines which would make them work. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some sort of explanation offered to Senator Reid's concern about the sorts of problems that are associated with a small professional association, such as the Australian Capital Territory Law Association. I did not understand the Minister's explanation and I am sure it did not address the concern expressed by Senator Reid. That concern is shared by some several hundred groups; it is shared by nearly all the employer groups in Tasmania which would not qualify under the arbitrary numbers that have been trotted out by the preparers of this scheme so as somehow to limit the numbers of registered industry training agents who would be applying. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania, of course, there are very few employers or employer groups which would qualify under the numbers scheme. The number of groups in Tasmania which would qualify under category E-and this has been pointed out by Senator Reid in respect of the Australian Capital Territory-would be drastically reduced because of the numbers which have already applied for nationwide coverage. Any body in Australia which applied for and was successfully granted coverage to represent a profession would usurp the right of a Tasmanian body, which might also have applied, to represent its employers. That problem could easily be dismissed by the removal of the numbers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The real criterion is the ability of the registered industry training agent to deliver quality advice within the industry area in which that agent proposes to operate, and that is covered by stages 7.1, 7.2 and 8.1. If we concentrate on that area and remove this numbers criterion, we would have regulations which might be capable of working. But that seems to escape the Minister. There seems to be no understanding at all of how these things would operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that I am most disappointed that the Opposition could not show some strength and join the Democrats. Our motion is to disallow the proposed guidelines and regulations. Without further ado, I think we should see what happens when the question is put. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Committee that the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats is probably the one that has attracted the most public reaction. The clause that we intend to amend would place the obligation on unions to move towards a membership figure of 20,000. I commented previously that the Democrats saw that as creating a bad psyche out there in the electorate and that we believed that a lower target figure would evoke a more positive response in the community at large, and even within the union movement itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I could draw an analogy, this is a little like selecting a gear on a bicycle. The series of options is open and it is a question of which gear will have the greatest effect. The Government is simply proposing a gear of 20,000. We believe that that has some negative aspects to it and that it would be more effective to aim lower, but perhaps in a quicker timeframe. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to comments made by Senator Crane last night, with respect, I believe that he misunderstood what we are intending. Frankly, I do not believe that the figure is of any great consequence other than to induce a response. Senator Crane elaborated on the membership of a range of unions. He said that some unions have memberships in the order of so many thousand and so on. I do not believe that that is of any consequence. In the final analysis, I do not think that we can predict the outcome of this. As I said earlier, I believe that there will be a number of unions with a few hundred members and a number of unions with a few hundred thousand members. The configuration at the moment is of no consequence at all. It ignores the fact that many unions are in the process of moving towards amalgamation anyway by themselves, without this induction process. To cite a range of unions being at the moment of particular membership configurations contributes nothing and suggests to me some misunderstanding of the process. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters talked about big unions, bashed the unions, and generally went off in an emotional tirade about the union movement at large. In my time here I have been greatly impressed by Senator Walters in many respects. I admire her tenacity, she is courageous, she is incredibly persistent and she believes in certain things and pursues them. That makes for a very formidable adversary. But on occasions she is also illogical and on occasions she in fact distorts and selects-and that perhaps makes her even more of an adversary because, when one gets the combination of the admirable qualities with illogicality and distortion, it makes for a pretty formidable challenge but does not contribute very positively to the debate about improved legislation. She did not make a positive contribution. She just went off on an emotional tirade. We saw once again the closed-mindedness and the bias that are so frequently apparent in her contributions. I admire Senator Walters's tenacity and courage and those other positive attributes, but I had no respect for her contribution to the debate last night. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that Senator Crane has missed the point. We are simply suggesting that this amendment will achieve greater effect rather than less effect than the figure proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall return to the question that Senator Cook posed at the close of the debate last night, and we were seeking clarification as to whether or not the Opposition will support this amendment. In comments made by Senator Crane, he suggested that the Opposition would not support it. The effect of that will leave the Government with 20,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to state the Opposition's position in relation to clause 12. Clause 12 is really the most critical clause of this Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. It creates this new process of amalgamation, the object of which we debated at great length in the second reading debate. It will increase the minimum numbers for union membership from the present figure of 1,000 to a figure of 20,000. That is an enormous increase in the minimum size of union membership from the 1,000 presently provided in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to a figure of 20,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, to our great surprise-and I will deal shortly with why we are surprised-have moved that the figure, instead of being 20,000, should be 10,000. Senator McLean has now made it clear that, if that amendment does not succeed, he would then support the 20,000 figure. So the Opposition was even more surprised at the view of the Democrats that they would be supporting the Government's figure of 20,000, and I shall deal with that shortly. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McLean" NAMEID="3I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are figures of consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator McLean does not think it has got any consequences, but we differ greatly from him. I would think that the Government also differs greatly from him because it sees the significance of a figure of 20,000, and so do we. It is only the Democrats who fail to understand what this is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's position is that we are opposed to any change in the present provision of 1,000 in the legislation. We dealt in the second reading debate with the reasons why we are opposed to this, and I am not going to repeat all their arguments in the committee stage because I think they were fully thrashed out in the second reading debate, and also because so far in this committee debate many of them have been repeated. So we are essentially opposed to this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because we do see the considerable significance in these numbers and if we are going to fail in relation to our principal position, then we would prefer 10,000 to 20,000. We are seeking to achieve that as a second best position, although we are opposed to it. The Government has said it will support that amendment of 10,000, and therefore the Opposition will support it only in the sense that it is better than 20,000. However, we will maintain our opposition to the figure of 10,000 by voting against the amended clause. That is the Opposition's position. It is a perfectly logical position, and I hope Senator McLean can understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> What we find difficult to understand about the Democrats position is that the 1,000 minimum figure was inserted in the original Act by the motion of Senator McLean on behalf of the Democrats when the Industrial Relations Bill 1988 was before this Senate only two years ago. On 29 September 1988, in the committee stage of that Bill-we have already referred to this before-Senator McLean moved to leave out the figure of 3,000, which was the Government's proposal in that Bill, and to insert the figure of 1,000. The Opposition supported this amendment and it was successful. So that is how the figure of 1,000 for union minimum membership appears in the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure of 1,000 was the recommendation of the Hancock Committee of Review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems. The Democrats were very upset-and so were we for that matter-that the Government had tinkered around with the Hancock recommendations by making it 3,000. So, we supported Senator McLean's amendment to reduce it to 1,000. In the debate Senator McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we offer no objection to the process of amalgamation. However, we think it is important that we proceed slowly and responsibly and in a way which accommodates the needs of presently small unions. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say in support of the figure of 1,000:</PARA>
<PARA>This figure would provide the opportunity to meet the needs of smaller unions, who could amalgamate rather than rely upon special circumstances, exemptions in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Small unions have experimented with amalgamation unsuccessfully, some of them finding that very large unions cannot represent the interests of a small specialised group as well as they would like. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We therefore feel that the figure of 3,000 is likely to lead to ideological family of unionists whereas a requirement for a minimum of 1,000 members is more likely to be specifically based and therefore to produce the type of union structure that is able to operate more functionally in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the views of the Democrats and Senator McLean were only two years ago. I wonder what has changed. Senator McLean is making very clear in this amendment, and what I just read out about what he said in support of his amendment in 1988, that in fact the minimum numbers of the union are vitally important in this whole question of amalgamation. The whole case two years ago, as I have just read out, was that these are vital questions, and there was a very vital difference, in the Democrats view, between 3,000 and 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Here today he is arguing, as he did yesterday, that numbers do not mean anything. The numbers meant a lot to the Democrats two years ago. They meant a lot to Senator McLean, who was then and still is their spokesman. Senator McLean has persuaded the Opposition, as he did two years ago, and we are still of the view that the numbers are very important indeed. Anyway, we do not need to have Senator McLean's authority, whatever it amounts to, in view of the total inconsistencies of the Democrats and their attitude to this vital legislation, and we would not want to rely too heavily on their arguments. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the numbers mean a great deal because it is this figure-and the failure of unions to meet the figure of 20,000, or 10,000 or indeed 1,000 at the moment-which triggers the process of amalgamation through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is the unions that do not meet the minimum membership figure by their own efforts at amalgamation, or disinclination for amalgamation, or whatever. If the unions do not meet those targets in the legislation, the unions themselves have the weight put on them well and truly, and they have to show special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We will come to a debate later about what `special circumstances' could mean. I understand the Democrats have caved in completely to the Government on that one, because it had a proposed amendment which it put to the Opposition. I do not mind talking about these things because Senator McLean was only too ready to expose discussions that he had with the Opposition, and he misrepresented in many ways what those discussions were. I can tell the Committee that Senator McLean had considerable amendments proposed on this question of what would be special circumstances. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking about the way in which Senator McLean has behaved in this whole matter. He has now dropped all these amendments; they will not get his support any more even though the Democrats proposed them to the Opposition and we said we would support them because we are very concerned about the pressure that was to put on unions to conform with the Government's policy toward amalgamations on a large scale and the reduction in the number of unions to 20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is ridiculous to say that these figures mean nothing. They are vital to the operation of the Government's policy. The fact that the Government has a figure of 20,000 here is very significant. We are opposed to that figure; we are opposed to a figure of 10,000, a figure of 5,000 or a figure of 3,000. We believe that the figure should remain as it is, and even then it may be a bit high. When the Opposition comes to propose its own policy in this area in the form of legislation we may have a lower figure, but that is a debate for another day. At the moment we believe that the figure of 1,000 should remain as it is. There is a process in the present Bill for amalgamation based on that figure and the Opposition believes that that is good enough, as indeed the Democrats clearly believed two years ago. The Democrats felt then, as Senator McLean said, that the whole process should proceed slowly and responsibly. That is the view that we adopt in relation to this clause, and I have explained the position we will take in relation to the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before continuing from where I was in my remarks last night, I wish to pick up a couple of points which have come through in the debate this morning. I will not go over the ground that Senator Durack has covered, but I find it quite incredible that Senator McLean comes into this place today and tries to be reasonable and rational after the tirade he delivered last night. He accused Senator Walters of being a nice person but irrational, but I will leave it to Senator Walters to deal with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I particularly want to deal with his comments that I had misunderstood the situation. If I have a misunderstanding about the situation, I pose the question: what does Senator McLean have when he has an amendment before this chamber to alter the figure to 10,000 and yet continually says that the number is of no consequence? I find that totally irrational. Of course the number is of some consequence. The fact that a number is there and that it is a large number means that enormous pressure will be placed on the smaller unions to amalgamate. That pressure will continue regardless of whether amalgamation is for the benefit of members of a particular union. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I will deal with the things I was going to deal with last night. Senator Sherry in an interjection threw down a challenge to us to provide examples of where thuggery had occurred. I have decided to take up that challenge because I think it is very important in this debate. I will give three examples. The first is dealt with in an article in the West Australian of 30 November 1990. The article was written by Shaun Menegola. Although I will quote only the paragraphs from that article which are applicable to this debate, the article is here for any honourable senator who wishes to read it. It is headed `Unionist admits assault in toilet' and reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Transport Workers' Union official James McGiveron has admitted assaulting former Perth radio personality Barry Martin in the toilet of a North Bridge restaurant last July. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Singleton, who was representing Mr McGiveron, was reported in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the incident stemmed from Martin's involvement in a union election campaign for a man standing against long-time TWU secretary John O'Connor. Accounts from the campaign had wrongly been sent to the TWU and to the WA Trotting Club. </PARA>
<PARA>My second example concerns the situation in Western Australia in relation to the amalgamation of the Professional Divers Association of Australia and the Seamens Union of Australia. It concerns one Gary Ihnen, who is the Federal Secretary of the Professional Divers Association. He has been making phone calls to union members threatening to blow off their kneecaps if they do not concede to the demands made of them. My third example concerns a situation in which I was involved, the dispute in 1982 regarding the use of wide combs. It concerns Bob White and his family, who are shearing contractors in the town of Blayney in New South Wales. In order to protect Bob White and his family, the police in Blayney had to put them into the gaol because of the threats to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, there were a number of other incidents. However, when we have these challenges, it is important to recognise such occurrences. They have gone on in the past, they are going on now and they will continue to go on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to a couple of other points. Firstly, I will deal with the Minister's suggestion about the formation of a food union in the future. If that food union were to involve the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) and its current activities-which I will deal with in a moment-I suggest that we would all starve. However, the Minister might starve before I do. In his comments last night the Minister said that I had an obsession about the meat industry. I make no secret of being obsessed about that industry in its current situation. I respect a number of unions and some of their activities and responsibilities, but I hope that nobody in this place respects the AMIEU or its current behaviour. I will quickly run through a couple of the figures. Nearly $100m worth of export earnings has been lost since the dispute started and the number of meat export works in Victoria has reduced from about 19 five years ago to the present 12. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this it is the workers, the producers, our customers and our current account which are affected. If I have an obsession about this industry across the board, I will continue to have that obsession. In the current situation in our meat export industry, with the efforts being made, for example, through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks to get some sanity into world trade, I find it absolutely incredible that we are handing markets to those competitors that we are trying to get to reduce their protection. It is an absolutely ludicrous situation. </PARA>

My obsession about a union-or anybody else-who breaks the law to meet its own ends will continue. I do not care whether it is the AMIEU or anybody else. That has been well and truly documented and is on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the comment in the debate last night by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) that discussions had been held with the union movement and employer organisations about this matter. I would like to bring to the attention of the Committee another press article, this time in the Australian Financial Review of 26 November 1990, headed `Government reported to ILO'. That action was taken by the Confederation of Australian Industry, which has long been recognised by the current Government as being the peak employer organisation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation has made it quite clear that it does not accept or like this particular legislation and does not believe that it will deliver the types of benefits which it is claimed it will. Also, I must report that from my own discussions with employer organisations-I do not claim to have talked to every one of them-not one has lobbied me to support the numbers that we are now talking about in this legislation, nor the preference clauses which it introduces. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude my comments in this debate at this point by saying that I find it quite irrational-in fact, I find it unbelievable-that we have a situation where Senator McLean, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, proposes to move from the figure of 1,000 to 10,000 and at the same time argues in the debate that it has no consequence. I find that absolutely incredible. Of course it has a consequence. It will mean that, as I outlined in a particular case in Western Australia, enormous pressure will be put on unions in an area where they are behaving quite rationally and responsibly now and are in fact doing a good job. It will mean that the power of the union movement and the Australian Council of Trade Unions will be put in fewer hands. In the longer term that will lead to more industrial disruption in this country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I will deal with Senator McLean in a minute. This legislation in general, but most importantly this clause which seeks to establish the Government's policy of mega-unions, has its origins in the document entitled Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement published in May 1987 and another document entitled Australia Reconstructed which was also published in that year. It is simply a recipe for further increasing and entrenching the power of trade unions within our industrial relations system. These changes are not about improving productivity or improving the conduct of industrial relations; they are simply designed to create, in line with the desires of this Government's Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) masters, mega-unions with a minimum membership of 20,000. This represents an increase of some 2,000 per cent on the current minimum allowable size for trade unions-a massive increase which will not be more conducive to the development and maintenance of effective industrial relations processes in any industry. The Government's rationale for larger and fewer unions is fatally flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, this clause will not, by seeking to enforce a minimum size of 20,000 members, ensure the rational development of a more appropriate trade union structure which is what is required as we move into the twenty-first century. Currently, there are about 300 or so registered trade unions and the Government, and particularly its ACTU masters, want to see this number reduced to 20 mega-unions-a cut of some 93 per cent. Presently, only 45 unions have a membership in excess of 20,000. Of course, that again highlights the importance of Senator Harradine's question as to how many existing unions will be affected by the passage of this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen after 28 February is that, in accordance with this legislation, unions registering after that date will be required to have a membership of 20,000. Currently, registered smaller unions will be allowed a further two years, after which if they fail to reach this magical figure of 20,000 they will have to show cause why they should be allowed to stay registered. Why should the onus of proof be on an existing organisation-a small union-to justify its continued existence and survival?</PARA>
<PARA> That is the point which we raise against Senator McLean's claim last night that numbers are of little consequence. Senator McLean says that these numbers which are being laid down in this legislation are merely targets to be achieved and are of little real consequence. The reality is that this legislation lays down these figures not as targets, but as minimum numbers that must be achieved. If they are not achieved the onus of proof is on the existing small union to show cause why it should continue to exist. It is a most difficult process for that small union to go through to justify its continued existence beyond two years hence and, of course, a quite unjustifiable imposition to put on such a small union. So the Democrats should clearly recognise that this figure is not a target; it is a mandatory requirement which it will be very difficult to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to recognise that, contrary to what this clause will provide, size is absolutely no guarantee to establishing the internal efficiency of any union. I believe it would be nothing more than committing national suicide to encourage and create an umbrella and cumbersome conglomerate of unions which could fall into the hands and control of a small group and be subject to the sort of union thuggery which Senator Crane gave evidence of a few moments ago. He gave several examples, from the many that have been evident over a number of years, of the application of union thuggery by a small controlling group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties wholeheartedly support the restructuring of unions, but we want to see that done on the basis of enterprise unions and enterprise agreements. That is the fundamental basis of the coalition's approach to industrial relations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that the Minister have a close look at our industrial relations policy. He might learn something from it and be ready to apply some of its principles. The other difficulty the Opposition has with this clause is that to establish any minimum size for a trade union, including the one imposed in the existing legislation, let alone the proposal under this amending Bill for a minimum size of 20,000, clearly violates the fundamental principle of freedom of association and is a direct contravention of convention No. 87 of the International Labour Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we see that in putting up this legislation-especially clause 12-the Government is simply tightening the anti-competitive, monopolistic stranglehold of the trade unions in our community. The Government is endorsing the concept that big is beautiful and it seems to have forgotten that big is also most unwieldy and unresponsive to individual needs and requirements and, by definition, concentrates power in the hands of a very few. </PARA>
<PARA> Mega-unions that do not have to compete for membership will have no necessity to bend over backwards to look after and effectively service their members. Amalgamations of unions into 20 or so mega-unions will not lessen demarcation disputes. The only way to do this is through an enterprise based structure, as I mentioned a few moments ago. The minimum size requirements initiated by this legislation will actively prevent enterprise based unions from coming into existence. So there are a number of serious defects and serious consequences for Australia if this clause, which the Government has put up, is passed. As I said, it would prevent forever the emergence of enterprise based unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia study called Enterprise-based Bargaining Units-A Better Way of Working argues very strongly that there should be fewer unions within enterprises or industry, and we strongly support that view. It also provides significant evidence, particularly on the basis of a survey which it has conducted, that amalgamations of small unions, as this clause will require, will not in any significant way reduce the number of major unions among its member enterprises. In other words, the amalgamation of unions which will be forced by this legislation will not reduce in any significant way the number of unions in any particular workplace with which an employer has to deal and, therefore, will not necessarily lead to fewer demarcation disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Chamber of Manufactures has shown that minimum sizes seem more likely to reduce the number of federally registered industry focused unions than they are to reduce the number of federally registered craft unions. In other words, this clause will compound the difficulties that we already have because of the craft structure of our unions, rather than having an industry or, as we would prefer to see, an enterprise based structure for our unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the amalgamations that will be required to meet the 20,000 minimum will not solve the problem of multiple coverage in workplaces. Again I refer to the Business Council survey, which showed that the 12 top unions which have membership in Business Council members' workplaces would only be reduced to nine under the amalgamation proposals required through the passage of this clause. For example, the recent rubber workers and storemen and packers amalgamation would reduce the number of unions in only 4 per cent of plants. A more significant amalgamation, such as that proposed by the Australian Workers Union and the Federated Ironworkers Union, would reduce the number of unions in just 16 per cent of the plants. So much more is needed than the approach which has been initiated in this legislation by the Government, at the command and with the support of the ACTU, if we are going to achieve amalgamations that are linked to productivity instead of amalgamations linked to the development of union power as an end in itself. This is why the Opposition opposes clause 12, in particular, of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also opposed to the amendment that has been put up by Senator McLean, which seeks to substitute a figure of 10,000 for that of 20,000 proposed by the Government. As I said a few moments ago, Senator McLean, in his remarks yesterday, was of the view that numbers did not really matter at all. I have already explained to the Committee why the numbers that we put in this legislation do matter. More importantly than that perhaps, Senator McLean really did not justify, either in the arguments in his speech yesterday in moving his amendment, or in the earlier second reading debate, the reasons why the Democrats were putting up this amendment and why this amendment was so much better than the Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA> One can only conclude from Senator McLean's remarks on both occasions that either he has severe amnesia or he has been pushed by the new members of the Democrats who came in at the last election and who are causing his Party to lurch even further to the Left to support the Government's approach to industrial relations, whereas only two years ago they would not have a bar of it in relation to minimum union size. Senator McLean put the view that amalgamations of unions should be encouraged and accelerated and, through his amendment, believed that this should be achieved through a preferred minimum size of 10,000 members compared with the Government's proposed 20,000. Again, he does not really seem too fussed about size, because he does not see the significance of the legislation in imposing this minimum size. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that Senator McLean, as the industrial relations spokesman for the Australian Democrats, two years ago moved an amendment to the Industrial Relations Bill, an amendment which reduced the minimum union membership requirement from the Government's then proposed 3,000 to just 1,000, and an amendment which this Opposition supported. Although, as I have said, we believe there should not be any minimum size requirements on unions, we supported that as the lesser of two evils compared with the Government's 3,000 at that time. I remind the Committee that in moving that amendment Senator McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian Democrats saw these amendments as constructive and responsible in that we have been approached by a considerable number of small unions who argue that they are unable to find, and will remain unable to find even within the three-year period allowed for adjustment, compatible unions with which to amalgamate successfully. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We draw attention to the fact that our revised suggested figure of 1,000 as the minimum required limit for employer and employee organisations is simply in line with the recommendations of the Hancock Committee of review . . . we are not convinced that in the interim 15 months there has arisen a need for the Government or the ACTU to argue the non-acceptability of 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that was the original proposal earlier of the Government itself in its 1987 Industrial Relations Bill. The Democrats, who only two years ago saw 1,000 as an acceptable minimum size, now believe 10 times that is an acceptable minimum size-quite illogically. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Chapman spoke, I was asked a direct question by Senator Brian Harradine. There were three parts to the question. The question, as I apprehended it, was: how many unions are there with under 10,000 members? How many unions are there with between 10,000 and 20,000? What are the names of those unions? I have since supplied Senator Harradine with a list categorising registered unions in the Federal industrial relations system by size. There is, on the list I supplied, an anticipation of the amalgamation of four unions into two separate unions. The first concerns the Australian Timber Workers Union and the Pulp and Paper Workers Federation, and that is anticipated in the list that I have supplied. The second is the amalgamation of the Hospital Employees Federation and the Health and Research Employees Association into a new union. That is also anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With those qualifications, to answer the first question: there are 92 unions with members under 10,000 and there are 13 unions with members between 10,000 and 20,000, making 105 unions directly affected. Since there are 105 unions, to read the name of each union would be a long process. I seek leave to incorporate a document in Hansard setting out the unions in order that the record shows the full answer to the question posed by Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is that the Australian Democrats have always attempted to strengthen the exemption provisions. We were lobbied very heavily three years ago in relation to exemption provisions and we accommodated the needs of that lobby at the time. In our opinion, there is clearly less concern out there now. We have been lobbied far less intensively, but we still have addressed ourselves in the next amendment in an attempt to strengthen the exemption provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has chosen to ignore the fact that we have always identified with it in that process-the protection of the individual. In addressing the next amendment, I will reinforce our position in that respect. Frankly, we are not prepared to adopt the bias and the closed mindedness of the Opposition. We have to be open-minded and we have to have an open door. We have done both, and had both those things. The outcome of it is a series of amendments, and this is one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern amongst small unions that they may be forced into what has probably been appropriately described as `shotgun weddings', and we share that concern, but it is resolved best by strengthening and clarifying the exemption process. It is resolved best through the ballot box by the members saying that they favour, or do not favour, a particular amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this legislation in large detracts from that process of democracy; in fact, it strengthens it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns should just listen. Joe Thompson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst on the surface a proposal to reduce the number of unions seems sensible and appropriate, a closer look reveals the potential for unions organized largely on political lines and no likely reduction in demarcation and membership disputes. The net result could well be to give the ACTU greater power to pursue whatever political objectives its Executive decided upon-and an increased potential for large-scale disputes based on such objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A recent ballot for amalgamation of the membership of the Building Workers' Industrial Union (BWIU) and the Federated Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Association (FEDFA) narrowly overturned the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>The name planned for the union was `The Construction, Mining and Energy Workers' Union.' Foundation of such a union would have opened the way for a national union crossing the whole broad spectrum of industry, including not only building and construction, but mining and extraction, power generation, and coal loaders as well as the operation of all types of cranes, including overhead cranes and all forms of mobile equipment. It was intended that, following the amalgamation of the BWIU and the FEDFA, there would then be an amalgamation with the Miners' Federation and the Timber Workers' Union. In short, one union would have had the potential to institute stoppages extending far beyond the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This would have meant that the whole nation could have been halted by an executive decision to close down our power stations; or our coal exports could have been halted by closing off all our coal-loaders. These are only some of the things which could have occurred with an amalgamation of this type. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the Bill. The Bill says that we are going to move to a minimum membership of 20,000 for registration. The Australian Democrats have moved for 10,000, and they call this democracy at work. We have, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has just said, 92 unions with under 1,000 members. The Democrats are forcing those unions, despite what Senator McLean says, to amalgamate unless they can satisfy special circumstances. The clause says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If, on exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), a Presidential Member is not satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify the continued registration of a small organisation . . . in the public interest, the Presidential Member must cancel the registration of that organisation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats have not read the Bill, because they say, `This is democracy at work. We are not forcing those small unions to amalgamate; we are saying that they have to put up a very good case, and if a presidential member says it is not good enough they will be deregistered'. That is the Democrats' and the Australian Labor Party's type of democracy; it just does not happen to be our description of democracy. We say that true democracy in Australia is complete freedom to associate or not to associate. That is our description of democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our description of democracy is that there should be no numbers. If a group of employees wants to form a union and negotiate with their employer, as occurred at Mudginberri, then the Government should not say to its inspectors, `Don't cross the picket line that the union has set up. Don't send that man broke'. But the Government did just that. The Government sent Mr Pandarvis broke because its inspectors would not cross the picket line, and the union deliberately took action against its own members. </PARA>
<PARA> The union deliberately undermined the agreement that the employees made with their boss-an agreement that benefited the employees, an agreement that benefited the boss, an agreement that would have benefited Australia because the company had exports worth millions of dollars. The whole thing was thrown in the rubbish tin and Mudginberri went broke. The employees were thrown out of their jobs because the Government supported the union in this dreadful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the Democrats saying, `That must not exist in this country. That cannot exist. We will not tolerate small unions making agreements with employers'. If they want to be a small union, this Bill says they have to have special circumstances to do it and, if the presidential member does not think those special circumstances that they have put up are good enough, the union will be deregistered. That is wonderful democracy, but not our democracy. That is the democracy of the Australian Democrats and the democracy of the Labor Party, and I can assure them that we will have none of it. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments focus on the area of concern which we touched on in our debate on the last amendment, namely, the exemption provisions. The Opposition is full of the argument that unions will be railroaded into a process of amalgamation, that there will be no escaping this and the terror of it all, when a great deal of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill is directed at the question of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of the Australian Democrats' concern in the debate that was referred to by the Opposition, namely, the debate leading up to the principal Act, and a great deal of the dialogue and discussion which we had with both the Opposition but particularly the Government prior to this Bill coming into the chamber, focused on the process of exemption-gaining exemption and strengthening the exemption provisions. We acknowledge that in this process of amalgamation there needs to be acknowledgment of and provision for exemption. The amendment is directed towards the process of ensuring that those applying for exemption can do so publicly, and that all those that are and should be involved in the process are notified and are able to participate in arguing the case for exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack said that in an earlier discussion between the Opposition and the Democrats we had a more comprehensive amendment. The amendment he referred to attempted to come to grips with defining special circumstances-a very difficult area indeed. We have had long discussions with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and officers of the Department as to how we could strengthen the exemption provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an interesting contradiction in the Opposition's logic. In the discussions which we had with the Opposition as to how it would approach this legislation, the shadow Minister for industrial relations, Mr Howard-I asked him whether I could quote this publicly and he said yes; so I am not disclosing a confidence-said:</PARA>
<PARA>We will support any amendment which weakens the bill and oppose any amendment which strengthens it. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, anything which supports the principle of divide and conquer in relation to unions the Opposition will identify with. I anticipate that Senator Durack will stand up and say that the Democrats had a great amendment but we pulled it off. The Opposition would have supported it because it believed it would have weakened the legislation. I am sorry that the Opposition does not have that opportunity now because we have called upon the Minister to facilitate the process of clarification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have not been bought. That is just emotional language. It has nothing to do with what has happened. It is called consultation. It is called dialogue. It is called responsibility when we, as the party which will determine the outcome of this legislation, have had dialogue and consultation with the Government on how to improve the legislation, how to strengthen the exemption provisions and how to clarify what is meant by `special circumstances'. That is responsible action on our part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We attempted to have dialogue with the Opposition. We were having it until we were told that the Opposition's bottom line position was that it would support any amendment which weakened the legislation and would oppose any amendment which strengthened it. We walked away from that dialogue; we walked away from that rubbish. If the Opposition is ever in government, it will have to adopt an entirely different logic from that. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving this amendment, which is intended to strengthen and clarify the processes of exemption, the Minister has undertaken to have incorporated in Hansard a clarifying statement which will have standing. That has come from the dialogue and the constructive, responsible discussion that we have had with the Government. To us it is a very acceptable outcome. It is an outcome which is preferable to having an amendment which the Opposition would have said that it would have supported because it believed it would have weakened the legislation. It has the same effect. It is less constraining upon those responsible for administering and effecting this very important process of exemption. It places fewer constraints but it adds clarification and support to the process. We believe that it is a most appropriate way of building upon, extending upon, the intention of this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday during the debate on matters of public interest I brought to the attention of the Senate some of the very major environmental and heritage matters which are significant in far north Queensland. I did say last week that I would, at some future time, continue to look at some of the things that are of quite major significance to far north Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the last break I had the opportunity of touring far north Queensland with Mr Fred Chaney, the Liberal Party shadow spokesman on the environment, and we looked at a number of these issues. After doing a lot of work in the environment areas of far north Queensland north of Cairns we then went out to the southern Atherton Tableland area around the town of Ravenshoe. I was very pleased to be able to introduce Fred Chaney to the people of Ravenshoe so that he could hear at first hand the problems that they are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not elaborate on our visit with the Ravenshoe townsfolk as this will be a subject of my continuing inquiries into all aspects of World Heritage listing as it has affected the town of Ravenshoe. I will continue with that until the matter is resolved satisfactorily. I simply take the opportunity again of emphasising the hurt that is being suffered by those people-hurt that can be resolved by courageous decisions of government. I again call upon the Government to look into the matters affecting the people of Ravenshoe-as I have done many times before-and ask them to come up with some solution, some decision, on the matters which have been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot help be impressed and have great admiration for the research into the environment which is being carried on as an integral part of the Tully Falls-Millstream Falls hydro-electricity project. Over $5m has been spent on researching delicate environmental issues and I am impressed at the depth and expense of the research being conducted by the Queensland Electricity Commission into that project. </PARA>
<PARA> If the project does eventually come to fruition it will be a marvellous thing for safe, clean and inexpensive energy for north Queensland. More importantly, it will provide a permanent source of power to north Queensland in times when the existing grid from coal-fired stations in the south of Queensland might be cut by fire, flood, cyclone or other calamity beyond the control of man. The situation of electricity in north Queensland at the moment could be precarious if some natural disaster interrupted the supply from the south. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated at the research being done into a little animal called the rooting rat, which is a little fellow who, after two weeks of sexual frenzy in the rainforest-and what a glorious place to do it-dies as a result of exhaustion. He is quite a unique fellow and an enormous amount of research has gone into this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably a good way to go if one has to go at some time. The research that has been done into that little fellow is quite interesting. I was equally impressed by the research that has gone into the yellow tailed flying possum which inhabits some of the wet sclerophyll land adjoining the rainforest areas of the Tully Falls-Millstream Falls project area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of the 660,000 hectares of World Heritage listed rainforest in this particular area, the Tully Falls-Millstream project, if it comes to completion, will affect no more than 135 hectares of that land. It should also be pointed out that the Queensland Electricity Commission has purchased about 440 hectares of rainforest from a private landowner. This land will not be touched by the QEC but instead it will be incorporated into the adjacent State forest and will more than compensate for the small area of rainforest that will be inundated by the Tully Falls-Millstream Falls hydro project if it does go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Every effort is being made to ensure that the flora and fauna which inhabit the smaller areas which might be inundated are not endangered. The research by environmentalists in the area has revealed that many plants and animals previously thought to be unique and rare are, in fact, not quite as unique or rare as they once were thought to be, but they are, of course, treasures which Australia must preserve at all costs. Apparently plants and animals get rare classifications if there is only a small number found, but I understand that while there are quite a lot of these animals and plants there, they have not been recorded over the years and the research which the Queensland Electricity Commission is doing has, as I say, taken out of that rare and unique category many of these plants and animals, which are treasures and which must be preserved but which are not quite as rare as once was thought to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The research being conducted by the QEC into the environment is being conducted in such a sensitive way as to demand universal respect and admiration. I might mention that at the bottom of the range in the Tully River Valley a test drill hole has been dug into the side of the mountain. The work is completed, but I cannot help be amazed at the lengths to which the QEC has gone to return the test hole site to its original condition. This involved lifting bitumen roads, completely clearing the site and replanting vegetation. I think that is indicative of the lengths to which the QEC is going to protect the environment and to do everything so correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased also to learn that one of the greatest tourist destinations of north Queensland, the Tully River white water rafting activities, will continue to have a place in the Tully River Valley following the implementation of the Tully Falls-Millstream Falls hydro project. Water will continue to be released into the river which will provide a continued and guaranteed source of water down the rapids which will delight overseas and Australian enthusiasts alike for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Our discussions with environmentalists in the Tully-Mission Beach area were fruitful and informative. There appears to be a new realisation amongst Australians that most people are indeed very concerned about the environment and conservation and are determined to protect it. But this realisation is being tempered by the realisation that in these difficult economic times sensible decisions must be made on all matters which take into account a very broad understanding of the Australian land mass and its limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chaney and I were, during our visit, able to inspect one of the less memorable examples of the way blatant and unlawful destruction of mangrove environments can happen and we were able to talk to the people of the Cardwell area who were trying to pick up the pieces of an initially bad decision and make something out of it which will benefit the little seaside community of Cardwell. Certain work was done in the mangrove areas without permits by a company which has since gone into liquidation. Perhaps not surprisingly, the company was being funded by one of Victoria's more notorious financial institutions, which has also collapsed. But the damage has been done and it is now a question of what can be achieved to resolve it. A huge hole exists in the area. It was intended to be a marina- a marina which the people of Cardwell believe is vital to achieve the potential that Cardwell offers as a tourist destination. The town is situated on the edge of the Hinchinbrook Channel and is a perfect stepping stone to the fabulous tropical islands, including Hinchinbrook Island, the Palm Islands, the Brook Islands and Gould Island. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot help also being impressed by the depth of genuine feeling shown by conservationists in the North Queensland Conservation Council with whom Mr Chaney and I met in Townsville and had long discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> We were very impressed with the broad range of issues with which members were concerned, both at local, State, Federal and international level. The Council is to be commended for the diverse range of activities that it conducts on the very small budget that it has. I also mention the very good work being done by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which work I was able to speak about last week in the Senate when talking to its report. At that time I was also able to defend that Authority against attacks by the Democrats on the work that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority does. It is a magnificent organisation. It does a lot of good work and I was rather surprised that the Democrats should have taken the opportunity last week to attack its work. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not speak about the Authority as I did that last week, except to say that it is good to see that a very productive working relationship exists between the Authority based in Townsville, the Australian Institute of Marine Science which is at Cape Ferguson just south of Townsville, and the James Cook University of North Queensland at Townsville, all three of which conduct world class research into matters pertaining to the Great Barrier Reef and the environment around it. It certainly gives me a great deal of confidence about the preservation of our natural treasures when I see the work that these authorities are doing. As I said in my maiden speech, the Great Barrier Reef is perhaps our greatest piece of natural heritage and it must never be put in jeopardy by the decisions of man. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short four day trip through tropical north Queensland I was very pleased to be able to show Mr Chaney all of those major items in Australia's heritage and it certainly gave to me a new meaning and emphasis on the description of Australia being a lucky country. In these difficult times of economic recession, soaring unemployment and doom and gloom everywhere, it does us good to visit and appreciate the magnificent treasures that we have in far north Queensland, to experience them first hand and to live with them. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by talking about something not quite so positive, and that is the rallies that took place today on the front lawns of Parliament House and discussions which we have been having during the day on the problems that Australian horticulturists are experiencing at this time. They are in crisis mode. Many of them are in a situation where they will have to walk off their farms. This has all occurred through what they see as unfair trade regulations and rules, and I agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Australian producers of horticultural crops and many other agricultural crops are the most efficient and the most innovative in the world. They are some of the hardest working. But they are being brought to their knees by imports of the same food crops that they are growing. These imports are being brought in at a subsidised level. They are being brought in from countries which have much less regulation than we do. One of the real problems that they face is the high infrastructure costs in Australia, and also there are the things that we have promised to do in relation to micro-economic reform. But it is all really a little too late. It has to be done urgently. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the Government does not seem to be capable of moving along quickly. There are things like interest rates; the problems in the waterfront; the problems in transportation; the problems I suggest with quarantine measures, where the Government brings the quarantine service into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to talk about things, when one would have thought they might have been quite separate entities. All of these things are causing an enormous lot of trouble to these people. I wish them well in their campaign. I know that they have achieved a lot of publicity from what has happened today and it will bring the realisation to Australians of the real problems in their industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I urge honourable senators to consider the plight of these people and to do what they can, particularly government senators, to ensure that something is done immediately to overcome what can be quite disastrous results to the people who have for many years struggled to build their farms and to feed and clothe their families when all that looks like falling to nothing. Mr Deputy President, I bring those matters to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, the motion on Tibet, passed unanimously earlier today, is, I believe, an important statement of the Senate's views on a very troubled part of our region. I would like to take some of the Senate's time now to outline its significance. Before turning to the text of the motion I would like particularly to thank the Government, the Opposition and Senators Vallentine and Harradine for supporting the motion. Its passage is a very good example of the consultation and cooperation which is often a welcome feature of the Senate's work but which generally goes unreported because it is not a circus and it does not entertain in the way conflict does. I would also like to thank Lynn Russell and Jonathan Cebon of the Australia-Tibet Council for their initiative and assistance. A particularly pleasing aspect of the motion is that it was passed during a visit to Canberra by a Tibetan delegation organised by the Australia-Tibet Council. I should note that the wording of the first draft of the motion was changed a little to achieve a consensus of the chamber. Some of us, not only in the Australian Democrats, would have liked some stronger sentiments to be expressed; nevertheless, the motion is a strong one and the motion that was passed delivers an unequivocal message.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past few months we have been reminded constantly, and quite rightly so, of the enormity of a certain naked act of aggression committed by a certain brutal dictatorial regime on 2 August this year. The annexation of Tibet by China in October 1950 was precisely such an act. Since then hundreds of thousands of Tibetans are thought to have died as China has attempted in vain to suppress the centuries old culture of one of the most peaceful peoples on earth. Military campaigns, massacres, tortures, severe restrictions on freedom of expression and movement and a trans-migration program aimed at boosting the Chinese population have all failed to extinguish the Tibetan spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> As today's motion notes in its third point the United Nations General Assembly passed three resolutions on Tibet between 1959 and 1965, all of which remain relevant today in their entirety. Resolution 1723 of 1961 is particularly relevant in its call for the cessation of practices which deprive the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, including their right to self-determination. The issue of self-determination is also enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in article 21 which calls for free elections under universal and equal suffrage. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be argued that after 40 years of Chinese rule the incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic is irreversible. In fact, it is the desire of the Tibetan people for self-determination which has proved truly irreversible. The Tibetans have clearly demonstrated that they are an independent people. More oppression by China will lead to more bloodshed, more hostility and a spiral into further decay and conflict. There is no alternative but to recognise the aspirations and the identity of the Tibetan people and to ensure that they are given cultural and political expression. </PARA>
<PARA> Conflicts such as that in Tibet are being played out in one form or another in many parts of the world where the boundaries of states clash with the identity of peoples living within them. I could name many countries where movements for greater political autonomy are simmering or growing. Too often the response of the state under challenge is to use repressive measures in an attempt to crush those aspirations. This approach, apart from being immoral and unjust, which of course it is, is also demonstrably unsuccessful. One has only to look at our northern neighbours, in particular East Timor, Irian Jaya and Bougainville, to understand that military force simply does not work. Political resolutions must be sought to one of the foremost political challenges of the next decade and beyond. It is for this reason that the Democrats applaud the Senate's call for the Chinese Government to recognise the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people and to negotiate without pre-conditions for the Dalai Lama and his representatives to reduce the tensions in Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA> In the hope that this motion will be of some small assistance to the Tibetan people in their quest for justice, freedom and self-determination, I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in relation to the matters of public interest I rise to address two things that have occurred in this Chamber in the last few days. These have caused me great concern and I want to express that concern in this place. The first one occurred the other day in relation to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I want to say, in terms of the opinion of politicians that exists out in the public area which is not exactly very high, that when we have a situation arise in this place where a Prime Ministerial statement is given and is not incorporated or included or read into what is the official minutes of this place, I just find that quite disgraceful. First of all I want to express my displeasure and disgust at the action taken by the Australian Democrats in not allowing the statement to be incorporated. I think it is a total slight on the parliamentary system and will not do any of us any good. I think the action that members of the Democrats took was disgraceful. I believe it was quite reasonable to have the statement incorporated so that we could have more time for the debate. I believe that that would have been quite reasonable as I said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now want to deal with the next aspect of it. I believe that the action that was taken by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) was not proper or acceptable. Having been refused leave to incorporate, not to in fact have read the statement then, in the situation in which he was put, was just a case of spitting the dummy. Once again I want to emphasise the point that as far as I am concerned, and I am sure as far as people on this side of the chamber are concerned, I do not accept that as proper and acceptable behaviour from a Leader of the Government in the Senate. I would hope that there would be a personal commitment made into the future in this place by all people who sit in here that they will never allow that to happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is an absolute slight on the Prime Minister of this country. As I said before, it is not a case of which party that Prime Minister comes from. It is a case of the principle that he is the Prime Minister of Australia. We have what I believe is a totally unforgivable position. It will do us, as representatives from the various areas or the States that we come from, absolutely no good whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I want to come to in terms of what I wanted to raise concerns some of the debate about the Iraqi situation. I want to dissociate myself-and I emphasise dissociate myself-from the proposition that was put before us the other night in this place by Senator Vallentine. I do not deny her right to come in here and make a particular point. I guess the best words that I can pick in relation to this are the words used in the point of order raised by Senator McKiernan. He is sitting across the chamber. I will quote his words, because despite the fact that he made a few less complimentary comments to me last night, I think he summed up the situation absolutely perfectly. The honourable senator stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The honourable senator is here in this chamber offering Saddam Hussein a reward for invading a country and holding hostages. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, in terms of the current situation that we face, I must express my total dissociation from the proposition that was put forward by Senator Vallentine. As far as Iraq is concerned, I believe we have a situation whereby, for the first time since the United Nations was formed, we are seeing effective action taken. We are standing up to international thuggery. </PARA>
<PARA> I would liken it to the situation in a schoolyard where you have the big bully. He comes in and takes the ice cream from the little child, or the kid, or the smaller one, or the weaker one. But before he is punished for taking the ice cream, the headmaster tells him to eat it. As I said, I want to dissociate myself from that particular aspect. I suggest it is absolutely essential at this time when we are looking for lasting world peace, that one of the conditions that must be associated with part of the discussions that are going to be conducted is total withdrawal from all lands that have been taken over. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I wanted to get to in this matter of public interest today relates partly to what Senator Macdonald had to say about the breakfast we attended this morning and the very peaceful, lawful demonstration. I emphasise the word `lawful' because I think it is very important, and I am going to contrast that in a moment with another situation which exists in this country at this time. I mention the efforts that those people were making as far as fair trade is concerned. It is very important that we address in this place the nub of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One example that I looked at this morning is the importation into this country of Turkish apricots. People were not saying that Turkish apricots should not come into this country; they were saying that they should be delivered in a fair and proper way. They showed me an example of how they had been packaged and sold to the Australian community in plastic bags. People can hardly see through those plastic bags so they cannot see the product inside. Marked on the outside of those plastic bags were the words `produce of Australia'. The argument that was being used by the people who were presenting that example was that the plastic bag that they were in was a product of Australia. That might well be true, but I believe it certainly is a classic example of misleading labelling. </PARA>
<PARA> I know Senator Tate made some comments, and I did not hear them totally, on how that particular problem is being addressed. But I believe that there are a number of instances of Australian industry-good Australian, non-assisted, professional industry-being disadvantaged by others rorting the system or by misrepresentation. I think it is very important that we in this place do all we can to make sure that those unfair distortions which exist internally in this country are addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear much about blaming what is going on overseas on the Australian problem. It is true, and I accept it, that there are many instances whereby the activities that are occurring overseas do impact on us. We can continue with our General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks and our international negotiations to try to put pressure on the various countries that are involved in these activities, but at the same time there is a lot that can be done in this country to get rid of some of the rorts, the distortions and the disadvantages which occur and actually come down on our producers of wealth. I think it is very important that more emphasis be placed by government on that aspect of the equation within the Australian economy. In saying that, I am not saying that we should put less effort into international negotiations, into GATT and into the efforts of the Cairns Group of which we all know Australia is a leader. I am saying that we should double or treble our efforts to address some of the problems which exist in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to contrast the activities of the concerned farmers or producers who are here today with what is still going on in the Australian meat industry. Senator Cook, in the debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill last night, accused me of having an obsession with this dispute. As I said in that debate, while we continue to see blackmail, thuggery, all types of activities with a complete lack of recognition of the processes of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and complete defiance of its directions, I will continue to have obsessions about it. I want to highlight, in a collective manner, some of the damage that is currently being done to us by this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I highlight is that the losses now are getting close to $100m in terms of export meats at a time when Australia's current account and her overall financial situation is in serious disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to highlight, if I could, the situation that in Victoria alone-and I emphasise that this dispute does not only impact on Victoria because it impacts on other States and is currently on the agenda in Western Australia-in the last five years we have seen the closure of over half of our export meatworks. This is a very serious situation for Australia. It impacts, first of all, on the producers who produce the stock. This is because of the access that they have through these export works at peak times. I emphasise the point that with livestock there is only one time that you can turn them off and that is when they are ready. You cannot hold them for two or three weeks longer or a month longer. You cannot sell them a little bit earlier because then they are not suitable in terms of quality for the marketplace. So the producer only has one choice, one chance. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention the impact that this has had on the workers who have been involved and the loss of wages and time and the frustration. I have already emphasised the impact that it has on our current account. But the other point which is missed in this debate and which has not been raised in relation to what is going on, is the impact it has on our customers. Here we are spending many, many dollars-in fact probably millions of dollars over the years-in the GATT negotiations, in the efforts through the Cairns Group, and on deputations in international travel. Here we are handing markets to the various people whom we are trying to convince to in fact lower their barriers, lower their subsidies, lower their support. It is no wonder they have little respect for us. Any suggestion that we have not done our overseas reputation any damage is absolute nonsense. We have only to go into some of the markets in Asia and find from those people who purchase the goods from us, who have not been able to receive them from Australia, that in fact it has done us damage. They have gone elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to contrast what we saw out on the lawns today of a perfectly legitimate protest or demonstration to highlight the problems which exist in our horticultural industries with what has been going on in relation to this meat dispute. In recent times we have had from this inquiry a commitment made by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions that they would not take industrial action. This was ignored by the AMIEU. We had a commitment, once again entered into before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, just over 2 1/2 weeks ago. It was not honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearing just over one week ago. An agreement was reached there that, in the postponing of that particular case, they would not go on strike because the advocates from the AMIEU were overseas on the international junket. We have the situation where they got back and the hearing started yesterday. What did we see this morning? They are back on strike again in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is absolutely and totally intolerable. It is hurting this country badly. It is hurting producers badly. It is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. I hope that the honourable gentlemen sitting on the other side take note of my remarks. I feel very sad for this country. I feel very sad for the producers. I feel very sad for law and order in this place when we can just watch the damage that can be done to one of our most important export industries. In fact we have a situation in this country where many sheep are being shot and buried in pits. They could be sold overseas, helping our overall economic situation and certainly taking a lot of the pain of the current rural downturn away from the producers so affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating here today the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1990 which amends the Ministers of State Act 1952. The purpose of the Bill is in fact a requirement under section 66 of the Constitution which prescribes a maximum amount of money for the payment of Ministers. It is an amendment to the Act which sets this sum and is required from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sum appropriated is simply to meet the cost of salaries. It does not set the amount of individual salaries to the Ministers. In, fact the salary of Ministers is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and honourable senators will be aware that there were certain recommendations made by the Remuneration Tribunal in 1990 in respect of both Ministers and senators and members which were rejected by the Government and, subsequently, increases were agreed to which were substantially less than recommended by the Tribunal. People would debate whether that is a very wise move and I am sure it is something which will come up in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) said that the Government made a submission to the Tribunal in accordance with recent determinations for other groups within the Commonwealth sector and it was consistent with wage fixing principles. I just make the point that the Opposition would hope that is the case and the Government submission was made in accordance with the guidelines and not in accordance with some deal that was concocted in a dark corner of someone's office. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase takes into account-I think this should be made quite clear because I noticed a quite misleading newspaper report to the contrary-the fact that expenses of office allowances previously included in Ministers' entitlements have been included within their salaries. The effect of these changes, as outlined in the Bill, is to increase the total sum paid in ministerial salaries by $556,000 in the financial year 1990-91, and $657,000 in the financial year 1991-92. Hence my earlier remarks that this should not be misread. There was in fact not that sort of an increase in salaries for Ministers but the incorporation of expenses of office within the ministerial salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the expenses of office into perspective, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of those expenses which have now been included within the ministerial salary. I checked this with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) prior to Question Time and he was in agreement with that. </PARA>

I noticed, as I have just mentioned, that when this proposal was made to incorporate Ministers' expenses of office within their salaries the Minister in the other place said that this was consistent with the structural efficiency principle aim of simplification of salary structures, and so on. I wonder, if one is to be consistent, whether consideration should not be given to incorporating the electoral allowances of ordinary senators and members in this Parliament in their salaries. It seems to me that there is an awful inconsistency when the Government includes the expenses of office of Ministers in their salaries but does not include the electoral allowances of senators and members in their salaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every now and then a Bill emerges which the Opposition not only does not oppose but which it welcomes warmly. The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill is one such Bill. The Opposition welcomes the Bill warmly, partly because the Opposition drew attention to the anomaly which is being corrected by the Bill. In fact, I was the person who became aware of the anomaly which applied to a particular Australian citizen. The anomaly resulted in discrimination which, in fact, was gender based. To put it in very brief terms, an Australian citizen, Geraldine Room, was born of an Australian mother married to a person at that time not an Australian citizen-a very distinguished professor at Sydney University. Professor Room was an English citizen. He served with the Australian Imperial Force. To compound the troubles, he was on sabbatical leave in Seattle or somewhere on the west coast of America when the girl was born at a relevant time in 1948 or 1949.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of some anomalies in the Act, had it been the other way round-had it been an Australian father and a nonAustralian mother-the girl would have had Australian citizenship. But being the daughter of an Australian woman and a non-Australian man she discovered later in life that she was denied citizenship. I want to compliment several Ministers for Immigration. I took the problem firstly to the Hon. Mick Young, who understood the issue and said he thought it should be corrected. That would have been in 1983. The only sadness is that it has taken some seven years since then. We had various arguments from officers-the floodgates argument, the thin end of the wedge argument, the large number of people who might claim exemptions argument-and in the end it required a government decision that the anomaly would be corrected. This Bill sets out to correct the anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a little difficulty with the drafting because Geraldine Room, not unnaturally, wants the capacity to register her children. She believed she was an Australian citizen. She was brought up in Australia. She travelled on an Australian passport until it was discovered that this anomaly existed. She wants her children to be Australian. The Bill, as finally drafted, will allow all those things to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Ministers for Immigration have been cooperative. The view of the Opposition is that the Bill should be supported enthusiastically, that we should give credit to the Government, credit to the Ministers and wish the Bill the speediest passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware of the origin of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill when I was asked to respond on behalf of the Government to it but I accept Senator Peter Baume's word absolutely that that is the case. I congratulate him on the initiative that he took in this matter and in seeing come to fruition one initiative which he has taken. I was happy, broadly of course, to support the legislation anyway because it does remove a historic discrimination which was inappropriate when it was introduced and it is even more inappropriate in contemporary circumstances. Many Bills like this are minor in the national context but they are not minor to the individuals who are affected and it is desirable that individuals and individual members of parliament have the opportunity to take these initiatives when matters arising from their constituency activities point out defects in the law. To see those come to fruition is a plus.</PARA></TALK.START>

In this circumstance we had an individual who met the fundamental precondition of an Australian citizen, that is she had a commitment to Australia and she wanted to be an Australian citizen for properly valid reasons.

Other minor anomalies are corrected by the Bill and I welcome the Opposition's support of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is supporting the ICSID Implementation Bill the purpose of which is to put in place the legislative framework for Australia to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. This convention came into force on 14 October 1966 and it was signed by Australia on 24 March 1975. There are presently 91 member state parties including most of Australia's major trading partners. The purpose of the convention is to set up a mechanism for the resolution of disputes arising out of international investment and to provide facilities for arbitration or conciliation of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states. It establishes the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes known by its acronym ICSID at the headquarters of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Washington DC. The centre consists of an administrative council and a secretariat and maintains a panel of conciliators and a panel of arbitrators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a formula in article 17 for the contracting states to finance the Centre to the extent, if any, that its expenditure cannot be met out of charges for the use of its facilities and other receipts. Its jurisdiction extends to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a contracting state or any constituent subdivision or agency of a contracting state and a national or other contracting state which the parties to that dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. Once this consent has been given it cannot be withdrawn unilaterally. Although the term `investment' is not defined in the convention a wide range of investment disputes come within the ambit of the convention including those relating to profit sharing, service and management contracts, contracts for the transfer of technology, and building projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of conciliation proceedings is dealt with in chapter III of the convention. Any contracting state or a national of a contracting state may institute conciliation proceedings by means of a written request to the Secretary-General of ICSID. The conduct of arbitration proceedings is dealt with in chapter IV. Like conciliation proceedings, they are also instituted by means of a written request. The tribunal must decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed between the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the tribunal must apply the law of the state party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable. The tribunal makes an award which is final and binding on the parties. All questions in a dispute must be decided by majority vote, and the award must be in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, there are four types of remedies against an award under the convention. Firstly, where the tribunal has not decided a question submitted to it, a party may ask the tribunal to supplement the award. Secondly, a party can request an interpretation of the meaning and scope of the award. Thirdly, either party may request revision of the award in the light of new facts. Finally, either party may request an annulment of the award on certain grounds specified in article 52. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter VI deals with the costs of the proceedings. In the case of conciliation proceedings, the costs are to be borne equally by the parties. In the case of arbitration proceedings, the decision on responsibility for costs forms part of the award. Pursuant to chapter VII, proceedings are to take place in Washington DC unless the parties otherwise agree to their taking place at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, or any other approved centre. It is possible that in the future Australia could host an approved centre. We already have two centres for arbitration, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, and ratification of the convention would enable this to be built on. Under the provisions of chapter VIII, any disputes between parties relating to the interpretation or application of the convention may be resolved by the International Court of Justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The ICSID Implementation Bill amends the International Arbitration Act 1974 and the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. The amendments to the International Arbitration Act include: proposed new section 32 which gives force to the convention; proposed new section 33 which provides that an award made pursuant to the terms of the convention is final on the parties to the dispute and is not subject to any appeal or remedy other than those provided by the convention; proposed section 35 under which the Supreme Courts of the States and the Territories will have jurisdiction to enforce ICSID awards; and the insertion of the convention as a new schedule 3 to the Act. The International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act is amended to insert a new section 9a to enable regulations to be made under the Act granting privileges and immunities to persons who act as conciliators or arbitrators under the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we are supporting the Bill and the convention, I mention briefly that there are three principal areas in which the convention has proved to have limitations. The first relates to jurisdiction. One issue has been the effect that the convention may have on limiting State sovereignty. In this respect, arbitral tribunals have taken a broad view of the concept of jurisdiction and the word `investment'. Another issue that has arisen is the position of multinational companies and whether they can be considered to be nationals of a contracting State. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area concerns which law should be applicable in the resolution of disputes that have been referred to ICSID. The common practice of parties to investment agreements has been for the domestic law of the host nation to apply. However, difficulties have arisen where the parties have not specified the applicable law; for example, where a nation does not have a unified legal system because of its colonial heritage. The third area of concern relates to the question of whether the convention covers multipartite arbitration. The convention, as presently drafted, only covers disputes between two single parties and, in the absence of agreement, multipartite disputes or proceedings cannot be dealt with by ICSID. </PARA>
<PARA> Having raised these three matters, Mr Deputy President, I nevertheless point out that the coalition is of the view that it is appropriate that such issues be resolved at the international level, or by parties using appropriate arbitration clauses to overcome these problems, rather than by amendments to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We would encourage the Government to examine the existing provisions of the convention as a starting point for making it more relevant to the nature of contemporary investment disputes. During the debate on the second reading in the other place, my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) representing the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), raised two issues which we believed required the immediate consideration of the Government. The first was in relation to article 25(1). It was whether the Government intends to designate what it describes as any constituent subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth which will for the purposes of the convention assume the status of a contracting state. For example, could a dispute between a foreign corporation and a Commonwealth agency or a State government fall within the ambit of the convention in the absence of such a designation, and would it not be desirable that they should all be covered?</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) replied in relation to this matter that all States and Territories had been consulted to seek their consent to be designated as constituent subdivisions under article 25, and that all jurisdictions, with the exception of Western Australia, had consented to be so designated. That might not come as a surprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter which the Opposition brought to the Attorney-General's attention was whether the Government under article 25(4) intends to notify ICSID of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Attorney-General did not cover this matter in his final remarks on the Bill, and the Opposition would appreciate some assurance that it will receive his due consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters aside, the Opposition, as I said earlier, is pleased to be in a position to support this legislation. One of the factors leading to the Opposition's support of the Bill is Australia's growing status in recent years as a leader in the field of international arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region. There have been some influential advocates for expanding Australia's role in this field, notably Sir Laurence Street. It is hoped that the implementation of the ICSID convention will encourage this process. A second potential area of benefit is that having clearly established mechanisms for dispute resolution may well assist in attracting foreign investment to Australia. It will undoubtedly also prove to be an advantage to Australian companies proposing to invest overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons the Opposition is supporting the Bill whilst pointing out the areas in which we believe the convention has limitations which should be addressed at the international level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Hill who, on behalf of the Opposition, supported the ICSID Implementation Bill.

<PARA> It is appropriate that the Government and the Opposition should both be supporting this matter. Awkward as the acronym might be, it is an initiative that is, as the Attorney said, a step in advancing the Government's objective of developing Australia's role in international commercial dispute resolution-a point which was the foundation of Senator Hill's support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill extends for an additional one year the transition period as is defined by the Australian Capital Territory Planning and Land Management Act of 1988. The transition period in that Act commenced on 11 May 1989, which is the day regarded as self-government day in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and was specified in subsection 57 (2) of the Act to expire not later than one year after self-government day. During the transition period, the pre-self-government planning regime, mainly consisting of the policies of the National Capital Development Commission, was to remain in force, and under this Act the transition period could be ended on a day specified by proclamation. The prerequisite for this proclamation is that the national capital plan should be in force providing the ACT with a new planning regime. The national capital plan has not yet come into force and the transition period expired on 10 May 1990. As the Act operates on the premise that the national capital plan, together with the Territory plan, are substituted once the transitional period expires, this Bill will correct an apparent anomaly whereby currently there is no planning regime in force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The preparation and entry into force of the national capital plan is, in fact, taking longer than anticipated. There has been some suggestion that it may not be in place even by the middle of next year and it may be that another Bill like this will have to be passed to extend it again, but it is undesirable that it should take any longer than absolutely necessary. The planning vacuum created by the expiration of the transition period prior to the entry into force of the national capital plan has already given rise to litigation in the Territory over the validity of planning decisions made by the Interim Territory Planning Authority. I understand that the Federal Government has received advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that that is not a problem as it stands, but this Bill is designed to remove any doubt about it, and the ACT Government, I am able to tell the Senate, is not opposed to the passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the ACT Government and the people of Canberra have concerns arising out of the dual planning system provided in the legislation which establishes both the National Capital Planning Authority and the Territory Planning Authority. The concerns are twofold really-the additional costs that the national capital plan may impose upon the Territory, particularly the way in which it restricts land use, and the confusion which seems to be in existence created by a dual planning system. Whether it is inevitable that there will be confusion because there are two, I do not know but the fact is that a lot of people find it confusing. ACT business has to contend with the concepts of the national land and Territory land, land in designated areas and land subject to special requirements. Maybe it is because it is so new that it is still causing this confusion and it will all become clear, but I believe there are some grey areas and there are some areas which the Commonwealth has attempted to retain which I believe is not justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Contending with planning authorities, I am sure all would realise, can be complicated in the best of circumstances, but where there are two bodies answerable to two different governments in a city the size of Canberra, I think it is confusing. The ACT Government regards the matter as one which should be on the table for discussion in the context of the issues which arose out of the recent Special Premiers Conference, which I have referred to in asking a question here previously. It was agreed at the Conference that areas of functional duplication should be examined and I think there is no better example of functional duplication than is arising with our dual planning system. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT Government proposes the Territory Planning Authority be the only planning authority and act as an agent for the Commonwealth in relation to the national capital planning issues, and that is certainly one aspect of resolving the matter that should be looked at. The Federal Government has not yet acknowledged the importance of these issues, but I believe that it should do so and hope that it will. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that arises is the additional costs which arise from the plan. The financial implications and finances at the moment in relations between the Commonwealth and the Territory are somewhat of a sore point, and for two reasons, to which I wish to refer briefly. There were moneys unilaterally held by the Commonwealth which should be available to the ACT. That occurred only a matter of weeks after the ACT became a self-governing territory. Subsequently, the Labor Chief Minister sought some of those moneys from the Commonwealth and they were granted. Recently, the Chief Minister has sought $18.6m, $8.6m to recover redundancy payments to be offered in restructuring the ACT Administration, having inherited 17,000 public servants from the Commonwealth and $10m for restructuring the hospital system in accordance with the report of Professor Kearney, which the Federal Government commissioned and accepted as the way to go for the restructuring of our hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has refused to release any further moneys to the ACT Government, and says that the projects that they have been sought for are not of, in his words, `exceptional quality'. I wish to refer to his letter, which he addresses to the Chief Minister. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the last release of funds . . . we established criteria for their release-that the projects to be funded be of exceptional quality and cannot be funded by any other means. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter went on to state that the Commonwealth was not persuaded that that was the case in this instance. Both of these restructuring processes are absolutely vital to the finances of the ACT and the way that the place can be run and governed in the future. One wonders what it is that the Federal Government expects, especially when one considers what the $7m that it released last year was released for. We are talking about `exceptional quality' and not being able to obtain it from `other means'. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, when the Chief Minister sought money from this trust fund, it was for the upgrading of irrigation and watering systems along Canberra's roads-and no-one denies that that needs to be done-for the replacement of leased cars and for the upgrading and efficiency of the ACT hospital kitchens. None of it is quite in the category of being visionary or exceptional, and I wonder how on earth the Prime Minister justifies the fact that he released $7m last year and refuses, for the grounds sought, this year to do so. I believe the present request, in fact, has considerably more merit and I do not believe the refusal can be justified on other than party political grounds-just refusing to give it to a government that is not one of his own kind. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a letter in this morning's Canberra Times suggesting that the Chief Minister should take the matter to the High Court. Probably, perhaps, but at what cost, at what additional cost to the people of Canberra to try to sort these things out?</PARA>
<PARA> I perhaps should refer to the fact that the Chief Minister, I gather, referred to the $80m which the Federal Government has found and given to the Tasmanian Government to assist with public services and redundancies; the same reason, which was rejected, for releasing our own money to us in this instance. The Prime Minister, in his letter, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, with regard to your references to the Commonwealth assistance provided to Tasmania . . . I should note that this assistance recognised the serious financial position faced by that State. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody is denying that there is a serious financial situation in Tasmania. There are in other Labor States as well. Is he telling us that if we really get ourselves into such enormous debt that we cannot look after ourselves, then we can expect some help from the Commonwealth but, meantime, while we are trying to be responsible, not to get into debt, and run a balanced budget, we can go jump in the lake? That is what he is actually saying to the people of the ACT. The people here are being penalised, personally, by the Federal Government refusing to take a responsible attitude. It is clear that the ACT Government is not seeking any privileges or special treatment; merely seeking money which has been withheld and to which it is entitled. I regard it as appalling treatment by the Commonwealth of the people of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, I regret, consistent with what occurred when the infrastructure was allowed to run down by the Government before it was handed over to the people of the ACT and the way it behaved over the Gowrie Hostel. I shall not repeat again-I have spoken of it before in this place-the totally unjustified way in which the Commonwealth retained for itself the Gowrie Hostel so it could sell it and retain the profits. I know it won the argument in the court and I am not disputing the court decision. Technically, it was correct; morally, the Federal Government has behaved despicably. Now, the ACT is faced with additional costs, I believe, as a result of the national capital plan and the way it has been developed, with some of the prime areas of land being retained, as they are, by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, of which I am a member, in its response to the draft national capital plan, made it clear that any additional costs imposed on the ACT arising out of the plan should be borne by the Commonwealth, but I do not feel very optimistic that it will honour any such request. The Committee also recommended that the National Capital Planning Authority should provide more information about the financial implications of the plan and I certainly do not accept the view of the National Capital Planning Authority that the plan has no cost implications for Canberra. I think it has a very large job ahead of it if it is going to attempt to persuade the people of Canberra that that in fact is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> These are all matters that arise out of the national capital plan that we are referring to today. As I said, we do not oppose this Bill which extends for an additional year the transitional period of the planning and land management Act. </PARA>

It removes any doubt that might exist about the appropriateness, viability and continuing operation of the national capital plan during the period until May next year, although I do not believe, and the Commonwealth does not believe, that there was that doubt. It is not our view that there is no such plan in force but while the proper processes are under way it is appropriate that we should pass this legislation to remove any doubt, and it is another step in the proper implementation of self-government for the ACT.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister for Social Security by saying that some time ago, in relation to the social security amnesty, the Minister commented that the numbers were fairly close to those expected but that the amounts that the Government looked like recovering were not as high as anticipated. Can the Minister report to the Senate on what the final outcome may have been?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say in the Senate that I thought we might fall under the Budget estimates quite considerably. I think I indicated in this chamber that perhaps the amount would be closer to $40m than to the $53.4m which the Budget indicated we might gain from the amnesty. It would appear that we have done a little better than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two categories were considered in this amnesty and in past amnesties. The first category is the cancellation or reduction of payments to people who applied for and were granted the amnesty. The second category is the voluntary surrender of payments by people who were not entitled to receive unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or whatever but who were motivated by the publicity that attaches to an amnesty to take that course.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the amnesty generated 23,400 applications-and that is in advance of the 20,000 which were predicted in the Budget. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the total savings were $49.9m, which is very close to that $53.4m estimate. If one looks at those two categories of payments one sees that cancellations and reductions amounted to $22.5m and savings attributable to the voluntary surrender of payments by people who were prompted by publicity surrounding the amnesty are $27.4m.</PARA>
<PARA> It is probable that some clients who were receiving pension or family payments without entitlement also surrendered those payments because of amnesty publicity. However, we have not attributed any savings to those, nor to cases where people claimed the amnesty but were not entitled to it because, for example, they were not current Department of Social Security clients. There were about 1,300 of those. I suppose it would be possible, by some wrestling with statistics, to actually get our figures over the $53.4m. The reality is that of the amnesty has been a great success and has come very close to the Budget estimate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General follows a question that I asked on Monday concerning the decision by the Western Australian Liberal Party to block legislation in the Western Australian Legislative Council enabling the application of the Australian Companies and Securities Act. Can the Minister inform the Senate what effects the Liberal Party's obstruction will have on the raising of capital by Western Australian companies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the decision by the Opposition parties in the upper House in Western Australia to opt out of the Australian Securities Commission administered regulation of companies and securities Australia-wide will have a devastating effect on Western Australian business confidence and in the money that can be raised by companies operating in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that, as a result of this very shortsighted decision, Western Australian companies will be severely disadvantaged. When such companies are seeking much needed capital for their operations, there will be different rules applying to the issue of prospectuses in Western Australia and in the rest of Australia. As the rules will be different, their application by the Australian Securities Commission and the Western Australian Corporate Affairs Commission will have to take account of that difference.</PARA>
<PARA> Companies in many cases will not only have to pay two sets of registration fees but will have the added transaction costs, including legal and accounting fees, in order to comply with both laws. In some cases it may even involve issuing a different prospectus in Western Australia than the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Beahan would realise, from that short description, that there will be added costs of thousands of dollars involved in Western Australian companies seeking to raise capital on the Australia-wide market. After all, that is what it is. We are now operating in a situation where Australia-wide we have the one capital raising market and it is essential that we have the same set of regulations and laws applying and the same administrative techniques applied by the Australian Securities Commission. So, just on the simple question of legal and other transaction costs in raising capital, there will be an increase of thousands of dollars in each company. But there is a much more fundamental question which I think lies behind Senator Beahan's query in the Senate this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA> One wonders how investors in, say, Sydney or Melbourne or certainly overseas can have any confidence in the situation that is being created within the Western Australian jurisdiction. The West Australian of today in a very fine editorial, which echoes much of what I said a couple of days ago in the Senate, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Just when national consensus appeared to be emerging on the need to eliminate wasteful duplication and inefficiency in Federal-State relations, conservatives in the West Australian Legislative Council have dealt the process a body blow.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that Mr Peter Costello, the shadow spokesman in this area, along with Premier Nick Greiner, has made that point time and again in the last few days. I know that Senator Campbell was going to use his good offices to try to see that his colleagues in the Western Australian upper House saw good sense in this regard. The West Australian, which is not a red rag broadsheet but a quite conservative paper, went on to say today:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that Australia needs an effective national system to regulate companies and securities. Nowhere is this need more evident than in Western Australia where corporate misbehaviour has assumed alarming proportions that have set off several inquiries and now a royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the absolute paradox and contradiction. Just when all the political forces in Western Australia are leading to a situation where the companies and securities area in that State can be such that investors can have confidence in it, we have this extraordinarily contradictory effort of the Western Australian upper House to create an enclave, a retreat from a nationwide approach to the regulation of companies and securities. So investors can very well ask why are the Liberals and the National Party in the upper House creating this situation which can only provide opportunities for a very weak regulation of the companies and securities markets in Western Australia. That can only benefit those who are engaged in nefarious and crooked activities.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that once Western Australian businesses realise that tremendous costs will be imposed on them by this decision they will put a lot of pressure on the Liberals and the National Party in Western Australia to reverse their stance. Senators will know that Mr Hartnell of the Australian Companies and Securities Commission has stated that from 1 January 1991 it will be illegal for companies registered in Western Australia to trade in other States of Australia unless they have registered under the provisions of the new corporations law. In other words, they will be treated as foreign companies. By virtue of the law about to be passed in this Parliament, and certainly passed in other parliaments already, for example, in New South Wales and Victoria, Western Australian companies as a result of the action of the Western Australian Liberals and National Party will be treated as though they were companies registered in New York or Vanuatu. It is an extraordinary situation, which will lead to more costs and certainly a loss of investor confidence in the companies and securities market in Western Australia. I believe that the matter needs sober reconsideration by the upper House in Western Australia. I hope that for the sake of the business, commercial and trading life of Western Australia a reversal of that decision will soon take place.</PARA>

I believe that the question of the actual appeal process can always be a matter for review to ensure that it acts in a way that is utterly fair to the interests of veterans, whilst at the same time protecting the legitimate interests of those who need to ensure that taxpayers' money is expended in a proper way.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would not believe that that is the case because of the commitment to the furtherance of the obligation that the Australian community has to veterans. I believe that that is the key question. It is not a question of comparison of one system of appeal against another, but of whether the veterans have a fair and effective appeal system within which to operate. I believe that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Ben Humphreys, will endeavour to ensure at all times that that is available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Richard Tastula is the Chairman of the Gold Producers Association and in a report today he said that inflation was rising, that taxes would be applied to the goldmining industry next year, that gold `took off to be No. 3 in the export earnings list after wool and coal without any government assistance', and that `in one greedy move Canberra has destroyed it, our confidence has gone and investment has dried up'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, he is from the Gold Producers Association, but he could be one of those people Senator Walsh referred to last year as the spivs of St Georges Terrace in Western Australia. I think that Mr Richard Tastula discredits himself and the organisation that he represents. In the September quarter we saw inflation come down to 0.7 per cent, the fifth successive quarter in which inflation had dropped under our Government, meaning that the Budget target of 6 per cent this year will be realised. In terms of the gold industry and government assistance, the gold industry was the only industry which was exempt from paying normal company tax on profits, which in effect meant a subsidy of roughly $300m a year to that industry and, of course, we stopped that practice. The price of gold has increased in response to tensions in the Middle East, to answer the last part of the question. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects the world gold price to average $US385 an ounce in 1990 and $US400 an ounce in 1991. The Bureau also expects exports of gold to rise by 17.8 per cent in 1990-91. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that profits in the mining industry have risen by 41 per cent in 1989-90. Going back to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, its figures show that Australian gold production in 1990-91 is expected to be steady at 215 tonnes compared with a record level of 222 tonnes in 1989-90 and 188.4 tonnes in 1988-89.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While it is frequently the fact that lobby groups in presenting their cases to government do stretch the facts to suit their argument, in this case we have one in which the facts are completely wrong on the four major points that have been made. That is, as I have said, a discredit to the spokesperson and the organisation. I cannot for the life of me glean what the motive might be, other than trying to cloud over how well the goldmining industry is in fact doing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted in some newspapers some employer organisations, and some people accredited as spokespersons for the Opposition, saying that accord mark 6 as revised is too rigid, that it is a failure and that it should not go ahead. All I can say is that these people have very short memories indeed. The accord was revised two weeks ago in the wage-tax trade-off. This means that there is a 12-month wage pause in this country, a wage pause that would not have been able to be contrived by any other means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the metal trades industry, an important benchmark industry for the rest of the economy, the pause is from March 1990 to May 1991-a 14-month pause. The possibility of the wage-tax trade-off was, of course, brought about by the September quarter consumer price index, which was to be the indicator for the next wage increase. That has been bought out in a tax trade-off by the Government. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has agreed to that and we now have a 12 months wage pause which will lock in a lower level of inflation for the economy and ensure that Australia's inflation level is going down when the level of inflation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries is going up.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to put the advantages in context I have before me a copy of Syntec's corporate brief for December. It says of the wage-tax trade-off:</PARA>
<PARA>The September quarter CPI, and the way the Government has handled it, now amount to a circuit breaker of considerable promise. The extended nature of our recession will have the virtue of locking a lower wage/price trajectory into place.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to exaggerate the benefits that this would bring.</PARA>
<PARA>And further:</PARA>
<PARA>We now have a chance to settle into a wage/price setting roughly equivalent to the US, and hence a setting for profoundly lower interest rates, stronger market rates and sustained growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it ought to be said immediately that Syntec does not normally come out and praise the Government. Those words underline the benefit of the wage-tax trade-off. The wage-tax trade-off and the accord also mean that the next wage increase is on 16 May, which is $12 across the board to everyone. At average weekly earnings that is a 2 1/2 per cent increase, hardly what one might call a wages blow-out. As well, it provides for a 3 per cent increase in superannuation being taken in one per cent lots annually starting from 1 July 1991. That is 3 per cent over 3 1/2 years- hardly an unreasonable provision. Further, it provides for enterprise level negotiations for achieved productivity and profitability gains in that enterprise, which means that those wage increases will not increase unit labour costs.</PARA>
<PARA> All of that has been possible with the accord to achieve a very stable wage fixing environment in Australia, and at the same time to enable the very great progress that has been made in award restructuring to make Australian industry more efficient to continue. That award restructuring will put in place, when it is properly completed with workplace reform, a much more competitive economy. They are the advantages of the accord. They are not inflexible. They are of huge value to this economy.</PARA>

What is the Government's response to the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) at its eighteenth session in Perth this week calling on the Federal and Queensland governments to halt logging operations on Fraser Island and to proceed immediately with World Heritage nomination?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the resolution which the IUCN passed this week but, as Senator Reynolds would be aware, some time earlier this year the Queensland Government set in place a commission of inquiry to make recommendations on the conservation and management of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy region, and it appointed Mr Fitzgerald, QC, to head that up. I know that Mrs Kelly's Department has lodged a submission to that inquiry on the heritage values of the region and like all of us I anxiously await Mr Fitzgerald's finding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly the Government would like to work with the Queensland Government in any nomination of Fraser Island for World Heritage, and we will make a decision upon that as soon as Mr Fitzgerald has brought down his report. I hope that can be done as soon as possible, and I shall certainly check with Mrs Kelly, but I think the Government would be most reluctant to take action independently of the Queensland Government on this matter in the same way as we spent some time talking to the Western Australian Government before we nominated Shark Bay. We got there in the end and I hope we will get somewhere with Fraser Island as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we have been through this several times in here before. There was concern over time that people were going on to invalid pensions for reasons other than medical reasons and that perhaps when people were falling between categories, when it was becoming difficult to know exactly where they ought to be placed, too often the invalid pension was used. I think there were sufficient times when it was used inappropriately. So in looking at a review of disability support payments-and I might say reviews of that have been going on for six or seven years-it was clear to me that the best course of action to adopt was to ensure that an appropriate medical standard was used as the criterion for entry. That being the case, the Government looked at impairment levels which measure the level of dysfunction at a whole lot of percentages. In fact other departments made suggestions during those reviews and indeed during Cabinet discussions on what an appropriate impairment level might be. In the end we came down with 20 per cent. The discussions I have had with disabled organisations since the Budget-and they even included some yesterday-suggest to me that overall that has certainly been accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It concerns the damage to the environment caused by excessive public reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy. What is the Government doing to encourage society to utilise other sources of energy that are less damaging to the environment? Further, what research is being done in the field of alternative sources of energy that may facilitate a more rapid shift away from a reliance upon fossil fuels?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously fossil fuels and their use are at the forefront of the environmental debate around the world, not just in Australia. As a result of that worldwide debate and what I think was a very active debate within Australia in the past few years, in October this year the Government adopted an interim planning target to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions to 1988 levels by the year 2000 and to reduce emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a recognition of the significance of this greenhouse issue. It is also a clear declaration to all Australians that we will have to rationalise our use of fossil fuels. The Government has made it clear that the strategy for achieving the greenhouse target will be met not by cutting energy and other services but by satisfying such demands more efficiently and reducing waste. The targets should be achieved largely through energy conservation and efficiency and if we can achieve that we will be able to maintain or improve our position against trading partners in Europe which will obviously adopt these targets and will be working towards them. By improving the efficiency of industry, our trade competitiveness must be improved. A number of overseas countries are already reaping the benefits of their energy efficiency programs and there is an absolute need for Australia to join with them and put more effort into this aspect of energy use.</PARA>
<PARA> Within a fortnight of the Government's announcement of the target, the Government adopted a package as part of its national greenhouse response strategy. That package includes the development of an energy conservation information kit which will be distributed to every household in Australia. Energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings will be promoted through demonstration programs and the development of building codes. The Commonwealth itself will lead the way by upgrading energy management in its own operations, including an energy audit of the Commonwealth vehicle fleets, appointment of energy managers in government departments and authorities, and setting high energy efficiency requirements for government housing and commercial building leases. This initial effort is estimated to achieve $1 1/2 billion in annual average savings by 2005 and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14.2 million tonnes each year. Another package which will involve longer term measures is expected to be ready before the end of this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I noted the Minister's attendance at the Last Great Aussie Breakfast this morning, where he made a further significant announcement that package labelling would show clearly the country of origin of fresh food products. The Minister's announcements on labelling over the last week have been welcomed by all primary industry groups and will go some way to helping Australian growers and producers. But there is still the problem of consumers who wish to purchase Australian goods and cannot identify them on the shelves. Is the Minister aware that food imports increased by 12.8 per cent in October and now represent 12.7 per cent of the total current account deficit, and that these imports now cost Australia $2.134 billion per year? Will the Minister now give an assurance to growers and to Australian consumers that labelling laws in Australia will ensure that the country of origin will be shown on the front of the can or package in letters no less than five millimetres high so that Australian consumers can easily distinguish superior Australian products from inferior, subsidised and dumped foreign products?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for his question. He has taken a very keen interest in the matter of country of origin labelling. I have to acknowledge that, and do so quite freely. But I urge him to exercise a little caution in talking about the balance of payments in this context because, whilst it is true that we import some $2 billion worth of foodstuffs into this country, we export some $10 billion worth. Given the state of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round occurring at this very time, I think we have to keep that proportion in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that many orchardists and vegetable producers around Australia are suffering greatly because of the influx of imported food products. It is also true that Australian consumers are not always in a position to make choices which would benefit their fellow Australians on the land who are in the orchard or farming sectors because the information is not always presented to consumers, either as to the country of origin or in a way which is immediately accessible to them, to help to influence their choice.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell would know that I announced a little while ago that it will have to be signified on packages of imported juice that the particular juice being sold on the Australian market carries some imported ingredients. That is a very essential move to help to protect citrus growers, and we met some of the orange growers this morning. I am sure also that Senator Boswell has an interest in the pineapple industry in Queensland, as I do in the apple industry in Tasmania, and I am sure that those orchardists and producers would benefit from the juice market indicating truthfully the country of origin of the product which is being sold.</PARA>
<PARA> This morning I was also able to mention that I have urged all health Ministers around Australia to support, and the Commonwealth is certainly vigorously supporting, the idea that in the area of unpackaged food, fresh or frozen, coming into Australia-and I am referring to vegetables, fruit, fish products and nuts-there ought to be a clear indication of the country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, whilst New Zealand is in an exceptional position because of the closer economic relations it has with us, this would be of great advantage to consumers to enable them to make an informed choice, and it would be of particular advantage to those people engaged in fishing, in the orchards or on the land who are putting their own food products onto the Australian market in competition with overseas products.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Boswell asks particularly about the minimum print size that might be attached to such labels. At the moment it is thought by officials that 1.5 millimetres is sufficient. I have indicated that, in relation to health warnings on tobacco products, some four millimetres is required and for health warnings on other food products some three millimetres is required. Therefore, I have asked the Australian Food Standards Committee to look at this issue of the minimum size required and I have asked the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to liaise with Professor Tony Worsley of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, who is working on the benefits to consumers of food labelling information.</PARA>
<PARA> Those labelling size requirements are simply minimum size requirements. My plea is that producers of foodstuffs for the marketplace which contain Australian produce should of course label them `country of origin, produce of Australia' in much larger print to promote and encourage the consumption of Australian produce in the Australian marketplace.</PARA>

These issues were all dealt with at some length by the Hughes Committee which inquired into the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme, and the Government essentially adopted the recommendations of that committee. What this means, of course, is that available resources will be better concentrated and I remind Senator Harradine that in reaching this decision we also provided for trading houses or a consortia of small firms to apply for EMDGs. The strategy was to try to get small firms collaborating in export markets rather than trying to go out there on their own in a big market like the United States, where they inevitably get lost. So I do not know whether it bears disproportionately on States. I take it that the honourable senator has Tasmania in mind because, according to the implications of his question, it has a disproportionate number of small businesses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have consistently said, when we talk about lost time in industry, that lost time owing to accidents and disease in industry is the largest single factor. This question focuses on chemicals, which are a significant cause of accidents and disease in industry. Yes, in Victoria and in New South Wales there are investigations currently on foot. In Victoria a ministerial task force on the management of hazardous chemicals was set up in response to a fire at the V/Line, formerly VicRail, storage depot in Melbourne and, in New South Wales, the New South Wales Government chemical inquiry was set up in response to the liquid petroleum gas explosion at the Boral plant earlier this year. They are just two examples of the significance of chemicals in occupational health and safety and the sorts of problems that arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to the second part of the question, I can say that today the national workplace chemical safety plan was announced. It is a national management strategy for the use of chemicals at work. It is the first time that a national integrated approach has been developed to manage workplace handling of chemicals. The plan has four major elements: firstly, assessment; secondly, information and education; thirdly, control; and fourthly, emergency services. The assessment provision in the plan includes the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, known as NICNAS, which became law earlier this year. The information element features a new national public access database on chemicals in occupational health and safety. This is expected to be available in the middle of next year. The control element of the strategy centres on model regulations and a code of practice to control hazardous substances in the workplace. Those regulations were endorsed at yesterday's meeting of the National Commission in Canberra The emergency services component of the national strategy requires the placarding of chemical stores and the provision of a list and a plan of the location of hazardous substances.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Government's commitment to chemical safety, Worksafe Australia will fund four research projects at an estimated cost of $400,000. They will examine carbon monoxide, occupational asthma, bladder cancer and toxicity of solvents. The Government is confident that implementation of the strategy will have significant beneficial results for the health and safety of working men and women throughout Australia. Accidents involving chemicals occur almost every day in the Australian workplace.

<PARA> The primary issue is access to finance. The Government is concerned that all Australians are aware of their rights within the finance sector. Our programs in this area are directed towards the special needs of disadvantaged groups, including women. To this end Senator Tate could have mentioned, and I do so now, that the Government provides $1m a year for financial counselling. We run information seminars and provide information booklets. More particularly, Senator Tate is currently working with the States and Territories to introduce uniform credit legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that this particular issue is part of an overall problem. We must break down all the barriers to equal opportunity for women in the work force. Since assuming office we have introduced a number of measures, including a range of legislation, to deal with that particular problem-affirmative action, equal employment opportunity and sex discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also a special recognition of the role of women with families. To that extent we recognise the need for measures in this area. The establishment of the equal pay unit in the Department of Industrial Relations, together with the ratification of International Labour Organisation convention 156 on workers with family responsibilities, is geared towards addressing this problem. It has also been recently announced that the Office of the Status of Women, in close cooperation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, will undertake a research program to assist paid maternity leave. That will form the basis of developing future policy in this area. Finally, the Government recognises the problem. It is part of the overall problem of barriers to equal access in our community. We are taking measures to redress this inequality.</PARA>

On 4 December Senator McKiernan claimed that I was `offering Saddam Hussein a reward for invading a country and holding hostages'. Today Senator Crane said that he concurred with Senator McKiernan's comments. In my speech on 4 December I was referring to two of the contentious issues that Iraq cited as reasons for invading Kuwait but which I believe could be dealt with through negotiation to the satisfaction of both sides, which would not constitute rewarding Saddam Hussein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, on the islands issue, there is a useful precedent over the issue of two islands that block Iraq's access to the sea; that is, the Aland islands in the Baltic Sea which were the subject of a dispute between Finland and Sweden after the First World War. Instead of fighting, these two countries went to a third party-in this case the newly formed League of Nations-and their decision was to allow the Aland islands to remain under Finnish control, but they were to become a demilitarised zone, and they have remained so to this day. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a solution in the Gulf would give the islands, which are uninhabited, back to Kuwait as demilitarised zones with international guarantees, but would also give Iraq access to the sea without threat of interdiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem of unemployment among young Australians is one of the most important problems that this chamber can discuss and try to resolve. We know that it is an important matter because our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has consistently said so. He said so in his policy speech back in 1983 when he made a whole series of promises about what would be done about youth unemployment and how appalling the level of unemployment among our young people was at that time which, as the Senate remembers, was in the midst of the worst drought Australia had had for 50 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that point he lamented that one in four young Australians looking for work were unable to find work. That is the figure we are approaching now. He lamented that one in 10 Australians were out of work-`a figure no Australian would have believed possible a few years ago and which no Australian government should ever be forgiven for creating'. That is the figure we are approaching now under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only a little while ago that this Government was consistently crowing about the success of its policies-policies which were to bring down unemployment. We remember the Government after it was elected-having lamented the large number of Australians who were out of work, as we all did-saying that it would fix it up. This sort of headline dramatises how it did fix it up: `Public spending will double in creation of 70,000 jobs'. This Government bought its way out of unemployment. We said at the time that that was not the way to bring a lasting resolution to that problem. We said that it would not bring jobs that would last, and it has not. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we face the dreadful situation where Australia is going into a world recession-a world downturn-not coming out of its own serious problems, following a time of world boom, the most consistent run of dynamic world economic activity since the war. We have gone through that, and Australia is in a disastrous situation with, as Senator Richardson admitted the other day, unemployment among young people `rocketing up'. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1984, when talking about serious economic problems, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said there was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . none worse than the disastrous unemployment situation, particularly that facing young Australians. We placed the highest priority on tackling this problem. We believed then, as we do now, that levels of unemployment anything like those of the past couple of years cannot and should not be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> In consequence, we have developed policies directed at the promotion of sustained economic growth, which will lead to increased employment opportunities for all Australians, including young people. </PARA>
<PARA>We have had a one-third increase in youth unemployment in the latest available statistics. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Archer" NAMEID="IE4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And spent the money, as Senator Archer said. We have seen a one-third increase so far this year in youth unemployment, and the latest figures do not yet show the rocketing up that Senator Richardson has revealed from his weekly statistics which he kindly indicated to the Senate the other day. I commend him for doing that; for letting us know that the situation is, in fact, far worse than the latest official statistics reveal. In fact, at the end of November the number of people on unemployment benefit was 480,000. That is 34 per cent more than the number of people on unemployment benefit during the same month last year. A one-third rise in unemployment is almost unbelievable. It is an incredible rate of rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Government that although Mr Hawke was talking about how it was unsustainable and disgraceful that any government could have such a high level of unemployment, in only five months of all those years of the Fraser Government did the level of youth unemployment exceed the level that now exists in Australia, and that was after the worst drought in 50 years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a world recession. Of course, we are concerned about the unemployment of young people. That is why I have proposed the following matter of public importance today:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous impact on young Australians of the Hawke-Keating government's deliberately `engineered' recession which has already resulted in youth unemployment `rocketing up' with worse to come. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1983 when Mr Hawke, as Prime Minister, talked to the summit-the summit that was going to solve everything-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The raw statistics do not show what unemployment means in terms of the loss of human dignity and self respect. What it means in terms of the break up of families and the social alienation of one third of the best and brightest generation we have ever produced. What it means in terms of the defeat of human hope and the crushing of the human spirit. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is when it was unemployment that took place as a result of a disastrous drought, when the Fraser Government was in power. I wonder whether it still holds today. I wonder whether we will see Mr Hawke beating his breast and making the same sorts of statements about the one in four young people now unable to get jobs, clearly and certainly rising to something like one in three in coming months, as the school leavers find it very difficult to get jobs. We know that they will find it difficult to get jobs. Surveys have been done by a range of people. The Sydney Morning Herald, only last week, ran a page one story which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The job outlook for the 54,000 school-leavers in NSW is so grim that they were advised yesterday to delay their post-HSC holidays and apply for work before the traditional January rush. </PARA>
<PARA> Latest Federal Government figures show the jobs slump is continuing with the number of skilled vacancies dropping to a near seven-year low. The number of skilled vacancies has dropped by a half in the past year. </PARA>
<PARA> The big employers are cutting back. Major banks will curb their intake of school-leavers, with the Commonwealth Bank slashing recruitment by 1,500 this summer. </PARA>
<PARA> The retail industry has been reducing staff and offers few job prospects. The outlook for graduates is also poor. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet we noted, at the time that the Prime Minister was telling us how he was going to fix up unemployment in Australia, that he was going to say that his sound economic policies were an essential part of the longer term response to youth unemployment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are particularly concerned that the programs, the majority of which are aimed at young people, should be both comprehensive and integrated. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Prime Minister talking just six years ago. How integrated and effective have the programs been? Later in this debate Senator Vanstone will deal with the incompetence and the collapse of these nonsensical programs which simply have not worked. One can see that they have not worked from the disastrous--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; And at great cost, as we can see. Mr Hawke, in those days, went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past two years the youth employment situation has been exacerbated by a serious fall in the number of apprenticeships becoming available. </PARA>
<PARA>Has he had a look at what is happening with apprenticeships these days? This Government has, in fact, largely as a result of its wages policies, priced young Australians who are trying to learn skills out of jobs. Not having a training wage is a madness at a time like this; at a time when so many employers are finding it so difficult to keep their doors open, let alone to take on more young people. </PARA>
<PARA> When I raised this problem-which was self-evident, I must say to the Minister-a couple of months ago in this chamber, he took the question seriously and answered it on the basis of advice. He told me that his advice was that the situation was trending down. On the ground, that was simply self-evidently not so. That is why I raised it at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I had been going around the Illawarra region, particularly in Wollongong itself, talking to unemployed youth; talking to the employers who are unable to take people on; talking to all those people in the Commonwealth Employment Service, for example, who have to deal with this mounting and disastrous problem. I was told then-this was back in September and October-that the unemployment situation was, to use the word that the Minister likes, `rocketing'. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, this week's Illawarra Mercury at last reveals the official statistics from that time-this was the time that the Minister was saying the figures were trending down. That is almost like Mr Keating saying everything is on track; it is going to be a soft landing; there is not going to be a recession. At the same time Mr Keating was saying that sort of thing, we had Senator Richardson saying, `Don't worry, the figures are trending down'. On the ground they were not. </PARA>
<PARA> These statistics from the Illawarra region, at the very time the Minister was saying they were trending down, revealed that Illawarra's youth unemployment rate had rocketed to 28.4 per cent, which is almost double the New South Wales average. Maybe I was seeing the worst end of it, but the fact was that on the ground one could see that trend. One could see what was happening. What bothers me is whether this Government really does have its finger on the pulse; whether it has been in office so long that it is right out of touch with what is happening. Before the six weeks about which the Minister said, `In the last six weeks the figures have rocketed up', in the Illawarra region the unemployment rate for young people was already 28.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the unemployment figure has rocketed up since then, clearly about one in three young Australians will not be able to find a job. That is an absolute disaster. I want to hear whether the Prime Minister will now adopt the same note of concern that he expressed for political purposes in 1983 when his policies have brought about this kind of disaster. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Walters says, they have been brought about deliberately. I must admit that, when Mr Keating said that there was no recession, that there would be a soft landing and that everything was on track and when Senator Richardson said that the figures were trending down, I had assumed that this was on the basis of sound advice and that they knew what they were doing. Maybe it was a charitable view. The fact is that if that was their advice, if that is all that they knew, no wonder the policies they have been implementing have brought about such disaster. They have consistently been the wrong policies at the wrong time bringing about the wrong results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policies of those opposite, their refusal either to face the reality or, even worse, not even to know what is going on on the ground, have resulted in a continuation of the wrong policies, which have clearly brought about this disaster in unemployment. Those opposite cannot blame anyone else-they cannot blame the rest of the world. This is a home-grown recession that Mr Keating is proudly prepared to claim he engineered. It is the young people who are in the front line of his engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent to which the young people are in the firing line is evident from the latest break-up of the age groups of Australians who are out of work. These figures go back all the way to August, when about 441,000 people were on unemployment benefits. The situation is now far worse. As Senator Richardson concedes, those figures are now rocketing upwards. Forty per cent of those 441,000 people on unemployment benefits were aged under 25 years; in other words, people between the ages of 16 and 24 made up the 40 per cent. The 35 to 65 age group totalled only 150,000. The unemployment is concentrated at the young end; it affects the young people of Australia. People under the age of 25 made up 40 per cent of the people on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of future is this Government giving the young people? These figures appeared before unemployment started rocketing. This is an interesting situation as this figure-the huge proportion of unemployed being made up largely of young people-has rocketed despite the extraordinary efforts and, in some cases, dramatically successful efforts of the Government to reduce the number of young people available on the work market. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly do not criticise the Government for its programs to encourage young people to develop greater skills. In fact, I am all in favour of it. The Government has been very successful in encouraging people to stay on at school. After all, if one cannot get a job there is not much point leaving school anyway. Despite the fact that the Government has been successful in getting people to stay at school, there have been dramatic rises in unemployment figures. Despite the fact that last year's retention rate at schools was about double what it was in 1982, there is this huge increase in the unemployment of young people. In 1982 there were about 90,000 students in year 12. Last year there were almost 170,000 students in year 12-just about double. The Government has managed to cope with that part of the problem quite successfully. But despite all the schemes, the gimmicks and the dollars being thrown at the problem, it is now worse than it was during almost all the time of the Fraser Government. As I said, only in five months of seasonally adjusted figures were there worse youth unemployment figures under Fraser than have been generated now by this Government's deliberate policy. </PARA>

Only in the last five months of the Fraser Government did we have these high figures-figures which this Government is not only getting all by its own work but has also engineered, brought about deliberately. That is the sin; that is the appalling legacy of this Government: it has deliberately set out to engineer a recession-in the Treasurer's words-where the people in the front line, the people suffering most, are the young people. That is the Government's sin; that sin will be brought home to it over and over again. When those opposite say things like, `Don't worry, things are trending down. Don't worry, there will be a safe landing' the Australian people, particularly the young people, will know that they can never believe them again. It is the young people who are in the firing line; they are suffering as a result of these deliberate policies. And these policies must end.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note this passionate appeal to the youth of Australia to vote Liberal. I note, in particular, this passionate appeal to the unemployed youth of Australia: `Vote Liberal-we'll look after you'. What Senator Michael Baume neglects to talk about-what he and his colleagues now run from every day-is that great promise to cut out unemployment benefits after nine months. They will not talk about what will happen to the unemployed after nine months. Under a Liberal government, if people are young and unemployed, they will fend for themselves; there will be no government policy for them; they will find out how to live on the streets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously it will always be difficult to explain to Australia why an economic slowdown or indeed a recession occurs. There will never be applause for explaining it. Nonetheless, explanations are obviously called for. The difficulty that the Australian economy faced a year or two ago was that spending was far outstripping production. No-one responsible in politics believes that he or she can simply play for the applause of the crowd and ignore the problem. Had this Government chosen to ignore the problem, all we would have done was pass on a much worse situation to be dealt with by our children. We would have simply passed on to future generations our lack of responsibility. We would have left them with a poisoned inheritance. That is something that the Australian Labor Party just would not do. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a year or so back, spending was running at a growth of 9.1 per cent and gross domestic product (GDP) at 4.2 per cent. We cannot have a 4.9 per cent gap between the two for very long. In the end, while using management policy, while using high interest rates to slow down that spending, we have to look at the whole context of this recession-declining inflation, a current account that is coming down, an historically high profit share, low real unit labour costs, a competitive exchange rate, declining interest rates, a very large Budget surplus, investment running at well above the average for the last 25 years. When we address long term structural problems, we do not get solutions overnight. There are no easy answers. The easy answers proffered by the false prophets will be seen through very quickly by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> There cannot be any comparison, given that declining inflation, given that declining debt, given that competitive exchange rate and the other things I just mentioned, between this situation and that in 1982-83. We do not have an economy that is out of control because all those factors are in place. In 1982-83 employment fell by 2.6 per cent over five consecutive quarters. We are a long way from that. In that recession private business investment fell by 20 per cent. Both inflation and unemployment were at double figures. It is only a couple of weeks since we were able to demonstrate that inflation in this country is now at 6 per cent and falling as against 11 per cent and rising when Senator Michael Baume and his colleagues left office. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that, in 1982-83, 90-day bank bills peaked at an interest rate of 22 per cent. This time they peaked at 18 per cent, and, since then, they have gone down by 5 per cent. There are just no comparisons between the two when we look behind them. The Budget was in deficit when we came to office in 1982-83 to the tune of 2.6 per cent of GDP. We have turned that around to where this year we announced our fourth consecutive surplus-four in a row. Our surpluses are far greater than the Fraser-Howard deficits. What is more the Opposition has the hide to get up here today still without any wages policy. Just remember what happened the last time the Opposition actually had a wages policy. In 1982-83 there was a massive wages explosion, wages totally out of control. All around the country wage outcomes of 13 per cent, 14 per cent, 15 per cent, were being announced on a daily basis. There is absolutely no comparison between the situation today and the one then. What is the Opposition's prescription? As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said yesterday in another place, it is scorched earth. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition sits up there with a lightning rod to scorch the economy to earth. </PARA>
<PARA>With the economy already in recession, the Opposition proposes to slash $3 billion off government expenditure and those opposite still do not have a wages policy. What effect will that slashing of government expenditure have on the level of economic activity? What do honourable senators think that will do to the level of unemployment in Australia? All the Opposition can do is to propose to make it worse and, while making it worse, to rip the unemployment benefit out of the hands of the unemployed after nine months. That kind of prescription is all about disaster. It harks back to what the ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs Thatcher, tried to do. She has gone and has left Britain with inflation at 11 per cent, wages outcomes of between 15 per cent and 19 per cent, productivity at between 1 1/2 per cent and 2 per cent and manufacturing devastated. That is what the Liberal Party of Australia would once again attempt to do to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this question of youth unemployment that Senator Michael Baume has raised today. Strong employment growth has been one of the hallmarks of the Hawke Government. More than 1 1/2 million jobs have been created during that first seven years and young people fortunately were benefiting from that growth. The Government was able to oversee a period where 70,000 new jobs were created for people aged between 15 years and 19 years. When the Government came to office the unemployment rate for that group was 24.3 per cent. </PARA>

The teenage full time unemployment growth now stands at 20.8 per cent as compared to that under the previous Government at 24.3 per cent. We have to take into account the extraordinary difference that exists between now and then, in participation rates of those who have been staying in education longer and the pathetically low retention rates in the years of the Fraser Government. The number of 18-year-olds to 20-year-olds in receipt of unemployment benefits was 73,500 in August of 1990. That is about the level recorded in the late 1970s when it was between 65,000 and 75,000. It is well below the peak, I might say, of 127,600 that we inherited in February 1983. In September, 7 1/2 per cent of the teenage population was unemployed and seeking a full time job. That is a considerable improvement from the 12 1/2 per cent that we inherited when we came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the real change has occurred in education and I suspect that is the reason for the difference in the figures. Australia had always lagged behind its trading partners in education retention rates, whether we looked at Japan, Europe or the United States. Australia always lagged behind. Those seven years of Fraser and Howard saw nothing to change that- no initiatives, nothing; just simply ignored. More teenagers now are combining education with part time work, with teenage part time employment up by 128,000 or 81.8 per cent. These are figures that Senator Michael Baume neglected to mention. During the period from 1980 to 1990, the teenage full time education participation rate has increased to 57.4 per cent, up 14 per cent in just seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> The year 12 retention rate has increased from 37 1/2 per cent when we came to office to 60.3 per cent now. They are the real successes of Labor in government: giving young people a proper education, having them stay at school longer and getting through, giving them that real chance to get a job when they leave. Between 1989 and 1993, about 70,000 additional places for Australian students will be funded by this Government. Look at Austudy: an increase of over 95 per cent in the number of students receiving income support since we came to government. Not only did we provide extra places for a better educated work force, particularly amongst the young, important as that is, but we also made sure that they were getting income support while they were studying. These things were unheard of in any previous era. Since 1983 apprenticeship intakes have risen by nearly 50 per cent. Senator Michael Baume was talking about apprenticeship intakes and about how bad they were going. I want to repeat that statistic: since 1983 apprentice intakes have risen by nearly 50 per cent to an annual level of more than 60,000. That is the record. You might not like the record but that is the record. The Government has obviously been successful in raising the level of participation of young people in eduction, especially in the later years at school. </PARA>

<PARA> We made sure that it did not stop there. In the 1989-90 Budget the Government announced a package of social justice initiatives costing $100m over four years to assist homeless and disadvantaged youth. These initiatives provide greatly enhanced assistance for young people in terms of not only income support but also housing, the labour market, education and health. In the portfolio of Social Security, those measures include a 17 per cent increase in the rate of the young homeless allowance from $81.40 a week to $95.10 a week and automatic indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> When one mentions indexation and this great concern of the Liberal Party for the young of Australia, whatever happened to the indexing of child payments under a Liberal-National administration? It was simply never done. It took a Labor government to introduce indexation of those payments. Thank God we were around to do it. It took a Labor government to introduce an independent rate of Job search allowance for young people who have demonstrated long term independence from their parents; it took a Labor government to reduce the youth homeless allowance waiting period from six to two weeks, accompanied by the abolition of the waiting period for young people who leave home because of domestic violence or those kinds of exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the prescriptions for looking after those who have become unemployed? Of course, the messages from the Opposition on this question have been pretty difficult to read in recent times. They come and they go with the blowing of every wind. Here we have an Opposition coming in here today pretending to care, pretending to be concerned and to have some sort of prescription for the future. I think we ought to go back to what Dr Hewson has said in recent times. Not only does Dr Hewson want to do away with the Department of Social Security, he also wants to do away with the Department of Employment, Education and Training-the two departments that most affect the people we are talking about this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA> If we want to judge how the Opposition would really go in government, we need only look at 1982-83 when not only were the numbers so high in respect of unemployment-so much higher than they are now-not only was inflation out of control and not only was the deficit out of control but also the then coalition Government slashed the payments to those in trouble who were relying on social security. We can see what the coalition did when it had the chance to deliver the goods. Despite a savage recession, the Liberal-National Party chose a deliberate policy to cut in real terms assistance to the poor, the unemployed, the youth, the pensioners and, of course, the single parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has now promised to do it again. It has promised once again that, if it is given the mantle of leading this country, it will once again hit the poor; it will once again cut the benefits to all those who need them. One might as well hark back to the Depression of the 1930s when one thinks of the way that this current Opposition would behave. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that the Opposition's general direction and its lack of a wages policy are going to lead to a greater reliance on a policy of high unemployment. Agencies like the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the St Vincent de Paul Society are predominantly urban based. Yet, Senator Alston would have them deliver social security payments. The only reality of that is that if one is a young unemployed person in the bush, look out.

<PARA> We are told that recession is now official and that unemployment is expected to continue to rise. While that is most edifying, I think there are not many people in Australia who did not know that and who needed the time of this chamber to be taken to become fully informed in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> What we heard in response from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was a set of indicators, a set of figures. As far as I am concerned, one can use all the statistics one likes. It can be contended that 20.8 per cent of teenagers are unemployed and that that is better than 24 per cent or some other such figure. It can be contended that 73,500 people are now defined as being in receipt of unemployment benefit and that that is better than the 127,600 people who were in receipt of the unemployment benefit in February 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister quite rightly said, the education retention rate has changed these figures. What does that mean? As far as I am concerned, that means that the unemployment situation has in fact been delayed and that there is a wave yet to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that that is all too evident, but it seems to have escaped the attention of the Government, which is trotting out a set of figures in an attempt to dismiss the concerns of the Opposition. The Australian Democrats contend that this Government and the Opposition are both using the wrong tools to measure what is happening in society. The tools that have been trotted out today on both sides are debatable: the accent that is put on the tools of measurement and the interpretations that can be derived from those tools are all debatable. Even while we continue to measure our society's well-being in terms of things such as gross domestic product and percentages of unemployment and employment participation rates, these sorts of things are not much use when we are measuring our society's well-being; they are not much use when we want to debate the welfare of our people. We are not measuring the status of our resources, our real social prosperity in this country. With these tools we have only an inadequate representation of what is actually happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is actually happening was demonstrated to us this morning outside Parliament House. A group of citrus growers were telling us what was happening. They did not need percentages, tools, retention factors and all that sort of nonsense. They were able to tell us straight out in black and white that all was not well in their industry. They were able to tell us that we have been exporting the jobs, the employment prospects, of people in their industry. In our primary industry we have allowed the influx of foreign products to such an extent that the jobs in fruit picking, fruit processing, transport of the processed product and retailing are now in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has put forward the idea that the engineered recession is responsible for the employment situation in Australia. I contend that it is a whole range of policies and not just that particular area which is responsible. In fact, it is our attitude, the misguided, misconceived commitment to the free trade philosophy, which is shared by both sides. I contend that many factors are responsible for the unemployment situation in Australia. It is about time we changed our attitude towards a number of things if we are really interested in ensuring a future for our young people. It is important to demonstrate this by using the tools-as much as I do not like to use them-which have been used in the discussion so far to indicate how extensive that is. There are about 150,000 school leavers expected nationally, but about 240,000 people are expected to leave all forms of education next year. That is the wave which has been caused by this retention rate. Senator Michael Baume has described this as a disaster and he will get no disagreement from us on that, but we disagree with the Opposition's contention that this is all due to economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to redefine and reassess what is work. It is all very well to say that a person who is unemployed is somebody who does not have work, but if we redefine it and begin to value socially useful work, if we encourage youth to experience and to learn, and if we are able to give youth meaningful work instead of a sense of worthlessness, we might be able to engender the sort of self-esteem that is necessary for people to contribute to our society in a worthwhile sense. If we looked at and valued our human resources, if we devised tools that were able to measure our human resources as a country, we would not then discount and insult our unemployed people. We would not see them just as a side issue, as people to be discarded. We would rightly see them as victims of our present employment attitudes. If we valued these citizens, we would then be able to harness their energies and talents to improve this country's well-being, and that is surely what we are on about. Surely we are not-I would hope not-just concerned with scoring points from the other side of the political debate. I hope that we are not just interested in embarrassing the Government over the disastrous position in which our young unemployed find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were honestly concerned with the well-being of our young people, we would be measuring their talents and putting them to work. We would not be confining them within schemes and programs and within bureaucratic paradigms which do not allow them to engage in alternative forms of work which are equally valuable to society. My notice of motion earlier today sought to congratulate the Sheffield Women's Shared Workspace on its initiative and success in achieving employment opportunities for seven people in the town of Sheffield in Tasmania-an area with very high unemployment. That area has benefited from an enlightened set of initiatives which has brought to that area work which would otherwise not be there. This has come about through the imagination and initiative of a group of people who have refused to be written off as unemployed or unemployable and have been able to create their own answer to the situation which has been imposed on them. We should take their example and follow it more closely throughout Australia. I understand that there are many other examples of such activity through Australia, but there is not enough effort in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> So often the support schemes which enable people at least to get a start are removed-both by this Government and by the policies espoused by the Opposition. It is necessary before people are able to work in a cooperative or work together at least to have the notion that their presence is valued by our society-that the nation as a whole values them and the contribution which they could make. To write them off to fend for themselves, as might be proposed by the Opposition, is such an insult that it is almost a self- fulfilling prophesy. To restrict, restrain and confine such people within the framework of the bureaucracies which have grown under this Government is equally stultifying. We propose the opposite of that. We seek to value people for their presence in society and for their potential rather than their situation as measured by an inadequate set of tools, about which I spoke earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing to come in here and listen to an argument about a set of opposing contentions and constructions placed on figures derived from perhaps different sources, with different interpretations being placed upon them, rather than to see imaginative initiatives brought forward which might actually make progress. We hear that the Opposition proposes to cut $2 billion off Government spending, but the Opposition has never actually said where it would cut it. I suspect immediately that those sorts of cuts would impinge on the ability of young people to survive the process of transition from school to employment. It would impinge on their ability to assess their position and come up with employment-creating initiatives while they make the transition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's contention that a highly educated set of young people is more able to deal with life and becoming employed is not debatable. It is a fact that education is extremely valuable. It cannot be contended that it is not. I would repeat that merely increasing the retention rate over the last couple of years is not something to be particularly thrilled about, unless the Government has been able to demonstrate that upon leaving education-no matter how much further it is extended--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this afternoon a matter of public importance-and indeed it is just that-put forward by Senator Michael Baume from New South Wales; namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The disastrous impact on young Australians of the Hawke-Keating government's deliberately `engineered' recession which has already resulted in youth unemployment `rocketing up' with worse to come. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the most important topics that this chamber could be debating and we seem to agree on that. The worst kind of unemployment one can have is youth unemployment-when our future nation comes out of school and says, `I have got no hope; I can't get a job'. So we all agree on that. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard ad infinitum from Government members when they took office in 1983 what a bad job the Fraser Government had done; how it had not coped with the recession properly and how young Australians were out of jobs and had no hope. What Senator Baume is pointing out is that we are back in that position. We have been on a long circuitous route where some things have been achieved, but not much-a lot of things have been left untouched-but youth unemployment is heading back to where it was at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to know what the Government is going to do about this. We have seen attempts by the Government to do something about youth unemployment, as Senator Baume said. Some of us will remember the Priority One: Young Australia scheme launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in a much vaunted bolt of publicity in 1985. I certainly hope it is not that that Senator Crowley thinks is funny. It was such an unmitigated disaster for young Australians that I do not think it is funny. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal first with the remarks of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). What he tried to say was: `Look, here are all these economic indicators and we are doing so well'. Recently I distributed a paper to the business community around Australia showing that on about 10 key economic indicators we were worse off than the six Asian countries that when I was at school were regarded as developing nations that needed our help. On each of those 10 economic indicators we were at the bottom. So it is head in the hand stuff to quote selected figures and pretend, as the Minister did, that things are going well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even more head in the hand stuff to try to do that when the Government says, `We have got a recession'. We have known for many months that Australia has a recession, but now the Government is finally forced to admit it. Yet, the Minister comes in and says, `In the course of this Government all these good things have occurred and you should all be grateful. Aren't you lucky to have us? Aren't you lucky to have the recession you needed to have?' But he did not tell us what to say to young Australians who have just finished their exams. What are we going to ask them over the Christmas break-`How is your job hunting going'? That is not a question I am going to ask. I do not want to muck up people's Christmas by reminding them of the difficulties they are going to face in January and February in getting a job. I do not want to politicise Christmas by saying, `It is the fault of this rotten, lousy Labor Government that I hope you do not vote for next time'. It is better to leave that question until January and February and then do what we can to help them. What we would like to know is what the Government is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the matters that we hear over and over again in this chamber as the Government still tries to pretend that the economy is in good order. Day after day Senator Cook tells us how industrial disputes are down under this Government. He picks selected figures to say how bad they were under the Fraser Government. But what he does not tell us is that the biggest drop in the days lost through industrial disputes over the last decade was the drop between 1981 and 1982; namely, in the final real year of the Fraser Government. He neglects to mention that. The figures were reasonably constant for a period after that. It is true that there was a further drop in 1983 when this Government took office, but not a substantial drop after that, and they have remained pretty constant. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest drop in the level of industrial disputation on a days lost basis occurred in 1981-82 under Fraser, but this Government does not want to tell us that. It wants to pretend that it is all a consequence of its own doing. It pretends that the real reduction in days lost is a function of the accord. The Government says, `Now that we have got the accord and we know how to manage things, we do not have industrial disputes'. But it does not say why that is the case. It is the case because the unions learnt to their cost, and to the cost of many young Australians who were tipped out of work, what happens to the number of jobs available when industrial disputation is too high. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear how well inflation is supposedly going under this Government, but we are not reminded that it has been stubbornly above the 7 per cent mark and only very recently falling down to six. Labor's accord that Senator Cook berates this chamber with so much has simply been unable to fulfil Mr Keating's promise of 3 to 4 per cent inflation in 1990-a promise that is now conveniently forgotten. The fact is that our performance on inflation has been consistently worse than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, and that says something to school leavers. It says that we are not performing as well other OECD countries and they would have a better chance if they were somewhere else. It used to be the case that one could say to young Australians, `This is the lucky country. You have got a better chance here than you would have anywhere else'. One could have said that with respect to a lot of opportunities in many areas. But regrettably one cannot do so now. </PARA>
<PARA> In March this year Mr Hawke was asked this question by a journalist:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the economy facing a rise in unemployment as a result of the economy contracting?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke replied:</PARA>
<PARA>No, not a rise in unemployment . . . You can have a situation where you can have a slowing down in growth without necessarily a rise in unemployment . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he said that we were not going to have a rise in unemployment. The journalist pursued the matter and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . keep the unemployment rate around that 6 per cent mark then?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke replied:</PARA>
<PARA>That's what we would be aiming at, about that order. </PARA>
<PARA>Since March 1990, the unemployment rate, in seasonally adjusted terms, has risen from 6.1 to 7.4 per cent and, as Senator Baume says, it is on the way up. We want to hear what the Government is going to do about that as it impacts on young Australians and their job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister was very keen to talk about the rise in the level of investment in Australia and what the Government has done, in his view, to create more jobs for young Australians. What, of course, he does not tell us is that the investment in tradeables as a percentage of gross domestic product-that is generally the manufacturing area-has gone down consistently under this Government since 1986-87; and that the investment in finance, business and property services-not the areas where there are jobs and where manufacturing is going to produce goods that we can export-has gone up. I think the Minister would do well to give a more frank and full account of what has happened to the economy under his Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to what this Government might be thinking of doing in relation to youth unemployment. I will do so by harking back to the Priority One scheme that I mentioned earlier. We might all remember seeing the advertisements which said that the traineeships provided a brighter future for young Australia. We had billboards all across the nation with Mr Hawke's face smiling down at us, with young Australians all smiling away, saying `Youth of Australia: Priority No. 1'. Honourable senators probably all remember-I am sure that Senator Crowley does-that the billboards did not carry a telephone number that one could ring to find out how one could get a job under this program. There was nothing concrete to help one get a job; there were just big advertisements of the Prime Minister with young Australians. </PARA>

A promise about youth unemployment and what the Government will do about it, a promise for 75,000 traineeships in the bicentennial year and an achievement now of only 13,000 comes out at about 18 per cent, which is less than 20c in the dollar. I would not invest in a company that had that kind of reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister went much further than just giving a hint of 75,000 in the bicentennial year. He went on to say that there were only 2,300 in the year the thing was started, in 1985. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we really believe that come the beginning of the 1990s-</PARA>
<PARA>and that was not very far away; it was 1987 when he said this, and the trouble with saying things about the future is that it comes around-</PARA>
<PARA>we ought to have been able to eliminate unemployment as it's developed in the 16 and 17-year-old group . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is a bit like saying that no child will be living in poverty by 1990. That is what the Prime Minister said, that by the beginning of the 1990s-not very far away-the Government would have been able to eliminate unemployment in the 16-and 17-year-old age group. It is an absolute disgrace that the aspirations of young Australians were raised in that way and not delivered on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's record in this area is not that good. The schemes that it has had to do something have not worked. It is all very well for the Government to come here and say, `You have a lightning rod and you are going to scorch the earth'. That is not my view about what will happen when we will get into government. I believe that if we had a more deregulated labour market where people could actually negotiate on their own behalf and if we allowed young people to use their own wits to get out there and get a job with the hours and conditions very largely that they wanted-over and above a minimum rate being set-many more young Australians would have jobs and the economy would be much better off. I invite Australians to put the Opposition to the test. We will soon be kicked out and will not last more than one term if we have a scorched earth impact. There is no worry about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations at the time, Mr Willis, said that traineeships would halve youth jobless. That is one of the promises made by this Government-that it would halve youth jobless-and it just did not happen. We had Senator Cook, who now berates people in this chamber at length-and I will not go into why he does so-telling us that this promise of 75,000 traineeships by the bicentennial year was `assigned the highest priority by the Government'. The highest priority that the Government had it failed to achieve. Heaven knows what happened to things at the bottom of the Government's list of priorities. Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a program led by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and supported by a task force of members of Cabinet comprising the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Youth Affairs, Mr Dawkins; the Minister for Education, Senator Susan Ryan; and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Ralph Willis. </PARA>
<PARA>All these people, with the exception of Senator Susan Ryan, are still there. It was a high level Cabinet task force dealing with the Government's No. 1 highest priority and the Government simply could not deliver. Senator Cook went on to say that he thought certain things indicated that `even when unemployment falls to 5 per cent'-and there is not a hope in Hades of that happening in the next couple of years- `youth unemployment is still likely to be well over 10 per cent'. History will show whether he is right in that respect, but history has shown that the Priority One scheme was a disastrous failure. I have a cartoon prepared by the Adelaide Advertiser showing Bob Hawke sitting at a desk with the spiky hairdo that punks have, filing his nails with a rasp. It is headed, `Priority Two: Youth of Australia. Don't call us. We'll call you'. They are still waiting, half a decade on, for the call and the queues are getting bigger. We need to have some explanation of what this Government will do. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest anyone thinks that this is just carping criticism of an imaginative plan put forward by the Government, I invite them to turn to an article in the Australian Financial Review of January 1987 which is headed, `Helping the Class of `86'; they could take out elements of this and reprint the article as `Helping the Class of `90', because they are in the same boat half a decade later. That article said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our young people should not be victims of another Priority One disappointment.</PARA>
<PARA>We come back to the question raised by Senator Baume. The recession that this Government engineered and said that we needed to have is tipping people out of jobs and tipping young Australians out of opportunities. The Government refuses to accept the need to deregulate the labour market and has not done a whole lot of other things that it needs to do to get the economy going. That means that school leavers will not be able to get jobs. The hopes and aspirations of young Australians are just dashed in the egotistical overconfidence of this Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the blind stupidity of his Government colleagues in following his path. It is vitally important that something be done about youth unemployment in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to what Senator Vanstone's suggestions are in my own way. One thing which is very clear is that when we came to government there was very high unemployment, and that included very high youth unemployment. The Government set out a number of programs and implemented them to address youth unemployment. Minister Richardson said, and I would say, that youth unemployment is slowly rising. It is rising at a rate which is sad and very disappointing, but it is not as high as the honourable senator said. It is a matter of grave concern and I would have thought that people can take considerable comfort from this Government's commitment to do things to address the problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to use my time to make clear this Government's commitment to young people. That is essentially what we are talking about. It is not right for Opposition senators to skip over the Government's commitments to education and to young people. Young people in our society are better able because they have had the opportunity of tertiary training, because they have stayed on in school until year 12, because 60 per cent, not 30 per cent, of young Australians are completing year 12, and precisely because of Government policies to encourage them to do that. Honourable senators opposite cannot say that unemployment is down because people are in education and dismiss that as though it were a kind of fudge by the Government. The Government is committed to having young people in education. If that brings down unemployment figures, well and good. I cannot think of a better reason than that they are in school for people not to be in the unemployed figures. </PARA>

What is important is that all of them together provide a package of commitment to young people which is very different from the situation that confronted the Government when we came into office in 1983. Young people now have an opportunity for education through school, tertiary training and apprenticeships, and for those young unemployed people who continue to fall outside these mainstream arenas, there are traineeships and job start and new start programs. Those programs are in place. They will not go away. They are there to assist if they are needed at this time. They are not gimmicks; they are absolute commitments to young people. I noticed that Senator Michael Baume commented that he did not want to oppose that commitment to education. I think we concur entirely on that point and it is more important to concur on the commitment to young people. In the past they may have felt that they were forgotten, overlooked or ignored, but that is not the case now.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I wish to address in particular the claims by Senator Vanstone and Senator Michael Baume concerning the traineeships and the level of apprenticeships. Senator Michael Baume wanted to say that the numbers of apprenticeships were falling. The facts are that since 1983 apprenticeship numbers in this country have risen by nearly 50 per cent to an annual level of more than 60,000. That is another area that the Government has taken very seriously. The drop in the number of young people who were able to get apprenticeships was very frightening. Indeed, the consequences of that dropping off of apprenticeships in the late 1970s and early 1980s meant that there was a huge number of untrained people in this country, and it takes five or 10 years before that kind of apprenticeship pick-up can happen. At the time there was a demand for skilled labour, and Australia had unemployed people without the skills. Immigration programs were set in place to bring skilled labour into this country because the Government had overlooked the opportunity of skilling its own young people. This Government has been committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships very dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the other things which the Opposition has not wanted to address in looking at these figures is the very dramatic increase in the number of young women in the work force. Women are now taking the opportunity of going through to year 12 and going on to college, university and apprenticeships. They are now also enjoying prospects of training in non-traditional areas. I have had the pleasure and the privilege of being involved-more at the presentation stage than the hard work stage, but I am pleased to say I am interested to be involved and continue to support this not only in my own State but in other States as well-in programs conducted by the office of employment and training in conjunction with the Federal Government to encourage young women to take up apprenticeship opportunities in non-traditional areas. That whole question of apprenticeship training is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia there is a program called `Women on the move', and those women who have already succeeded in training in non-traditional areas are actually taking the message to young women of the exciting opportunities for employment in non-traditional areas. It does not quite go to the point that Senator Bell raised but at least it is of very clear relevance. Senator Bell wanted to suggest-I wanted to make this point in passing-that jobs are being lost in the agricultural area. That has been going on for 150 years and I sincerely hope Senator Bell is not suggesting that we revert to employing more people in the agricultural sector. A mark of the success of this country has been the fewer people it has needed in agricultural areas to produce more food more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Bell wants to say that there are specific problems in the citrus area and is suggesting that they are new problems, all I can say is that the honourable senator has not been talking to people who have been growing citrus for the last 10 or even 15 years. I suspect, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you would be one of the people in this chamber who does know that this is not a new problem. It is somewhat cyclical, but it is certainly not new and that is the challenge for citrus growers in this country. The complaints they are making now are no different from the complaints that they have been making for 10 to 15 years. They were justifiable then and they are justifiable now. I do not want to dismiss their complaints at all, but they are not new. There have been challenges to that part of the agricultural industry for a long time. Certainly, it is an industry that provides employment for those people living in citrus growing areas and it also provides seasonal work for some young people. While we would be pleased that young people in this country could take up those kinds of seasonal work job opportunities, they are not the sorts of jobs that this Government is principally committed to. That is not to say that we would not be pleased that young people could have those job opportunities, but the whole thrust of our policies has been to say to young people, `You have skills and talents. They will be much better if you are trained through apprenticeships, universities and colleges, through the technical and further education (TAFE) sector or the traineeship scheme. We do not want to waste your talents, we want to talk with you and point you to those training programs through social security and unemployment benefit payments. Young people of Australia, this Government cares about you'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of grave concern that some young people are now finding it harder to get jobs. It is certainly my hope, as I am sure it is of everybody on the Government side, that the loss of prospects of employment is only brief for anybody in Australia, but certainly for our young people. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, outlined the economic challenges for this country. There is no way that we can deny those figures and we do not. But we certainly say that the programs for young people in this country are in place, they have been established by this Government over the last seven years, they are in place and they will be there to serve the youth of Australia in this difficult period of unemployment if some people find that they now need those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Senator Vanstone's cracks about the Australian traineeship scheme, it is true that the figure is now 45,500. I do not believe Senator Vanstone intended to confuse the issue in this Senate when she mentioned the figure of 13,000. The figure of 13,247 is the one for traineeships for 1989-90, but it is a part of a total of 45,500. Certainly, that is below the Government's proposed target of 75,000, but those honourable senators who have had anything to do with that traineeship scheme will know that there were considerable difficulties with the introduction of the traineeship scheme because of the endless and extensive negotiations with the union movement that were necessary to be sure that no traineeship program or modified wages scheme could be used to undercut the rights and wages won for workers and paid under awards. That series of negotiations took a very long time, as many unionists wanted to be absolutely clear what the details and consequences were and how the traineeship scheme would fit in with other areas of industrial awards and relations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a disappointment that those figures are not as high as were targeted. It may also be, though, that the people to be provided for are coming on to those traineeship schemes at a rate that satisfies them. I can tell Senator Michael Baume that I have had some considerable involvement with that program, particularly in my own State and through the TAFE sector in Australia. It is very interesting to see the success and satisfaction the young people exhibit when they have completed their traineeship, to see the confidence and new outlook that many of them have after completing the traineeship scheme and how that has helped so many of them go on to different and fuller employment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way I can counter the facts that the Opposition put in here: a target of 75,000; an achievement of 44,500. There is no way I can say anything but that the Government did not meet its target. But the program is there and the traineeships are increasing in number. The people participating in them are finding them of great benefit. That work is just one part of this Government's ongoing commitment to young people in this country, and it is not going to go away during the period that we are confronting-the period that Senator Michael Baume alludes to. The Government's commitment to young people is there; the programs are there. I am sure that the youth of Australia will find that they will be of assistance now as they were last year and as they will again be next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the youngest member of this chamber, I have great pleasure in speaking to this matter of public importance, which addresses the problems facing young Australians today. In opening I would like to quote the words of A. D. Hope in his patriotic poem Australia when he wrote these very stirring thoughts:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Yet there are some like me turned gladly home</PARA>
<PARA>From the lush jungle of the modern thought, to find</PARA>
<PARA>The Arabian desert of the human mind,</PARA>
<PARA>Hoping if still from the deserts prophets come. </PARA>
<PARA>How appropriate those words are when we look at the Government's failed economic policies. How appropriate those words about the Arabian desert are when we look at the Government's failure over the last seven years. Senator Richardson, in opening the debate for the Government, said today that the Australian Labor Party would not give future generations of Australians a poisoned inheritance. On behalf of the young Australians, on behalf of future generations, I have to disagree with him, because this Government has turned Australia into an educational desert. This Government has presented future generations with a windblown, sandy wasteland with no employment, no opportunities and no future. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the arguments that the Government has come up with today have centred on its so-called educational policies-matters on which I will comment shortly. However, first I think it is appropriate for me to address this Government's generally contemptuous attitude towards young Australians. It is ironic that in a discussion on youth unemployment the Opposition has the youngest member of the Senate to close its debate. Who does the Government have? It has Senator Burns, one of the most geriatric members of the Senate; a man whom one could generously describe as being intellectually moribund, a man whose reminiscences of youth I am sure pre-date the Second World War. This is the response that the Government has when we come to talk, heartfeltly, about the problems facing young Australia. Who does the Government wheel out-and it probably did wheel him out in a wheelchair-but Senator Burns?</PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that I am on this side of the chamber and not on the other side. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in a debate yesterday said of my comments about his attempts to hide facts from an Estimates committee that it was adolescent, windy rhetoric. The Leader of the Government uses the word `adolescent' as a term of abuse. That is how those opposite treat young Australians. That is the contempt they show for everybody under the age of 25 in this nation. But people who are over 65, as Senator Button says, are in grave difficulties because the Government will legislate them out of a job. This is the track record of this Government over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume came before us today and spoke very eloquently of the problems facing young Australians. He said, quite correctly, that one in three teenagers looking for a job cannot find one. As far as I am concerned, that is a pretty good definition of youth unemployment-one in three. One in three youngsters that we meet out on the street cannot find a job no matter how hard they try. That is the legacy of seven years of this Labor Government. That is the legacy of seven years of the Hawke-Keating regime. But the Government responded with this argument: `We have done marvellous things with school retention rates'. Honourable senators opposite said that when they came to power 37 1/2 per cent of students only stayed on to year 12 and now 60 per cent of students stay on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell is exactly right. The reason they stay on to year 12 is that they cannot get a job. It has nothing to do with the Government's policies. It is all to do with need-the need to stay at school because they cannot get a job when they leave the school gates. Now we come to Senator Crowley's comments about education training, about employment schemes. I thought this was a telling slip of the tongue if ever there was one: she spoke with pride of the Government's employment schemes in South Australia, but she had to admit that she has been involved in this particular employment scheme only at the presentational level; she had not been involved in the hard work. The sad truth is that everybody who has been involved with a government employment scheme has been involved only at the presentational level and not in any hard work, because this Government's employment schemes have failed to deliver. Their target was 75,000 jobs created per annum. The figure for 1989 was 13,500. On my rough reckoning that means that this Government gets a score of one out of five. In other words, it has failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government talks with pride, it says, about what it has done for education. Senator Crowley spoke all about higher education. Let us talk about higher education and not about year 12. I will tell the truth about higher education under this Labor Government, and this is a telling statistic. Senator Cook loves statistics. I am sure that he will love this one. In 1983-84 spending on higher education was 1.01 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). In 1989-90-the year that has just closed-spending on higher education was 0.81 per cent of GDP: a drop of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government tries to talk about what it has done for higher education, what it has done for tertiary education. Yet it has cut the level of funding as a percentage of GDP by 20 per cent. It has cut the funding by 20 per cent at a time when more and more young Australians are being urged to go to university and undertake further studies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I think I can rise above Senator Cook and the sort of carry-on that he is guilty of so frequently in this chamber. I said that Senator Cook loves facts and figures. Here is a fact that might interest Senator Cook: when I left school in 1982, a tertiary entrance score of 955 was required to enter law. Last year a tertiary entrance score of 980 was required to enter law. This year the tertiary entrance score is likely to be 985 or maybe even 990. On that basis, only one per cent of school leavers in Queensland get the opportunity to go on and study law if they want to do so. It is the same across every subject, be it commerce, arts or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the truth about the Commonwealth's supposed funding of higher education. This is the brave new world that this Government says it will deliver to us. The Government promises not to give us a poisoned inheritance and instead laces the chalice with arsenic. These are the facts about what this Government has done to young Australians and what it continues to do to us. What worries me most gravely is the fact that it is the young people in provincial Australia who are the ones that miss out under the Hawke Labor Government; it is the young people outside the big cities who miss out under the Labor Party's recession government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission figures on participation rates in higher education are very interesting. Whilst here in the idyllic surroundings of Canberra participation rates in higher education are 29 per 1,000-it is a similar figure in Melbourne-in north Queensland, where my electorate office is, those participation rates are as low as 12 per 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of this, university students in Cairns are still without a dedicated campus site. After years and years of lobbying, university students in Cairns have a limited range of courses and if they want to study anything special they are told to go somewhere else. It is an absolute disgrace. It is a condemnation not only of this Government's attitude to young Australians but also of this Government's attitude to everybody outside the big cities. This is the truth about what this Government has done for higher education; this is the truth about its so-called employment schemes; this is the truth about what it has really done to the young people of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sat through seven years of Labor Government rhetoric, seven years of broken promises, seven years of banner headlines screaming out what Hawke will do, followed by seven years of attempts to claw back the mistakes that he made in his headlong rush to grab a newspaper headline. Seven years of rhetoric have come from the other side. The Labor Party claimed during those seven years that it would lead us to the promised land and yet all it has delivered is a desert. This is not the future I came to expect as I was growing up. My generation was promised a land of milk and honey, then asked to survive on bread and water. Unfortunately, all Australians will be the poorer for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking on this matter of public importance, I would like to quote John Dawkins, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The human resource is the most important of all, and the limits of a nation's capacity to produce are set by the capabilities and skills of its workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this lesson which is driving the major reforms initiated by the Hawke Labor Government, to our education and training systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is attempting to argue that the Government has failed its young people because of an increasing youth unemployment rate. Let us have a look at the real achievements of the Hawke Labor Government, and what it has done for our youth. Let us not confuse the issue: this Government has a solid policy, backed up by hard dollars, of encouraging young people to stay at school. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want our young people in the work force in unskilled jobs: we want them to be trained, educated and skilled, ready to enter into a technologically sophisticated work force; ready to compete in international markets; ready to bring Australia into the twenty-first century. We believe that all people, and youth in particular, have the right to expect sufficient support to enable them to develop their full potential. We argue strongly that this support will have huge dividends for Australia's future prosperity. We fail to develop our most important resources at our peril, particularly our human resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Our capacity to create wealth will be determined by the capacity of our work force. The importance of creating that wealth for youth and the young of this country is of great moment because all the other programs we talk about in terms of social services, such as unemployment benefit, pensions, health and education-all those things-have to be financed out of the wealth which we create in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the dark ages when the Opposition was in power, Australia's young people were divided into two groups: those who came from rich families, who had a very privileged education and entered the work force when they had finished their training; and another group of young people who were not rich, who left school early and got work where they could. Very few people in the latter group ever had an opportunity to improve their skills or increase their employment opportunities through training. This was a national disaster. Australia fell way behind its trading partners in terms of technology, industry development, and industrial practices. This Government has developed significant training and educational initiatives for all our youth, not just the privileged few-those people that Senator O'Chee so badly represents. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important, and it should be said twice. This Government has decided to take the issue of youth very seriously and has seen that young people, regardless of their particular circumstances, must have access to training and skills. Therefore, this Government has chosen the path of education for its young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Education and training must be the foremost priority for both the country and the development of the individual, although I must say that, in some instances, it does fail. We have taken on education and training with impressive results. This Government is proud of the fact that its young people are in school. The Opposition should be applauding the considerable achievements of this Government in increasing the training and education of its youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate some of the things that this Government has done for youth. There will be 70,000 additional places for Australian students funded by the Government between 1989 and 1993. There is a real increase of nearly 25 per cent of higher education funding from 1988 levels. School retention rates have increased from 36 per cent in 1983 to over 60 per cent in 1990. In the early 1990s, two out of every three children who start school will finish year 12. This could not be said of the Fraser years. Schools have been given an additional $30m in capital grants for 1991-92 to pay for the cost of increased retention. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for government and needy private schools has increased in real terms by massive amounts. For example, government high schools have received a 102 per cent increase in real terms over 1984 figures. The Government has developed a national curriculum framework and implemented a national project on teacher quality-quite a contrast with the old approach of the States going their own way and having a disjointed national situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with other government initiatives, this Government has also targeted disadvantaged students by funding hostels and literacy campaigns. Special programs have been developed for our Aboriginal students. This Government is asking that business-the main beneficiaries of an educated work force-contribute to the cost. Companies are now required to commit one per cent of their payroll to training. </PARA>
<PARA> I know, from my personal experience as a trade union official over many years, that there have been many companies which have carried out their responsibilities and done a fine job in terms of training people in the work force. Quite often they have been rewarded by others who refuse to train and who come along and poach those valued and well-trained employees. What this Government has done is to make sure that the training costs and burdens are evenly spread, and that those who carry out that responsibility for training have to pay nothing more than they are already paying to meet that one per cent figure. </PARA>
<PARA> A massive 44,500 young people have participated in the Australian traineeship scheme since its inception. Since 1983, apprenticeship intakes have increased by nearly 60 per cent. The Government is providing funding of millions of dollars to technical and further education colleges for their costs and increased training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside education and training for a moment, let us have a look at Government initiatives for young Australians in the area of employment. There are a number of successful programs that help young people make the transition from school to work, for example. Job train is especially designed to help job seekers, amongst others. This provides job training to meet the needs of both the individual and the local labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> Skill share emphasises the provision of skills and training to the most disadvantaged unemployed people and enhances the network of community based training and assistance schemes. That is quite different from the old community youth support scheme, whereby there would be one program in, say, Toorak, where people of great means live and where there was really no requirement for it, whereas in disadvantaged areas there was no assistance for the young. Now Skillshare has been placed in those areas where it will be of best advantage to, particularly, the unemployed who come from poor backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has recognised that some of our youth are disadvantaged. It has devised special programs for disadvantaged young people. These programs are designed to take care of all the special needs of this particularly vulnerable group. The Government has committed over $100m to the youth strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, these initiatives include: an increased availability of emergency accommodation for youth; increasing the financial support available to families; developing strategies to assist those most vulnerable to early school leaving; increasing and targeting the employment and training support available to the most needy youth groups; developing specialised health services for young disadvantaged groups; and improving access to information and advice for disadvantaged young people, with an increase in the number of youth access centres. These centres provide an important service for young people who have special needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also recognised the special needs of young people for income support as they make the transition from school to work. For example, there is additional income support assistance to young homeless people who are unemployed or in education and to those required to live away from home while studying. There is improved assistance for young people who live away from home while they undertake training or short term training. The Opposition is aware of these programs but remains silent on the achievements of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is committed to the whole person. Young people are not just numbers in or out of the job market. This Government has provided very real help to the most needy families while, at the same time, managing government expenditure efficiently and carefully. The Government has looked at the needs of young people and it has developed a special response to the health requirements of youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing needs have been addressed with sensitivity and a positive outlook. Young women have been a special target group, with many successful programs in the school system encouraging higher participation in all aspects of the workplace, not just the traditional clerical, sales and teaching arenas. These programs have also meant that young women are taking up non-traditional trades and tertiary courses. It is good for the community, as more people will have qualifications. It also means that our young women will be more able to participate fully in the workplace in the future. The Opposition has made no comment on the tremendous strides this Government has made in the area of youth, specifically youth education and training. It prefers to concentrate on youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at youth unemployment. We acknowledge that there has been an increase in unemployment for our young people over this year, but it is important that we do not allow the Opposition to distort the facts. Since the beginning of the Hawke Labor Government, teenage unemployment has dropped by a massive 34.1 per cent, and 81.8 per cent of teenagers are combining education with part time employment. We are proud of these figures. Over 90 per cent of all of our young people are engaged in either full time education or full time work. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government first came to office, 12.4 per cent of teenage people were unemployed and seeking full time employment. The figure is now 7.5 per cent. This represents a considerable improvement, even with the recent economic difficulties facing all sections of the community. We encourage the Opposition to look at the facts. Australia has had the fastest rate of employment growth in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Our unemployment fell from 10 per cent to 6 per cent from 1983 to 1989. We have significantly reduced unemployment from the incredibly high records of the previous Government. This has included the youth unemployment level. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's youth is better educated now than at any time during our history. The next generation will be better equipped and more able to respond to the demands of industry and production in an increasingly competitive world. This is what the Hawke Labor Government has done for our youth, and what the Fraser Government never did. And we are proud of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we look at the figures-and the figures I am quoting do not include a whole range of people who are not in the paid work force-we see that they include youth who are on employment training schemes and who would have been previously included in the unemployment figures. I do not say that to be picky, but just to try to set the parameters. I am concerned that there are no job opportunities for those on training programs at the moment. That is the key point. That is a real problem. When further figures come out that is where unfortunately we will see a substantial boost in the number of unemployed. The figure of 22 per cent unemployed in Tasmania was for October this year. It is not the November figure and we know that things have got worse in November and are getting worse every day. We should be most concerned about that. The Government needs to direct its attention to it. I see this matter of public importance as an opportunity for members of parliament to express their views about this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, these figures, bad as they are, are not complete because a whole range of people are amongst the hidden unemployed. It is almost impossible to establish a number for those people. The Australian Bureau of Statistics produces figures which deal with the number of discouraged job seekers, of which there are thousands and thousands. It is a very disconcerting feature that there are so many discouraged job seekers. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 September 1990 I rose in this chamber and referred to the August overall unemployment figure for youth and the fact that that figure is double that of those unemployed as a whole. The latest figures indicate that the same trend exists. I asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button):</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would the Government agree that we in Australia are in an unemployment crisis? Has the Government specifically considered the causes of the high level of unemployment, including the hidden unemployment that is not reflected by those latest figures?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button responded:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course the Government is concerned about the increased level of unemployment which has particularly become manifest in the past two months. It is fair to say that the achievements of this Government in respect of employment have been extraordinarily good over the life of the Government having regard to what we inherited. </PARA>

But a large percentage of those jobs are part-time jobs. There is not only unemployment but also underemployment. That is a tragedy. Many in the Third World countries are facing this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year the Treasurer (Mr Keating) boasted that families now had two and three jobs. That should not be a boast. Nobody should be proud of this, particularly a Treasurer. Wage rates and the tax regime should ensure that a family can exist on one income. But because of high mortgage interest rates and other factors, many families are forced to bring in two incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons for our recession is that we do not have a self-generating economy. There is not the population base in this country to provide the domestic market for the goods produced in this country. This is also a factor. I go back to my question to the Minister: what is the Government doing about it and what are the policies? We have heard about Priority One. The Government fails that policy in its own department. The Public Service Commissioner's report made a very tiny reference to youth employment. Pages and pages were devoted to equal opportunity but there was only a tiny paragraph on youth employment. Youth employment in the Public Service is at an all time low. That reflects the Government's view of youth and the employment of youth. </PARA>

<PARA> If a comprehensive settlement is achieved within that kind of timeframe, along the lines that Australia initially proposed and the international community has since adopted, we will have played a role of which we can be very proud in bringing to an end the killing and suffering which has so plagued Cambodia's modern history, and in removing a major source of international discord in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is appropriate to answer those few persistent critics, both within and outside Australia, who argue that there is something fundamentally flawed or misconceived about the Australian peace plan in that the Khmer Rouge will be able to exploit the peace process militarily, politically or both-particularly in the proposed transitional period under United Nations (UN) administration-and will in any event, at the end of the day, simply not accept any outcome which does not leave it in control of the country. It is important that clear answers be given to these kinds of concerns lest there be any move at the last minute to dilute or move away from what remains Cambodia's best chance to achieve a lasting peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I believe that it is timely to make the point that, while we are much closer than we have ever been to reaching an effective, workable, comprehensive settlement to the Cambodian problem, there are grounds for fear that the window of opportunity in this respect may well start to close around the end of this year. The key international players-not least the Permanent Five members of the Security Council, whose role this year has been central in maintaining the peace momentum-do not have infinite reservoirs of commitment and patience. As other major issues continue to clamour for attention, and if the Cambodian parties themselves remain intransigent, it cannot be assumed that the key international players will not walk away from the Cambodian problem. If they do, the result can only be continuing civil war and possibly worse. By agreement, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of this lengthy statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>The Cambodian Conflict: Settlement Efforts Prior to November 1989</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In April 1941 the French, still in effective colonial control of Indo-China, ensured the election of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as King of Cambodia, although initially he performed a largely titular role. The period between 1941 and his overthrow in 1970 was characterised by efforts by Sihanouk to assert growing independence and effective neutrality for Cambodia in a region deeply involved in continuing conflict. In 1955 he abdicated as King in favour of his father, resumed the title Prince and also took over executive authority for the government as Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Following the death of his father in 1960, he assumed the title of Head of State, but continued to exercise executive authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1970 Prince Sihanouk was overthrown in a military coup by Marshal Lon Nol and went into exile in Beijing where he established the Royal Government of the National Union of Cambodia (GRUNC). Over the next five years the Lon Nol regime's hold on power declined in the face of both internal corruption and external threat from Sihanouk supporters, allied with the powerful Khmer Rouge guerillas. In 1975 the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh, overthrew the Lon Nol regime and Sihanouk took up his position as Head of State. Sihanouk found that he could have no place, however, in what became quickly obvious was the monstrously cruel regime of Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea (DK), and he resigned as Head of State in April 1976, but remained in Phnom Penh under house arrest until January 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> The virulent anti-Vietnamese attitudes of the Khmer Rouge led to border clashes with Vietnam and eventually to invasion by Vietnam on 25 December 1978. Phnom Penh was captured on 7 January 1979, the DK Government ousted, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) proclaimed on 11 January under the leadership of Heng Samrin (Hun Sen became in 1985 Prime Minister of the PRK, subsequently renamed the State of Cambodia (SOC)). In June 1982 the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was established in Kuala Lumpur, bringing together-united in their opposition to the Vietnamese invasion if little else-the non-communist Sihanoukists and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) under the leadership of Son Sann, together with the communist Khmer Rouge. (The CGDK was later renamed the National Government of Cambodia (NGC) in February 1990). </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, under the Fraser Government, made clear in 1980 its decision to derecognise the DK regime and formally did so in February 1981. No Australian Government has recognised either the SOC or the NGC since, although the recognition issue has been academic since our 1988 decision to recognise henceforth only states and not governments. (On the question of who should have credentials to occupy the Cambodian seat in the United Nations, Australia has abstained since 1981.)</PARA>
<PARA> While not supporting either side to the conflict Australia has, however, been consistently active in pursuit of a settlement of what is undoubtedly the region's most pressing source of instability and a situation which has for far too long been the scene of horrific human suffering. After 1983, the Australian Government became particularly prominent among those countries seeking a solution. Along with others, we sought to identify areas of shared concern in the positions of the various parties to the Cambodia dispute and sought to encourage dialogue on the basis of the following broad principles: withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from Cambodia, matched by an effective arrangement to prevent Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge forces from returning to power in Cambodia; free and fair elections for Cambodia; the creation of conditions for the peaceful return of displaced Cambodians to Cambodia; and guarantees that a post settlement Cambodia would be neutral, independent and non-aligned. </PARA>
<PARA> Until July 1988 there was, nonetheless, little substantive movement towards a peaceful settlement. The period until then was characterised by ritualistic statements and plans for settlement incorporating aspects that were known to be objectionable to the other participants. Australian activities were, nevertheless, vigorous and included visits by Mr Hayden to Vietnam and Laos in 1983 and 1985, and visits to Australia by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Thach in 1984 and Prince Sihanouk in 1985. Specific Australian initiatives designed to help break the stalemate included the Pol Pot tribunal concept and the series of seminars organised by Griffith University and supported financially by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Following Mr Hayden's efforts in the mid 1980s regional countries, and in particular Indonesia, sought to play a more active diplomatic role in pursuit of a solution to the Cambodia problem. These efforts led to the two Jakarta Informal Meetings (JIMs) in July 1988 and February 1989. These meetings were inconclusive. Although they did result in some clearer definitions of the issues involved, there was no progress on lessening the differences among the four Khmer factions. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopes for a major move forward had arisen with the announcement by Vietnam in January 1989 that it was prepared to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September that year. Seeking to force a breakthrough, France judged in mid 1989 that the time was ripe for a full international Conference on Cambodia. The Paris International Conference on Cambodia (PICC) was accordingly convened, with joint Indonesian chairmanship, in Paris in July/August 1989: it brought together all four Cambodian factions, the six ASEAN countries, the Permanent Five Members of the UN Security Council, Vietnam, Laos, Australia, Canada and India as well as Zimbabwe (representing the Non-Aligned Movement) and a representative of the UN Secretary-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event the Paris Conference failed, but not without coming very close to succeeding. A comprehensive settlement strategy was mapped out involving, in broad terms, the monitored withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces; a ceasefire; the cessation of external support; the creation of a transitional administration; and the holding of free elections-all under the supervision of an international control mechanism. It also involved measures to guarantee the neutrality of Cambodia and non-interference in its internal affairs; to deal with the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons; and to ensure the reconstruction of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> That settlement strategy foundered for a number of stated reasons, but only one of them was really crucial: one side to the conflict, the combined resistance forces of Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann and the Khmer Rouge, together with their international backers, demanded a place for each of the four internal parties, including the Khmer Rouge, in the transitional administration; this was a demand which the PRK Government of Hun Sen, and its international backers, were simply not prepared to concede. </PARA>
<PARA> Vietnam proceeded to withdraw its formed military units more or less on schedule, but this was accompanied not by a renewed momentum for peace-despite various efforts by the Paris Co-Chairmen, the Thai Prime Minister and the US Secretary of State-but rather a resurgence of fighting, continued external supplies of arms and material, and a general hardening of diplomatic positions. Although international opinion remained overwhelmingly in favour of a comprehensive settlement-as the UN General Assembly vote on the ASEAN resolution again proved-the stumbling block remained the composition of the proposed transitional administration, in particular the role proposed in it for the Khmer Rouge: even on the basis that the Khmer Rouge would have but a minor role in a quadripartite administration, and that it would be shorn of its former leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> It was to break this impasse that the Australian peace proposal, announced in outline in the Senate on 24 November 1989, was put forward. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Proposal and Diplomatic Developments Since</PARA>
<PARA>The central concept of the Australian proposal to reinvigorate the peace process was very simple. So as to sidestep the power-sharing issue which had bedevilled the Paris Conference, and constrain the role of the Khmer Rouge in the transitional arrangements, we proposed that the United Nations be directly involved in the civil administration of Cambodia during the transitional period. Along with a UN military presence to monitor the ceasefire and cessation of external military assistance, and a UN role in organising and conducting elections, UN involvement in the transitional administrative arrangements would ensure a neutral political environment conducive to free and fair general elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian initiative recognised that a logical consequence of such a role for the United Nations would mean having the Cambodia seat at the United Nations either declared vacant or transferred to a neutral representative Cambodian body for the duration of the transitional period. In other important regards, the Australian initiative preserved the objectives of a comprehensive political settlement as defined at the Paris Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of United Nations involvement in a transitional authority was not in itself new, although the degree of detail with which the concept was subsequently developed certainly was. Prince Sihanouk had in March 1981, and occasionally subsequently, raised the idea of some form of United Nations trusteeship. And during 1989, US Congressman Stephen Solarz had developed the specific idea of a neutral United Nations interim administration: discussions I had with Mr Solarz in New York last October and subsequently have been crucial in shaping my own thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> In advocating the very substantially enhanced UN role in the settlement that we did, the Australian Government recognised that we were being ambitious. Though well experienced in peace-keeping operations and monitoring elections, the United Nations has not so far had a role in the civil administration of one of its member States, nor in having primary responsibility for organising and conducting elections as distinct from monitoring them. In addition, conditions within Cambodia-including the potentially fragile character of any ceasefire, the difficulty of monitoring guerilla forces, and the lack of developed transport and communications infrastructure-would mean that the overall UN operation would be much more difficult than that which had been experienced in most other situations. </PARA>
<PARA> While recognising from the outset the inherent difficulty and complexity of what we were proposing, the Australian Government was encouraged by the new vitality and credibility the United Nations had been able to demonstrate through its success in facilitating an end to the Iran-Iraq war and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, and its role in implementing the Namibian settlement. The transformation of East-West relations under way in 1989 was also relevant to our calculations in two ways. First, close collaboration between the United States and the Soviet Union on a number of international disputes had strengthened markedly the collective authority and influence of the Five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council. Secondly, as the effects of historic changes in the Soviet Union and Europe worked their way through to the Asia-Pacific region, it was becoming clear that the Soviet Union, Vietnam and probably China were more interested than before in achieving a Cambodian settlement if their minimum objectives could be obtained. Despite these positive pointers, however, we knew that a long, gruelling effort would be required to translate the Australian proposal into reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial international response to the Australian proposal was nothing less than quite remarkable. It very quickly became clear that the idea was one whose time had come. Within a matter of weeks, most of the participants in the Paris Conference had picked up the proposal for an enhanced UN role as a viable way around the power-sharing impasse and the problem of the Khmer Rouge, and given it varying degrees of public as well as private endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA> This process was considerably assisted by a remarkable feat of diplomatically effective endurance by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Deputy Secretary, Michael Costello. He had been tasked early in December 1989 to pay a quick visit to Hanoi-in between talks scheduled on other matters in Hawaii and Tokyo-to take preliminary soundings. The response was so encouraging, and developed with each successive meeting such a snowball effect, that this initial detour turned into a series of 30 major meetings with key players in 13 countries over 21 days straddling the December 1989- January 1990 period. During the course of this odyssey the Australian `idea' became a fully fledged Australian `initiative' or `plan', as we constantly refined and developed the detailed elements of the proposal and responded to suggestions or criticisms from our various interlocutors. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly encouraged by the positive reaction of the US Administration, which had the foresight to propose to the Soviet Union in late 1989 that they join the other three Permanent Members of the Security Council in a series of consultations on Cambodia. Representatives of the Permanent Five met in Paris on 15-16 January and agreed by consensus on a set of sixteen principles which would form the basis of their future discussions. Those principles included strong endorsement of the concept of an enhanced United Nations role in the transitional period. </PARA>
<PARA> The January meeting of the Permanent Five was significant in another sense. It marked the start of a two-track international approach to the Cambodia problem-the Permanent Five process and the Paris Conference process-between which a productive interaction has continued all this year. </PARA>
<PARA> By late January, Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, who, as Co-Chairman of the Paris Conference, had been exploring the possibility of an informal regional meeting on Cambodia, felt sufficiently encouraged to convene a meeting in Jakarta on 26-28 February involving the four Cambodian parties, Vietnam and Laos and the ASEAN countries. In recognition of the contribution we were making to the peace process, Australia was invited to attend as a resource delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> In preparation for the Jakarta Informal Meeting on Cambodia (IMC), as it became known, I dispatched a technical mission to visit Cambodia, Bangkok and the Thai-Cambodia border area from 2 to 16 February to gather information on the administrative structures of the State of Cambodia and of the National Government of Cambodia, with a view to filling in gaps in data necessary for the development of a United Nations role in Cambodia leading to free and fair elections. Working very rapidly, with a Departmental task force now numbering over a dozen senior officers, we produced in time for distribution at the Jakarta Meeting a 155-page series of Working Papers, incorporating the technical mission's findings and covering in some detail all the necessary elements of a comprehensive settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Papers were subsequently published as Cambodia: an Australian Peace Proposal-the now familiar `Red Book'. They examined in particular detail a role for the United Nations in civil administration, organising and conducting elections and in maintaining a secure environment in which Cambodians might exercise their electoral choice free from fear, intimidation and violence. The Papers also explored a range of costings. Conventional wisdom had it that such an exercise would be beyond the resources of the United Nations. Our indicative calculations showed that such a proposal (estimated, for the preferred `mid-range' scenario, to cost $US 1.3 billion for 18 months) was both practicable and affordable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jakarta IMC came very close to reaching agreement on a statement of principles providing for an enhanced role for the United Nations in a comprehensive settlement, but in the end it just failed to do so, consensus breaking down on the question of whether the agreed record should make specific reference to ``the prevention of recurrence of genocidal policies and practices''. While the outcome was disappointing in that regard, the meeting did begin a process of consensus building and confirmed that if there was to be a way forward, it must be through an enhanced role for the United Nations. Moreover, the concepts and suggestions in the Australian Working Papers began to permeate international thinking, and found expression in papers developed by the Permanent Five over the course of six major consultative meetings on Cambodia they held between January and August this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite alternate gloom and false dawns, the negotiating process has ground forward during 1990. Continual Australian diplomacy both in and around Indo-China, at the United Nations, and in Permanent Five capitals has helped maintain the renewed momentum which our initial initiative generated. Necessarily our role during this period has been supportive and back-room in character, rather than politically centre stage, but it has been no less substantial and constructive for that, and has been widely acknowledged as such. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months the accumulated diplomatic efforts of all concerned have borne fruit, with five significant developments occurring in fairly rapid succession. In noting these recent achievements I pay particular tribute to the valuable personal contribution that has been made to the international negotiating process by my friend and colleague, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Mr Ali Alatas, whose perseverance and resourcefulness through a series of difficult meetings hosted in Jakarta by his Government have been most impressive. </PARA>
<PARA> First, at its sixth meeting on Cambodia, in New York on 27-28 August, the Permanent Five reached agreement on a framework document setting out the key elements of a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian conflict based on an enhanced UN role. Along with other interested governments, Australia welcomed this document as a major contribution to the peace process. While there were naturally areas where we wanted to see further elaboration, we considered it to represent a skilful and judicious balance of the various interests involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, at a meeting in Jakarta on 9-10 September hosted by Indonesia and France as Paris Conference Co-Chairmen, the four Cambodian parties accepted the Permanent Five framework in its entirety as a basis for settling the Cambodian conflict, and agreed to establish a Supreme National Council (SNC) as called for in the Permanent Five framework, which would, among other things occupy the Cambodian seat in the United Nations. At Indonesia's invitation, Australian representatives attended this meeting and helped behind the scenes achieve a successful outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the United Nations itself endorsed the basic elements of the peace plan, urging the parties to elaborate the Permanent Five framework into a concluded comprehensive political settlement in UN Security Council Resolution 668 of 20 September, and UN General Assembly Resolution 45/3 of 15 October. These resolutions also welcomed the agreement of the Cambodian parties to form an SNC ``as the unique legitimate body and source of authority in which, throughout the transitional period, the independence, national unity and sovereignty of Cambodia is embodied'', noting that the SNC would ``designate its representatives to occupy the seat of Cambodia at the United Nations''. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Paris Co-Chairmen hosted a Working Group meeting in Jakarta on 9-10 November at which agreement was reached on the form and structure of a comprehensive settlement negotiating text. This meeting was attended by the Paris Conference Co-Chairmen (Indonesia and France), the Co-Chairmen of the Conference's three Working Committees (Canada and India, Malaysia and Laos, Japan and Australia), the other four Permanent Members of the Security Council and a representative of the UN Secretary General. Australia had prepared and circulated a full draft negotiating test as an input in to the Working Group meeting, and this work was substantially drawn upon during the discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, pursuant to the mandate given to the Paris Co-Chairmen by the Jakarta Working Group meeting to complete the drafting of a negotiating text, representatives of the Co-Chairmen and the UN Secretary-General met with Permanent Five officials in Paris on 23-26 November and reached consensus on a full draft comprehensive agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments, cumulatively, represent a particularly satisfying result for Australia, not least because there is at last achievement of a central objective we have pursued since February this year: agreement by the Permanent Five and other key players in the Paris Conference process to approach the final stages of a comprehensive settlement process working from a single negotiating text. No-one, including Australia, believes the present draft text is yet perfect, but it is certainly now in a shape that will make rapidly achievable the final negotiation of a comprehensive settlement at a resumed Paris Conference-provided always the will is genuinely there to make this possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining steps in the settlement process are: first, for the SNC to meet, resolve outstanding questions about its composition and chairmanship, and indicate its willingness to join in a resumed Paris Conference; secondly, for the PICC Co-ordination Committee, involving all Paris Conference participants, including the SNC representing Cambodia, to meet to finalise the text of the comprehensive settlement agreement; and thirdly, for a Ministerial session of the Paris Conference to convene to endorse and sign that agreement. After these steps have all been taken, it would be then for the UN Security Council to pass a resolution instructing the Secretary-General to take the necessary action to implement the settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The most optimistic assessment has been that these steps, up to the point of the Ministerial signature, can all still be completed before Christmas 1990. But that is now an extremely optimistic scenario; certainly it depends crucially, in the first instance, on the willingness of the SNC to commence immediately full participation in the negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions raised about the Australian UN Peace Plan</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding all the momentum now accumulated behind the peace plan originally proposed by Australia and now endorsed in outline by the UN (hereafter referred to as the ``UN peace plan''), criticism persists in certain quarters about certain aspects of it. The most important objections are that it makes too many concessions to the Khmer Rouge who, it is said, will be able to exploit the process politically, militarily, or both-particularly in the proposed transitional period under UN administration-and who will not in any event accept any final outcome which does not leave them in control of the country. </PARA>
<PARA>I. The first question raised by this kind of criticism is why we seek to engage the Khmer Rouge in the peace process at all. Why not simply take the position that their past record of atrocities entitles them to no consideration at all, and that the best option in these circumstances is to establish relations with the Phnom Penh government and encourage it to hold free elections-in which at least the non-communist resistance would be able to participate-as soon as possible? Now that Vietnam had withdrawn virtually all its troops, and was no longer sustaining by occupation the government it had installed, was it not now possible to accept, at least pending elections, the SOC as the legitimate Government of Cambodia?</PARA>
<PARA> This course has not been without its temptations, but is not one that has, hitherto, been able to withstand close scrutiny. If it were simply a matter of adopting a strategy that would effectively isolate and marginalise the Khmer Rouge, not very many voices would be heard in strenuous opposition. But the point is, simply, that the Khmer Rouge cannot be effectively isolated and marginalised, with its military influence nullified, so long as it continues to be supplied, especially by China, with arms and money and diplomatic support. China has consistently maintained that it will give a commitment to cease military support to the Khmer Rouge, and support a ceasefire, only in the context of a comprehensive settlement agreed by all four Cambodian parties. The simple truth of the matter is that unless and until China is prepared to withdraw from the picture-and only the UN peace plan seems capable of delivering that-then whatever Australia and other countries choose to do, the continuation of bloody civil war is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA>II. A second criticism made of the UN peace plan, or at least the protracted process involved in its negotiation, is that the delay in its implementation is being exploited by the Khmer Rouge to make major military gains and extend their political influence. </PARA>
<PARA> This criticism makes two assumptions, both of which lack foundation. The first is that there is an alternative, quicker way of achieving peace in Cambodia-but if the current international negotiating process were not taking place, there is simply no reason at all to assume that the Khmer Rouge's military activity would have been any less in recent months. The Australian initiative has not provided a smokescreen behind which the Khmer Rouge has fought-they have been fighting without encouragement from us for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> The other assumption, which needs to be addressed in more detail, is that the Khmer Rouge have in fact been making significant gains in recent months, and that there is as a result a real prospect of their regaining control of the country in the short to medium term. The media often carry exaggerated and unfounded accounts of Khmer Rouge advances, but the situation reflected in intelligence assessments available to the Australian Government is less dramatic. These assessments do indicate that the Khmer Rouge is making steady long-term progress with the same sort of guerilla strategy which brought it to power in 1975, but that there is no prospect of an early military takeover by the Khmer Rouge. The only exception made, and it is a very important one, is in the event of a total collapse in the military, political and social morale of the Hun Sen administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent media reports that the Khmer Rouge have recently received 24 Chinese tanks have, understandably, attracted wide attention. The Australian Government agrees with the view that, if such reports of recent delivery were true, they would indicate an ominous shift by China away from support for a comprehensive political settlement towards a military victory by the Khmer Rouge. But after full examination of, and consultation with our partners on, information from all sources, there is no evidence available to the Australian Government that the Khmer Rouge have recently received tanks from China. Indeed, the consensus among the experts is to the contrary. It is also worth noting that, while possession of tanks may give the Khmer Rouge some psychological advantage over the SOC, the logistic requirements to maintain, fuel and operate them, especially away from border areas, would stretch Khmer Rouge resources in current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The SOC armed forces also have tanks and sufficient artillery to counter Khmer Rouge use of tanks. All along, the important question for the SOC has been their ability to use this hardware in a militarily effective way. Fighting has been limited in recent weeks, and casualties on both sides remain light. The pattern has been one of the SOC's maintaining static deployment against Khmer Rouge guerrilla harassment. There have been suggestions that the onset of the dry season from this month may see the SOC move to counter-offensive activity, but so far there are few indications of preparations for that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly the view of the Australian Government that, to minimise any risk of significant change in the present military balance before the comprehensive settlement is bedded down, the current negotiating effort should be complemented by an immediate ceasefire and cessation of external arms supply. In this context we have been seeking support also for early dispatch of a United Nations military ``good offices'' mission, to facilitate implementation of a period of military self-restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is not the case that the SOC is facing any imminent disaster, it nonetheless has to be acknowledged that prospects of the SOC regime's surviving over the long term are not especially good if current trends inside Cambodia are allowed to continue. The long-term vulnerability of the SOC regime is compounded by chronic economic and administrative weaknesses. The regime has been heavily dependent on external assistance, particularly from the Soviet Union, but that is now being significantly reduced. The situation is exacerbated by Cambodia's very limited capacity to earn foreign exchange or to generate internal revenue. There are chronic shortages of basic necessities, particularly fuel. While the SOC has put in place measures to liberalise the economy, it has not developed adequate mechanisms to generate the income necessary to fund government services. </PARA>
<PARA>III. The third criticism is that once the UN peace plan is put into operation, the Khmer Rouge will be able to exploit the transitional arrangements to facilitate their return to power. </PARA>
<PARA> This is of course something which has been given very close attention in the international deliberations to date, and will no doubt continue to loom large in what remains of the negotiating process. The most important point to appreciate is that the SNC, while fully embodying the sovereignty of the Cambodian nation, is not expected to itself exercise the full range of executive authority that one would associate with an ordinary government. There is a sharp distinction in this respect between the SNC's role, and that proposed for the quadripartite transitional administration in the pre-November 1989 peace plan which implied a quarter-share in the day-to-day government of the country by Khmer Rouge officials. The presence of just two Khmer Rouge nominees within the body of 12 (or 14) constituting the SNC should not of itself cause concern, and is in fact readily accepted by the SOC regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor does the SOC regime, it should be said, resist the idea of letting the Khmer Rouge contest the UN-supervised elections provided Pol Pot and his most notorious associates are not allowed to stand as candidates. While it appears they are not in fact proposing to do so, in any case the United Nations and most relevant national governments including Australia would naturally refuse to cooperate with a process which was belittled by the presence of candidates of such notoriety. A further important election safeguard, proposed by Australia and accepted by other countries, is that the general elections organised by the United Nations should take place with secret balloting for a single national constituency with proportional representation. This will minimise the risk of intimidation of voters in areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> More generally, of course, the whole concept of an enhanced UN role in the civil administration of the country during the transitional period is to ensure a genuinely neutral environment for the conduct of the election, in which no one party would stand to benefit by way of either assistance or neglect from a central government. </PARA>
<PARA>IV. A fourth criticism of the UN peace plan is that the Khmer Rouge will not in any event accept the final outcome of any process which does not leave them in control of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to believe that the Khmer Rouge would win more than a minor share of the vote in any genuinely free and fair election, although it would be unwise to underestimate the degree of support they have been winning-with their fiercely anti-Vietnamese nationalism and freedom from accusations of corruption-especially among some segments of the rural population who did not suffer directly their earlier brutality. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly in these circumstance, given that there is no evidence that the Khmer Rouge's stated abandonment of their previous ideology and methods is anything more than tactical, there can be no guarantee that they will not resume fighting after the transitional period with weapons which have been hidden from the UN monitoring teams. </PARA>
<PARA> While acknowledging there can be no absolute guarantee that renewed fighting will not occur, two crucial new factors will have a positive bearing on the outcome. First, China will have given an international legal undertaking to cease arms supply to the Khmer Rouge, will be under close international scrutiny to uphold that undertaking, and can be reasonably expected to honour it. While the Khmer Rouge may well have access to two or three years supplies of arms in caches, and will be able to make a major nuisance of themselves during that time, thereafter-without continued external support- the danger they pose to the fabric of Cambodian society will be dramatically reduced. We can expect them to be genuinely isolated and marginalised. </PARA>
<PARA> A second relevant consideration is that the new Cambodian administration will be accepted by the whole international community as the government of the country and is very likely to receive substantial economic, social and technical assistance during the rehabilitation and reconstruction process envisaged under the comprehensive settlement. Taken together, these factors will mean that the newly elected Cambodian Government will be in a much better position that the present Hun Sen regime to withstand any renewed challenge from what will be in any event a considerably constrained Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA>The Comprehensive Settlement Window</PARA>
<PARA>Taking stock of the current state of the peace process, it is apparent that there are two conflicting trends. On the one hand, following the successful fusion of the Permanent Five and Paris Conference components, there has now been prepared an integrated draft negotiating text for a comprehensive settlement. If the Cambodian parties and their international backers show the necessary political will, we should now be only a month or two away from a comprehensive settlement. On the other hand, the Cambodian parties are still unable to agree among themselves on the relatively minor-compared with other matters at stake-issue of the Chairmanship and Vice-Chairmanship of the SNC as established at the September Jakarta meeting. Not altogether unreasonably, the Paris Conference Co-Chairmen maintain the position that they will not reconvene the Paris Conference Co-ordination Committee until the Cambodian parties sort out the SNC impasse. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a most unhappy result if the peace process were to break down at this late stage around this essentially very marginal issue. As already noted, it is not as though the SNC is intended to be a body with strong executive powers. Its role is intended to be largely formal. Throughout the transitional period, the SNC will be the unique source of authority and the embodiment of Cambodian independence, sovereignty and unity. Its role is to represent Cambodia externally and to delegate to the UN the powers necessary to ensure the implementation of the comprehensive settlement. But for China, Vietnam and all the Cambodian parties, it is increasingly clear that the SNC issue has now acquired considerable symbolic significance. </PARA>
<PARA> In late October and early November, Australia undertook a series of informal consultations in Phnom Penh, Hanoi, Beijing and Bangkok on the SNC impasse. We also consulted with Prince Sihanouk in Pyongyang. While it was clear that a deadlock might continue for some time, we encouraged the principal parties to consider a compromise formula whereby Prince Sihanouk would be elected as Chairman and a thirteenth member of the SNC, Prime Minister Hun Sen of the SOC regime would be elected Vice-Chairman, and the SOC would be invited to nominate someone to become a fourteenth member of the Council, with these arrangements being implemented either at clearly defined separate stages of a single meeting or at two successive meetings of the SNC. There are indications that something along these lines might eventually be acceptable to all the parties, but disagreement for the time being persists. </PARA>
<PARA> In parallel with the continuing SNC impasse, there have been recent reports of dissatisfaction by the SOC regime and Vietnam with aspects of the Permanent Five framework of 28 August, as elaborated in Paris on 26 November 1990, including questions which relate to the administrative and military mandate for the proposed United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. The continuing sensitivity of these issues has been known for some time. Australia's view is that the reported expressions of concern by the SOC and Vietnam confirm the urgency of resolving the SNC impasse quickly so that the Cambodian parties can address directly the substantive issues of the comprehensive settlement at a reconvened session of the Paris Conference Co- ordination Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated at the outset it is important for the Cambodian parties themselves to appreciate that the international community does not have infinite reservoirs of commitment and patience to provide to the peace process, particularly if the Cambodians themselves are not willing to help maintain forward momentum. There are indications that the commitment to the peace process of some of the key international players will be difficult to sustain much beyond the end of the year. The Gulf crisis and forthcoming major issues in Europe are likely increasingly to command the priority attention of most Permanent Five countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, these observations point to the conclusion that, while we are now much closer than we ever have been to reaching a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict, the window of opportunity for progress may well start to close around the end of this year. It is incumbent on Australia and other like-minded participants to give every possible support to the Paris Conference CoChairmen in the period immediately ahead so that, if possible, an unstoppable momentum towards a comprehensive settlement can be generated by the end of the year, even if the culminating Ministerial session on the Paris Conference has not taken place by then. </PARA>
<PARA> As I also indicated at the beginning of this statement, despite the efforts of Australia and many other players and despite all the progress made during the past year, it is still by no means certain that we will be able to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict. We should know one way or other during the next two months or so, as the parties are forced to come to grips with the actual obligations set out in the single negotiating text. </PARA>
<PARA> If it becomes clear that, despite the best efforts of all concerned, a comprehensive settlement is unachievable, Australia, along with other Western and regional countries, will need to review other policy options. It is very clear that any course other than a comprehensive settlement would be very much a second-best option. Diplomatic recognition and the moderate levels of economic assistance which might be forthcoming over time would obviously help the SOC psychologically and to some extent practically. But the Khmer Rouge military threat, on the assumption of continuing arms supply from China, would remain a major challenge to the survival of the SOC regime. The internal weaknesses of the SOC regime, with all that they imply for its long-term vulnerability, could be expected to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the sorry history of Western military involvement in Indo-China in recent decades, it would be a very large assumption that any future Australian government, or any future government in the West generally, would be willing to contemplate the dispatch of military forces to help the SOC fight the Khmer Rouge. Certainly Vietnam has made it clear that it cannot afford to, and will not, play that role again. Up to 200,000 Vietnamese troops, fighting over a period of nearly 11 years, were not been able to eliminate the Khmer Rouge so long as it was supplied by China, and there is no reason to assume that anyone else would do as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The kind of alternative policy approach which is constantly recommended to the Government-built around recognition of the SOC-has, then, obvious limitations in helping save the ordinary Cambodian people from continuing civil war and the appalling prospect of a second military takeover by the Khmer Rouge. Nor can it be assumed that it will help in removing the Cambodian conflict as a source of international tension in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognition of these realities strengthens the Australian Government in our conviction to do all in our capacity to help achieve a comprehensive settlement in the coming months. We are further reinforced in our commitment by the knowledge that Australia's diplomatic contribution to the solution of this deep-seated and complex problem has been welcomed and encouraged by the key international players in the negotiating process and all Cambodian parties except the Khmer Rouge. Just as importantly, Indonesia and other regional partners have welcomed the contribution we have made towards resolving an issue which has obstructed the harmonious development of relations in our region for over a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Given all that has been achieved so far in the Cambodian peace process, and given the importance of the issues at stake-partly in terms of our own regional standing, but more importantly for the long-suffering Cambodian people-we do not intend to walk away from the effort to achieve a comprehensive settlement as long as there remains some reasonable prospect of success. While we may eventually have to consider other options if others allow the window of opportunity to once again slam shut, to do so now would be to demonstrate a lack of that nerve and stamina in foreign policy which is increasingly necessary in the ever-more fluid and uncertain international environment we now face. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this motion to take note of the statement which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has put down today on the subject of Cambodia. The Minister advised the Senate two days ago that this was to be a major statement. We have been wondering, not surprisingly, what it would contain. There has been considerable speculation about this matter of recent times. We read of intended visits by the Minister to Phnom Penh; we read of plans to establish a mission in Phnom Penh. In fact, I understand that certain personnel from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been advised that they will have positions in that mission. We were therefore expecting something of some moment in this statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that, although it is a very long document-perhaps that is a definition of `major'-we find it somewhat puzzling because it contains very little that is new. First and foremost, it is a history of the sad events of Cambodia and a record of the contribution of this and previous governments to do something to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the Cambodian conflict. Secondly, it is an attempt to refute some of the concerns that we have been expressing about how the peace process that is being advanced might facilitate or advantage the Khmer Rouge, and I will come back to that because it is a particularly important aspect. Thirdly, in some ways it seems to sow the seed of an acknowledgment of failure, to suggest a need for a substantial policy change. I guess that is new. </PARA>
<PARA> We are left wondering whether the Minister genuinely believes that the comprehensive settlement process might now fail. Up until today the Australian Government has been incredibly optimistic-we have suggested at times even overoptimistic-particularly in its timetable expecting peace to come about by the end of this year, the United Nations forces to be in Cambodia and the UN administration in place. We have tried to put to the Government just how unrealistic some of these hopes have been. Now it seems that, in the Minister's terms in the statement, the window of opportunity is closing. It is the first time that has been said by the Minister, so perhaps we are being softened up for an about-turn in policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement also fails to allay our fears about the position of the Khmer Rouge. At no time have we suggested that the Australian Government has wanted to take any step to advantage the Khmer Rouge, but it has seemed to us that, under the shield of the comprehensive settlement process, the Khmer Rouge has been advantaged, and the thought of the Khmer Rouge retaking power in Cambodia is almost too horrific to contemplate. Whether that is why the Minister is now softening us up for an about-turn in policy I do not know. We simply do not get the answers to those questions in this paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to take the opportunity to make one point clear because it has been suggested otherwise from time to time. We do recognise the efforts that this Government has taken in making a positive contribution to the resolution of this awful conflict. We recognise the application and energy of Senator Evans in this matter. We are pleased that he has recognised that previous Australian governments, as I said a moment ago, have also made a contribution. He recognises in his paper that the Fraser Government decided to derecognise the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) regime, and did so in February 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans recognises in his statement the contribution that his predecessor, Mr Hayden, made as Foreign Minister. We have always said that Mr Hayden's efforts were well intended. His strategy was to look for a great Australian influence through developing a better relationship with Vietnam. It was believed by many that in some ways the application was mistaken in that Mr Hayden got Australia out ahead of our Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) friends and as a result we lost some capacity to influence events. But that was not the intention; the intention was clearly to find a worthwhile role for Australia in this particular issue. As I have said, Senator Evans has continued those efforts and has left his mark on the history of the international communities' attempts to facilitate a resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans realises that, when he announced the new moves in his policy some time ago for an enhanced role for the United Nations, we criticised the fact that this was packaged in a way to suggest that it would no longer be necessary to involve the Khmer Rouge in the process-that once we had moved away from a quadripartite solution and a direct role for the four factions to an enhanced role for the UN, in some ways we were avoiding the Khmer Rouge difficulty. That is simply not so. Senator Evans recognises the cooperation and participation of the Khmer Rouge in this comprehensive settlement process is as vital now to its success as it has ever been. Therein lies one of our concerns: the Khmer Rouge is simply using the process to its advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I have to say that we have been somewhat unimpressed by the level of self-congratulations that has been accepted by our Minister and other Foreign Ministers in this particular exercise. This was well expressed in the editorial in the Australian Financial Review a day or so ago, which stated that the degree of one-upmanship by Foreign Ministers in this issue is almost unprecedented. There has been Nobel Peace Prize talk as each offers to nominate the other, and one can continue in this vein. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that while the Foreign Ministers of the world are slapping each other on the back on this issue, men and women are continuing to be killed and maimed every day in Cambodia. They continue to be dispossessed of their homes. There are somewhere between 150,000 to 300,000 displaced people in Cambodia at the moment. If Senator Evans goes to Cambodia next year, he will witness some of that tragedy which has been witnessed by people like Senator Schacht when he was there earlier this year and me. This does bring home the reality of the horror that is a daily event in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> The few days that I was in Phnom Penh happened to coincide with one of the three major attacks on trains by the Khmer Rouge only 70 kilometres from the capital. The train was mined. Those who were not killed by the train being derailed were removed from it. The officials were separated from the peasants. The officials were all then shot and the peasants were sent home to the villages to give the message. Those who were wounded were later taken into Phnom Penh, where the message further spread. </PARA>
<PARA> The message, of course, is one of terror. It is the age old strategy of the Khmer Rouge and it is being practised now as effectively as it ever was. It remains as horrible as it ever was. Peasants return from the fields during the day, go to their grain baskets, put their hand in and have their arm blown off by a Chinese-made plastic mine, put there by the Khmer Rouge to spread terror. This is the background. The Minister has been interjecting but I did not hear what he said. But that is why we have been saying that we would far have preferred more effort to be put into pressing the parties to a cease-fire than some of the other--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister did not do it in Tokyo. That was his best chance to get a cease-fire. The Minister ignored that. The Khmer Rouge did not attend that conference because they did not wish to be locked into a cease-fire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third area of concern that we have had, which I mentioned a moment ago, is that the policy might be wrong. It might in fact be less likely than more likely to lead to a settlement and to peace. We have said that the comprehensive settlement ideally is the best option. In an ideal world, a process that could lock all four Khmer factions into a settlement would appear to be better than a process that leaves one-say the Khmer Rouge-out of the process, to continue its path of aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that with Cambodia one is not looking at an intellectual exercise and one is not looking at an ideal world. What we have observed is that when the comprehensive settlement process was advanced a year ago, the position on the ground in Cambodia then was very different from the position now. The position of the Khmer Rouge was different. They significantly advanced their position, which I might go into in more detail in a minute, during the ensuing year. On the other hand, the position of the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh has significantly deteriorated. I think the paper delivered today is the first time that that has been acknowledged by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Through a series of events-in particular, the withdrawal of Soviet and Eastern Bloc aid for the Phnom Penh Government-Cambodia's economic position has significantly deteriorated. It has run into internal political difficulty as the old guard has sought to see advantages from the dialogue process. It has failed to do so and, as a result, has turned on Hun Sen in particular. It has lost credit as the terror campaign of the Khmer Rouge has proved more successful and the morale of the population has dropped. The situation has been reached where one must really put a question mark over the future of the Hun Sen Government. The Opposition has been saying that for some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister is patient, he might hear some. This is the first paper in which I have noted the Minister acknowledging the deterioration of that regime's position. What I am saying is that the balance has significantly changed during the course of this last year. The position that was to be locked in by the comprehensive settlement a year ago is very different to the position that might now be locked in by the comprehensive settlement, particularly when we look at the balance between the Hun Sen regime and the Khmer Rouge. That has caused us very genuine concerns, which seem to have been ignored by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two days ago my colleague, Senator Teague, asked the Minister a fairly simple question that concerned our worries about the rise again of the Khmer Rouge and whether they were being adequately excluded from this process. He asked the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . what arrangements in the settlement process have been agreed on in order to disarm and contain the Khmer Rouge? Secondly, what mechanisms are in place to prevent Pol Pot and his deputies from returning to power? Is it in fact the case that the P5 agreement-</PARA>
<PARA>the Permanent Five agreement-</PARA>
<PARA>provides no assurances at all? Finally, is it true that Son Sann, one of the Khmer Rouge representatives on the Supreme National Council-</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that there are only two-</PARA>
<PARA>is a Pol Pot deputy and allegedly responsible for gross human rights violations during their period in power?</PARA>
<PARA>Three simple questions, I would have thought, to put to a Foreign Minister of this country. The Minister declined to answer the questions, instead saying that there would be a major paper put down today and that we would presumably find the answer to those questions in that major paper. Well, they simply are not there. No-one has adequately answered the first question-how the Khmer Rouge are to be disarmed and contained. The Hun Sen Government is not satisfied that it can be done because of the two to three years during which everyone seems to concede weapons will be hidden. Therefore, we have developed this quaint notion that in some ways the Khmer factions would voluntarily give up their arms but they would have access to them in case the settlement breaks down. What that really amounts to is that there are no effective guarantees of disarmament of the Khmer Rouge at all. Senator Teague also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, what mechanisms are in place to prevent Pol Pot and his deputies from returning to power?</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's answer to that in the paper seems to be that no-one will agree to Pol Pot's standing for election. Nobody realistically expects Pol Pot to stand for election. That is not the way in which Pol Pot exerts and maintains power. He does not go through an electoral process. Obviously he never will. His power has been gained at the point of a gun. He is in a stronger position now since he was last removed from Phnom Penh and he simply is not going to give up that power and influence. It seems to be generally believed that Pol Pot and his deputies are still in control and still pulling the strings, usually from their camps in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says, `Look at the documents and see what provisions are there to ensure that Pol Pot and his deputies will not be returned. I read the P5 statement, and it contains no assurance, no mechanism at all to ensure that Pol Pot and his deputies will not maintain power and influence after a settlement. That causes us serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we said to the Minister in that series of three simple questions, `Is it true that Son Sann, one of the Khmer Rouge representatives, is a Pol Pot deputy allegedly responsible for gross human rights violations?'. This is the person that the international community is apparently endorsing as one of the two Khmer Rouge representatives on the Supreme National Council (SNC), and I find no answer to that in the statement that the Minister has put down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister of the article in the Economist, a highly reputable journal, of 22 September that refers to Son Sann, who said that he was a general in the Khmer Rouge Army that captured Phnom Penh in 1975, that he subsequently became Defence Minister in the Pol Pot Government-these are the people who are being legitimately returned to power under the Minister's program-that ruled Cambodia until it was banished by the Vietnamese in 1978. He had some role in internal security-that is, imprisoning, torturing and killing everyone the Government said was his enemy. His name has been linked with the Tuol Sleng school in Phnom Penh that the Minister might visit if he goes there next year, the torture chamber, which might bring the Minister back to earth on some of these issues.

What step does the Minister intend to take then? The legitimacy of the Khmer Rouge is enhanced by the process; there is no doubt about that. Once they get a position on the SNC, they get national legitimacy as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the year-this is the year of the Minister's program-their military activity has increased. Most experts seem to accept that their influence in the countryside has extended. They are now exerting influence over a much greater proportion of the country as a whole, having moved away from just the mountainous and border areas. The strategy is the encirclement of Phnom Penh with guerillas fanning out from Kompong Thom in the north, to Kampot in the south and Kompong Chhnang in the north-west of Phnom Penh-a process of expanding influence. I mention the practice now of attacking trains, with three trains having been attacked in the past year and ever extending signs of influence-still principally a terrorist exercise, not seeking to take and hold large tracts of land. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been disturbed by the allegations that they have now been provided with tanks by China. I see that the Minister in his statement today refutes the fact, indicating that Australian intelligence sources now doubt whether tanks have been supplied.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Oh, now it becomes a laughing matter apparently. Mr Acting Deputy President, what I was doing was expressing concern about the expanding influence of the Khmer Rouge under the shield of the Minister's proposals in this area. There is no doubt that that has occurred, there is no doubt that the Phnom Penh Government during this period has lost influence. There is no doubt that there is the chance of a comprehensive settlement if it can be realistically expected to work-that is, if one can realistically expect the Khmer Rouge to participate in a democratic process. I have always wondered whether that is so. There is no doubt that the Khmer Rouge has vastly expanded its position of power and influence within Cambodia during the past year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has kept interjecting, asking what other options are open, what should he be doing, and I expect that we shall hear fairly soon from the Australian Government as to what alternative process it will adopt next for Cambodia. We have been saying that we believe there was an alternative of greater influence towards a cease-fire and that that has been largely avoided. We believe it would have been worthwhile if there had been more effort to try to lock out the military aspect of the Cambodian issue over the past 12 months, and perhaps a little less on the diplomatic set. We think that advantages could have come out of it. We have been saying for years that this Government and other governments could have brought an action in genocide against Pol Pot and his regime. This Government has had its own internal advice to that effect, but it has disregarded that advice. It would have had the advantage of properly excluding Pol Pot and his deputies from the process-those whom we fear are to be advantaged by the Government's action. </PARA>
<PARA> We have said also that if it appears on a realistic assessment that this will be a path back to power for the Khmer Rouge, or alternatively that the comprehensive settlement process will not work, again the international community should have been looking at the option of a linkage of three factions that excluded the Khmer Rouge, but that has been disregarded. I know that the argument for disregarding it is the one I mentioned a while ago that nevertheless leaves the Khmer Rouge in the field, but if the international community is prepared to support the three factions at the exclusion of the Khmer Rouge, it can be equally argued that the position of the Khmer Rouge becomes marginalised. There is a lot that can be done that has not been done by this Government. Why does it now seem that we may be going to face an about-turn? Why is the Minister now saying that it looks as if the window of opportunity has been closed?</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it might be a sudden realisation of the enormous hurdles that still remain-hurdles that the Minister will not acknowledge, hurdles that I mentioned in this chamber some little time ago-and the difficulties that the UN itself still sees that lie ahead with containment and disarmament of the Khmer factions. As the UN officials say, they cannot get to square one with that because the factions have not even been prepared to give them information as to their military assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN still needs to send another military adviser group to Cambodia, but they cannot go until there is a cease-fire. It comes back to that key political point. The UN says that before it can take any action there must be major development of infrastructure-ports, roads, airfields and communications-which is a massive job in itself. The 200,000-odd displaced persons have to be resettled. The land has to be cleared of mines. The security of the UN personnel and perhaps Australian personnel, if that is what the Government is intending, has to be ensured. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the UN has to take over the administration, which is a key to the breakdown of the five functions of government that the Hun Sen Government was to give to the UN; that is, foreign policy, defence, communications, interior, and finance. Of course, it is only in the last few days that Hun Sen has come out again and said, `I am simply not prepared to give over those functions to the UN. I am not prepared to weaken my position in any political process that might further ensue by handing over those functions of government'. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps, finally, the Minister is realising the enormity of the challenge that is still ahead. It is not a matter that can simply be resolved through conferences in Paris, in Indonesia, in Jakarta, and elsewhere, because on the ground Cambodians have continued to suffer. Perhaps he is now finally recognising that that should be the key and that attempts should be made more realistically to assess what efforts the international community can make, particularly to bring the Khmer Rouge to heel, which is now in a stronger position than it has been in since it was last removed from Phnom Penh. I am pleased that we have had a statement and I am pleased that we have had an opportunity to talk about some of these issues. But I regret that the statement has not advanced the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator, could you take your seat. I am sorry to interrupt your speech. Minister and Senator Hill, you have both spoken and the chamber was very interested in what you had to say. It is now Senator Bourne's turn to speak. I again ask for no more interjections. This debate has been, in fact, labelled a major statement, and people in this chamber want to hear everyone speak and without interjections continuing. I will not ask again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a credit to the value of the negotiating process and, in particular, to the efforts of a few people, including Australia's negotiating team, that we have arrived at the stage that we are at today. In many ways, agreements that have been achieved to date are due also to the changed international climate in which we now live. The Cambodians have for many years now been fighting someone else's war. Now with the Cold War officially over, those external powers have no interest in the continuation of a nasty, unwinnable proxy fight in South East Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Soviet Union, the principal sponsor of both Vietnam and Hun Sen, has its own serious economic problems and can no longer afford to sustain military adventures in Indo-China. China, as the principal supplier of arms and funds to the Khmer Rouge, no longer feels the need to go on punishing Vietnam and is now seeking international approval since the atrocities of Tiananmen Square took place. In fact, since the Tiananmen Square outrage, China now appears willing to be seen as a peacemaker in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States (US) has slowly and finally realised that the Vietnamese communists have been punished enough for defeating the Americans in the Vietnam war and that a change of heart was necessary on their part. A peace settlement in Cambodia would remove the last obstacles to the lifting of US-led embargoes and sanctions against Vietnam, giving Hanoi access to desperately needed international aid and loans. Therefore, to a large extent, the UN peace plan has gained the support that it has precisely because the international mood has now shifted. This has created an environment in which the cause of peace in South East Asia can now realistically be advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the Foreign Minister has refuted any suggestions that the Khmer Rouge are somehow exploiting the peace process for both political and military advantage. I am encouraged by the Minister's comments in this regard, and I am hopeful that he is right when he suggests that the best way of dealing with the Khmer Rouge is to include them in the negotiating process for, once a comprehensive peace settlement is in place, the Khmer Rouge will eventually be marginalised. Let us all hope that this is so. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Minister is also right when he suggests that China is the key to eliminating the Khmer Rouge. It is true that, unless a comprehensive peace settlement is established in Cambodia, China will continue to fund and supply the Khmer Rouge with military supplies. The fact remains, however, that China has a less than perfect record in such matters, and the Khmer Rouge are of the same bizarre communist strand that gave the world the atrocities of Pol Pot. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am seeking to make is that I have very little confidence or trust in the Khmer Rouge or in their sponsors. The Khmer Rouge should not be underestimated in this regard. They will undoubtedly want to gain as much of the country as possible before a cease-fire, hoping that an advantage is obtained when the election is held. </PARA>
<PARA> It may seem inconceivable, but I have seen reports of United States intelligence suggesting that at least 30 per cent of Cambodians would vote for the Khmer Rouge in any election; I hope that is wrong. This information seems to be at odds somewhat with the Minister's stated belief that the Khmer Rouge should obtain only a minor share of the vote when the election actually takes place. Already there have been reports that vote buying has started with the Khmer Rouge guerillas paying farmers generously for everything that they can buy from them in return for voter support during any election in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> By his own admission, the Minister has said that the Khmer Rouge have access to two or three years' supplies of arms, even without continued external support, and will be able to make quite a nuisance of themselves for some time to come. It is understandable, therefore, that some of us remain fearful that, despite recent developments, the Khmer Rouge are still intent on winning power-by the ballot box if possible and by force if they do not get their way.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we feel that the Australian Government's proposed way of dealing with the Cambodian conflict and the policy option it has pursued is the one most likely to succeed. In this regard, the Minister does have the support of the Australian Democrats for what has been achieved to date and the efforts he has outlined that are likely to be followed up in future international forums. It must be said that we should keep trying along the path outlined by the Minister, because the sad fact is that few countries have suffered quite as much as Cambodia has in recent generations. Bombed by the United States, brutalised by the Khmer Rouge, occupied by the Vietnamese, and then fought over in a four-faction civil war, Cambodia has endured more pain in two decades than most countries have to in two centuries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Cambodia, regardless of any outcome of the current peace process, is a country in ruins. Its Government has been running an annual Budget deficit equal to 30 per cent of the country's modest gross domestic product. Defence accounts for 45 per cent of all government spending. Meanwhile, credits and highly subsidised oil from the Soviet Union have kept the Government's finances afloat. We understand that these hand-outs will stop at the end of the year and one can only imagine what the impact of this will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Cambodia should be the rice bowl of South East Asia. Instead, it operates with an economy which is in a shambles. In most districts, there are of course no telephones. There is an erratic or non-existent electricity supply, no clean drinking water and few vehicles or indeed passable roads. In many of the guerilla war zones, thousands of landmines are sown amongst rice fields. </PARA>
<PARA> With this situation in mind, we sincerely hope that the international efforts will shortly bear fruit. Most of all, we need to see a resolution of the current impasse concerning the dispute over the membership of the Supreme National Council. When one considers how far we have come and how close indeed we are to a settlement in Cambodia, we share the Minister's fear that it would certainly be tragic if indeed the whole thing were to come apart now. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot forget, however, that an interim United Nations administration, even if it does get set up, will need formidable administrative help and a fair sized force to keep the various factions under control. In some ways, a comprehensive peace settlement now would open up an even greater number of problems. There should be no doubt that the United Nations will be engaged in a task far more ambitious than anything it has undertaken for years. For instance, officials supervising the elections would have to contend with a population that has known power only through violence and terror for an entire generation. Most Cambodians probably have no concept of freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of cost as well, the sheer size of the operation would need to be large. By way of comparison the operation in Namibia cost $US373m and at its height involved a total of just under 8,000 people. This is quite small when compared to what Cambodia would need. I note that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has estimated that the proposal to use the United Nations in administering and overseeing any elections in Cambodia would cost around $US1.3 billion and this should give us some idea of the scale of the operation involved. Nevertheless, as the Minister has correctly pointed out, a world so preoccupied by events in the Gulf and in Europe might be reluctant to turn its attention in a generous way towards Cambodia. Under those circumstances, a failure to respond would indeed be a tragedy. The world should not lose sight of the fact that a successful transition to democracy in Cambodia would open the way to a more peaceful and secure South East Asia. Given the fact that many of the problems now facing South East Asia are themselves the creation of external forces, one would have thought that those same forces would not be unwilling to contribute now to the success of a comprehensive peace plan in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that the success of the peace plan would be a chance to show the world that the recent achievements of the United Nations have not pushed that organisation to its limits but were in fact the foundations on which bigger accomplishments could be built. Regardless of the success or otherwise of the United Nations peace plan, we must also not forget the magnitude of the economic problems facing Cambodia. Accordingly, should the peace plan succeed and should Cambodia be able to choose a government of its choice, the foreign aid required from the outside world will need to be massive. Indeed, we would like to see Australia increase its foreign aid to Cambodia to address the chronic shortages in basic necessities which were described by Senator Gareth Evans. There are already large numbers of refugees and it is now clear that many of the relief agencies operating in Cambodia are not coping with the magnitude of the problems they face there. Nevertheless, like the Foreign Minister, we hope we are much closer than we have ever been to achieving a long lasting peace settlement in Cambodia. It has already been pointed out that the next few months will be crucial in determining whether the Cambodian people will finally be granted the peace and security they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to and recognise the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the officials in his Department who have moved the peace process along to the stage it is today. Regardless of the outcome, we are confident that the Minister has done all in his capacity in a sincere and genuine way to bring about a lasting peace in Cambodia and this needs to be recognised. In addition, we would like to recognise the efforts of Australia's special envoy, Michael Costello, for his part in the process. Mr Costello's special and unique skills as a mediator played a crucial part in moving negotiations along and I know that we could not be where we are today were it not for his perseverance in the matter. We remain hopeful that all these efforts will not have been in vain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak in support of the Government's statement on Cambodia. It is a comprehensive statement which gives a detailed history of Cambodian politics basically since the Second World War. It also gives considerable detail about the situation reached in the peace process in Cambodia at present, and particularly the events of the past year or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After hearing part of Senator Robert Hill's speech, I must say that it was full of nitpicking and offered no alternative to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) outlined. I think it is disgraceful that the Opposition would nitpick without any substance and without any overall theme but above all else would not produce an alternative program of how to get peace in Cambodia. I find it extraordinary that Senator Hill consistently argues that the Government is going to allow the Khmer Rouge back into power in Cambodia because we do not understand the evil nature of the Khmer Rouge. If one reads the statement carefully and listens to what Senator Gareth Evans and his predecessor, Mr Hayden, have said over a number of years, one finds it is clear that the Government more than anyone else understands the evil nature of the Khmer Rouge and the Pol Pot period. It is extraordinary that Senator Hill should ask, `What are you going to do to stop the Khmer Rouge?', and yet he does not outline what he wants to do to stop the Khmer Rouge. He implies that the Government should recognise the Hun Sen Government forthwith. He implies that we should probably send weapons to the Hun Sen Government to fight the Khmer Rouge because, if he does not propose anything else, that is the only deduction I can reach from the way in which he asked his nitpicking questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement makes it quite clear that had it not been for the Australian initiatives, the so-called `Red Book' launched in October-November last year, we would not be at the stage we are now where all the permanent members of the Security Council have basically agreed to adopt the Australian proposition. It was the Australian initiative that laid the groundwork, and Senator Bourne has just paid tribute not only to the Minister but also to Mark Costello, Australia's Special Envoy in the negotiations who made many visits to Asian capitals, to Europe and to the United Nations (UN), often at a rapid rate, to discuss and explain what we were proposing and to break sometimes the walls of resistance to the peace process. I do not think we would be where we are today had it not been for that process. </PARA>
<PARA> The big change which gave momentum to the process was the one in American policy in July this year. The Americans said they were willing to negotiate with Vietnam and they were no longer going to vote in the UN to support the Khmer Rouge and the other resistance factions as the official government of Cambodia. That was the change that broke the deadlock in so many ways in the negotiations. Firstly, it showed to the Cambodian resistance factions-the Sihanouk group, the Son Sann group and the Khmer Rouge-that they could no longer rely on American influence in the UN to protect their so called sovereignty in the UN. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have asked why America changed its position. I think the Americans finally found it intolerable to defend a position where at one level they were saying, `We do not want and never will support the Khmer Rouge coming back to power in Cambodia', and at the same time they were voting in the United Nations to recognise the Khmer Rouge as part of the official government of Cambodia. The position and policy of the Americans were the ultimate in political contortions, convulsions and hypocrisy. At one level they said they did not want the Khmer Rouge in any way back in government but on another level they were recognising them as the official government. In the end the American public woke up to this stupid dichotomy and put pressure on the American Congress and Administration. I congratulate the Bush Administration and, in particular Mr Baker, the Secretary of State of the United States of America, for making the announcement of the change in American policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It broke the log jam and it broke it in particular with China. For the past 15 years China had the luxury of knowing that, no matter what it decided about Indo-China, it was secure because America would not have any dialogue with Vietnam. However, the day the Americans announced they were going to start talking to Vietnam, the Chinese realised they no longer had the luxury of always saying no, and that if they did not watch out they would be alone and isolated in the peace process. They had to readjust their thinking about the peace process to make sure they were not left out and that America did not reach an agreement with Vietnam over a peace settlement in Cambodia. Once that position was reached by the Chinese, they were willing in the Security Council discussion of the Permanent Five (P5) to vote for the peace plan outlined by Australia, including the call for free elections and United Nations administration and so forth. That would also put pressure on Khmer Rouge by saying, `The game is up. You cannot consistently veto the peace process with other Cambodian factions'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that has led to the situation where we now have agreement within the P5 and in the United Nations that this process can work. We still do not have agreement in the Supreme National Council (SNC), which has been formed of the four factions, about how it will operate, but we do have an opportunity for agreement to be reached in the next month or so. It is not certain, and this is the area where there is still some pessimism. But I do not think it is appropriate today for the Opposition to start criticising the Minister for, quite rightly, pointing out in his statement that the whole plan may still fail because the SNC may not reach agreement about its composition and its operations. The Minister was forthright in saying that that is a risk. If he had not said it, Senator Hill would probably have been even more vocal in his criticism of the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Minister has said that there is some chance that the process will not come to a successful conclusion does not mean that the whole process is wrong. I again reiterate: if it is wrong, what does the Opposition want to put in its place? It puts nothing in its place, except to imply that we should automatically support the Hun Sen Government and probably even supply it with arms to fight the Khmer Rouge. That fighting would lead to extensive killing in Cambodia over a longer period and the Cambodians would be the great sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is hypocritical of Senator Hill to claim that he is against killing when he is willing to denigrate the only plan that is on the table anywhere in the world which, if implemented, will guarantee an end to hostilities. What he is proposing is a long war of attrition. Unfortunately, that may be what will occur if the peace process falls apart, but if it falls apart it should not be a matter of triumph for the Opposition; it should be a matter of considerable concern and disappointment that there will be ongoing killing, disagreement and conflict inside Cambodia, in which the ordinary Cambodian people-overwhelmingly the peasants-will be the major sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Mr Ruddock in the other place and I are the only members of the present Parliament who have visited Cambodia on two occasions in recent years. When I was there in July this year I saw the consequences of the increased fighting by the Khmer Rouge. I visited the displacement camps which now hold some 150,000 people. I should point out to the Senate that recently the Australian Government announced a special aid grant through non-government organisations (NGOs) of some $1m to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, medicines, basic utensils and housing materials, such as canvas and so on, for these camps. Anybody who had been to visit those camps would have been appalled at what he or she saw. There were children who were clearly suffering from malnutrition and people living in appalling conditions, basically with no sanitation. This was at the end of the dry season and I could not imagine what the camp I saw would be like after a few days of the wet season-it would have been nothing but a mud heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made a major aid contribution to these camps. I think of all the Western countries it has been the biggest contributor of aid to help overcome the problems of the people in these displaced camps. Since 1983, Australia has also been the biggest aid donor to Cambodia of any Western country. All of our aid, of course, is provided via NGOs. I must pay a tribute, as I have done previously in this place, to the magnificent work of Australian aid workers in Cambodia. Most of those people who work there, if not all, put their health at risk by working in conditions where practically every known tropical disease in the world is prevalent. But those aid workers are willing to put up with that and work in appalling conditions as part of their commitment to help the people of Cambodia. I have no doubt that, whatever the outcome of the conflict in Cambodia in the immediate future, in the long term those aid workers who have been there for a decade or more will be remembered by the Cambodian people as their true friends. A friendship will be established and maintained between the people of Australia and Cambodia which will endure for a long time to come and this will establish a long term relationship between Australia and Cambodia that can benefit not only the Cambodian people but also Australia. I pay tribute to those aid workers, many of whom are working in appalling conditions, often at some risk to their health. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, some aid workers in Cambodia have been risking their lives due to attacks from the Khmer Rouge. At one place near Siem Reap I was told that an international aid team of doctors was carrying out operations in a makeshift hospital with machine guns under the operating table with which to defend themselves in case the Khmer Rouge burst into the hospital and attempted to shoot them. That is the level of the commitment of the aid workers in that country, of which Australia has a large proportion, and I pay tribute to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this statement is an important one. It will not be the last such statement and it will not be the last time we debate the issue of Cambodia in this chamber. I hope that sometime next year we can have an extensive debate after a peace agreement has been signed and after the United Nations has been asked into the country to conduct the administration and the holding of elections so that the Cambodian people can choose the government that they want. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bourne said that there was an assessment that the Khmer Rouge may get 30 per cent of the vote in that election. I find that hard to believe, but let us remember that if we believe in democracy and if the people of Cambodia choose to vote for the Khmer Rouge that is their business and they will take the consequences of it. The people of any country take the consequences when there is a free election and the people vote a government in, so long as the election is free, fair and properly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the problems surrounding the formation of the SNC, I think that is the last problem to be overcome. It is not a major problem, but it is a difficult one. A formula will probably be worked out-I certainly hope so-in the coming weeks so that the Paris peace conference can begin. If it is, the documents will be signed and the Secretary-General will be invited by the SNC to take over the important parts in the administration of Cambodia. When that is achieved during the next few months, as I have said before in this chamber and elsewhere, that will mean the end of the longest war of the twentieth century-a war that has been going on for 50 years in Indo-China. Most of that time the fighting has been in Cambodia, Vietnam or Laos. It is a war that will rank in the history of human civilisation as being as horrible as the Thirty Years War of the seventeenth century in western Europe or some of the great wars of the feudal age in western Europe. In my view, it is no credit to the Western world that much of this fighting in Cambodia and in Indo-China has been exacerbated by the wrongly thought out policies of Western countries. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, whatever our mistakes in the past have been and whatever our disagreements have been in a partisan way within Australia, Australia does have a moral obligation to be concerned to have a peaceful outcome in Cambodia and Indo-China, because we have been involved in the conflict in one form or another. I think it is incumbent upon all Australians, whatever their views, that we take this responsibility and do whatever we can to end this long, terrible and unfortunate war. The Minister's statement today gives a clear indication that our country and our Government have done more than any other Western government and Western country to achieve peace in Cambodia. When the history of peace in Cambodia is written, the Australian Government and Foreign Ministers Hayden and Gareth Evans, with the backing of their Government, will have pride of place as having achieved that peace. In my view, they will rank with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai and the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, in getting the important breakthroughs in this very complicated problem of how to achieve peace. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I support the statement that has been tabled today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement that we are discussing today provides an excellent summary of events and achievements to date. As such, it is a very useful document. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and his Department should be congratulated on the progress that has been made towards a comprehensive settlement, on their enormous commitment and their strenuous efforts to achieve this progress, especially on the part of Australia's chief negotiator, Mr Michael Costello.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's determination to pursue the comprehensive settlement, as long as there remains some reasonable prospect of success, should be supported. It should be acknowledged that public discussion of other options at this time might undermine the delicate process under way. However, we look forward to public discussion on other options, should it be necessary to abandon the comprehensive settlement process. We trust that discussion of such options would canvass the views, observations and experience of those members of parliament and the community and, in particular, those community organisations which have been working with the people of Cambodia, both inside the country and on the border, who have a particular interest in and knowledge of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has attempted to explain away some expressed concerns with regard to the participation of the Khmer Rouge. Firstly, in order to avoid continued civil war in Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge must be involved, and China has agreed to discontinue support for the Khmer Rouge only in the context of a comprehensive settlement involving all parties. That is a huge stumbling block-the continued support by the Chinese of the Khmer Rouge. Somehow or other more international pressure has to be brought to bear on China. But can we really depend on the international legal undertaking by China that it will desist from supporting the Khmer Rouge with military options once a comprehensive settlement is made? This is a promise by a country which continually shows blatant disregard for international opinion. We saw how carelessly it responded to criticism about the Tiananmen Square event and how quickly trade events overtook the outrage of the international community which was expressed at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Khmer Rouge is using the time delay in the implementation of the United Nations (UN) peace plan to make the major military gains. The Minister reassures us that his intelligence assessments are that there is no prospect of an early military takeover. I hope, in that respect, his intelligence sources are correct. We do know that in the meantime each week several hundred more Cambodians are being maimed or killed by landmines on the roads and in the fields. The Khmer Rouge does not need tanks to continually sabotage and break down the spirit of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The state of Cambodia is continually being worn down. There are very good reasons for us to increase our support inside the country to ensure that the system does not break down completely before the UN plan is implemented. That is why I ask that if the Minister acknowledges that Vietnamese troops have left Cambodia, why will the Government not recognise Cambodia so as to allow aid and trade to flow through and to help prevent the ongoing destabilisation of the current government, which has struggled for over 10 years to survive without realistic outside support and recognition? Coming on top of the despicable events of the Pol Pot regime, it deserved much more attention and support than it got from the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia recognises states, not governments, why are we not providing all the assistance we can and should be providing to the state of Cambodia? Why do we not have full bilateral relations? We know that officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have opted for such recognition, as have many aid agencies around the world. What is blocking a decision to go ahead and offer such recognition to allow for a realistic supply of aid? I know the Minister will not like my quoting John Pilger on this, but this letter from him, published in the Sydney Morning Herald today, may begin to provide some of the answers:</PARA>
<PARA>The so-called Evans ``peace plan'' for Cambodia came to light just one year ago. It was the direct result of public concern, expressed through the media and ALP branches, that the Hawke Government was selling out Cambodia to a revitalised Khmer Rouge, as part of Washington's continuing war of revenge against Vietnam . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that last phrase is telling; that, in fact, Washington has a great deal to do with our non-recognition of Cambodia. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, at last year's Paris conference on Cambodia, none was more zealous that Senator Gareth Evans in supporting US and Chinese plans to bring back the Khmer Rouge as part of a ``comprehensive settlement''. In his own handwriting, Senator Evans proposed changes to an Australian briefing document so that reference to Pol Pot's ``genocide'' was eradicated. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Last week's announcement by Premier Hun Sen that the Phnom Penh Government would not resign and allow Pol Pot the opportunities offered by the UN plan (in effect, Washington's plan) should bring home to the Australian Government that its ``initiative'' serves only to waste time, and lives, and in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that last week's statement is really a turning point in this debate, and that is why we need a reassessment of the Australian Government's position. I return to John Pilger's letter:</PARA>
<PARA> Recently I was told by a member of the Hawke Government that the Department of Foreign Affairs had a contingency plan to recognise the Hun Sen government ``around next July'' should the UN plan fail. In other words, the Australian Government is prepared to allow Pol Pot to press home his military advantage for another eight months before backing the only opponents to his return to power. </PARA>
<PARA>On the question of continued fighting and power plays during the transitional period and following elections, assuming the elections do not favour the Khmer Rouge-and, of course, that is a big question mark, as Senator Bourne has alluded to-how will the international community ensure that the Khmer Rouge is not supplied with arms? This includes the big question about China continuing to supply arms-but not only limited to China. The world is full of enterprising arms dealers who know no international boundaries and, of course, have no moral scruples whatsoever. I believe that the Thai military, for example, is in an excellent position to continue to exploit the situation of demand and supply in the region. I firmly urge the Minister not to underestimate in any way the power, cunning or resourcefulness of the Khmer Rouge. I am sorry that the Minister's statement did not address the question of Khmer Rouge disarmament during the transition process. This obviously is a big gap and probably a question that would not be easy to tackle; nor was there any mention of human rights violations in the refugee camps in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA> I was also disappointed that although the Minister criticised China-and that is well-deserved-he made no mention of United States (US) aid to non-communist faction members of the coalition or the camps on Thai soil that I have just referred to. There have been many allegations of illegal United States military assistance and British military assistance directly to Pol Pot. In that regard I quote Gary Klintworth in Australian Society of August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> The US annually provides at least $US20 million in cash. Much of it is used for military purposes, according to testimony by William Colby, former Director of the CIA, and Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists. They were appearing before the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on 28 February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a lot of detailed evidence about what they said to that Committee. Some of the US aid is allegedly syphoned off to the Khmer Rouge, which is logical given that the ANS and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front have been joined with the Khmer Rouge since 1982 in a coalition dedicated to overthrowing Hun Sen. Of course, there have been allegations quoting members of the Special Air Service Regiment from the United Kingdom and senior American military officials who have decided that they cannot, in conscience, any longer support this military backing for the Khmer Rouge and have decided to speak out publicly against their former involvement. Their words ought to be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cambodian people have worked hard for the last 10 years to rebuild their country peacefully and against all odds. They have received little international support and encouragement; no opportunities for trade or investment; no access to international development assistance other than through non-government organisations, which have been doing a fantastic job. Is it any wonder that the country is now experiencing extreme difficulties with the withdrawal of Eastern Bloc support? The Soviet Union, which used to give it some support, is obviously far too busy with its own domestic problems to continue any kind of support whatsoever. So it is most important for humanitarian reasons, and for the future stability of the region, that other countries come in and fill that gap. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Australian aid agencies urge the immediate recognition of the state of Cambodia, to thus give a lead to many other countries who are worried about the possible return of the Khmer Rouge. The people of Cambodia deserve our official government support immediately. I have to admit a bias here, although I have not been to Cambodia, in favour of saving people's lives, especially the lives of innocent people caught in the international power struggles. This is a particularly callous power struggle between China and the United States. The United States wants to make the Vietnamese pay for the embarrassment caused in the loss of the Vietnam war. These two countries get together at international conferences now to discuss these peace plans without paying enough attention to the will and the struggle of ordinary people on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike many politicians in this country, I respect the work, the diligence and the hands-on research and compassion of Australian expatriate journalist John Pilger. People often try to downgrade his comments because they are challenging and uncomfortable. I will conclude with the positive aspects of his letter which was printed in the Sydney Morning Herald today:</PARA>
<PARA> By recognising Phnom Penh, the Australian Government would give a significant lead to many governments with deep misgivings about the UN plan. It would not be long, I believe, before Pol Pot was excluded from both the diplomatic chain he has used so effectively and the ``peace process'' over which he has been allowed to operate a veto. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, Australia could build on its good relations with the Thai Government and give all support to Premier Chatichai's courageous efforts to get rid of the Khmer Rouge from Thai soil and to reach out to Phnom Penh. I say courageous, because Washington has repeatedly threatened to cut off trade preferences to the Thais if they continue with their peace initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a clear statement by Senator Evans, calling on China to cut all its links with Pol Pot, would reinforce the isolation of Asia's Nazis. If the Australian Government wants to be remembered for other than obsequiousness to great power interests, now is the time. Wait much longer, Senator Evans, and it will be simply too late for a nation which desperately needs all our help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All senators are looking for a peaceful and stable outcome for the people of Cambodia. We in the Opposition recognise that the proposal by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) a year ago for a comprehensive settlement is an ideal solution. Our concern all through this year, when it was seen that there was an initial failure for the comprehensive plan to be accepted by the four factions, and even after the acceptance by the P5 and the Paris conference, was that it was still not going to be achieved. Our scepticism has grown to the point where we are looking at a more realistic or more achievable way of gaining the stability, the settlement, the peace and the democracy for the people of Cambodia to which we all aspire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the debate which has occurred internationally and in this chamber, where the keenest alternative to the Government's comprehensive plan has been that put forward by the Opposition, in particular through Senator Hill, there has now come this opportunity for the Foreign Minister to put down another statement on the situation in Cambodia. I recognise that, for the first time, it directly addresses the criticisms which many around the world, not least the Opposition, have made of Senator Evans's proposals in the comprehensive plan. That centres around the assessment of the Khmer Rouge. It is because there is not a genuine trust in this plan as a result of the past and present role of the Khmer Rouge that it has been essential, we have argued, for the Australian Government and for all governments to contemplate a solution that excludes the Khmer Rouge. It is that alternative that has been here addressed for the first time by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there is nothing new in the Minister's statement, whilst there are no new initiatives, whilst there is no announcement even of his own plan to visit Cambodia-as was speculated in the newspapers over recent days-whilst there is no answer to the specific questions that I put earlier this week in Question Time to the Minister about Cambodia, and whilst there is a great deal in the statement that has no real significance at all, the element that is new and that is significant is that the Minister is trying to address the question of the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA> There are hints in the ministerial statement put forward today of a plan B, a second alternative, and that that second alternative is the view the Opposition has been advocating as an option for consideration by this country and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the remarks of my colleague Senator Hill earlier in this debate. I share the emphasis he places upon realistic assessments and not just `hope so' statements. The position of the Australian Government and of Senator Evans is still a `hope so' position. Senator Schacht, who supported the Minister, finished his speech by saying, `I certainly hope so'. I think that is the theme of Government speakers and, indeed, of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement, along with the comprehensive plan announced a year ago, is a `hope so' statement. I feel that we have not been given in this statement any basis, any ground, for believing that that `hope so' statement will be achieved. We must come to terms with a realistic assessment of the Khmer Rouge and the connection of the Khmer Rouge with China. I wish to address my remarks chiefly to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that there has been no answer to the three questions I put very directly to the Minister last Tuesday. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the question I asked and the answer given by the Minister, Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and concerns Cambodia. I refer to reports that Khmer Rouge military activity is escalating, especially in the western region, including Siem Reap province, and also directed to control one of the two major east-west roads in Cambodia. In view of the Government's support for the Khmer Rouge and this faction's inclusion in the settlement process, I ask: firstly, what arrangements in the settlement process have been agreed on in order to disarm and contain the Khmer Rouge? Secondly, what mechanisms are in place to prevent Pol Pot and his deputies from returning to power? Is it in fact the case that the P5 agreement provides no assurances at all? Finally, is it true that Son Sen, one of the Khmer Rouge representatives on the Supreme National Council, is a Pol Pot deputy and allegedly responsible for gross human rights violations during their period in power?</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a gross caricature of the Government's position-or anyone's position-to describe support for the United Nations peace plan as involving support for the Khmer Rouge. The matter in issue is support for a peace proposal that will genuinely bring comprehensive, lasting and durable peace to that country in a way that no other peace proposal so far identified is capable of doing, bearing in mind the necessity for any successful peace proposal to take out of the picture external sources of supply, in particular to the Khmer Rouge, which are crucial in maintaining that particular group's role and influence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many questions are raised by Senator Teague's multipronged question. I am proposing to deliver in this place on Thursday a major ministerial statement on the whole subject of Cambodia. Those questions will all be addressed in that statement. Until then I think I will ask Senator Teague and anyone else who is interested to hang on to their hats. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Senator Hill has already analysed the lack of answers to these three questions that I put only two days ago. I note that there have been no answers even though in my question I directly addressed the difficulties with the Khmer Rouge. We have felt this way for many months. The Minister, in his statement today, is directly addressing his own assessments of the Khmer Rouge, but he did not have the information or he did not wish to put on public record any answers to the specific questions that the Opposition is addressing with regard to the Khmer Rouge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To that extent, the statement today is disappointing: it is not comprehensive; it does not satisfy the Opposition; it does not answer, for example, our concern that there is no mechanism in the P5 agreements or in any of the solutions put forward by the Paris conference or, indeed, by Senator Evans's plan to exclude Pol Pot and the others most responsible for the genocide of the Cambodian people; it does not answer the particular status of Son Sen, who is one of the representatives of the Khmer Rouge on the Supreme National Council; it does not address the question of whether the Australian Government will take any action in the International Court of Justice for genocide against the Khmer Rouge leadership; and it does not give any reassurance at all to the Opposition in its concerns about the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Minister's statement today about Cambodia there is nothing new, there is no new initiative. It is a defensive statement. It is also a `hope so' statement. The comprehensive plan which we in the Opposition recognise as an ideal solution, given the present circumstances in that troubled country, is so distant from being realised, as it has been all of the months of this year, that it remains a `hope so' statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The key to the Minister's statement is those pages after page 13 which address the questions that have been raised about the Australian-United Nations peace plan. It is in an attempt to answer questions that have been raised by the Opposition in this chamber, and similar questions that have been raised internationally, that the Minister, Senator Evans, has brought down this statement today. He is seeking to defend the ideal that he has put forward as a solution, as Australia's suggestion to the international community and to the four factions involved in Cambodia, to find a stable and peaceful outcome for that country. </PARA>
<PARA> As one in the Opposition who has raised the questions that the Minister has set out here and attempts to defend his position by answering, I am not convinced and I am not reassured. I am glad that he has begun to address those questions. As I was saying before the suspension of the sitting, for the first time, there is in this statement an attempt by the Minister, Senator Evans, to put forward a transition to plan B. plan A is the comprehensive plan. Plan B is a solution that excludes the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not trust the Khmer Rouge. I do not believe the majority of the Cambodian people trust the Khmer Rouge. How can they? Not only did the Khmer Rouge kill more than a million of their own people but also, even now they are excluded to defensive positions as bases for their guerrilla warfare against the present Government in Phnom Penh. They are torturing, maiming, killing and destroying the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it impossible that even Senator Evans can trust the Khmer Rouge. It is the distrust that the Australian people feel towards this brutalising group of extremists that leads to the scepticism that we have sought to address, not out of any wish to detract from Australia contributing a solution to this unhappy country, but in order to stir the Minister and this Government to be realistic, and to see that several options need to be considered at once. One option is the comprehensive plan that Australia has initiated, but that was a year ago. Another option is a solution that excludes the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in the statement we have before us we have the first signs of the Minister building a bridge to plan B. This will allow him in the months ahead, as events develop, to start to define, along with other countries and especially the Cambodian people, a solution that I will now try, for my own part, to define. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if the Khmer Rouge are vetoing a comprehensive plan they ought to be shown, by the international community and by the other factions, that a solution may be found that does exactly exclude them and that will lead to the necessity for the other three factions, together with international support, to beat the Khmer Rouge on the battlefield. The only substantial support for the Khmer Rouge is the Chinese Government's supply of ammunition and military equipment. I mention China, and I note that Senator Vallentine also mentioned China. In his statement, on page 14 especially but in other parts, too, the Minister addresses the connection between the Khmer Rouge and China. In fact, he builds his comprehensive plan-plan A-on the basis that he believes that China is likely not to accept any other way forward but the comprehensive plan, that is, a plan that is agreeable and agreed to by the Khmer Rouge. Page 14 of the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA>The simple truth of the matter is that unless and until China is prepared to withdraw from the picture-and only the UN peace plan seems capable of delivering that-then whatever Australia and other countries choose to do, the continuation of bloody civil war is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister in his statement today is saying that China, it appears, is only prepared to withdraw and not supply the Khmer Rouge with military equipment and ammunition if there is a comprehensive plan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in this carefully written statement the Minister, Senator Evans, uses the word `seems'. He is not sure. He thinks this is the most likely situation, but he is not sure. Why is he not sure? Because for some 18 months now he has not talked seriously to China, apart from speaking to the Foreign Minister in a brief meeting on 1 October in New York, just a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In my concluding remarks I wish to call upon the Minister, Senator Evans, and this Government to begin again a dialogue with China. I believe that alternative Chinese responses need to be explored by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it needs to be tested as to whether there will be grounds on which the Chinese will cease to supply military equipment and ammunition to the Khmer Rouge. I am not extraordinarily hopeful that ideal solutions will emerge in this matter. Frankly, this question of Cambodia is the one significant area in which I have disagreed with Chinese foreign policy statements. There are so many issues over the last 10 years, in the period when Deng Xiaoping has been ascending, and when China has been looking to the outside world and concentrating on its own economic development, in which we have agreed with China. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an extraordinary parallel in the views of Australia and the views of China on foreign policy matters. We have both sought to see the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics withdraw from Afghanistan; to withdraw from Vietnam; to withdraw its aid through Vietnam in its occupation of Cambodia over the last decade; and to withdraw its armaments and military deployment around China. There has been a parallel view in seeking solutions with some justice for Third World countries; in attitudes to world economic issues; in China's attitudes to its own region in the Far East; and in its very friendly foreign policy towards this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In all those issues I include the present end of the Cold War and the attitude of China, as a member of the Permanent Five, in contributing with all the other nations of the world to a solution in the Gulf. I welcome the areas of agreement with China, but over the last 10 years this one issue has stood out as being an extraordinary problem in any dialogue between Australia and China. It is an area that we have not sufficiently addressed. I call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs to reopen the dialogue that was cut off by the Tiananmen Square massacre on 4 June last year and to begin to talk to China, not least for the reason of gaining a sensible set of direct inputs from it on the question of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are other reasons to talk to China at this time. There is the call that Australians want to make to China to see international standards and human rights established in that country. If we take the ball and run away, if we isolate ourselves from any kind of discussion with China at the ministerial level, how do we know what opportunities we are missing? In fact, the Opposition knows because we went there in September. Party delegations from the coalition went as well in October and in November. We know, first hand, that there may be fruitful outcomes in Cambodia. We know that there are fruitful outcomes with regard to economic relations between our countries, with regard to the Gulf and with regard to a range of international questions. In this question of Cambodia, as much as in the domestic and other international matters involving Australia and China, the Minister's statements here, his assertions, should be tested by direct dialogue with Chinese Ministers and other representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> China is in a transition period at the moment where the straightforward, genuine statements of a friend such as Australia will be listened to. It is possible for us to put our position on Cambodia clearly to the Chinese leaders and, I believe, see China come to a position where it no longer supplies the weapons of war to anybody in Indo-China, including the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It is the burden of the Australian relationship with China that the Minister has rightly identified in his analysis of the Khmer Rouge in his statement today. I believe that what I have been calling plan B depends upon China. That in turn depends upon us, as a nation, having dialogue with that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that, on balance, this Government statement by Senator Evans on Cambodia has nothing new to say, announces no new initiatives and continues to defend the comprehensive plan announced a year ago. The operative word is `defend' because it is not fresh, it is not initiating; it is in fact a defence which leaves open the analysis of moving to plan B, to a comprehensive solution that sees free and open internationally supervised elections in Cambodia after the exclusion of the Khmer Rouge. In all realism, we must explore that second option, the option which the Opposition has put forward over the last year, at the same time as the `hope-so' option that the Minister has put forward as the comprehensive plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is of the essence. There is a deterioration in the Hun Sen Government's position in Cambodia. There is a curtailing of aid from the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which are in no position, given their domestic circumstances, or even their political inclinations these days, to be of the assistance that they have been over the last decade to Cambodia through Vietnam. Those days have gone. The Hun Sen Government is very much by itself. It is with a short window of opportunity that we will see a just and democratic outcome for the people of Cambodia. That is why I, as yet another Opposition senator, put forward this second alternative, this plan B, this more realistic approach, and urge the Government to give it close attention. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTALITIES (APPLICATION OF LAWS) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill is substantially the same as the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1989 which was introduced into the Senate on 26 September 1989 and which lapsed with the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The title has been changed because the new Bill contains a provision to clarify the position concerning the application of Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territory laws to State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of the Bill is to make clear what kinds of State and Territory laws apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. In particular, it is designed to resolve long-standing uncertainties as to the extent of the Commonwealth's implied constitutional immunities from State law, and to remove problems created by a decision of the High Court in 1986 concerning section 64 of the Judiciary Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The legal position of the Commonwealth in relation to State legislation is at present very unclear. The Commonwealth has acted on the view-supported in a number of High Court judgments-that, because of implications in the Constitution, the Commonwealth, its servants and agents and many of its instrumentalities have extensive immunities from State legislation. However, there has been longstanding uncertainty as to the scope of these immunities. For example, in 1953 in The Commonwealth v Bogle (1953) 89 CLR 229 at pages 259-260, Mr Justice Fullagar, whose view was shared by 3 other Justices, including the then Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon, said that a State Parliament `has no power over the Commonwealth' but added that the Commonwealth may become `affected' by State laws. These principles have been subjected to criticism by some eminent writers. A proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to the matter of Commonwealth immunities was discussed at the 1985 Brisbane meeting of the Constitutional Convention but no agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States. In its final report in 1988 the Constitutional Commission recommended that no alteration should be made to the Constitution in this respect, recognising that the matter could be addressed through Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In the early years of Federation the Commonwealth Parliament addressed the issue of the Commonwealth's immunities in the particular area of civil liability. Interim legislation was enacted in 1902 modelled on colonial legislation which provided remedies against the Crown. This legislation was replaced, in substantially similar terms, by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 which is still in force. It provides that-</PARA>
<PARA> `in any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject'.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 64 applies only to civil proceedings to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party. In criminal proceedings under State law the legal position depends on other Commonwealth legislation and on the scope of the Commonwealth's implied immunities. </PARA>
<PARA>Until 1986 the Commonwealth acted on the view that section 64 of the Judiciary Act had a very limited effect in subjecting the Commonwealth to legislation to which it was not otherwise subject. Much Commonwealth and Territory legislation was drafted on that basis. However, the High Court's decision in The Commonwealth v Evans Deakin Industries Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 254, means that section 64 of the Judiciary Act subjects the Commonwealth, and also Commonwealth instrumentalities, to a wide range of State and Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. Section 64 can even subject the Commonwealth to State legislation that does not bind the State, and in some cases to Commonwealth legislation that would not otherwise apply to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>This result was almost certainly not intended by the Parliament that enacted the Judiciary Act in 1903 at a time well before the burgeoning of legislation of all kinds. As a result of the Evans Deakin decision, the Commonwealth is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the States might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. The decision in Evans Deakin would also apply to self-governing Territory legislation and to Imperial legislation still in force in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In the interests of the community, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, the legal position should be clarified and those risks removed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has examined various alternative solutions to the problem. One approach considered was to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislation and instruments that should, or should not, apply to the Commonwealth. However, that approach would be impracticable. Very substantial resources would be needed to monitor existing and new State Acts, self-governing Territory Acts and subordinate legislation (including local government legislation). There would inevitably be delays pending the enactment of the Commonwealth legislation. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth could have incurred obligations or liabilities, or rights could have accrued, where particular State laws had inappropriately applied to the Commonwealth. It would be undesirable to seek to avoid such obligations or rights by means of retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that the only feasible approach is to specify in an Act some classes of State and self-governing Territory legislation (defined to include any relevant continuing Imperial legislation) that should apply to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, and to have regulation-making powers to deal with other classes of laws and with any special problems-the regulations being subject, of course, to Parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. This provides the necessary flexibility to respond quickly to new State or self-governing Territory legislation. The Bill follows this course. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to outline the main provisions of the Bill. I mention, first, that the Bill treats self-governing territories other than the Australian Capital Territory-that is, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island-as though they were States. The position under Australian Capital Territory laws is not affected by the Bill since those laws are either covered by section 27 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 or are Ordinances made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 that can, if necessary, be amended by the Governor-General in Council to clarify the position of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill set out exhaustively, except in relation to Australian Capital Territory laws, the extent to which the Commonwealth is to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Bill any changes in the existing position will only apply to events or circumstances occurring after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill. Also, a State, Northern Territory or Norfolk Island law will be applied to the Commonwealth only if the relevant State or Territory is itself bound by that law. </PARA>
<PARA>Under clause 5, the Commonwealth will continue to be subject to Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territory legislation that is expressed to bind the Commonwealth or otherwise shows an intention to do so. In this respect clause 5, in providing that the Commonwealth is not bound unless the law discloses an intention to bind the Commonwealth, reproduces the general rule as recently decided by the High Court in Bropho v Western Australia (1990) 93 ALR 207. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the following classes of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation are applied by the Bill itself to the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA> (l) legislation concerning procedure in civil litigation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) legislation codifying, modifying or extending the common law with respect to liability in tort. State legislation on contributory negligence in actions for damages for negligence is one of many examples of such laws concerning tort liability. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of laws codifying, modifying or extending the common law of tort the Bill makes an exception for provisions declared by regulations not to apply to the Commonwealth. This will enable the Commonwealth to be exempted from unforeseeable kinds of State or Territory legislation, although any accrued rights existing at the commencement of the regulations will not be affected (see clause 14(2)). The Government will consult the Governments of the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island concerning any proposals to make regulations to exempt the Commonwealth from laws that would otherwise be applied to the Commonwealth by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides for other State, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island laws to apply to the Commonwealth if prescribed by regulations under the proposed Act. Since the contents of future legislation cannot be predicted, the Government does not consider it appropriate for legislation falling outside the listed categories to be automatically applied to the Commonwealth. The only feasible approach is to include a regulation-making power to include further State and self-governing Territory legislation. When required, regulations can be made quickly, but will still be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. The regulations will be able to make appropriate modifications to the applied State and self-governing Territory provisions (see clause 6). </PARA>
<PARA>Laws applied to the Commonwealth by a provision of the Act or pursuant to a regulation would, by virtue of clause 13, apply only from the commencement of that provision or of that regulation (unless the regulation provides otherwise in accordance with sub-clause 13 (3)). </PARA>
<PARA>Regulations would be made so as to apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth personnel the provisions of the general motor traffic laws (except in so far as they provide, for instance, for the licensing of vehicles). This will preserve the present position according to the longstanding High Court decision in Pirrie v McFarlane (1925) 36 CLR 170. The Government does not intend that this Bill should be used as a means for the Commonwealth to avoid the operation of such laws. A similar comment applies, of course, to the application of general criminal laws to Commonwealth servants and agents. </PARA>
<PARA>Until special occupational health and safety legislation is enacted by the Commonwealth, regulations will also be made so as to apply occupational safety laws to the Commonwealth for the purpose of making the Commonwealth subject to an action in tort for damages for breach of a statutory duty. The Commonwealth will therefore continue to be civilly liable under these laws so that the practical result will be the same as in Strods v The Commonwealth [1982] 2 NSWLR 192 where the employee succeeded in an action against the Commonwealth on the basis of section 64 of the Judiciary Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of difficulties in formulating an appropriate general description of the classes of contract laws that are to apply to the Commonwealth, the Government has decided to apply to the Commonwealth specific classes of contract laws by the regulations. Examples of laws that will be applied by regulations include sale of goods laws, the Statute of Frauds concerning the enforceability of contracts, laws with respect to unconscionable contracts and laws with respect to the frustration of contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>Regulations will also be made applying State laws to the Commonwealth for the securing of the payment of moneys payable to sub-contractors. The provisions of such a State law-the Subcontractors' Charges Act 1974 (Qld)-were held by the High Court in the Evans Deakin case to have been applied to the Commonwealth by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903. Although many of the consequences of that decision are considered by the Commonwealth to be undesirable, the particular law in question in that case is of a kind that, in general, should apply to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will be consulting the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island to identify the various additional classes of State or Territory legislation that they would wish to see applied to the Commonwealth by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 7 contains provisions for determining the extent to which Commonwealth servants and agents are to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill deal with the application of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws to Commonwealth corporations. While some Commonwealth corporations such as the Australian Postal Commission share the Commonwealth's immunities from State legislation, many do not do so, especially if engaged primarily in commercial activities. However, it is often very uncertain whether a particular statutory corporation shares the Commonwealth's immunities. The present tests involve factors such as the degree of Ministerial control. They are very difficult to apply. The Government believes that any Commonwealth statutory corporation should be immune from State legislation only to the extent (if any) provided by or under the legislation establishing the corporation or other legislation. However, the Bill provides that, in respect of laws existing at the commencement of the proposed Act, immunity can be given by regulations made under the Act before its commencement. Such commencement would be deferred by clause 2 (2) for one year to give time for the making of such regulations in all appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA>The Repatriation Commission, which is, in substance, a Department of the Commonwealth, is treated under the Bill as part of the Commonwealth rather than as a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 11 of the Bill provides in effect that, in deciding whether a Commonwealth written law applies to a State or self-governing Territory (including the Australian Capital Territory), the same rule of interpretation will apply as in deciding whether a Commonwealth written law applies to the Commonwealth itself. The rule is that the law will not apply unless it discloses an intention to bind the State or self-governing Territory. This accords with the recent High Court decision in Bropho v Western Australia (1990) 93 ALR 207. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 12 contains provisions for determining the extent to which agents or servants of a State or self-governing Territory are to be subject to laws of the Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 13 limits the retrospective operation of laws applied under the Act. Clause 14 confers regulation-making powers for the purposes of the Bill and contains provisions that will ensure the preservation of accrued rights and liabilities where, pursuant to regulations under the Act, laws cease to apply to the Commonwealth or other persons. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 15 of the Bill provides for complementary amendments to section 64 of the Judiciary Act. Section 64 will cease to operate in relation to rights created by a written law where the Commonwealth is not subject to the provisions of that law in accordance with the Bill or otherwise. The States will also be placed on the same footing as the Commonwealth in relation to section 64. However, section 64 will continue to apply in relation to unwritten laws-for example, the common law of tort which, in the absence of section 64, would not apply to the Commonwealth or a State because of the maxim that the Crown `can do no wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>Purpose of Bill</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill is for an Act to establish a statutory authority, to be called the Australian Sports Drug Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide this country with an independent body to conduct a comprehensive drug testing and educational program for Australian sport. The establishment of the Agency is an integral part of the Government's commitment to achieve drug free sport in this country and to contribute to the global ``clean-up'' of sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out the objects, functions and powers of the Agency. It also covers a wide range of issues relating to the management and operation of the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> On 19 May 1988, the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts received the following reference:</PARA>
<PARA>``the use by Australian sportsmen and sportswomen of performance enhancing drugs and the role played by Commonwealth agencies''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee produced an Interim Report, in May 1989, and a Second Report, in May 1990, that in total stretch to over 1,000 pages. It has made 65 recommendations that are far reaching, touching on all the issues of concern in this problem area. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to emphasise the Government's resolve to address the problem of drugs in sport. The use of performance enhancing drugs in sport is cheating. It is totally against the values that we have in Australia-the value of fair play, the value of reward for excellence and for dedication. We have a proud sporting record that has been built on the notion of fair play-of the best athlete winning, not the athlete with the best chemist. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say, Mr President, that the Government has accepted and already implemented the key recommendation of the Committee-namely the establishment of a comprehensive drug testing program. It has achieved this by establishing the Australian Sports Drug Agency as an extension of the Australian Sports Commission's Anti Drugs Program. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Agency is functioning most effectively, there is a need to ensure the organisational, legal and financial independence of the Agency by establishing it as a statutory authority. The drug testing agency must be, and must be seen to be, totally divorced from any direct involvement in sports administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government response to the Senate Committee's reports was tabled in the Senate on 7 November. That document indicated the Government's intention to introduce this Bill to establish the Australian Sports Drug Agency as a statutory authority, thereby guaranteeing its independence, and Parliamentary scrutiny of its activities. This legislation is a further indication of this Government's continuing commitment to the task of eliminating drug use in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>Major Features of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill outlines the objectives of the Agency, which are:</PARA>
<PARA>* to encourage the practice of sport free from the use of drugs;</PARA>
<PARA>* to encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community at large about the dangers of using drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>* to provide leadership in the development of a national strategy on drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>* to encourage the establishment of a centralised drug sampling and testing program that exposes all competitors to drug sampling and testing at short notice both at sporting events and during training;</PARA>
<PARA>* to encourage State and Territory Governments and national, State and Territory sporting organisations to adopt uniform drug sampling and testing procedures;</PARA>
<PARA>* to encourage the development and maintenance of drug testing laboratories accredited by the International Olympic Committee; and</PARA>
<PARA>* to promote and encourage the adoption, at international level, of uniform sampling and testing procedures, and of educational programs relating to the use of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill defines the functions of the Agency, which include:</PARA>
<PARA>* the maintenance of an up-to-date schedule of prohibited performance enhancing drugs and doping methods. This will be the internationally recognised List of Doping Classes and Methods developed by the International Olympic Committee;</PARA>
<PARA>* the establishment and maintenance of a Register of Defaulting Competitors;</PARA>
<PARA>* the dissemination of information about likely penalties and testing procedures;</PARA>
<PARA>* the selection of competitors, times and places for testing;</PARA>
<PARA>* the collection of samples and arrangements for testing;</PARA>
<PARA>* the development and implementation of educational programs;</PARA>
<PARA>* the encouragement of uniform policies domestically and internationally on drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>* the confirmation of Australia's compliance with international agreements on drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>* the conduct of research into drug use in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>* the promotion of sports medicine and sports science research; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the establishment of a national information service and the provision of advice to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also defines the powers that the Agency will have to undertake its activities and provides for the appointment by the Minister of a Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Chief Executive and not fewer than one nor more than three other Members of the Agency to exercise these powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should also note the powers and responsibilities of the Minister in relation to the Agency. The Government wishes to ensure that the Agency will work within the framework of Government objectives and policies. The Agency will be required to submit estimates for its proposed annual budget, produce an annual report, an annual operational plan and a strategic plan each of which must be approved by the responsible Minister. Its financial affairs will also be subject to scrutiny by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions, together with those allowing the Minister to issue directions to the Agency and to seek information on specific activities, will ensure a proper degree of Ministerial overview and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill has been framed following widespread consultation with interested parties including the interim Agency, the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Olympic Committee, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association, the Human Rights Commission and the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation reflects the privacy and human rights principles laid down in other Commonwealth legislation. In particular, only those who need to have access to information will be informed. The names of competitors who return a positive test result or who fail to provide a sample will not be published. The Government has also been concerned to protect the rights of athletes and has built into this legislation certain appeal rights to ensure athletes are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues of protection of individuals' rights, the right of appeal and the process of investigation have also been raised with State sports Ministers and umbrella sports bodies such as the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and all have undertaken to develop policies consistent with the principles adopted by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The State and Territory sports Ministers have also undertaken to seek the introduction of complementary legislation once this legislation has commenced.</PARA>
<PARA> The Agency will be established as an independent testing authority. In taking this position the Government is conscious of the need to separate the testing process from the broader issue of the policy of drugs in sport. It was decided to provide the Agency with a relatively narrow and virtually non-discretionary role-namely the thorough and professional application of internationally approved drug sampling and testing procedures to detect drugs on the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances and the notification of positive test results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to be in a position where the registering by the Agency of an athlete's name on the Register of Defaulting Competitors means only that he or she has recorded a positive test or failed to provide a sample. The issues of guilt or innocence, inadvertent or deliberate use, length of sanction, Commonwealth view on the appropriateness of the sanction and so on are therefore issues for Government and non-government authorities other than the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agency, therefore, will not be undertaking a range of related functions such as developing sports drug policies, liaising with law enforcement agencies, adjudicating on penalties imposed by sporting federations or conducting investigations, which the Senate Committee recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that these are more properly within the province of organisations other than the Agency. For example, drugs policy at Federal level is better handled by the Australian Sports Commission and by my Department in liaison with other Federal, State and Territory authorities. National sporting organisations also have a role to play in imposing penalties and giving athletes a fair hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Agency will not isolate itself from these broader issues. It will draw upon key areas of expertise such as the medical, legal, sporting and health education communities. It will have an international role in enhancing testing processes, bilateral and multilateral agreements, updating of the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances and so on. It will have a significant education role. It will be involved, with the Australian Sports Commission, in discussions with national sporting bodies on uniform doping policies and sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The strategic and annual operational plan requirements are in line with the Government's commitment to overall financial management improvement within the public sector. In its strategic plan the Agency will be required to develop broad objectives in performing its functions and the manner in which it proposes to perform its functions. Ministerial endorsement and tabling of the plan in both Houses will be required. </PARA>
<PARA> The administrative and operational expenses relating to staff, travel, meetings, and day-to-day running costs of the Agency will be determined annually in the Budget. The Agency's budget in 1990/91 is $2.143 million which includes provision for 2,000 ``public interest'' tests to be fully funded from the Agency's budget. Tests additional to these will largely be requested by professional sports under contract to the Agency and will be conducted on a ``fee for service'' basis. It is hoped that this market will be progressively enlarged to include neighbouring countries as they develop their own drug testing programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this legislation is further evidence of this Government's commitment to sport and its willingness to take positive steps to assist Australian sportsmen and sportswomen achieve their true potential by competing on an equal basis. The elimination of drugs in sport remains one of the key objectives of this Government. I am sure Senators on both sides of this House want to ensure that the long held Australian traditions of honesty and a fair go in sport are preserved for our children. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this legislation is an integral step in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND CHARGES COLLECTION BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the first in a package of Bills relating to the collection of Primary Industries levies and charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make provisions to enable measures which will allow more cost effective and efficient levy collection techniques to be utilized. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1988 this Government introduced measures to allow the Commonwealth to be reimbursed, out of industry funds, for expenses incurred in relation to the collection of the many levies, export charges and taxes and for other administrative expenses. These measures have meant that the Government has had to seek means, at industry insistence, to reduce the burden to industry, since initially the effect was to increase costs and in some cases cause hardship. This Bill and the complementary consequential provisions Bill have been designed bearing this primary aim in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>Other aims are to allow those required to pay small amounts to take the option of making larger accumulated payments over longer periods of time, to allow for regulations, as nominated by industry bodies, which provide for various optional collection methods and to obtain a consistency of approach to procedural matters currently embodied in more than 30 acts. </PARA>
<PARA>A review of all levies and charges collection legislation showed that while many administrative provisions were similar in all of the existing Acts, many required updating, some not having been upgraded since 1962. It is on this basis that this Bill has been developed. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides one act which will deal with all Primary Industries levy and charge collection, thus enabling a uniformity of collection procedures which was previously not possible due to the large number of collection Acts in existence. </PARA>
<PARA>I now come to the main provisions in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Most levies and charges are payable by the producer (or grower) of the produce. In order to reduce the costs of collection, particularly by reducing the number of collection points, the Bill provides that for the better securing of the payment of levy or charge, moneys may be collected from intermediaries (such as first purchasers, agents or exporters) on behalf of the producers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill stipulates that the Commonwealth may enter into collection agreements with States and Territories, and other collection organisations subject to full consultation with industry groups. Such agreements will assist in meeting the goal to keep costs to an absolute minimum by significantly reducing the number of collection points. </PARA>
<PARA>New levies and charges which may from time to time be implemented may be prescribed by regulation. In addition there are provisions which will allow for a greater flexibility in due dates for payment, and the introduction of techniques adopted recently in the horticultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Revised provisions for imposing penalty for late payment of levy or charge have been included reflecting changes in debt collection techniques.Powers of authorised persons seeking returns and information as well as for those carrying out field audits and investigations, have been modernised. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill allows for an authorised person to publish certain information to specified bodies permitting proper administration of each levy or charge scheme. This provision is required to cover the requirements of the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA>There are also enhanced but simplified methods to allow reconsideration and review of decisions in relation to remission of penalty for late payment and in certain other cases. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier this Bill achieves an aim, of which many legislators will be envious, the consolidation of more than 30 Acts into one. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Commonwealth now recovers all costs of collection there are no net financial implications arising from this or the associated consequential provisions Bill. Any savings which are achieved will be immediately passed back to the relevant participating industries via reduced costs. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND CHARGES (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the companion Bill to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make the consequential amendments to each of the Levy and Charge Imposition Acts needed following on from the main collection Bill outlined earlier. The specific amendments to each Act are contained in schedule 1 to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the provisions in this act are of a technical nature and arise because of the vastness of the scope of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990. Each of the Levy and Charge Acts previously had their collection Act incorporated and read as one with it. Such an approach is no longer considered appropriate where a considerable number of imposition Acts are now associated with a single collection Act. Accordingly, a new method allowing for the interpreting of words and phrases is utilised throughout this Bill. There are no financial implications arising from this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL CATTLE DISEASE ERADICATION TRUST ACCOUNT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This is the third Bill in the package relating to the collection of Primary Industries levies and charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the continued existence of the national cattle disease eradication trust account. The existing provisions contained in the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964 are being re-enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is necessary following repeal of that Act through the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Provisions) Bill presented earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The trust account facilitates the financial operations of the national program for cattle disease eradication. </PARA>
<PARA>There are no financial implications arising from this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators, and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Knowles) adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator McMullan)-by leave-agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1990 and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill 1990 be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day. </PARA>

<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's Response to the Recommendations in the Report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade</PARA>
<PARA> Third World Debt: An Australian View</PARA>
<PARA> December 1990</PARA>
<PARA>BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA>The Report arises from a reference given to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on 1 December 1987 calling for an inquiry and report on:</PARA>
<PARA>Appropriate Australian policy responses to the present international trade and financial situation, including debt, and, in particular, measures Australia could take to improve its own balance of trade in goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report was tabled in November 1989 together with a minority report dissenting from the findings and recommendations of the Report. A further report dealing with the Australian current account deficit and overseas debt will be tabled later. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian banks are not major lenders to heavily indebted third world countries and the scope for unilateral Australian action in relation to third world debt is limited. Nevertheless, Australia has humanitarian and foreign policy interests in the smooth resolution of the debt problems, and an important stake in the continued stability of the world economy and international financial markets. Moreover, we also believe that the problem of third world debt is not solely attributable to the policies of developing country governments and it is in the interests of all countries to promote a sustainable solution of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report envisages Australia promoting the interests of third world debtors in relevant international bodies of which Australia is a member, particularly the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). </PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSES TO THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R1. the Government, through its IMF Governor and through requests to the Executive Director representing Australia in the IMF, strongly urge the IMF to prepare social impact statements in respect of country adjustment programs that it initiates. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee adopts as a recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>R2. the UNICEF strategy of `adjustment with a human face' which aims at appropriately changing productive structures while also emphasising:</PARA>
<PARA>* more expansionary macro-economic policies;</PARA>
<PARA>* concentrating sectoral policy on employment and income earning areas including small farming and informal activities;</PARA>
<PARA>* a greater equity as well as cost effectiveness incomes policies and social programs;</PARA>
<PARA>* compensatory programs to protect health and nutrition of the poor during restructuring</PARA>
<PARA>* closer monitoring of major aspects of living standards, so as to respond more quickly to deprivation;</PARA>
<PARA>* ecological responsibility; and</PARA>
<PARA>* democratic control of economic policy-making. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to Rl and R2:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that international financial institutions (IFIs) such as the IMF and World Bank should discuss social and ecological considerations when negotiating adjustment finance packages with recipient countries, which is already happening. The governors of the IMF and World Bank have stated that essential ingredients in the design and sustainability of successful structural adjustment programs include broad public support and the integration of poverty and environmental considerations. During the replenishment negotiations for the International Development Association (the concessional lending arm of the World Bank) it was agreed that poverty alleviation and the environment would receive higher priority. Nevertheless the distribution among social groups of any austerity measures accompanying a structural adjustment/loan agreement is determined essentially by the political and social priorities of the recipient country. </PARA>
<PARA>There are constraints on the international financial institutions imposing social or political conditions on recipient countries. The IMF is required to pay due regard to the domestic social and political objectives of its members. The World Bank under its articles of agreement is prohibited from interfering in the political affairs of any member, and its decisions are not to be influenced by the political character of a member. As regards appropriate sectoral policy and the extent to which macro-economic policies should be expansionary, these are matters for careful determination in the light of the circumstances of each individual country. The IFIs seek to promote growth-oriented adjustment through their programs, involving structural adjustment conducive to growth and external financing sufficient to support a reasonable rate of growth. They have paid increasing attention to the impact of adjustment program on disadvantaged groups. The Australian Government endorses the World Bank's twin focus on economic growth and measures designed to address poverty alleviation directly. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government therefore accepts these recommendations in part. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee adopts as a recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>R3. the Government examine in detail international financial institutions with respect to the effects of conditionality on democratic policy making. As long as international economic and monetary issues are seen as only technical and abstract subjects which should be left to officials and bankers, some of the most important economic issues which affect the lives of all people are removed from the area of public debate. Greater political involvement of parliamentarians as well as international co-ordination of parliamentary action is a high priority in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R3:</PARA>
<PARA>Programs supported by IFIs are adopted by the governments of the countries involved and it is the governments which carry the political and social responsibility for them. Nevertheless the IFIs, in their dealings with recipient countries, emphasise the importance of public awareness and acceptance of the need for programs as this contributes to a successful outcome. The economic conditions associated with IFI programs are considered technically essential to the attainment of external viability-that is, they are the minimum conditions consistent with success of the adjustment program. In some cases environmental conditions also apply. It would be inappropriate for individual parliamentarians to seek to impose their own political and social views on recipient country governments through the activities of the IFIs. The recommendation is therefore not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R4. in return for this indirect official support, the commercial banks should be required to participate in the debt and debt service reduction proposals, such as the Brady proposal, which are currently being promoted. </PARA>
<PARA>R5. a significant reduction in the amount of world debt stock, with appropriate variation country-by-country depending on ability to pay as measured by export earnings and volume of debt. </PARA>
<PARA>R6. with regard to remaining debt, measures should include, where appropriate:</PARA>
<PARA>* rescheduling principal repayments;</PARA>
<PARA>* reduction of interest rates to concessional levels; and</PARA>
<PARA>* recycling repayments by allowing local currency repayment into reinvestment funds with repatriation constraints (in order to provide investment resources for developing countries as well as limiting outflows). </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R4, R5 R6:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the efforts to provide debt and debt service relief to countries which are incapable of servicing their existing debt in appropriate circumstances. The Brady plan is intended to reduce the cost of debt servicing and such measures as reduction of interest rates on existing debt are included amongst the options. The largest debt reduction and restructuring agreement so far under the Brady plan, between Mexico and its creditor banks, supported by the IMF, the World Bank and Japan, will have the effect of reducing external net transfers by Mexico by more than $US4 billion annually, equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP. Other debt reduction and restructuring agreements under the strengthened international debt strategy include debt buyback and interest reduction packages by Costa Rica, Venezuela and the Philippines; and in principle agreements with commercial bank creditors by Morocco and Uruguay. The Government will maintain its support of these efforts and to that extent accepts the recommendations, but would be concerned that such arrangements should not result in the undue transfer of private risk to the official sector or result in diverting resource flows from developing economies which have maintained their creditworthiness. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R7. the industrialised countries assist the process by co-operative steps including:</PARA>
<PARA>* disclosure by tax authorities in the countries concerned;</PARA>
<PARA>* disincentives to capital flight such as taxation in the country of inflow; and</PARA>
<PARA>* recycling of at least a share of the funds to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R7:</PARA>
<PARA>``Capital flight'', or the shifting of funds from countries in economic difficulties, is a characteristic of highly indebted economies where governments are pursuing inappropriate policies such as overvalued exchange rates (although not limited to such cases). The total value of assets held abroad by residents of those countries has been estimated to be comparable with their combined sovereign debts. However, some capital outflows will be associated with investment abroad providing genuine benefits to the source country, while restrictions on repatriation of capital by foreign investors will discourage desirable investment capital inflows. </PARA>
<PARA>As regards disincentives to capital flight being imposed by developed countries, a basic problem is the difficulty, given the huge volume of international funds transfers, of assessing whether specific individual transactions involve flight capital. Any attempt to regulate flows of flight capital would not only require cooperation by all tax jurisdictions, including tax havens, to be effective. Even then, there would be numerous possibilities for circumvention. The deregulation of many countries' financial systems, and the progressive removal of barriers to international capital movements have further added to the practical difficulties involved in devising effective measures of the kind proposed by the Committee. In any case, Australia is not generally regarded as a common destination for such capital and could not act alone. </PARA>
<PARA>More generally the appropriate response to capital flight is domestic economic measures to increase the attractiveness of local investment, and in that regard the adjustment policies negotiated by the international financial institutions with recipient countries are designed in part to restore the confidence of investors. The proposal is therefore not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R8. the Australian Government in co-operation with other supporting countries such as France should formally recommend to the World Bank that a proposal for a Debt Management Authority (DMA) be prepared for consideration by member countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R8:</PARA>
<PARA>The level of benefits claimed from the establishment of a DMA depends in large measure on the discounts so far observed in the secondary markets for third world debt-which have been dominated by selling pressure-being substantially maintained after the establishment of a DMA. Those discounts have reflected the marginal character of secondary market activity to date and would be driven down by large scale repurchases. The cost of borrowing by the DMA could also be high, given the riskiness of its assets, unless guarantees were given by creditor countries-thereby transferring the risk to their taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>The financial viability of the proposal is therefore not clear-and the Government does not consider that a compelling case for a DMA has been made. The Government supports IFI involvement in the development of the existing procedures whereby debt reduction packages are tailored to the circumstances of individual countries, and which have proved an effective mechanism to provide substantial debt reduction. The proposal is therefore not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R9. the Government implement a policy of rapid growth in Australia's ODA as a proportion of GNP: by 1992 Australian aid should once again stand at 0.5 per cent of GNP. This Committee reiterates this earlier recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R9:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the concerns of the Committee in relation to aid volume and will take these into account in the context of future budget deliberations. However, in the continuing difficult economic environment all additional expenditure proposals must, in the interests of competent economic management, be considered against the full range of Government priorities. Nevertheless, the Government is firmly committed to the objective of at least maintaining present aid volumes in real terms. The Government also remains committed in the longer term to attaining the UN target of an ODA/GNP ratio of 0.7% and, economic circumstances permitting, will seek to expedite progress towards this goal. As the Government has previously stated, Australia's international contribution in aid-related matters is somewhat understated by comparisons of ODA/GNP ratios. For example, our contribution to refugee resettlement has been very much higher in per capita terms than in any other OECD country, but assistance to refugee resettlement is not counted as ODA. In addition, Australia's bilateral ODA is given entirely in the form of grants which provide greater benefit to recipient countries than a similar volume of loans. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R10. the Government vigorously press in international forums for a general increase in ODA from donor countries. </PARA>
<PARA>For low income debtor countries the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>R11. a write down of a significant portion of the Paris Club debt;</PARA>
<PARA>* a moratorium of ten years on all official interest payment obligations;</PARA>
<PARA>* the use of International Development Association terms for these rescheduled payments:</PARA>
<PARA>* that the budgetary costs of these debt reductions be added to aid donor commitments and not be taken from existing aid allocations;</PARA>
<PARA>* that aid donors who have not already done so plan now a program of cancellation of their aid-related debts;</PARA>
<PARA>* significant expansion of concessional resource flows;</PARA>
<PARA>* the development of improved means of encouraging the restoration of eligibility for those countries in arrears to the IMF; and</PARA>
<PARA>* that the IMF consider the sale of a portion of its gold holdings to finance additional multilateral concessional lending to low-income debt-distressed countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R10 and R11:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will continue to support in international fora increased international aid to developing countries, allocated on the basis of established aid criteria. In relation to the third world debt problem, it is particularly appropriate that surplus countries or countries whose banks have substantial exposure in problem debtors should provide increased assistance. For the poorest, most heavily indebted countries the Government has supported the need for special concessions, such as those provided by the Paris Club. The poorest countries are, of course, eligible for concessional financing from the International Development Association, including a special facility to support debt reduction by adjusting countries. The IMF arrears strategy has recently been extensively reviewed and a number of measures are being implemented that are specifically designed to normalise the relationship between the IMF and countries in arrears to it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R12. the Australian Government support calls from other countries for a global conference on international financial reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R12:</PARA>
<PARA>The Report's concerns in relation to this recommendation have to do with the issue of SDRs and access to IMF and World Bank credits for excluded countries. The appropriate fora for discussion of IMF and World Bank matters are, however, the IMF and World Bank. As regards access to IFI credits the Government agrees with the institutions that debtors should demonstrate that they are prepared to carry through the policy reforms which are an essential part of any adjustment package. Provision of funds without a commitment to positive adjustment policies by the recipient member country is not merely an ineffective use of funds, it enables harmful policies to be continued. The recommendation is therefore not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R13.- the task of Australian representation on World Bank bodies should be transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Department. The Committee also considers that Foreign Affairs and Trade representatives will be more sensitive than financial experts or bankers to social, trade and foreign affairs implications of decisions that threaten social stability and have grave environmental and ecological implications. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R13:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has previously indicated that provided that arrangements for Australia's representation at Bank meetings fully reflect the range of policy interests in the Banks and that there is close consultation with Treasury and Foreign Affairs portfolios, there is little to be gained by transferring the governorship of the Banks. The recommendation is therefore not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>R14. other domestic actions which Australia should take should include:</PARA>
<PARA>* reviewing our banking regulations with a view to encouraging private banks to reduce debts;</PARA>
<PARA>* regular reporting by the Treasurer to Parliament on Australia's policy stance in the IMF, World Bank and other international debt forums;</PARA>
<PARA>* establishing a mechanism for consultations between Government and NGOs on Third World debt and other international financial issues; and</PARA>
<PARA>* providing access to policy and background papers by the IMF, World Bank and other international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R14:</PARA>
<PARA>The exposure of Australian banks to highly indebted developing countries was never high, and has been further reduced by secondary market sales in recent years. There is also no impediment in current banking regulations to banks reducing debts should they consider it appropriate. There appears to be no need for a change in Australian banking regulations for the purpose suggested.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer already provides considerable information to the Parliament on Australia's policy stance in the IMF, World Bank and other international debt forums. Opportunities will be taken to supplement this information as appropriate. The Government already consults with non government aid organisations as appropriate. The establishment of a formal mechanism for consultations on international finance issues is not considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of papers from international organisations in general, it would be consistent with the Government's general policy on disclosure of information for papers to be made available unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary. However, papers and reports of the IMF, World Bank and related bodies dealing with recommendations on specific decisions or otherwise relevant to decision making are not usually made publicly available to preserve the confidentiality of the decision-making processes of the institutions and also of the member countries. Where these and similar considerations do not apply, internal papers will be made available. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation is thus accepted in part. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>R15. increased concessional aid flows, support for future general capital increases of the World Bank to increase development lending, doubling of IMF quotas, and similar expansions in the capital base of the regional development banks and of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. </PARA>
<PARA>R.16 The Committee recommends that the Government give strong support to international financial institutions in any actions taken concerning proposals outlined in this report. In particular, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in order significantly to influence decisions made in international financial institutions and in foreign capitals, should apply vigorous diplomatic pressure on other participants at the start of any decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to R15 and R16:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is a firm supporter of the role of the IMF in providing finance and of the World Bank and other development banks in providing loans and technical assistance. It has been active as a member and supported the recent increase in the capital of the World Bank, and has recently voted in favour of a substantial increase in IMF quotes. The Government has also announced that Australia will contribute $A10.5 million to the third replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. It is concerned that these international financial institutions should retain and augment their important roles in providing technical and policy assistance as well as financing. Through its representatives on the boards of the IFIs and in other ways Australia will continue to influence decision making by the institutions to help achieve the most efficient and equitable outcomes possible. </PARA>

It is a Government response to a report which was tabled and presented in the Parliament a year or more ago-paper No. 456 of 1989, completed in November 1989. The report, as the Government's response says, was tabled in November 1989 together with a minority report dissenting from the findings and recommendations of the report. I understand from the Government's response that a further report dealing with the Australian current account deficit and overseas debt will be tabled later. I am sure we will await the receipt of that report with considerable interest. Were I the Government, I would be tabling that report as soon as I possibly could. It is interesting to ask why the further report dealing with our current account deficit and overseas debt is being delayed in its presentation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Given the state of the economy that we have debated at length in recent days, given the statistics that have been coming out in recent weeks, given what we all know about the state of the Australian economy and particularly the situation with our current account deficit and the level of our overseas debt, to which I will come back in my remarks, I would have thought that the prospects of any improvement in those vital indicators of the economic health of this country is whistling in the wind.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. All coalition senators and members shared a dissenting view on many of the major recommendations of the report. The interesting thing in examining the Government's response is that on virtually all matters the Government has come down on the side of the dissenting report recommendations rather than those of the majority report, which was carried on the numbers because the Government has the majority in the Committee. I place it on record that it is very interesting and significant that the Government has rejected the recommendations of its own members of the Joint Standing Committee. I am not sure whether that is without precedent but it may well be. It is certainly very unusual for a government to do that. I think it has done so with very good reason. I share the view of members of the coalition who signed the dissenting report when in their first paragraph they said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report fails to recognise the underlying operation of the commercial banking system around the world in voluntarily mobilising capital funds to seek a profit. If conditions in a developing country do not offer sufficient incentive, needed capital will not be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the majority report, the report signed by the Government members, ignored that basic point. In terms of the development of the Third World and the meaningful attempts to resolve the desperate problems facing many Third World nations in their debt situation, the worst thing we could possibly do to them would be to make them increasingly think that they need to be supplicants of aid. That is not the way to go. The only way to get development in the Third World-and in the developed world-is to have conditions which are conducive to economic growth and development for the further liberalising of world trade. That is why the breakdown in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round of negotiations is so catastrophic for us all. This is the way to go rather than looking at the aid side, as the Government members did in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise just a couple of matters in relation to the report. Although it deals with Third World debt, considering our debt situation in Australia and having looked at the figures, it is not only illuminating but also salutary and alarming to compare our situation with that of many Third World countries on whose debt we are reporting here. Our debt situation is quite clearly running rapidly out of control. Our total external debt now stands at a quite massive $156.3 billion-42 per cent of our total gross domestic product (GDP). That $156.3 billion compares with the figure of $35.9 billion when the Hawke Government came to office just 7 1/2 years ago. During that short period of 7 1/2 years, as a result of this Government's gross mismanagement, Australia's level of debt compared with that of the rest of the world has increased more than fourfold. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more disturbing than the actual absolute level of that debt is the fact that, as a percentage of our gross domestic product, our total annual production, our debt has doubled from 21 per cent of GDP to 42 per cent of GDP over the term of this Government. That puts Australia-I was going to say in the league with low income economies such as Nepal, Chad, India, and Rwanda--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the senator has not had a chance in his busy life to look at the actual figures, but I am citing actual figures. This increase in our foreign debt has occurred despite all of the pain caused by monetary policy, which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said is going to solve our debt problem. Instead, what it has done is destroy the confidence and the capacity of the productive sectors of this economy and it has left our great export and import replacement industries reeling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether the situation is ever going to be reached, but it certainly is high time that the Treasurer admitted the Government's mistakes on the economic policy and put the focus where it is needed to be to solve our debt problems. I do not say this in a party political way; I say it, hopefully, in a bipartisan way: the only way we are going to solve our debt problems in this country is to tackle the supply side of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done, through this excessive reliance on monetary policy, is to clobber demand. What is that going to do when we release the brakes? All it is going to do is bring us back to the cycle that we have had over and over again in the past. Until the Government starts tackling the supply side, until we put the emphasis back on getting our export and import competing industries going again, until we start to tie wages to productivity, until we get on top of our inflation problems, there is going to be no long term improvement in the debt situation in which we find ourselves today. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the average Australian today has any concept of what a problem we have even to stabilise our debt situation. To stabilise Australia's foreign debt situation as a proportion of our gross domestic product by the year 1995, on reasonable assumptions in terms of what the growth will be in that period in our GDP, to get even a stabilisation of our existing enormously high ratios and problems, we will have to move into exports about 3 3/4 to 4 per cent of our total productive activity each year. </PARA>
<PARA> That may not sound a lot but we would have to do it every year for five years. Not in one single year in the post-war period have we been able to achieve that result. That gives us some idea of the enormity of the problem that we now have on our debt side, essentially as a result of the policies of this Government over the last 7 1/2 years-policies for which it makes no excuse, policies which it has no intention to change. If the Government does not change those policies, it will not just have to deal with explaining away the `r' word-as it tried desperately to do until it was unable to do it any longer-it will have to explain away why we became a BR, a banana republic, as a result of those misguided policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch on a couple of points in relation to the Government's response to the report of the Committee. The first relates to Australia's aid program. The majority of the Committee-the coalition members dissented-recommended in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government implement a policy of rapid growth in Australia's ODA as a proportion of GNP: by 1992 Australian aid should once again stand at 0.5 per cent of GNP. This Committee reiterates this earlier recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has responded to that recommendation in the following terms: it notes the concern of the Committee in relation to aid volume and says that it will take this concern into account in the context of future Budget deliberations. However, it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the continuing difficult economic environment all additional expenditure proposals must, in the interests of competent economic management, be considered against the full range of Government priorities</PARA>
<PARA>I support that view, as would the coalition. That view was reflected fairly strongly in the dissenting report by coalition members, but at the same time the coalition continues to support the United Nations role of 0.7 per cent of our gross national product being given in aid. But, like the Government's response, we would say that that has to be looked at in the context of the overall situation facing the Australian economy. The tragedy-not just for Australia, but in terms of what Australia would want to do and should be able to do to assist the development of the Third World-is that the mismanagement of the last 7 1/2 years has left us in a much weaker position to provide the other rational forms of assistance, in the broad sense of the term, that we would wish to see in our relations with the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other recommendation I wish to touch on briefly, but it is an interesting recommendation, is this:</PARA>
<PARA>the task of Australian representation on World Bank bodies should be transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Department. The Committee also considers that Foreign Affairs and Trade representatives will be more sensitive than financial experts or bankers to social, trade and foreign affairs implications of decisions that threaten social stability and have grave environmental and ecological implications. </PARA>
<PARA>We could all have differing views on that. However, it is an important recommendation to be considered. I am not in a position to speak for the coalition on that, but personally I would support the point made by those coalition members who signed the dissenting report. I quote from that report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is essential that international financial bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank continue to impose sensible and appropriate economic policy conditions on countries which use the services of those bodies. These economic policy conditions should include</PARA>
<PARA> * maintenance of realistic exchange rates;</PARA>
<PARA> * cuts in subsidies;</PARA>
<PARA> * realistic food prices to producers to encourage domestic production of food; and</PARA>
<PARA> * expectation of appropriate return on capital for commercial project investment. </PARA>
<PARA>They are important policy conditions that have been mentioned in the dissenting report. The broad response, as I read it, of the Government to the majority recommendation takes a lot of cognisance of that. I think that, in terms of who represents Australia on some of these bodies, some of us may have differing views. It is a matter to which obviously further consideration needs to be given. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks I reiterate the coalition's noting of the Government's response. Overall, the Government has responded in a way that is much more in tune with the recommendations or views of the dissenting members of the Joint Committee report. I welcome that because the dissenting members were the coalition members. I think the report has served a useful purpose. The Government's response was useful. It is a subject with which the Senate does not deal or consider as much as it should. I hope that from time to time we may be able to find the opportunity, in a very crowded program, to give more consideration to some of these very important issues than we often seem to be able to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the Government's response to the recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Third World Debt: An Australian View. It is now three years since the report was commissioned and just over a year since it was tabled, along with a minority report dissenting from the findings and recommendations of the report to which Senator Short has just referred. It is rather disappointing for me to have to note that he is pleased that the Government's responses are generally in line with the dissenting report. This was the subject of some controversy within the Committee and the more generous recommendations which were put forward have not been acceded to. I can understand why Senator Short is pleased, but it certainly does not make me pleased. The aid agencies will not be pleased-the people actually dealing with the recipients of aid who, as a consequence, are the ones who are suffering and dying because of the enormous burden of Third World debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's response indicates that it is prepared to do virtually nothing about Third World debt, and what little support there is for the 16 recommendations will probably gather dust on the shelves, like most reports of this nature. This is highly disappointing and I find it very irresponsible as a Government response. Responding to the 16 recommendations, the Government gives an outright `no' to five of the stronger ones, accepts three recommendations, mumbles about four, and accepts three in part. That is hardly a ringing endorsement and it must be very disappointing indeed to members of the Committee who put in the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the reiteration of the recommendation on restoring aid to 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), there are the same tired old platitudes about waiting for the state of the economy to improve, so I will count that as a `no' as well. In fact, I think it is worse than a `no'; I think that it is very dishonest because it says:</PARA>
<PARA>the Government remains committed in the longer term to attaining the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent, economic circumstances permitting . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we have heard the same thing reiterated now by Senator Short on behalf of the Opposition-the Opposition which, I remind senators, was prepared to cut $100m off the aid budget, or at least that was its plan or promise before the last election. I think it is a really cynical statement that the Government has the intention to get up to the United Nations recommended level. We have seen nothing of that in the past seven years; in fact, we have seen a steadily decreasing amount of the foreign affairs budget going into aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Government is not prepared to do anything really effective to tackle the issue of Third World debt, the silent killer, which is taking away the lives of far more men, women and children than those being lost in any of the 27 or so wars raging around the world at this moment. It is true that Australian banks are not major lenders to heavily indebted Third World countries, but a number of the major international banks do have branches here. I must say that I was not very impressed with their response to the `Fax the Banks Day' organised last month to draw attention to their role in the international debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this report makes equally depressing reading as the Government simply rejects the relatively innocuous recommendations made, at least where they even remotely risk treading on Treasury's toes. There is a `no' to the proposal to set up a debt management authority. There is another `no' to the idea of a global conference on international financial reform. It is pretty extraordinary that the Government is saying `no' to a conference to talk about international financial reform. Surely this is an urgently needed conference, not only for Third World debtor nations but, as Senator Short has so clearly pointed out, in the case of our own nation as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The next strangled `no' is to the idea that Australian representation on World Bank bodies should be transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and to his Department, instead of to the somewhat less sympathetic Treasury. Obviously people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade might have a better understanding of the intricacies of the aid budget and what we might be able to do to improve the situation to assist the debtor nations which are suffering so greatly at the moment. It is hardly surprising that there is little enthusiasm for supporting an increase in overseas aid, either by Australia or other countries. We may be in dire economic straits, or indeed in a recession-now that we can officially call it a recession-but the fact remains that we are far better off than most other countries in the world, particularly the least developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Aid is not just dishing out money to ungrateful Third World countries. Overall, it is an economic fact that the developed countries are actually recipients of aid from the Third World rather than the other way round, if we include the huge interest repayments and the aid money coming back to get spent on goods and services provided by the donors. Much of the overseas aid provided by Australia comes back to this country and, if the economies of our neighbours were to improve, this in turn would generate trade and improve our economy. So, at the very least, we should be increasing aid with a view to enlightened self-interest in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Aid, of course, is not the heart of the problem. The complex issues of international debt, unfair trade practices or commodity pricing arrangements need detailed and critical analysis, some of which were addressed in the Committee's report. Both the so-called free market and the demands of the World Bank and IMF work against the people of the Third World, if not their elites. The status quo results in a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, and that needs to change if we as a global community are going to begin to achieve ecological sustainability, because many of the world's environment problems are driven by poverty, particularly poverty in least developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude by reminding this Government once again of its lamentable record on aid as we sink below the line set to separate the mean countries from the more generous ones and, in particular, the Scandinavians and the Dutch. I have never understood why Australia cannot stand by these countries instead of drifting down to join the meanies, but I know that it will require a lot more development education by the non-governmental organisations such as Community Aid Abroad and the One World Centre, which do so much good work in Western Australia and in other States around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret sounding so negative, but I have to be realistic. I suppose the Government's response today was to be expected, but it is extremely disheartening. My hope now lies in growing support in Australia for the work of the non-governmental agencies that I have just referred to, covering both fundraising and development education. As usual, the people must lead so that governments will follow. International debt is no exception to this rule. We cannot allow the issue of Third World debt to go unaddressed, even if we want to because, in so doing, considering the interconnection of all issues facing all people everywhere, we sow the seeds of our own destruction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the Gulf crisis has been resolved, the major issue which will be facing the world will be the resolution of Third World debt. I regret that neither the original report nor the Government's response is going to contribute significantly towards the resolution of that problem Third World debt is indeed a complex and disturbing problem. The original report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Third World Debt: An Australian View states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is a small industrialised country possessing something in common with developed countries, eg, OECD membership and IMF developed country status. </PARA>
<PARA>It also has a number of similarities with developing countries, especially:</PARA>
<PARA>reliance on commodity exports and serious continuing current account deficits and mounting foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the point that really did hit me through this report is that, though this inquiry was into appropriate Australian policy responses concerning Third World debt, unfortunately, Australia is fast joining the Third World countries. The so-called many characteristics so vividly described as belonging to Third World countries with ever-increasing debt seem to be describing Australia. Earlier this year, Australia was ranked fourth in the world of the top 10 debtor nations after Brazil, Mexico and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Australia's economy, with its reliance on primary products, bears more in relation to the average indebted developing country-for example, 72 per cent of exports are primary products-than the average industrial economy, where 24 per cent of exports are primary products. Australia shares with the Third World a limited manufacturing base, a reliance on the export of commodities to finance growth, and a consequent high degree of vulnerability to international market forces. Anyone who attended the Last Great Aussie Breakfast this morning can testify to this. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's foreign debt has constantly risen since 1980, when it was 11 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), to 28 per cent of GDP in December 1986 and to 38 per cent of GDP in 1990. Australians should be taking more than an altruistic glance at the debt crisis. However, on reading the original report I see a number of aspects from which my fellow colleagues decided to dissent and with good reason. I would like to reiterate one or two of these to the chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The original report, I believe, failed to recognise that the underlying operation of the commercial banking system is, after all, to make a profit. The conditions in developing countries do not offer sufficient incentive, and needed capital will not be forthcoming. The trends, as stated in the report, are that an increasing proportion of capital flows to developing countries will come from official rather than from commercial sources. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to encourage capital input into the less developed countries, it will be necessary to correct the underlying economic malaise in which these countries now find themselves. Therefore, in this context, it is essential that the international financial bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank continue to impose sensible and appropriate economic policy conditions on countries which use the services of these particular bodies. This is an area in which Australia, as a member of these organisations, could be of direct benefit. We should be directly influencing the policies to be of the greatest benefit to the less developed countries, which cannot cope with their present levels of debt and should not be encouraged to take out further loans that they cannot repay. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, we have many Third World countries owing more in debt repayments and interest than they earn a year from exports. That makes it impossible for them to repay their debts. Such countries have no option but to borrow more money to survive. Yet to give this money could only exacerbate the problem. I was surprised to read in the last briefing note by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid that there is a gross anomaly in the present aid structure given by this Government. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), while in Washington and Manila, supported increases in Australian aid to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank but, in Canberra, the aid program is cut. This year aid through the banks increased 250 per cent, while back home $100m is cut from direct aid. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of this policy is that aid is being redirected from victims of emergencies and programs for the poorest, through non-government agencies, so that more can go to the banks. Secondly, Australian aid is being redirected away from the no strings attached grants to World Bank loans that make even worse the debt problems of developing countries. Our policies should not be encouraging the debt problem, but rather should be directed to relieving the debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are many ways of doing this and I do not intend to go into them this evening. The point that I do wish to make is that there is a major world debt problem, and that our policies should be directed to reducing this, not encouraging it. Sections of the original report implied that the commercial banks have an obligation to support developing countries. This is unrealistic, as in the commercial area the obligation is in large measure to the shareholders. Therefore, I would like to reiterate what my colleagues said in their dissenting report:</PARA>
<PARA> Any need that developing countries have for foreign capital, but which has no commercial incentive, should be provided on concessional terms. In other words, the provision of these funds must be subsidised . . . Although world-wide aid funds have been slowly increasing in recent years, it should not be expected that aid funds will grow in the future as rapidly as commercial funds decreased in the mid 1980s. It is becoming increasingly clear that the role of the creditor countries in providing capital flows to the LDCs is being increasingly borne by the taxpayers in the creditor countries and that shareholder risk is rapidly being shed. </PARA>

I guess the Third World would give a bit of a horse laugh to have Australia, which as Mr Keating said is on the Argentine road, trying to advise it on what its problems are. I listened carefully to Senator Vallentine's response and it seems to me that Senator Vallentine and people who share her views often fail to note the central lessons of the past two decades. Although Senator Vallentine is not here, she and the others should have asked themselves the following questions: which Third World countries have done really well? Which countries have succeeded and which have failed? I think one can say without fear of contradiction that the countries that have succeeded are basically those which have relied for their economic growth on market economies. They have given great emphasis to free enterprise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Yes, that is right. It was a classic socialist experiment. One can look at the eastern European countries that bombed out there. They followed the socialist road. It seems to me that, if the Senator Vallentines of this world are genuinely concerned about the living standards of people in the Third World, they should look at history, learn its lessons and at least in their long report, which they give ceaselessly, give some emphasis to the need to develop properly functioning market economies. Senator Vallentine did not say that and we will listen with great interest when Senator Spindler gets up to see whether he can at least acknowledge the importance of free markets and free enterprise in the creation of wealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine and Senator Spindler want to tax Australian workers more-people who are already labouring under the failed accord which the Government has brought on-to provide more and more aid to countries which often fail to undertake vital structural reforms themselves. I am not opposed to foreign aid, but I am opposed to throwing money at countries which ceaselessly fail to make the necessary reforms so that aid can be properly used. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response which we now have before us has by and large totally rejected the report brought down by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In the end, as Senator Short said, a dissenting report was drafted and signed by all the coalition members of the Committee. I agree with Senator Short that the Government has had little time for the majority report which, in effect, was prepared by its own backbench. The Cabinet is dumping in a fairly fulsome manner on its own back bench. Some seven of the 16 recommendations have been rejected outright by the Government and a number of the other recommendations are so weakly supported as to amount to being rejected. On that part at least I agree with Senator Vallentine. </PARA>
<PARA> One gets the feeling on reading the Government's response that it was restrained in order to avoid highlighting the clear differences between the Cabinet and its own back bench even in those recommendations to which it at least tried to give some credence. For example, in recommendation 9 the Committee recommended that the Government implement a policy of rapid growth of Australia's official development assistance as a proportion of gross domestic product and that by 1992 Australia's aid should once again stand at 0.5 per cent of GDP, according to the report we have before us. The Government has in effect rejected the Committee's recommendation. The Government, while in sympathy with some of the thrust of the recommendations to alleviate Third World debt, has in effect comprehensively rejected the detail of recommendations 10 and 11, including such proposals as a moratorium of 10 years on all official payment obligations and a write-down of a significant proportion of the Paris Club debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the impression from reading the Government's response-and in this area I agree with Senator Short-that the philosophical approach of the Cabinet is more in line with the dissenting report than with the majority report prepared by the Government's own back bench. When one looks at some of the members of that Committee, one wonders whether we are not seeing another element of factional fighting occurring within the Government. There were very strong representations from the Left on this Committee-Senator Childs, Mr Baldwin, Mr Langmore, Dr Theophanous and so forth. I suppose if Senator Sherry had been in the Parliament then, he would have been on this Committee as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This report has been brought down and the Government has dumped on the Committee; we now wait to see whether any Labor members are prepared to stand up and defend themselves-or will they, as they normally do, just lie down? We are waiting on Senator Sherry-he can grin and bear it-or one of the Committee members on the Government side to stand up and defend this Government report. We do not appear to have a Minister in the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he probably is embarrassed, and so he should be, in my view. Clearly we are again seeing major dissension in the Australian Labor Party. In short, rather than being a useful analysis of and an appropriate response by Australia to Third World debt, this report will go down in the Parliament as another symbol of the great philosophical divisions in the Labor Party today. These are the divisions between those who put their faith in outmoded socialist solutions and those who are learning the lesson that the fundamental way to assist the Third World is to adopt the philosophy of free markets, free enterprise and genuine political democracy. That is another element missing from Senator Vallentine's speech. Democracy and free enterprise are the great drivers of growth in the world economy; they are the great drivers of prosperity and living standards for the working people. It is a great pity that this report did not pick up those themes because they are the themes which history teaches us will deliver to people not only political liberties but also prosperity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has treated the work of the Committee-the work of its own back bench-with a thinly disguised contempt. It is interesting, as Senator Short has said, that we should be standing in this chamber looking at how we can help Third World countries when we ourselves may soon be joining their ranks. After all, it was none other than Mr Keating, on 14 May 1986-does Senator Button remember that date?-over 4 1/2 years ago, who warned that Australia was on the road to becoming a banana republic. That is what he warned us 4 1/2 years ago. Our foreign debt is huge and growing day by day by any standard. In June 1986-just one month after the famous banana republic statement-Australia's gross foreign debt was $92 billion. Today our debt is heading towards $160 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election campaign Mr Keating said-I know that casts doubt on the statement because we have already seen a number of promises broken by this Government-that by 1992 Australia's debt will be stabilised. If he is correct and he is able to stabilise Australia's debt, it will then be about $200 billion. It is a remarkable record. It is no wonder that Senator Short said that with these figures we are well and truly on the Argentine road. By most measurements, Australia's international position has significantly worsened, despite a substantial improvement in our terms of trade since 1986. Mr Keating's comments on the banana republic day in 1986 on the John Laws program were somewhat prophetic. I would like to read some of the comments Mr Keating made that day. He pointed out that once economic growth is slowed to under 3 per cent unemployment starts to rise again. John Laws, having heard this statement from Mr Keating, replied:</PARA>
<PARA>And then you have really induced a depression. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating responded to John Laws by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>You have gone, you are a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating, in his own words, has engineered a recession and those words will come back to haunt the Labor Party as the job queues grow and as Australian workers are retrenched. Whoever thought of that tactic was the same person who thought of advising the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to pretend that he had kept his promise on child poverty. I really think the Government should think about where it gets its advisers, because I predict that the statement that Senator Button has made time and time again in this Parliament in recent days-that the Government has engineered a recession-will come back to haunt him. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating said on banana republic day that if our growth went below 3 per cent the country would be going backwards. Today the economy is not growing at all; so it is not even under 3 per cent. The economy is actually receding. Des Moore, a former Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth Treasury, who is now senior fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs, has pointed out that close to 30 per cent of total external receipts are now going to service external debt. This is the highest proportion since the Depression years of the 1930s and is double the level that existed as recently as 1983. No wonder Senator Sherry looks horrified. Des Moore says that after each of the two previous occasions when the proportion rose above 30 per cent, a depression followed. What was clearly regarded as a crisis in 1986 must be regarded as even more of a crisis today. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other important statements have been made concerning Australia's debt problem. These have come from people who are concerned mainly with making sure that we set our own house in order: physician heal thyself before you start to worry about the problems of others. A number of eminent organisations have tried to concentrate on our debt problem to see what can be done about it. The Business Council of Australia held a debt conference earlier this year and put forward a comprehensive range of recommendations which could help Australia address its difficulties. The Institute of Public Affairs has been very active in highlighting Australia's debt problem and has been very constructive in proposing a range of solutions. It has to be said that the Government has not made any effective response to these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by addressing an interjection by Senator Zakharov the other day in relation to Australia's foreign debt problem. Senator Zakharov called out across the chamber-I do not know whether it was recorded in Hansard-that Australia's foreign debt problem was caused mainly by the private sector. I asked her whether she was talking about Alan Bond and Laurie Connell-some good friends of the Labor Party-and if she was I think it was quite a courageous thing to do. But in actual fact Senator Zakharov was quite wrong. In order to prove that she is wrong, I will rely on a statement made by the Prime Minister prior to the 1987 election. It is a very important statement and perhaps it will set the Senator Zakharovs of this world back on the right road. I will quote from it at some length. It is important that it be recorded in Hansard because, as the debate on the Government's performance continues in the weeks and months ahead, I am sure that many senators on both sides will find it very useful. This is what Mr Hawke said about the responsibility for our foreign debt:</PARA>
<PARA>The generator of Australia's external debt is our current account deficit. When a country has a current account deficit it spends more than it earns and, therefore, the country as a whole must borrow from the rest of the world to cover the difference. The identity of those borrowing-Australian business, governments or whoever-is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what our Prime Minister said. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The key, therefore, to reducing our external debt lies with the Government formulating the appropriate fiscal monetary and wages policies to allow a reduction in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke stated very succinctly where the responsibility lay. I could not have expressed it better myself. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>There has recently emerged an encouraging downward trend in the monthly current account deficits. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said in 1987 before the election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is considering the Government's response to the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Third World Debt: An Australian View, which was tabled in November 1989. One of the members of the Committee who was an author of that report was former Australian Democrats Deputy Leader, Michael Macklin. I know that former Senator Michael Macklin was proud to be associated with the recommendations that were made in that report. He would be disappointed, as I am, with the Government's response. I can assure Senator Baume and Senator Kemp that the Australian Democrats would not have voted for the sort of report that the Government would have submitted, judging by the response that the Government has given to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have welcomed Senator Kemp's addressing the substance of the report rather than spewing forth party political rhetoric for almost half an hour. However, let us look at some of the recommendations that the report has put forward and the Government's responses to them. One of the first recommendations, and perhaps the most important, is that the Government, through its representatives in the International Monetary Fund, should urge the IMF to prepare social impact statements in respect of companies requiring loans. This is a requirement that we would have thought was self-evident. It is, to some extent, supported by the Committee's recommendation of the United Nations Children's Fund strategy of `adjustment with a human face'. Unfortunately, these principles, although ostensibly accepted by the Government, are weakened almost in the same breath when the Government says:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless the distribution among social groups of any austerity measures accompanying a structural adjustment-loan agreement is determined essentially by the political and social priorities of the recipient countries. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, once again we have the market theory which makes the poor and disadvantaged carry the burden and makes the rich richer. The pain always seems to fall on the most vulnerable groups in these nations and it is time that Australia, through its representatives on international bodies, pressed for an assessment of that and pressed for a loans policy which takes into account the benefits accruing to the people in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that, in contrast to the convention of the old international bodies, the United Nations Constitution actually addresses the well-being and the independence of peoples rather than nations. It is time we started to think in a similar way. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that we believe Australia should address when it considers, in these bodies, the criteria for determining loan funds is the ecological consequences. My colleague Senator Coulter has recently introduced into the Senate a Bill to ban the import of rainforest timber logged in Third World countries. Such a ban would help to cut the demand for the timber. The IMF and other such organisations should adopt measures to limit the supply and therefore the cutting of such timber. </PARA>
<PARA> In our alternative Budget we have proposed to institute a rainforest protection fund to which only Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries would have to contribute. On a relative gross domestic product basis Australia's contribution would amount to only approximately $60m to save the South American and South East Asian rainforests. When Senator Kemp asks me where the money is coming from and whether we are going to levy taxes, then I can tell him that yes, we are going to get it from his friends, the tax avoiders, and I would suggest that Senator--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very pleased to supply a copy of our alternative Budget to Senator Kemp, where he can read that there are some 26 measures, at least, which would yield well in excess of $2 billion provided those tax avoidance loopholes were closed. Unfortunately, Senator Kemp prefers to introduce a general consumption tax which would reduce the tax on Rolls-Royces and place a tax on bread and milk. This is not the Democrats' way of raising revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now proceed to another area that we believe should be considered in the policies in international forums and international banks when funding of Third World countries is considered. That is the form of democratic government that exists in those countries and the decision making that should be encouraged. The Government has rejected recommendation 3 of the report, which concentrates on the question of democratic policy making by the international financial institutions, but has given at least some support to greater political involvement by parliamentarians as well as the international coordination of parliamentary action. Once again, the Democrats say that what should be advanced is the democratic decision making by the people in those countries. It is rather unfortunate that this aspect is not emphasised in the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we believe that Australia should lead the way in developing a new world order in which social justice, the environment and the future should be given much greater preference than the rule of the markets, which essentially are value free and which prefer to ignore human and social values.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read with some degree of interest the Government's response to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in respect of Third World debt. There are a number of recommendations in this report which I believe are totally unrealistic and which, unfortunately, should not be in the report at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would, firstly, however, like to take the opportunity to address some of the comments that have been made by Senator Spindler, because Senator Kemp gave a very eloquent exposition on exactly what many of the problems of these Latin American countries are; that is, there has been a wholly excessive amount of government interference. What we really need in countries such as Argentina is a return to free market systems. At this point Senator Spindler interjected that Argentina was a free market country and that that was the problem. I think that Senator Spindler's interjection was something along those lines. I hasten to take issue with Senator Spindler on this point because unfortunately he is totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the aggregated borrowings of Argentina to international banks, one finds that either directly or indirectly an overwhelming amount of the borrowings are in fact public sector debt. For example, three of the largest debtors in Argentina are organisations such as Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, Entidad Binacional Yacyreta, and Direccion Nacional del Antartico-organisations that are public sector and not private sector organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this, one finds when one looks at the master loan agreements that exist for Argentina that many of the borrowers that are not public sector borrowers either enjoy a public sector guarantee or come under the ambit of public sector loan agreements. For example, the guaranteed refinancing agreement was guaranteed by the Republic of Argentina. It sought to guarantee the borrowings of a number of public and private sector borrowers, but ultimately the effect of the guarantee was to increase the Republic's own public sector borrowing requirement and force it further into debt. So any comment by Senator Spindler or anybody else that Argentina is a free market economy is just not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of intervention by the central bank in Argentina, the Banco Central de la Republica Argentina, is quite extraordinary. For example, in December 1989 inflation in Argentina had reached 200 per cent in the first 18 days of the month and the central bank's response to this problem of spiralling inflation, which is a direct consequence of enormous foreign debt, was to ring up the banks and say that from 19 December onwards the central bank would not bother to tally inflation in Argentina. </PARA>
<PARA> Another tactic the Argentine central bank used, to limited success, in the previous year in Argentina was to take a daily tally of inflation, and when the level of inflation reached an unsatisfactory point on any given day the central bank would ring up all the other banks and say that the next day would be a banking holiday and they would not be allowed to transact any foreign exchange transactions. These were the sorts of interventionist policies of the central bank and of the Argentine Government that mark out the Argentine economy very clearly, as Senator Kemp has so well said, as not a free market economy but an interventionist economy which is dogged by a sort of pseudo-socialist Peronism, a corporatism which has hamstrung the economy of Argentina. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn my attention at this point to recommendations 4, 6 and 7 of the Committee's report. The Committee in recommendations 4 and 6 says that the private sector commercial banks that have lent money to Latin American and other Third World debtors should be obliged to participate in debt reduction schemes. The debt reduction schemes that are anticipated by these recommendations are schemes that arose out of the Brady plan. Having had some participation at the sharp end of implementing the Brady plan in Mexico in 1989, I suppose it would be remiss of me to let these comments go without some sort of notation to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brady plan as it was implemented in Mexico basically involved a 35 per cent write down by the commercial banks of their lendings to companies and the Government in Mexico. The banks could do this one of three ways. The first option was that the bank would be allowed to hold its paper, that is, the unsecured loans it has outstanding to Mexican entities provided it stumped up an extra 35 per cent in a new money loan. The second option was what was called an interest rate reduction bond or a par swap bond, that is, the unsecured paper owned by commercial banks would be swapped on a par basis for bonds which bore a reduced interest rate. The third and also very significant option available to the commercial banks was what was called a debt reduction bond. This involved the banks swapping their unsecured paper for secured bonds with a floating rate, as opposed to the fixed rate, of the par swap bond, the bonds having a nominal value of 65 per cent of the unsecured paper for which they had been swapped. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate consequence of the Brady plan on these commercial banks was to force them to make enormous write downs. It is no surprise that the Brady plan led to massive losses by banks, such as Chase Manhattan, Citibank, and the Bank of America, which had made only limited provisions for the loans to these Third World countries. I am sure Senator Spindler would say, `Well, so what?' and the social justice advocates of this world would say, `So what?'. The consequence of these write downs is quite horrific because, ultimately, it undermines the stability of the whole banking system not just in the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe, but all around the world because capital markets are very complex markets. They are not populated by simplistic beasts such as some people in this chamber and in the House of Representatives would have us believe. They are populated by an interconnected series of financial institutions, each lending and borrowing from the other. The collapse of any one of these financial institutions would cause an ultimate collapse, like dominoes, of other financial institutions around the world. The consequences of that would affect many ordinary innocent savers in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and elsewhere around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unsatisfactory and irresponsible for anybody to argue that commercial banks, because of the fact that they are banks, should be asked to write down their debt to support Latin American countries. Certainly I accept the fact that many of these commercial banks in the 1970s and early 1980s had horrendous lending practices. Banking executives would fly down to Latin America every four months or six months, write the tickets for whatever loans they wanted, get marvellous lending spreads of 1 3/4 per cent and 1 1/2 per cent, take their commissions and go home. I suppose these lending executives never really thought about the reason for getting such an enormous spread. Why should they get a 1 3/4 per cent lending margin when elsewhere they were only getting three-quarters of a per cent or half a per cent? It is, of course, a factor of the risk. </PARA>
<PARA> To that extent, the commercial banks have been condemned. But the commercial banks have paid their price to date in enormous write downs of their balance sheets; they have paid their price in interest which has remained unpaid for years and years; and they have paid their price as they have seen the value of their loans shrink from 100c in the dollar to 10c in the dollar or 8c in the dollar, as is the case with loans under the guaranteed refinancing agreement in Argentina. That is the price they have paid. To expect them to make further write downs is, I believe, irresponsible and irrational. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a way to reduce the amount of outstanding Latin American debt and it is not by debt reduction schemes such as are contained in recommendations 4 and 6; it is by implementing debt to equity swap schemes. Debt to equity swap schemes have enormous benefits both for lenders and for the countries to which the money has been lent. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, a debt to equity swap scheme works in this fashion: a bank has outstanding loans to either a private sector or public sector entity in a Latin American country and it agrees to take its money early at, say, 70 per cent of the face value of the loan and have it paid in local currency and converted into equity in an approved corporate entity within that country. Attached to the conversion of this debt to equity are specific provisions that relate to the repatriation of capital and to the payment of dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> These schemes have been enormously successful and they are, without doubt, going to be the principal manner in which the problem of Third World debt will be solved in the next 10 years, perhaps even faster. We will not make substantial inroads into Third World Latin American debt by the pie in the sky claims of the social justice advocates who say that the banks should merely take a write down. There has to be something in it for the banks and, more importantly, there has to be something in it for the Third World country. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that banks should just write down their loans and walk away is, in the long term, detrimental for the borrower as well as for the lender because the lender has been burnt well and truly and the lender will not again provide credit willingly to those companies or countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there will be more borrowings by Latin American countries in the future. There will need to be more borrowings by Latin American countries in the future as they struggle to raise the living standards of their citizens. Those loans will not be available to those countries, to those companies or to those individuals if the banks have been so badly burnt that they will never come back again. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I believe these recommendations are totally unrealistic, just as it is unrealistic to expect a bank to take a reduction in its interest rates to concessional levels, as is contained in recommendation 6. The consequence of that, ultimately, is that the yield on the loan shrinks below an acceptable level for the risk. The way in which financial institutions compensate for this and bring the yield into line with the risk is to discount the loan. So if we force the bank to give a concessional rate of interest, the bank then has to write down the value of its loan because the market shrinks underneath it. Ultimately it would have the same effect if we asked the bank to take a reduction in the principal amount of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why there is liquidity in the Third World debt market, the LDC market, at the moment is very simple. The loans are already trading at a discount to the premium and that discount leads to a yield on effective interest rates that makes the risk acceptable. To take a further reduction in interest would, as I said, lead to a reduction in the secondary market value of these loans and ultimately affect the balance sheets of the banks and the security of the deposits that ordinary people, like those of us in the Senate chamber, have made. </PARA>
<PARA> The final recommendation which I wish to address is recommendation 7, which says, inter alia, that there should be disincentives to capital flight such as taxation in the country of inflow. Basically this recommendation is all about parallel markets and foreign currency which exist in many countries. For example, in Argentina inflation is so rampant that nobody in his right mind saves his money in australes. Everybody saves in greenbacks. If we were to put this recommendation into effect, what we would do would be not to safeguard the wealth and prosperity of Argentineans, Venezuelans, Costa Ricans or anybody else; all we would do would be to force those people further into poverty because we would give them no secure base for their savings. I accept the fact that the foreign exchange markets-the parallel markets-that exist in these countries are a problem, but they are less of a problem than they are a boon. They give ordinary people a safe haven for their savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, when stagflation and hyperinflation struck Argentina, the Argentine Government created a whole new class of poor people. They were not the manual labourers, they were not the farmers or the peasants; the new class of poor people that was created in Argentina was the white collar workers. They were the professional people-the doctors, the architects-all of the professional people who had no access to hard currency and who had no savings in hard currency. What I believe we must do, if we are to beat our chests and talk about our social conscience, is give the poor, oppressed, underprivileged people of these countries a chance to maintain the value of what meagre savings they have. I am sure that Senator Sherry on the other side of the chamber would take no issue with that. For those reasons, the suggestion that we should prevent people from securing the value of their savings by investing in safe countries and safe currencies is a wholly unrealistic one and one which, morally, I wish to have no association with. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the flaws in the report, and I believe that these matters should have been raised to explain the importance and the difficulty of this matter. It is not an easy matter. It is not a matter to which there is going to be an overnight solution. I believe that there will be a solution which will come as a result of market forces both within these countries and without. It will be market forces that will drive the debt to equity schemes. It will be market forces that drive the debt swap schemes such as existed and are planned in Venezuela and with which I have had some association, and I think they are on the whole good schemes. It is the market solutions which are important; it is not the solutions of the do-gooders because, however good their intentions, they fail to understand the crux of the problem, and in trying to solve the world's ills I believe that these people, in this regard, only make them worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the supplementary Government response to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Reform of the Australian Audit Office and a related document entitled Australian National Audit Office-Report of an Independent Review. I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard and to move a motion in relation to the documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's initial response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) report on the reform of the Australian Audit Office was tabled on 1 November 1989. The response noted that the Government had commissioned an independent review of resource issues in relation to the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) and that there were a number of issues raised by the JCPA report to which the Government was giving further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>This response comments on the independent review which was conducted by Mr T. A. Sheridan, the then Auditor-General of South Australia, as well as the issues outstanding from the Government's initial response. </PARA>
<PARA>Sheridan Review</PARA>
<PARA>The JCPA inquiry into the Australian Audit Office was one of the most significant undertaken by the Committee. However, the analysis of the resource issues presented in that report left, in the Government's view, something to be desired. Consequently, whilst the Government decided at that time to provide additional funding of $2 million per annum on an ongoing basis for efficiency audits, it also commissioned a review to advise the Auditor-General and the Government on the ANAO's capacity to improve further the use of existing resources. </PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the findings of the independent review are properly matters for decision by the Auditor-General. The main recommendations relate to a range of matters including organisation and staffing issues. The review noted that the Auditor-General had made significant productivity improvements, of the order of 15 per cent, over the past three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall, the review concluded that initiatives already undertaken by the Auditor-General, or suggested in the review, could lead to significant additional resources, equivalent to some 60 full-time staff, becoming available for efficiency auditing over the next two years or so. These resources, in the order of $3 million per annum, could be released through the adoption of risk based auditing; gains from information technology; release of resources following completion of the ANAO's information technology project; and improved management and control of resources. Together with the $2 million per annum increase in funding for efficiency audits announced in the Government's earlier response to the JCPA report, this represents a very substantial increase in resources above the level allocated to such tasks at the time of the JCPA report, which was then estimated at $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA>The review proposes that, from 1991-92, the ANAO charge for financial statement audits, and retain the resultant revenue. This will encourage auditees to maintain reliable financial reporting and control systems and prepare soundly based financial statements, in order to minimise charges. Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) and a number of other entities are already charged by the ANAO for financial statement audits. The Government agrees with the review conclusion that charging should be extended for the audit of all financial statements of government undertakings, including departments of state. Such a move would be consistent with Government's policy of fostering increased efficiency in the public sector. Efficiency audits and project audits, together with assistance provided to Parliamentary committees, would continue to be funded from the ANAO's annual appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Authority Status for ANAO</PARA>
<PARA>The JCPA report recommended the establishment of the ANAO as a statutory authority, largely to permit the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of employment of ANAO staff. All statutory authorities and GBEs are constrained by the centralised wage system and the Government's wages policies, so that there would be, at best, only limited scope for salary enhancement. Statutory authority status would, however, tend to limit the mobility rights of ANAO staff in relation to the rest of the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>There are several initiatives currently in train under the structural efficiency principle which will assist the ANAO's ability to attract and retain staff. In this context, it is worth noting that an upgraded SES structure was recently approved for the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of whether the ANAO is a statutory authority or not is irrelevant to the Auditor-General's independence, since, as a statutory office holder, he has the right to determine his own audit priorities and mode of operation. That has never been at issue. Nor is there any valid suggestion that the Government's wages policy, or the level of resources available to the ANAO has ever compromised the independence of the Auditor-General or the ANAO in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>As the reasons in favour of establishing the ANAO as a statutory authority are not compelling, the Government does not accept the JCPA's recommendation on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Mandate</PARA>
<PARA>In its earlier response to the JCPA report, the Government indicated its disposition to accept the JCPA's recommendation that the Auditor-General be reinstated as the external auditor of Government business enterprises and statutory marketing authorities (SMAs). Since then, the report of the independent auditor of the ANAO has expressed the view that all Commonwealth entities should be audited by the ANAO. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has also come out strongly in support of the view of the JCPA, stating that in accordance with the principle of ministerial accountability, all Commonwealth undertakings, of whatever legal form, should be audited by the Commonwealth Auditor-General to the standards laid down in the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Government's view that all public enterprises are ultimately accountable to Parliament, and that a major vehicle for this accountability is the Auditor-General. Consequently, the Government has decided that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. However, the Government has also agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions in the case of statutory marketing authorities and Government business enterprises where special circumstances dictate. The Auditor-General may appoint, as agents, private sector auditors to undertake specified audits and has already indicated his willingness to do so. Suitable transitional arrangements will be put in place where private auditors have been appointed to undertake the audits of Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. The necessary legislative amendments to implement these changes will be included in the new legislation to replace the existing Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>The Government greatly appreciates the very comprehensive review conducted by Mr Sheridan and his team, and acknowledges the assistance provided by the South Australian Premier, Mr Bannon, in making him available. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes announced in this statement underline the Government's commitment to preserve and enhance the Auditor-General's independence. They also demonstrate the determination of this Government to ensure the highest standards of public administration, together with effective accountability to both the parliament and to the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I am pleased that the Government has acknowledged that report No. 296 by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was one of its most significant. Persons with an understanding of Commonwealth public administration are aware that the Australian National Audit Office has a special place in Commonwealth financial institutional structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh said earlier that the Australian Audit Office is rightly regarded as one of the major instruments that can contribute to efficient, accountable public administration. Today's response to report No. 296, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament, is the second by this Government. A further process will be required which will involve the drafting of a new Audit Act, which we understand is due to commence on 1 July 1992. It is on the content of that latter process or Act that I wish to make further comment. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so I shall refer to a letter from the Department of Finance dated 30 November 1990 to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. Two features are foreshadowed in that Act which are particularly important and which were mentioned in and highlights of report No. 296. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>It will establish a Parliamentary Audit Committee, chaired by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, alternating each year . . . The functions of the committee will include providing advice to the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and to the Government on the level of resources made available to the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a most significant and welcome inclusion in the future Audit Act. Secondly, it foreshadows the establishment of the Auditor-General as the sole external auditor of Commonwealth agencies and entities, including statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises. However, the Minister for Finance will have the authority to grant an exemption to an entity from the application of that mandate. I believe that that will be exercised fairly sparingly. It is important that where there is government involvement in one of these commercial utilities or undertakings there must be some parliamentary accountability-some reporting to the Parliament. The Government, basically, has accepted the thrust of the central features of report No. 296 in bringing the Australian Audit Office and the Parliament closer together through the establishment of this Parliamentary Audit Committee, and providing a wide mandate for the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> A further document was tabled today known as the Sheridan report. Contrary to some commentators' views, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report and the Sheridan report are quite consistent. In fact, they are complementary. The Government recognised the under-resourcing of the Australian Audit Office by allocating an extra $2m earlier to enable an extension of the efficiency audit program. I believe that this was a wise move, given the high potential for cost saving through improved administrative practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sheridan report was a useful document. Tom Sheridan was a competent auditor, being the former Auditor-General of South Australia. However, I wonder whether the Commonwealth Treasury, for example, would like the Tasmanian Under-Treasurer-with no reflection whatsoever on his capabilities-to undertake a review of the significant department of state, the Treasury. In a sense, this is what the Department of Finance did when it recommended to the Government the appointment of Mr Tom Sheridan to review the Australian National Audit Office. He did it quite competently, but when these reviews are done it is essential that they are done by equals at least in terms of responsibility and prestige. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report gave the broad strategic outline. On the other, the Sheridan report supplemented that with detail and outlines of resources. Sheridan acknowledged that the Australian National Audit Office is undergoing the most significant change in its postwar history and that its affairs have been under almost constant review for over two years. While those review processes have not always helped the Australian National Audit Office to devote the necessary management and planning effort to the internal operations of the Office or to coordinate and implement change in the most efficient way, significant improvements have been achieved, particularly in the output of staff engaged in the direct audit work where productivity increases of about 15 per cent are starting to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> We pay tribute to the leadership of Mr John Taylor, the Auditor-General. I am not sure that the Parliament got the same value out of the independent auditor's efficiency report presented recently, but such an observation may well be changed when the Public Accounts Committee conducts a further inquiry into that efficiency audit. I quote from page 4 of the Government's response:</PARA>
<PARA>There are several initiatives currently in train under the structural efficiency principle, which will assist the Australian National Audit Office's ability to attract and retain staff. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been one of its major problems. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In this context, it is worth noting that an upgraded SES structure was recently approved for the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not only welcome but also long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the prolonged fight for funding, independence, mandate and recognition, which really began several AuditorGenerals ago, has finally been recognised. From my position, both as a senator and as vice-chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I thank all who have contributed over the years towards this recognition and upgrading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to comment on the supplementary Government response to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the reform of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) and essentially to echo the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson. I am pleased to note the Government's response in relation to the mandate of the Australian National Audit Office. That is a very sensible decision. It is certainly welcome. The Auditor-General will be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the Government has also agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions in the case of statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises (GBEs) where special circumstances dictate. I hope that the Government makes clear those special circumstances. A chink has been put in by the Government which, depending on how it is used, could permit the erosion of its decision. It is important that it be spelt out quite clearly what sort of special circumstances might dictate the exemption in the case of particular marketing authorities and GBEs by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular point I comment on is the one that Senator Watson alluded to. I join him in expressing my regret that the Government has decided not to accept the Public Accounts Committee's recommendation that the ANAO be established as a statutory authority. That is a retrograde decision. I am amazed at the reasons given in the Government's response for that decision. I disagree very strongly with some of the statements in the Government's response. In particular, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>All statutory authorities and GBEs are constrained by the centralised wage system and the Government's wages policies, so that there would be, at best, only limited scope for salary enhancement. </PARA>
<PARA>It is widely known that the Opposition is very strongly opposed to the whole concept of the centralised wage system. This is a classic example of why one ought to be opposed to the centralised wage system. It is essentially saying that we cannot make a very important office of government, in terms of its independence and its role in government, a statutory authority and give it the independence that virtually everybody believes it should have because it would somehow or other be contrary to the Government's centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA> Have honourable senators ever heard a more stupid and unjustified reason for rejecting such an important recommendation not only by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts but also by the Auditor-General himself over recent years and the whole thrust of the report by Tom Sheridan and the other reports that have been done, including the report by Michael Sharpe, into the Audit Office. That is a totally unsatisfactory and very worrying reason for the Government's rejection of the proposal that the Audit Office be a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's statement also says that the question of whether the Audit Office is a statutory authority is irrelevant to the Auditor-General's independence. This relates to the point that I have just made about the centralised wage system. The statement that it is irrelevant to the Auditor-General's independence flies totally in the face of the Auditor-General's comments made on several occasions, the most recent being in his foreword to this year's annual report of the Audit Office. The Auditor-General, John Taylor, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am compelled, therefore, to emphasise my response to the JCPA Report No. 296  . . . which recommended that the ANAO should be established as a statutory authority and that, like Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the Auditor-General should have improved ability over staff terms and conditions, and over hiring and firing, while maintaining consistency with the Government's policies of public sector restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very strong statement by the Auditor-General. It is a carefully considered statement that has been backed up very strongly by the Public Accounts Committee and by the independent reviews of the Audit Office. For the Government to say blithely that the question of whether the Audit Office is a statutory authority is irrelevant to the AuditorGeneral's independence flies in the face of all those statements and the views of most people with knowledge in this area. I find that a very disappointing and worrying response indeed. The Auditor-General and the Audit Office play an essential role in the good management of the finances of all Commonwealth entities and departments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a huge job. It is a job where integrity and the independence of the Office are of the greatest importance. It is undeniable that this decision by Government to reject this recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts lessens the independence that the Office would otherwise have. It is whistling in the wind to ask the Government to reconsider that recommendation. But I hope that it will have another look at it because it is a very ill-considered recommendation which seems to be based on the flimsiest of all possible reasons, namely, the question of the centralised wage system. </PARA>
<PARA> If we ever wanted a classic example of why the centralised wage system is causing the damage to this nation that it is, why we cannot attract the right people to the right jobs, why we cannot reward people on the basis of their productivity, why we cannot get greater mobility into our work force and why, therefore, we are becoming increasingly unproductive in a highly competitive world, which is the basic cause of the problems underlying the situation in this country at the moment, this is it. The centralised wage fixing system is at the core of all of that. Here in a very small but important way we have seen an example of that. I hope that the auditing of the accounts of the Commonwealth and all its entities will not suffer unduly as a result of that decision. I think there is every prospect that this Parliament will rue the day that the Government has made that recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment briefly on report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament. The Australian Democrats welcome the Government's acceptance of the Committee's recommendation that the Auditor-General be reinstated as the external auditor of government business enterprises and statutory marketing authorities. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has also supported this particular move. When we move into corporatising many government owned enterprises, such as happened recently with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, it is extremely important that the public oversight be maintained. They are still enterprises owned by the people. I believe that the Auditor-General must be given scope, powers and resources to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In passing, I mention my regret that the Government and the Opposition did not support my amendment to ensure that shares in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories could not be sold, except with the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Some of those enterprises in the not too distant future will possibly cease to be enterprises that belong to the community. Nevertheless, we support in the context of this report the proposition that all government enterprises should be accountable to the Parliament via the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I must share Senator Short's concern about the proposal to grant to the Minister for Finance a discretion to exempt some of these enterprises. That certainly requires some clarification. The notion of special circumstances is a difficult one to apply, unless it is specifically clarified and we know the criteria that are to be employed. We do not oppose the discretion; but we believe it should be clarified and identified in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I also share Senator Short's concern that the Government has decided not to establish the Australian National Audit Office as an independent statutory authority on, what I agree, is an extremely flimsy pretext that it cannot be provided with career paths and adequate salaries to attract qualified staff due to the centralised wage system that it would then come under. I believe that many other government authorities and departments have been able to create career paths for their employees and to attract qualified staff in one way or another. It should not be beyond the wit of this authority to be constituted as an independent statutory authority and yet develop career structures that enable it to attract qualified staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to comment briefly, with approval, on the proposal in the report to establish a parliamentary committee to oversight the activities of the Australian National Audit Office. That is the way in which to bolster its independence and autonomy and to ensure that the Auditor-General will continue to be the ally of the people and their watchdog. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and also as the author of the title of its report No. 296, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament. The reason that I suggested the title, and the reason that the Committee acquiesced to that suggestion, is that the office of the Auditor-General is pivotal in ensuring that there is accountability to the Parliament for the expenditure of the taxpayers' dollar, of public funds. For expenditure in the public sector it is to the Parliament that the answers must be given-not to the Executive, not to any particular committee, but to the Parliament as a whole. Therefore, the role of the Auditor-General is both pivotal and crucial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I read the report entitled Supplementary Government Response to the Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Reform of the Australian Audit Office in conjunction with the initial response delivered by Senator Walsh and entitled The Reform of the Australian Audit Office, Ministerial Statement, which was delivered last year. I read it in conjunction with Senator Walsh's comments when he said of the report that the Government does not agree with some of the Committee's recommendations dealing with the issues of independence, the resources for the Australian National Audit Office and the Auditor-General's mandate. In fact, in that report three of the most important aspects were the independence of the Auditor-General, the resourcing of the Office and the question of mandate. The Committee concluded that independence was of paramount importance because it was only by being independent of the Executive itself and of the strictures of not finding himself sufficiently resourced that the Auditor-General could properly carry out his function. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of resourcing, we were very keen to see the establishment of a committee which would be chaired by one of the Presiding Officers-either the Speaker or the President-and the funding for the Auditor-General being included within the appropriations for the parliamentary departments. As such, there would be an independent source of funding. Senator Walsh rejected that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at this supplementary response, which is based on the Sheridan report, I see that the point has not been dealt with except to say that, by putting a cost value on the reforms which the Auditor-General has already put in place, by simply being more efficient and having greater productivity, the Auditor-General can effectively render unto himself an additional $3m per annum in resources, together with the additional $2m per annum announced by Senator Walsh for the purpose of allowing a greater number of efficiency audits to be carried out. Significant in this supplementary report is the fact that the Government endorses the view that the Audit Office shall charge for financial statement audits and retain the resultant revenue. The Auditor-General shall not, however, charge for efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA> The really worrying statement in the report for me is the one that has already been mentioned by honourable senators who have spoken earlier-that is, the part of the report dealing with mandate. All the opening words of the paragraph under the title `Mandate' are quite reassuring. The report of the independent auditor cites, for instance, that not only the Public Accounts Committee but also the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration recommended that mandate be restored for all statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises. But when one turns to page 6 of the supplementary Government response, one reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has decided that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. </PARA>
<PARA>The first question that is raised in my mind is: what is the definition of a `controlled' entity? My mind goes back to the situation, which still remains, created by an opinion of the Attorney-General's Department that unless a majority of the directors are appointed by the Government, despite the fact that all the money for that entity is provided by the taxpayer via the Government, the Auditor-General must gain the permission of the auditee in order to conduct an efficiency audit. That was the position with the Australian Bicentennial Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the definition of the word `controlled' and what its current meaning may be. But I am more concerned that the response points out that the Government has agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions for statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises where so-called special circumstances dictate. There is absolutely nothing in this response to indicate what special circumstances may be considered; by whom they may be considered to be special or special enough; whether some sorts of guidelines are to be secreted away within the Department of Finance of which other people will not be aware; and whether or not those decisions are to be made in an arbitrary manner and are not to be subject to anybody's review. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Watson said that he hoped that this power of the Minister for Finance would be exercised sparingly. But there is nothing in this response to indicate that that would or could be the case. The words are very encouraging. The following statement is made in the conclusion to the response:</PARA>
<PARA>The changes announced in this statement underline the Government's commitment to preserve and enhance the Auditor-General's independence. </PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid that I am not convinced when I read a sentence that begins, `However, there shall be exemptions'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Auditor-General is to be commended on the actions that he has taken with regard to the report of the Joint Public Accounts Committee and the efforts he has made to make the Office more efficient and to provide unto himself greater resources through being efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The response points out that this was one of the most important reviews that the Public Accounts Committee has undertaken. As I said right at the outset, the Auditor-General is pivotal in the whole question of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Short addressed the question of the Australian National Audit Office becoming a statutory authority. I think, however, it is necessary to point out that Senator Walsh, in his statement last year, said that the Government would give further consideration to that recommendation when it received the independent review which was carried out by Mr Sheridan. I can only conclude that the Government did not consider Mr Sheridan's view on that issue to be of very much use because it has decided to jettison that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, I am encouraged to see that the Government has expressed a view which is supportive of the independence of the Auditor-General. I can only hope that that sentence which begins, `However', does not turn out to be full of portent that that independence will not be real but somehow fettered. </PARA>

<PARA>keep a register of organisations;</PARA>

<PARA>Of course, I am referring here to trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the back of the report in the appendices are listed a considerable number-far too many, as far as I am concerned-of registered organisations, including employer and employee organisations. There are some 300-odd trade unions. I am sure the Senate would be aware that we have been considering some legislation which hopefully will lead, on reading this report, next year and in further years to a severe reduction in the number of trade unions that are listed in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to see that we appear to be close to adopting the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill in order to rationalise the number of unions in the country. In the debate today on the matter of trade unions, their size and registration, Senators Crane and Chapman referred to the Business Council of Australia survey in their opposition to the reduction in the number of registered trade unions. I have read that report and I would reject their contention, based on that report, that the proposed legislation to reduce the number of trade unions will still leave a considerable number of firms with a considerable number of trade unions. In fact, that will not be the case, because the amalgamation of trade unions is simply the beginning of the process. What will occur once those amalgamations have taken place is the swapping of membership, and such mighty organisations as the Australian Brushmakers Union, the Australian Rope and Cordage Workers Union, the Bakery Employees and Salesmen's Federation, the Millers and Manufacturing Grocery Employees Association of Australia, the Federated Tobacco Workers Union--</PARA>

What they want in having thousands of trade unions is making sure that the bargaining power of workers who are covered by these so-called trade unions is non-existent. That is what they are all about.

In terms of large trade unions there are some dangers, and I acknowledge them. In reducing overlapping coverage it is important that we rationalise the research effort, the co-ordination, the training and reduce competition through unnecessary demarcation disputes. Let me give a good example, and this might interest Opposition senators who are totally ignorant of industrial relations. In the breweries area that I represented for some years there were eight unions. The major union was the Liquor and Allied Industries Union, but we had the metal workers, the painters, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, we had the plumbers, the clerks, the storemen and packers.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>At times I have been highly critical of the Australian Research Council's grants and awards. I am interested to note that now that Australia is in a very serious economic state the awards and grants being made are to a large degree very sensible. I strongly support the great bulk of them, and I want to mention a few of them as showing the sort of work of which the Senate and the people of Australia should be proud in these grants. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, among the successful grants noted in the report there is one looking at DNA markers in eucalypts for plantation forestry. Under this grant, scientifically Australia would be entering into a new field of forest molecular biology, with research based on its own native resources. The prospects there are very significant. There is another one involving the genetic engineering of wheat, using embryo cultures and microprojectile vectors. This `unique interdisciplinary team' has a good chance of taking a world leadership role in this new technology of gene implantation. The effects of temperature and salinity on the viability of rainbow trout are being examined with a grant of $31,000. This is very significant because the export potential of the industry is threatened unless selection programs are successful. This research is very important to Australia. Another grant relates to factors affecting large scale production of proteins from insect cell culture, which receives $70,000 for research. The commercial potential of the technique is very large. I mention all these to show that there is a great deal of very significant research going on which could be of immense significance to the people of Australia and for the profitability of many Australian companies. Then there is another grant relating to measurement of imperfections in silos in service, which is of great interest to people on the land. Then a sum of $56,000 goes towards a modelling approach to hydrodynamics, larval dispersal and reef connectivity implications. This work at the James Cook University of North Queensland is very important indeed in terms of the Great Barrier Reef management. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not simply in the scientific areas that some of these grants are very worth while. In the area of the arts, for which I am shadow Minister, there is a grant, for example, for investigation and analysis of Australian autobiographies. This is an area which does not seem to have received a great deal of attention. Patronage in Australian art is another investigation being funded by a grant to the extent of $18,000. This is an historically based investigation by government and private sources covering the years from 1788 to 1982. I am glad to see that attention is being given to this area of Australian arts. In fact, I complained during the bicentennial year that not enough research was going on in this direction. The final study will provide a sound and useful basis for future government decision making in this area. I look forward to having that information there when I am making decisions as Minister for the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is a grant relating to the Grainger letters. Percy Grainger was one of Australia's leading musicians and certainly an eccentric personality. Not enough has been done yet on him and the grant has been made for research in that direction. Then there is a dictionary of Australian artists dealing with nineteenth century painters, photographers and engravers. There is an art guide to places in Australia-a whole range of very useful work being done to celebrate Australia's significance as a place of the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> In social history there is a grant to do some work on college people-a social history of the Melbourne middle class from 1914 to 1980. This book will break new ground both in subject matter and methodology. It will do something to fill an astonishing gap in our knowledge of ourselves. Most research in this area seems to be about radical groups. Very little attention has been paid to looking to the middle class on which Australia has depended. Another relates to `Violence in Australian Sport: An Historical Perspective'. This will assess whether Australian sport today is more violent than in earlier times and will suggest possible means to combat this problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly this evening to put on record my thanks for the bipartisan cooperation I had when I presented a notice of motion yesterday and moved it this morning regarding the Italian internees during the war. I would like to thank the coalition-my own Party and the National Party of Australia. I would like to thank the Government for its cooperation, and I dealt with Senator Robert Ray on that matter and briefly with Senator McKiernan before that. I spoke with Senator McLean of the Australian Democrats and also Senator Harradine and Senator Vallentine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Italian community is very appreciative of the gesture of this Parliament on the fiftieth anniversary of that event. I would also like to thank Mrs Turkington of Como in Western Australia for writing to me on this matter in the first place. She attended some weeks ago a migrant seminar at the Italian department of the University of Western Australia and certain things were brought out at that seminar. Her concern was-amongst the things that I mentioned this morning about internment, and unjust internment in certain cases-the files that are now on the public record in the archives around Australia of people who were interned. On those files there are a lot of false accusations about these people. In those days, the Italian internees were not in a position to defend themselves, because even if they appeared in front of a board they could not speak the language, or they could speak very little of it. So they were in a bad position. Those files were put away as they were and they are now on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday, I took the liberty to go and look at half a dozen of those files on people that I knew to have been good and very straight citizens, some of whom are now deceased. I saw on at least three out of five files some accusations that certainly would not have stood up. I believe that the Government should take up the last point (e) of my motion, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . notes the desirability to investigate the possibility of having notations to the above effect appended to the internment records which are now part of the public record. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator McKiernan pointed out in discussions with me, I know that there may be a cost attached to having these things done-it may be a big job-but if the Government could look at the matter it would certainly set the record straight for all time. Once again, I thank the Senate for its cooperation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several weeks ago I had the privilege of being a member of a parliamentary delegation visiting European institutions and the parliaments of Switzerland, Belgium and France. Very early in our delegation's visit to Switzerland, I found myself sitting opposite nine senior Swiss bankers. The conversation centred on the question as to why Australia was not attracting more investment money from Swiss banks. The language was gentle but the message was very blunt: our corporate image stinks and the banking institutions in Australia have contributed to that unfortunate corporate image which we have overseas, and until such time as we can rectify that, we will not be attracting substantial sums of money for investment through Swiss banking channels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of that discussion, one of the nine senior bankers made a totally unsolicited comment. He said that the senior Australian bankers who had been involved in enticing Australian business people and farmers into the Swiss bank loans of 1984-86 were nothing short of criminals and should be in jail. That is the expression that he used. After our discussions I had private conversations with him, and he said that he would be prepared to come to Australia to testify to that effect. We have a bank inquiry coming up fairly soon, and I am led to believe that in fact he may be visiting Australia to do exactly that. It was by sheer coincidence that, five days prior to his making this unsolicited comment, I had been standing in this chamber and presenting to the Senate quite specific examples of the techniques that had been used by Australian banks to create the processes which had evoked such a very precise and specific observation by a senior Swiss banker. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I will be continuing to put before the Senate further very precise information, which I hope to put also before the bank inquiry fairly soon. One of the cases I have referred to previously has been the case of a Mr Wilfred Taylor of Cambewarra, near Nowra, who was the principal director and shareholder of Mighty Chef Products Pty Ltd. On several occasions I have referred to the Taylor case and his dispute with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Tonight I would like to be fairly detailed, and I will be later seeking leave to table copies of documents upon which I base some of these allegations. I have previously provided copies of these documents for perusal by both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1986, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia granted a facility to Mighty Chef, secured by a registered first equitable mortgage over the assets and undertakings of Mighty Chef. By October 1987, Mighty Chef experienced difficulties in repaying its debt and interest to the bank. Mr Taylor then sought an influx of capital into the company. On 21 October 1987, Mr Taylor attended a meeting with Mr Keith Greenwood, the Managing Director of Armtech Ltd, and Mr Peter Poppett, the Manager of the George and Market Street branch of the Commonwealth Bank. Poppett said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mighty Chef urgently requires an influx of capital. I know that there are several proposals afoot. I will make the final decision as to which of the proposals is acceptable to the bank. You-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Taylor-</PARA>
<PARA>will have no say in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor's account of what Poppett said is corroborated by Mr Greenwood in an affidavit sworn on 15 April 1988 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I attended a conference with Mr Taylor, Mr Poppett and Mr Levingston on 21st October 1987. Poppett used words to me to the effect that: `The bank (the first Defendant) would want periodic reductions in the principal sum on the Mighty Chef loan and would want more security. The Bank would have to be satisfied as to Armtech's security and make the decision.' Poppett used further words to the effect that: `There are a number of competing companies wanting to take-over Mighty Chef. The Bank would make the final decision as to who came in. Taylor has no say in the matter.'</PARA>
<PARA>In early December 1987 a finance broker arranged a meeting between Mr Taylor, a Wayne Lawrence and Poppett. Lawrence was the principal of Adelview Ltd. At the meeting Lawrence advised that he proposed to put a proposition to the Bank. At about the same time Mr Taylor introduced Mr Neil Tumbers to Poppett, and certain negotiations took place between Mr Tumbers and Poppett. Mr Tumbers was the Managing Director of United Systems Holding Pty Ltd, owned as to 25 per cent by Mr Kerry Packer. </PARA>
<PARA> In early December 1987 Poppett told Mr Taylor he would investigate proposals put to him by Lawrence and separately by Mr Tumbers and would let Mr Taylor know which proposal would be acceptable to the bank. In an affidavit sworn by Mr Taylor at Nowra on 26 September 1988, he swears that Poppett later said to him:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision as to which party is to come into your business will be made by me-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Poppett-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and you will abide by that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that Poppett was going to accept responsibility for making the decision. It also means that if Poppett made the wrong decision he could be held liable for it. Mr Taylor, as plaintiff, sued the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as first defendant and Peter Poppett as second defendant. The bank's defence alleged that the decision vested with Mr Taylor. Clause 9 of the defence provides, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Second Defendant said to the Plaintiff words to the effect that the second Defendant would need to examine both proposals to determine which option would best clear the corporation's-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mighty Chef's-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . indebtedness to the Bank and that the Second Defendant stressed that any decision on the acceptance or otherwise of the offers rested with the Plaintiff . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The defence was verified by an affidavit verifying defence sworn by Poppett on 30 March 1988. Mr Taylor swore on oath that Poppett told him that he, Poppett, would make the decision. Poppett swore on oath that he told Taylor that he, Taylor, would make the decision. What that means is that Taylor and Poppett had sworn to mutually exclusive statements of fact and one of them had committed perjury. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 November 1987 Mighty Chef entered into an agreement with Adelview Ltd for the acquisition by Adelview of 51 per cent of Mighty Chef. Unbeknown to Mr Taylor, the finance broker, one Warren Small, handed a copy of the agreement to the bank. Poppett knew about the agreement. The copy held by the bank has his handwritten note:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Poppett, Mr Small would like you to ring him. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, on 18 November 1987, a copy of the agreement was sent by facsimile transmission from the bank to Martin Brown of Coopers and Lybrand. The facsimile transmission header has this handwritten note:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Poppett will phone this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that Poppett knew of an agreement whereby Adelview Ltd would become entitled to more than 51 per cent of the voting power of Mighty Chef. Clause F2 of the deed of equitable mortgage dated 13 May 1986 provides, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) The moneys hereby secured shall at the option of the Bank...immediately become payable and this mortgage shall immediately become enforceable without any demand or notice in each or any of the following events:-</PARA>
<PARA> (m) If any person . . . who is not at the date hereof entitled to more than 50 per cent of the voting power shall, without the consent in writing of the Bank, directly or through a nominee, become so entitled. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This means that on and from 17 November 1987 the decision rested not with Mr Taylor, but with Poppett and the bank. Poppett committed wilful and corrupt perjury. Although Mr Taylor signed the agreement with Lawrence, Lawrence did not perform and Taylor distrusted him. In a later conversation Poppett asked Taylor which of the two persons, Lawrence or Tumbers, he preferred and Taylor said:</PARA>
<PARA>I prefer Mr Tumbers because he has a successful established business and could, if required, service the liabilities to the Bank and other creditors from the revenues received from his own business. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not at all happy to do business with Lawrence. I believe he is not genuine and I have reservations about his character. I believe he is dishonest and cannot be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that if Mr Taylor had made the decision, he would have chosen Mr Tumbers. Mr Taylor's attitude to Lawrence is corroborated by a bank diary note written by one Glen Levingston, which states, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor is not happy with Wayne Lawrence's offer as Taylor does not trust Lawrence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This diary note was initialled by Poppett. Mr Taylor's attitude to Lawrence is further corroborated by an affidavit of Mr Tony Rigg, sworn on 5 April 1988, which states among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>In late November, 1987, Mr Taylor telephoned me and used words to the effect that: `I have signed an agreement with Lawrence, because of pressure from the Bank'. I said: `Are you happy with him?' Taylor replied, `No. I am not. He has not performed on the contract.' In early December, 1987, Mr Taylor telephoned me and used words to the effect that: `Neil Tumbers has put an offer to me. I am going to put the offer to the Bank. I do not trust Lawrence, I do not believe he is honest or genuine. I recommend that you do not do business with him.'</PARA>
<PARA>This means that if, for whatever reason, Poppett decided to accept Lawrence's offer and wanted Mr Taylor to cooperate in the takeover of Mighty Chef, he would have to convince Mr Taylor to change his attitude to Lawrence. This Poppett did by a shabby and disgraceful fraud-a fraud that condemns the Commonwealth Bank as a corrupt institution. In his affidavit Mr Taylor gives this account of what Poppett said to him:</PARA>
<PARA>On or about 9th December, 1987, . . . Poppett used words to the effect, `We have investigated both parties. The proposal submitted by Mr Lawrence is a good one. He and his companies are financially secure and Lawrence has shown me a letter of credit for $1 million. You are to accept the proposal from Mr Lawrence. . .' Poppett further said that, `. . . the Bank insists that you enter into arrangements with Lawrence immediately, otherwise the alternative will be that a receiver is put in at once!'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor's account of what Poppett said to him is corroborated by an affidavit of Mr Tumbers sworn on 8 April 1988 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In early December, 1987, I met the 2nd Defendant-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Poppett-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at the office of the 1st Defendant-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the bank-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I used words to the effect that, `What security is Wayne Lawrence offering to the Bank?' The 2nd Defendant replied with words to the effect that, `Lawrence has an irrevocable letter of credit.'</PARA>
<PARA>A few days after the aforesaid meeting, the 2nd Defendant telephoned me and used words to the effect that, `We (the Bank) are going with Wayne Lawrence. His was a much better offer than yours.' I used words to the effect that, `Are you (Poppett) sure Lawrence can back up his offer? I am not satisfied that he can.' The 2nd Defendant replied with words to the effect that, `We (the Bank) have looked right into Lawrence and his companies. He and his companies stack up really well. He has the security the Bank requires.' I then used words to the effect that, `How does Wilfred Taylor feel about this? He really wants to do the deal with us.' The 2nd Defendant responded with words to the effect that, `It is not up to Taylor. It is the Bank's decision.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor's account is further corroborated by an affidavit of accountant Mr Prakash Masih sworn on 20 April 1988 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>On 9th December, 1987, Taylor used words to the effect that, `I have just received a phone call from Poppett and he says we have to go with Lawrence. I tried to talk him out of it, but he says he has checked Lawrence and his companies out thoroughly and they are financially sound. He (Poppett) said Lawrence had produced a letter of credit for $1 million. Poppett insists that if we do not go with Lawrence, he will appoint receivers immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor's account is further corroborated by an affidavit of Mr Tony Rigg of Nowra sworn on 5 April 1988 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>On about the 9th December, 1987, Mr Taylor telephoned me and used words to the effect that, `Peter Poppett said I had to go with Adelview or he would put a receiver in. Poppett told me he looked right into both Lawrence and Tumbers and Lawrence came up better than Tumbers. He said Lawrence had produced a letter of credit for $1 million in favour of Adelview. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor relied upon the statements of fact made to him by Poppett and executed an agreement with Lawrence. Mr Masih's affidavit provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>About midday on 9th December, 1987, Lawrence came into the premises (of Mighty Chef). He said to Taylor, in my presence, words to the effect that, `No doubt Poppett has telephoned you by now and told you that the deal is to be done with us.' Taylor replied with words to the effect that, `Poppett advised me of his decision and we have prepared a draft agreement for your perusal.'</PARA>
<PARA>Small and Moody (an associate of Lawrence) then drafted a simplified form of agreement and handed it to Taylor and myself. I said to Lawrence and Moody, words to the effect that, `I would prefer to sign the amended agreement that we submitted to you this morning. Under your agreement you receive the shares up front for nothing. . .' Moody used further words to the effect that, `Our agreement is the only one we are prepared to sign. I am sure you would not want Mr Poppett to put the receivers in on you.'</PARA>
<PARA>The parties then signed the Agreement and the share transfers. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The statements of fact made by Poppett to Taylor were palpable falsehoods. I make that statement in reliance upon the bank's own files. I refer you, Mr President, and other senators to those files and I rely upon the indisputable documentary evidence produced by the bank, namely, a letter from the bank to Lawrence, dated 11 December 1989 and signed by Poppett himself which, after referring to the release of the bank's securities, states as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The above is subject to the following:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) An unconditional Bank Letter of Credit for $750,000, which must be received at this office on or before Thursday 17th December, 1987 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Poppett is asking for a letter of credit and yet he told both Taylor and Tumbers that he had already signed a letter of credit. That was blatant fraud. The second piece of evidence is a diary note signed by Mr Glen Levingston, an officer of the bank and assistant to Poppett, and dated 30 November 1987 which states relating to Adelview:</PARA>
<PARA>We are yet to verify that the company has the cash (or even the potential) to pay $600,000 to the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The third piece of evidence is a diary note signed by Mr Levingston and dated 2 December 1987 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>We still have no information re the financial standing of Adelview Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>These diary notes mean that, upon the bank's own written admission, the bank did not know the financial standing of Lawrence's company. A diary note of Mr Levingston dated 22 February 1988 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst we do not have any idea of how Lawrence could meet a $750,000 payment (in fact, we know next to nothing about Lawrence or Adelview Ltd.) if he or his company does have the means to pay this amount to MCP (that is, Mighty Chef Products) we would be foolish not to at least take a punt on pursuing the matter for at least another month. </PARA>
<PARA>That diary note means that upon the bank's own written admission, after Poppett made the fraudulent misrepresentations, the bank still did not know the financial standing of Lawrence's companies. I say, and the fact is, that Poppett defrauded Mr Taylor in that he made to Mr Taylor false statements of fact, knowingly or without belief in the truth of the statements and recklessly without caring whether the statements were true or false, with the intent that the statements would be acted upon, and they were in fact acted upon by Mr Taylor. I further say, and the fact is, that Mr Poppett, by swearing the affidavit verifying defence, committed wilful and corrupt perjury as a senior officer of the Commonwealth Bank. I call upon the Attorney-General for New South Wales to forthwith take all appropriate action. I seek the indulgence of the Senate to table all the documents to which I referred in my statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak about an issue that I first raised in the Estimates Committee A hearing on 12 October 1990. The questions that I asked are recorded on page 657 of the Hansard and deal with a question that I asked of the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Kelly, concerning a practice which I called `triple dipping'. On that occasion I asked Mr Kelly about the self-assessment system being used. I asked whether or not it was the practice of the Australian Customs Service to charge an error made in the self-assessment system against the importer-that is, the owner, his agent or the agency of the agent concerned. As the questioning went on, as one would see from the Hansard, I received an answer that no, this practice was not carried out to the knowledge of the Comptroller.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsequent to asking those questions, I inquired a little further as to this practice and I have realised that the error in my question was the use of the word `charge'. In fact, the triple dipping to which I referred works in this way: where an error is made under the self-assessment system, the Customs Service is obliged to keep a record of those people who make such an error. I believe this record is known as the error records register. Instead of the record simply showing that a statement has been made by a particular person who is either the owner or his agent, an entry is made in that register against both the owner and his agent and/or the agency concerned. This becomes particularly relevant when an application is made for a reduction in the penalty which is imposed under the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that, in assessing the reduction of the penalty, the delegate making the decision takes into account the number of errors registered against both the owner and the agent and/or the agency means that an owner who has in no way been involved with the error that has been made by his agent, for instance, is penalised by errors that the agent may have made in cases which do not relate to that owner's business at all. This practice was in fact challenged and, indeed, dealt with more specifically in a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) called Walker (Australia) Pty Ltd and the Comptroller-General of Customs. That decision and the reasons were published on 13 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 October I asked whether or not Mr Kelly, the Comptroller, was aware of another case that was being brought concerning this practice. In the upshot, Senator Button, being the Minister in charge, said that he did not think that the Comptroller should answer that question. I went on to say that perhaps we would get a decision fairly soon and perhaps the Comptroller could make an examination and let us know how many other such cases existed. I have not had an answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a very important matter because, despite the fact that many others have complained about it, there is now a case which is due to be heard on 11 January 1991 called Oxford Clothing Co. and the Comptroller-General of Customs. This particular case involves only a small sum of money, namely, $300, but the people concerned with this case are so incensed that, as a matter of principle, they have taken it to the AAT. Indeed, from the reading of the judgment of Walker (Australia) Pty Ltd and the Comptroller-General of Customs, it would seem that they are relying on that case as a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> One may have argued, I suppose, at one stage that on a plain reading of the Act one could record the error against more than one party, although there is now a clear decision that in fact the view of the AAT is that section 243 of the relevant Act draws a distinction between the actions of the applicant, that is, the owner in this case, and those of the agent or the applicant; that is, the owner. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 243u (4) (a), (c) and (d) are clearly referring to the maker of the statement in question. The statement in question must be that which led to the imposition of the penalty imposed under section 243t, which in this case would be a statement to an officer that is false in a material particular. I raise this matter because it is my feeling that at the time of asking the question on 12 October the practice was identified specifically despite the fact that I used the wrong word. However, I did take the care to go away and research the matter a little more thoroughly, and that is why I have raised this matter here this evening. I will be interested to see the outcome of the case of Oxford Clothing v. Customs on 11 January 1991. </PARA>
