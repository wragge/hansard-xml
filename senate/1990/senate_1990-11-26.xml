<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In light of the announcement by the United States Secretary of State, James Baker, that the United States plans to ask the United Nations (UN) Security Council to meet on Thursday to consider an appropriate resolution which authorises the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait, can the Minister inform the Senate as to the Australian Government's views on this initiative? Have those views been communicated to the Bush Administration?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4393" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports today indicating that Secretary of State Baker does intend chairing a meeting of the Security Council on 29 November to discuss a draft resolution authorising the use of force, as a last resort, against Iraq. The text of the proposed draft resolution has not yet been circulated, but I understand from press reports that it will propose a deadline by which Iraq should withdraw from Kuwait. If Iraq fails to withdraw, member states would be asked to use `all necessary means' to implement the Security Council's resolutions on the crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for Australia's position on this, Australia has, of course, always supported a peaceful resolution to the crisis but, as I and the Prime Minister have indicated on a number of occasions, the military option does have to be kept on the table. If the military option does eventually have to be pursued in order to ensure Iraq's compliance with the Security Council's resolutions, then, as I have also made clear on a number of occasions, whether or not it is strictly necessary Australia would certainly prefer that there be endorsement of such action by a further specific Security Council resolution. Therefore, we would support a further move by the Security Council along the lines reportedly proposed by the United States to increase pressure on Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, although economic sanctions are, on all the evidence available to us, now causing real hardship in Iraq, Saddam Hussein has neither withdrawn from Kuwait nor abided by the norms of international law, particularly as regards the holding of foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait against their will. An ultimatum resulting from a Security Council resolution authorising the use of force would give Saddam Hussein a last opportunity for a peaceful settlement to this crisis. Australia, of course, would urge him very strongly to take that opportunity. The United States Administration is very well aware of Australia's policy on the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. We would expect specific discussions to take place with us on this latest move once a draft text was circulated for comment. Australia is not, of course, presently a member of the Security Council itself, but our delegation to the UN in New York will continue to follow the Council's deliberations very closely and report developments to the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question follows the previous question and the answer that has just been given. In view of the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade now indicates that the Government will support a Security Council resolution authorising force, I ask: will the Government go one step further and use its good offices to lobby for that, in particular with Security Council members within our region such as Malaysia? Now that we are looking at the instance of using force to end this crisis, has Australia been approached to participate in operations against Iraq in the event that such a resolution is passed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first point, we would be guided by the United States of America as the sponsor of such a Security Council resolution as to how it might be best progressed in New York in the Security Council. We would, of course, stand ready to assist in any way that was thought appropriate after such consultation in moving it forward. As to whether we have been approached to assist, no, there has been no approach in that respect. At this stage I do not think I should, so far as future questions of this kind are concerned, be drawn into the position of having to respond to that sort of question. I am not anticipating any particular approach, but it is very difficult in these situations to give a blow-by-blow description of a course of ongoing consultations which will undoubtedly be occurring in the context of a resolution of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. It concerns the Government's agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to replace the first wage adjustment under accord mark 6 with personal income tax cuts. Can the Minister advise the Senate on the benefits this tax-wage trade-off will confer on Australia's economic situation? Can he also advise honourable senators whether this is yet another instance of the continuing success of the accord system between the Government and the ACTU?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4394" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last sitting week I said that the September quarter, for which the consumer price index (CPI) was 0.7 per cent, was the fifth successive quarter in which the inflation rate in Australia had come down and that, in view of that, it was opportune for the Government to look at the innovative use it could make of having such a low figure. Of course, we have done that. Last Tuesday the Treasurer and I announced a proposal to buy out the September quarter wage round with a tax cut. Under accord mark 6 the September quarter was marked down for its CPI increase. That CPI increase was to be taken in the form of a wage increase as the first step under accord mark 6. The second step under accord mark 6 was for there to be, six months later, a $12 per week increase and then for guidelines to be handed down by the Industrial Relations Commission for enterprise based bargaining, those guidelines to provide for no double counting and for achieved productivity and profitability gains. As well, superannuation was provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal that we have consolidated with ACTU officers-a proposal we expect the ACTU Executive to adopt this week-is that we buy out the September quarter wage round; that the $12 will click in about mid-May; that there will be a one per cent superannuation increase from 1 July next year, another one per cent from 1 May 1992 and another one per cent from 1 May 1993; and that there will be enterprise bargaining guidelines for achieved productivity and profitability gains.</PARA>
<PARA> That is done in the expectation that the national wage case decision, which we hope would endorse all of those changes, will be available to us before Christmas. The wage-tax trade-off means that a worker on $30,000 a year will receive an extra tax cut on top of the tax cuts provided for in this year's Budget of $2.95, or the equivalent of a $4.85 wage increase. If one takes the two tax cuts together for the same worker, that would mean a $10.80 per week tax cut in lieu of an $18 per week wage rise. That has been hailed around Australia as a welcome innovation by the Government and one that will lock in a lower level of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> It effectively means that there is now a 12 months wage pause in Australia. The last structural efficiency adjustment was due on 1 March this year and there will not be another wage increase until mid-May next year. However, living standards will be maintained by virtue of the tax cut and purchasing power will remain. It means that our target for inflation in this year's Budget of 6 per cent will be achieved or, indeed, undershot. It means as well that Australia's inflation level will be going down at the time when the inflation levels of every other country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are trending upwards. That can only be of advantage to our trading position. It means that the aggregate wage outcome for the year has been revised downwards from 7 per cent to 6.25 per cent as a consequence of this agreement; meaning that the total wages bill for the budgetary year will be lower.</PARA>
<PARA> It proves once again that if one does not have a wages policy-as the Opposition does not-one cannot regulate and manage the economy. We have a wages policy, by virtue of the accord, that  enables us to manage the economy in order to do things of this nature-things which are to the benefit of the economy and the wider Australian community and things that have been universally acclaimed by all of the commentators. They have all praised the Government for this. Only that big sook and wet blanket, Dr Hewson, has opposed it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade by noting that the use of nuclear weapons against Iraq has been described by United States (US) Defence Secretary Cheney as a possible, if unfavoured, option and was openly endorsed by the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister on his recent visit to Australia. I further note that Secretary Cheney today said that Iraq may be five to 10 years away from  possessing a deliverable nuclear weapon. I ask the Minister: firstly, does he agree that the possible use of nuclear weapons is being raised as part of the process, identified by Morris West in yesterday's Sunday Herald, of conditioning us to war and desensitising us to its consequences? Secondly, does he also agree that Iraq's nuclear ambitions and those of other would-be nuclear powers will be increased by US threats to use nuclear weapons? Thirdly, will the Government convey to the Bush Administration its opposition to the use of nuclear weapons and its intention to withdraw Australian warships from the Gulf region if nuclear weapons are used there? Fourthly, will the Government support a United Nations initiative to maintain a ban on nuclear cooperation with Iraq after it withdraws from Kuwait?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to speculate as to what the motivation might be of those who are dangling, as it were, the use of a nuclear weapon option-although some motives spring pretty rapidly to mind, other than that which was the subject of comment by Mr West. As to what Iraq might do in response to such a threat, again, I do not think it would be helpful or useful for me to speculate about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Australia's attitude on nuclear weapons, our position, of course, is perfectly clear: we do not support the use of nuclear weapons in any context whatsoever. It is difficult to believe that the situation in the Gulf could possibly be an exception to that. I do not think it necessarily follows from that position, however, that we would feel obliged to take a different view about the whole justification for the situation in Iraq and the appropriateness of an international response to it. It is a matter of evaluating that in view of all of the circumstances as they prevail at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as nuclear cooperation with Iraq is concerned, I am not sure that I fully caught the import of the last part of Senator Powell's question but certainly I would hope and expect that the international community would be utterly unwilling in any circumstances whatsoever to extend nuclear cooperation to Iraq in the circumstances of a known disposition on the part of its Government to put together a nuclear weapon.</PARA>

What has been the response to the initiative announced last week between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions?

Has his attention also been drawn to reports of comments by Dr Hewson's spokesperson on industrial relations welcoming the deflationary aspects of the initiative?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The response to the wage-tax trade-off is manifested best by a selection of newspaper editorials responding to the announcement. The Australian Financial Review of 21 November, in its editorial, said the trade-off is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a clever move to achieve a one-off stepdown in prices growth and highlights the value of a flexible wage lever in the Government's policy kit bag . . . The new wage deal is a welcome and sensible step in bringing down the nation's inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Courier-Mail of the same day said, referring to Paul Keating:</PARA>
<PARA>At one stroke, he has emasculated the Opposition on wage policy, removed the counter-productive quality of the Accord process to build inflation into wage bargaining, and helped restart demand as a component of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Launceston Examiner said it was sensible and timely and it will help to turn the economy around. The Canberra Times said the wage-tax deal was an economic coup and went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The . . . Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions can only be described as both politically and economically inspired.</PARA>
<PARA>The Age of 21 November said:</PARA>
<PARA>Clever wage-tax deal benefits all.</PARA>
<PARA>It went to opine in its editorial that it is</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a timely and clever idea that should benefit everyone without any off-setting losses. The Government deserves credit for proposing it and the ACTU for accepting it.</PARA>
<PARA>The Adelaide Advertiser of the next day, 22 November, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The new wage-tax deal is a welcome initiative. It will curb but not cure inflation and provide a circuit-breaker for business.</PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA>The critics can't have it both ways. They can't argue that the economy couldn't afford a wage increase at this time and then argue this deal won't make a great difference to labour costs and therefore employment levels.</PARA>
<PARA> In this sense the Government has cut the ground out from under the feet of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>In his opinion column in the Herald-Sun, George Megalogenis, the economics editor, said:</PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, Mr Keating delivered a win for businesses, for workers and the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on with quotes from the Northern Territory News, an unlikely source of praise for a Labor government; from the Townsville Bulletin, similarly an unlikely source of praise; from the Melbourne Age; from the Herald-Sun, which said, `Keating plays a winner'; and from the Sydney Morning Herald, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>Tax/wage trade-off makes economic, political sense.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, Mr Ian Spicer of the Confederation of Australian Industry said the accord:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is in the best interests of Australia's economy.</PARA>
<PARA>If I can conclude, Mr President, John Howard in a radio interview is reported to have said these grudging words of approval, `To the extent it cuts inflation, I welcome it', and `Under the accord environment it was the logical thing to do'. Only that big sook and wet blanket, Dr John Hewson, said it was a diversion, a last gamble, and it would fail. Who is out of step?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Faulkner asked a question on this matter because the intergovernmental committee of Ministers representing all jurisdictions met in Alice Springs last Friday and received a report from Mr Justice Phillips, the newly installed Chairman of the National Crime Authority. We were greatly heartened by what we heard from him and were therefore able to give him unanimous support in the new directions in which he is leading the National Crime Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for our unanimous support fell into two categories. One was as to the more cooperative, collaborative approach which Mr Justice Phillips promised would be the style of the National Crime Authority in dealing with other law enforcement agencies at the State and Federal levels. The various jurisdictions are sometimes bedevilled by turf disputes and jealousy, and that cannot be allowed to impede nationwide law enforcement against organised crime, particularly drug trafficking and white collar crime of a major nature. That particular emphasis on cooperation and collaboration--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This will be a new and very welcome emphasis. As to the actual substance of the work of the National Crime Authority, there will be a shift in emphasis away from-but not excluding-major drug trafficking and towards white collar crime. Of course, to put them into those two exclusive categories is somewhat misleading. Money laundering is a very good example of a bridge between the two, where those who engage in major drug trafficking launder the proceeds of crime in various enterprises and engage in white collar crime as part of their overall criminal activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the general Australian community now recognises that, with the improvement in the efficiency and, indeed, the integrity of various law enforcement agencies throughout the Commonwealth, there is now a capacity in those other agencies to take up much of the drug trafficking investigation which was a feature of the National Crime Authority under the leadership of its first Chairman, Mr Justice Stewart. I believe the new emphasis in relation to white collar crime is very timely and very welcome.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is not, as Senator Hill has interjected, largely a change of fashion. I believe there is real substance here, and I believe that, with the new emphasis on white collar crime, together with the work being undertaken by the Australian Securities Commission, one has the capacity to make a very cohesive and concentrated attack on that type of criminal activity which defrauds the tax base of revenue and which leads to the undermining of public confidence and investor confidence in much of the commercial and trading life of Australia, both domestically and overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that with this new approach this Parliament can take the same attitude as did the various Ministers from the various jurisdictions in Alice Springs last Friday, and give Mr Justice Phillips a fair go in settling into his new responsibilities and his fresh approach. I believe that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has a real role to play in that support and I am sure it will be briefed by Mr Justice Phillips along the same lines as was the intergovernmental committee. I think it would be useful if the Parliamentary Joint Committee considered, not so much raking over dying embers of past disputes, which I agree were matters of concern, but looking to the matters which will be canvassed by the National Crime Authority and investigated by it as it assembles admissible evidence in relation to major criminal activity in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler indicated last week in a question to me-and I think I responded constructively-that if we can get the balance right between the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the National Crime Authority in relation to the matters which the National Crime  Authority can disclose and matters about which the Parliamentary Joint Committee can legitimately ask questions and report on to this Parliament, we will have a more accountable, less secretive organisation which, although vested with extraordinary powers to investigate organised crime, nevertheless needs to be accountable in our sort of democracy. I believe we can reach that balance and I hope the Parliamentary Joint Committee can agree with the intergovernmental committee of Ministers that the National Crime Authority, under its new leadership, will now enter a more constructive and even democratic phase of its activity within the Australian community and ought to enjoy our full support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our track record in unemployment growth has been very well proven. Employment growth has been almost five times the average annual rate recorded during the previous Government's term. That is a statistic that cannot be repeated too often. We have generated over 1.6 million jobs since we took office, of which over 90 per cent were in the private sector. That is not a statistic which can be repeated too often. It is the case, more recently, that the labour market has been subdued-employment did fall a marginal 0.1 per cent in the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures-to fall some 0.4 per cent in the three months to October, compared with the previous three months.  This is hardly a collapse in the labour market. There clearly has not been a major shake-out. It is nowhere near the 2.6 per cent collapse in employment which was recorded over five consecutive quarters during the 1982-83 recession, which Senator Short may well recall, since he has some of the responsibility of his Government for that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I will answer the question in exactly the way in which I intended. The rise in unemployment rates since late 1989 was largely due to the significant rise in labour force participation rather than any other consideration. However, the slowdown in demand growth necessary to reduce the current account deficit cannot be achieved without affecting both output and the labour market. Statements by Mr Kelty and others reflect that reality. The Budget forecasts an increase in unemployment this year, although it should start to decline next year as the economy recovers. Beyond that, I do not propose to speculate about what the particular figures are or may be.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for her question, because it is important to note that the Commonwealth will act in accordance with the decision of the Australian Police Ministers Council in  Alice Springs last Thursday to ban the import of certain military style semi-automatic self-loading rifles (SLRs) into the Australian community. The firearms to be prohibited from import are simply those which have been designed-or which try to imitate them-by the Soviet Union or Chinese military forces or militias for the purpose of killing other human beings. I believe that all honourable senators would agree that those types of weapons ought to find no place being imported into the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The New Zealand Minister for Police was with us at that meeting in Alice Springs and he indicated and applauded his great support for this decision. As honourable senators know, a Russian military style semi-automatic weapon was used in the terrible massacre which occurred very recently in New Zealand. Indeed, the killer had in his arsenal the type of Chinese style military weapon that is being imported at the moment into New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I think it is important to allay and put to rest some of the fears and misgivings which legitimate hunters, recreational shooters and some landowners have in regard to the exact definition of what will be banned from import. The Ministers quite clearly decided that those SLRs which have a magazine capacity of five rounds or an integrated magazine will be permitted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Newman will allow me to complete my remarks, she will see that I am adding to any statement I may have made from Alice Springs. For example, Mr Ted Pickering, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in the New South Wales Government, has said that a hunter of feral pigs in New South Wales can be faced with the prospect of confronting such a fierce animal with only a one-shot shotgun. That is absolute nonsense, because SLRs of a certain capacity will be permitted, and I believe that responsible shooters, hunters and landowners will applaud this particular decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have received great support from all jurisdictions, apart from New South Wales. The Northern Territory, for example, where the Chief Minister, Mr Marshall Perron, gave the earliest and strongest support for this particular ban, allows hunting in relation to the destruction of feral animals. Mr Perron was quite happy with this particular ban which I have described.</PARA>
<PARA> The various shooters' organisations have been given a privileged position in regard to the list of those categories of firearms which will be permitted for import. For their endorsed disciplines and various competitions, they will in fact indicate which hand guns or rifles ought to be allowed in so that they can fulfil their competitive shooting needs. As I say, hunters, recreational shooters and landowners will have access to other firearms as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the banning of Chinese Red Army militia style weapons of this very lethal kind ought to be welcomed by the Australian community, as indeed it has been by all jurisdictions except New South Wales. I believe that the Senate itself, having taken a great interest in the shaping and moulding of Australian society in the future, particularly in regard to questions of violence, will itself applaud this particular move.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question, of course, does have direct relevance to Senator Reynolds, but I am quite sure that the initiative that Australia took recently would be welcomed by every member of the Senate. The Great Barrier Reef is unique in that it is the largest system of corals and associated life forms in the world. Australia has been pressing for some time for enhanced measures to protect it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to advise the Senate that last week Australia was successful in a major diplomatic effort to gain compulsory pilotage of ships on the Great Barrier Reef. A meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) agreed to identify the Great Barrier Reef as a particularly sensitive area. This was the first such declaration by the IMO of any such area in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> This is simply not a question of symbolism; it has a real effect. All of the major shipping nations of the world will be required by their governments to instruct ships flying their flags to act in accordance with Australia's pilotage arrangements for the Great Barrier Reef. Amendments will be made to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act which will require all ships which pose a potential hazard to the reef to carry a pilot when navigating the northern part of the inner reef and Hydrographers Passage off Mackay. This requirement will apply to all ships in excess of 70 metres in length and to loaded oil tankers, chemical carriers and liquefied gas carriers, irrespective of their length.</PARA>
<PARA> Also an integral component of the Government's strategy is a special oil spill contingency plan for the reef called Reefplan, which is developed especially for protection of the reef. As part of this plan, the Commonwealth Government is currently engaged in a major upgrading of the stockpiles of pollution equipment contained at Townsville. There will be in excess of $1m worth of equipment located in Townsville when that upgrade is completed.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Great Barrier Reef has been included in the World Heritage List and is also recognised in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships-that is, the MARPOL Convention.

Approximately two weeks ago, Deputy President Riordan directed the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) not to strike. I repeat: he directed the union not to strike. In view of the total disregard by the AMIEU of this direction, will the Federal Government, at the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearing on 28 November, be intervening in support of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, firstly to have a bans clause inserted into the award and, secondly, to have all preferences to unionists removed from the award so that these abattoirs can employ people who are prepared to work and get our meat exports moving again; or will the Government stand idly by and see further damage to our international reputation as a trader and, by default, endorse the abuse of the Industrial Relations Commission by the AMIEU, which is nothing short of anarchy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the conscientiousness with which Senator Crane has put one point of view in the case of a quite serious industrial dispute in Australia. It should be said right at the start that the Australian Government is presiding over the lowest level of industrial disputation that has ever occurred in this country since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began keeping statistics on person days lost per thousand employees. Therefore, we are not talking about an industrial dispute in which there is a whole environment, if you like, across the board of industrial disputation. This has meant that we have been able to concentrate our efforts in creating industrial harmony by looking at the sectors that are particularly plagued. Unfortunately, it has to be said that the meat industry area is one of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a consequence, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is conducting an inquiry into the meat industry. The purpose of that inquiry, amongst other things, is to find out how to achieve a better industrial relationship in that industry, given its particular seasonal features, the tally system that applies and the far-flung regional locations of much of that industry around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Also as part of that inquiry, the Australian Government is sponsoring a tripartite union, employer and government overseas mission to look at best practice in other countries and to find models in which we can learn lessons to improve our own industrial management for the industry. It is against that background that this question arises. It is not to say that we do not treat this dispute as serious-we will. I will certainly consider the position of the Australian Government in terms of this matter. I do not think it is appropriate simply to proceed from a one-sided viewpoint and imagine, therefore, that all the elements of that one-sided viewpoint are right. The best course of action in cases like this is to allow the Industrial Relations Commission to do its job. That is far and away the preferred position of the Government.</PARA>

The current situation is that at the last Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) meeting-which I think was in Hobart-there was a proposal to establish a number of working groups with State governments to further discuss this issue, and that is precisely where the proposals are at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty that we are currently faced with, and I have particular sympathy in this regard for States such as New South Wales, is that State governments that have hitherto tried to be responsible in their charging regimes in respect of road use, and have tried to cope with what everyone acknowledges is a major problem in this country-that is, how to provide the extraordinarily expensive national system of roads with a population of 17 million people and 3 1/2 million square miles to build it across-have been penalised because of the current fractured system of charging.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is a particular problem for States like New South Wales. A massive amount of traffic runs across the roads of that State flowing, for example, from Victoria to Queensland and vice versa. The revenue gained as a result of that road use does not accrue to New South Wales, and any attempt by government, such as the New South Wales Government, to bring in a realistic system of charging would simply result in the trucking companies concerned moving the headquarters of their operations to a State where the road charges are less. It is a major problem that everyone acknowledges.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I thank you for rebutting that erroneous point of order by Senator Walters. The question of fire in the home and the contribution of furniture as an ignition point for those fires is, of course, a matter of grave concern, not only as to the fabric covering but also as to the foams which are now so often used in furnishings in Australia, because of the toxic fumes and gases that they can produce.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Richardson says, it is a form of pollution, but in this case so toxic that it can be not only injurious but also, in some cases, fatal. This is of great concern. The fact is that the Furniture Manufacturers Association of Australia and the Plastic Industry Association have come to an agreement in relation to these particular voluntary safety standards for the flammability of furnishings in Australia. I believe this is to be commended. It is important that we have the industries behind us and that the furniture manufacturers, importers and suppliers-retailers are fully supportive of this particular voluntary safety standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I was saying earlier to Senator Walters, the fact is that the Australian Furniture Testing Research and Development Institute, based in Launceston, Tasmania, will have the prime role in carrying out the various tests on the fabrics and foam fillings used in these furnishings. I believe that the expertise of that institute will be such that those who purchase furnishings in Australia over the next several years can be very confident that they will meet the standards that I am about to describe. The tests to be used are: the smouldering cigarette test, which involves assessing combustion when a lighted cigarette is placed on the furniture--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to his answers to questions on the deterioration in relations between Australia and India following the sale of Australia's Mirage aircraft to Pakistan. These answers have not been at all satisfactory. I ask: first, is it not the case that, contrary to the Minister's assurance that the supply date was understood, the Indian Foreign Minister wrote to him-after the Minister's visit to India-expressing concern that the delivery dates were apparently not as the Minister had undertaken to him when in India; secondly, did not the Australian High Commission in Delhi propose that ministerial consultations be held immediately following the intended Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' meeting; thirdly, did not the Indian Government then indicate that the timing was inappropriate because of the deterioration in Australia-India bilateral relations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already answered these questions. There was some suggestion that Australia had breached specific assurances as to the timing of the delivery of these aircraft. There were no such assurances. I have put into the record of this Senate the specific language I used in public press conferences, which make it clear that it was not an assurance being given but simply an expression of our perception as to the likelihood of the delivery date, which is something very different. I can assure Senator Teague, again, as I have previously, that no different language was ever used in private. If there was some misunderstanding of that, then it is not something for which I or the Australian Government can possibly be held responsible. Our position remains absolutely firm on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of a possible ministerial meeting following a possible meeting of Foreign Ministers on southern Africa and Delhi, I repeat the point that I have previously made to the Senate: no such meeting was ever scheduled or firmly bedded down at any stage. Indeed, the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' meeting on southern Africa, which would have been the occasion for such a possible meeting, did not in the event go ahead. So there is no foundation for Senator Teague seeking to beat yet more life into a fatally dead old nag of the kind that he is presently trying to beat life into.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented in a press release put out by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) concerning a supposed version of an interview undertaken in the Kronos program which I believe was broadcast on Friday. In the press release put out by the ABC it was claimed that I spoke of Roman Catholic bishops living in mansions. That in fact was a complete distortion of what I had said, had intended to say and what was in fact broadcast by Kronos the next day. Indeed, the press release was quite a fabrication of my views. Words were attributed to me which I never used.  For example, when talking about Anglican archbishops, the interviewer stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Senator the Hon. Michael Tate</PARA>
<PARA>26 NOV 1990</PARA>
<PARA>TO BISHOPS AND OTHER LEADERS OF CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA>You will have been as amazed and distressed as I have been at recent distortions of my views as peddled by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The press release put out by the ABC (Attachment A) claimed that I spoke of Roman Catholic bishops living in mansions. The fact is I never used such a phrase. The interviewer did, but I didn't take the bait-the ABC has simply made the phrase fall from my lips. </PARA>
<PARA>This was part of the desperate attempt by the ABC to get something controversial out of my address the previous week to the Anglican Social Responsibilities Commission (Attachment B)-the last few paragraphs are relevant. The `Kronos' interview implied that I had attacked the Anglican bishops in this matter. It will be apparent that I didn't. In fact, I refused to generalise in a defamatory way because I recognised how unfair that would be. </PARA>
<PARA>I enclose a transcript of the Kronos interview as broadcast. This version gives little ground for my supposed attack-I merely pointed to the dangers which are real enough-and, I note that in doing so I acknowledged that many of the residences are bestowed on the clergy, not personally chosen by them. This point was also edited out of the press release version of the interview. </PARA>
<PARA>I am trying to get hold of the whole interview tape (unedited) which, I am sure, would confirm my more tempered line. I very much regret the undue furore that has erupted following a very simple observation. May I assure you that the thesis that this is part of a concerted attack by me as a Minister on the church's leadership is utterly without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>(Michael Tate)</PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT A</PARA>
<PARA>RELEVANT PART FROM `MEDIANET'-ABC PRESS RELEASE</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate, a Roman Catholic layman and an Oxford graduate in Theology, criticised his own Church's perceived hypocrisy in lecturing the government and the community on economic matters while its Bishops lived in mansions. </PARA>
<PARA>`There is a danger that the style of life of its chief ministers and the homes in which they reside do put them in a suburb, let alone a lifestyle, which is not adjacent to those to whom the gospel was primarily directed,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT B</PARA>
<PARA>RELEVANT EXTRACT FROM ADDRESS: SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE 1990's</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, that Gospel from last week is very pertinent. If you are in the political area, you must have absolute concurrence between what you practise and what you preach. If the Salvoes have credibility in the community, it is because of the absolute concurrence which is perceived between what they say and what they do. </PARA>
<PARA>You must not give politicians the opportunity to say, `look what they are saying, and then look at what they are doing''. </PARA>
<PARA>Australians have a good nose for hypocrisy and will not readily accept edicts from `on high'-secular or sacred-particularly when they realise there is a great disparity between the professed concerns and the actual lifestyle of those in authority. </PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT C</PARA>
<PARA>RELEVANT PART OF KRONOS INTERVIEW AS BROADCAST</PARA>
<PARA>Austin: Senator Tate in your recent address to the Anglican Church's Social Responsibilities Commission you said `Australians have a good nose for hypocrisy and will not readily accept edicts from on high, secular or sacred. Particularly when they realise there is a great disparity between the professed concerns and the actual lifestyle of those in authority'. You then commended the Salvos, specifically for their obvious consistency but not the Anglicans to whom the address was directed. I take it that you believe that there is an inconsistency between statements from on high by Anglican Archbishops and the lifestyle that they display from their mansions. </PARA>
<PARA>Tate: Well, it would be wrong to generalise, and I wouldn't want to do that. I think it would be probably defamatory as much as anything. My own church, and I'm a Roman Catholic, and other more established mainstream churches, there is a danger that the style of life of its chief ordained Ministers and the homes in which they reside which have been bestowed on them, do put them in a suburb, let alone in a lifestyle, which is not amongst those to whom the gospel was primarily directed. And I think that is a disparity which people do note.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I have given notice of this motion on behalf of the Opposition is to give the Government the maximum time possible to consult with the veterans' community about a change to the calculations of impairment for war disability. Currently veterans are assessed both on their medical impairment and on their lifestyle impairment. Mr President, as you would be aware, the veterans' community campaigned long and hard to get rid of a lifestyle report which was complex, long and difficult for elderly people to complete. In June the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) announced that that would be abolished and since then the Department of Veterans' Affairs has operated without that lifestyle report. The Government has now introduced instruments which will get rid of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions 2 and introduce GARP 3, but in doing so it has not taken into account lifestyle effects as a result of medical impairment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that it is very important for the Government to have proper and meaningful consultations with the veterans' community to see that this, although administratively efficient, should not be done at the expense of a fair go for veterans. There is also concern that GARP 3 might be inconsistent with the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The time made available by the Opposition giving extended notice will enable some of these matters to be taken into account, and will enable the Government to look at alternative ways whereby lifestyle impacts can be factored into the assessment. The Opposition does not wish to delay unnecessarily the efficiency of the administration of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but it should be right, not just speedy. In giving 10 sitting days notice today, I warn the Government that there is an urgent need to review all those things hand in hand and cooperatively with the veterans' community.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report before the Senate is the annual report for our international airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, for the 1989-90 financial year. The report documents the very strong growth in Australian tourism that has occurred under the Hawke Government since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very illuminating to look at the numbers of passengers carried by our international carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd. One sees that in 1983, when this Government first came to office, only 2.1 million persons were carried by Qantas. In the year that we are looking at, 1989-90, for which we have the annual report, that number has doubled in just seven years to 4.2 million passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the report has some unpleasant news. In comparison with 1988-89, 1989-90 shows a dramatic slump in Qantas revenues and a consequent turnaround in Qantas's position, from a profit the previous year to a loss in the current year of record. In 1988-89, Qantas turned in an operating profit-that is, excluding external and extraneous items such as the sale of aircraft-of $177.2m. In the financial year just ended, Qantas has recorded an operating loss of $125m. So there has been a big turnaround for the worse in the accounts of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report documents that a major cause of that turnaround in revenues and in the operating result was the impact of the domestic pilots dispute that began in August last year and extended through into early 1990. It is estimated by Qantas that the pilots strike, even though it was in respect of domestic airlines, affected Qantas profits to the extent of $165m-an enormous sum of money. The strike certainly hit demand for travel to Australia in important markets such as Japan, the United States of America and West Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> The current report shows that Qantas is rationalising its routes. It is striking to look at where Qantas now flies to in continental Europe. In this financial year, Qantas has ceased flying to Amsterdam and Athens and it is also terminating services to Bahrain in the current year. It now flies only to Manchester, London, Frankfurt and Rome in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am rather concerned to read in the annual report that Qantas has terminated its services to India. India was a focus of a recent inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It is now the case that our national flag carrier no longer services the second most populous country in the world-a country which early in the next century is set to have the largest population in the world. India has a large potential urban middle class market that I believe can be tapped eventually-not in the short term-for international travel. I am very concerned that that trend has been recorded in this annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity of speaking at a seminar in Melbourne last month on the question of our relations with South Asia and India in particular. At the time the seminar was being held, Qantas was cutting out its flights to Bombay. So, the very week that members of the university and business communities in Melbourne were trying to foster better relations between Australia and India, Qantas was in fact removing its services to Bombay. </PARA>
<PARA> As a resident of South Australia, I think Qantas should be doing more to service the smaller capital cities in Australia, particularly Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide where there are not yet enough direct international flights by Qantas to international capitals. It is not satisfactory for people living in those States to have to travel via Sydney and Melbourne airports. Travellers suffer the congestion, holdups and delays caused at those airports, which can add up to half a day to international journeys. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly welcome the long overdue move by Qantas this year to initiate direct flights from Tokyo to Adelaide. I also welcome the doubling of direct non-stop flights from Adelaide to Auckland in New Zealand, which again is a long overdue move. I certainly welcome Qantas's extra connections through Singapore to Bangkok in the current year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion to take note of the document. I note that the Australian airlines dispute was not the only reason for the substantial decline in the profit of Qantas Airways Ltd which unfortunately resulted in an operational loss of $125.2m for the year to 30 June. I am one of those people who has a great deal of time and respect for Qantas. Looking at the annual report of Qantas Airways Ltd, one can see why the Government was eventually forced to decide to sell such a large proportion-49 per cent-of Qantas. To call it privatising is not accurate. The Government retains a majority position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The annual report shows that only two years ago Qantas's non-current debt was about $500m; it is now at $1.8 billion-almost four times as much. Qantas is now facing a massively increased interest bill at a time when interest rates are pretty high. That is one of the serious problems that Qantas faces. It underlines the necessity for many organisations like Qantas to be privatised so that they can finance their operations in the most effective and economical way possible. In some instances that may mean substantially increasing their equity base rather than forcing them into massive borrowings, the way Qantas has been forced, bringing with it a huge rise in its interest bill. The report indicates:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian domestic pilots' dispute . . . is estimated to have reduced pre-tax operating profits by $165.0 million. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, had it not been for the domestic pilots strike, instead of having an operational loss of $125m we would have had an operational profit of $40m. But $40m is still $137m down on the 1989 result of $177m. There has been a $137m drop in operational profit, which I believe needs further explanation in the annual report than we have received. As the annual report notes, it was critical that revenue be increased to cover the expenditure increases. There were increased aircraft standing charges. Staffing levels were increased, in anticipation of a level of operations which was not attained. Fuel prices rose significantly. A key factor was that shortages of skilled tradesmen resulted in some maintenance of aircraft being performed overseas at increased costs. Also towards the end of the year the freight market weakened significantly as a result of a slowdown in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is facing all of these problems and will continue to face them, at least in the short term. The Board's objective, as stated here by the Chairman, is to strategically manage this interim reverse to ensure that short term financial losses are minimised. This explains why some of those services referred to by Senator Maguire have been diminished. It is also particularly heartening to note that foreign currency earnings are predicted to exceed 60 per cent of the total revenue in 1990-91. This is particularly significant if we are looking at a situation where the Australian dollar could come under pressure in future. Whilst the company expects to achieve a turnaround in profits in operations in 1990-91, adverse factors such as the increasing fuel prices resulting from the Gulf crisis, the volatility of the Australian dollar and increased competition on all routes are matters which will affect the final results. So it is making no profit forecasts for the coming year. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Our ability to attract, train and retain maintenance personnel will also be critical to our plan to handle the major part of aircraft maintenance inhouse.</PARA>
<PARA>Qantas faces some problems and I hope that it will triumph over them, but I must say that its present revenue load factor and the problems it faces seem to suggest that 1991 will also be a very difficult year for Qantas. I hope that when Qantas is finally fully privatised it will be able to operate far more effectively than it has been able to because of the way this Government has hamstrung it, particularly in relation to its capital base, and because of the Government's failure to understand its problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about the Qantas Airways Ltd annual report, in particular, to endorse the remarks of my colleague Senator Michael Baume on the problems that Qantas has faced during the year. In that context, his concern about the forthcoming year is, I think, very well taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As stated in the report, the indication is that the freight market weakened significantly as a result of the slowdown in the Australian economy towards the end of the year. I think that is a portent of the future. There is no doubt that economic conditions in the current financial year will become considerably more difficult than in the year gone by for Qantas and, indeed, for every other productive enterprise in Australia, as a result of a variety of factors, notably, of course, the policies of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect that I want to touch on-Senator Michael Baume has already touched on it-is privatisation. The word `privatisation' has been used by the Chairman in the report, by which he means the sale of 49 per cent of Qantas to the private sector. Of course, it is the policy of the Opposition to have a 100 per cent sale of Qantas to the private sector. The 49 per cent sale really does not make a great deal of sense when we look at the requirements, particularly the capital and other financial structure requirements, of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that at the last election the Opposition went to the people with the policy proposal that 100 per cent of Qantas be privatised. Quite clearly, that remains the Opposition's position, and I regret that the Government did not take the opportunity this time to follow the same route. The only reason that it did not take the opportunity this time was that it was prevented from doing so by its factions and, particularly, the left wing of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to mention is that this is the first report of the new Chairman, Mr Dix. On behalf of the Opposition, I wish him well in his very difficult task. I also want to place on record a tribute to the almost 10 years of chairmanship of Qantas by Mr Jim Leslie, who, I believe, did an extraordinarily good job in very difficult times. Mr Leslie and his other Board members, in particular, his Vice-Chairman, Mr Jack Davenport, who also retired just a few months ago, did a sterling job on behalf of Qantas. I think we owe them all a debt of gratitude for that. I am pleased to place that on the record on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak very briefly to the Qantas Airways Ltd annual report. I am somewhat disappointed that over the years services to north Queensland have not expanded in the way that I might have hoped. I might have hoped that Qantas, as Australia's airline, would have been at the forefront of that expansion. North Queensland is becoming one of the world's leading tourist destinations. I think that more services should be organised through Townsville and Cairns to the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt Qantas looks very seriously at the passenger traffic available and, hopefully, makes its decisions on a commercial basis. But it seems to me that there is a lot of scope for Qantas to promote more flights into northern Australia, in particular to northern Queensland through the Townsville and Cairns ports, to cope with the increasing demand for tourism in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Qantas should look at charters from overseas into Australia, particularly charters involving the backpacker market. The backpacker market is one of the ever growing aspects of Australian tourism. This particularly involves young Europeans and, even more so now, Japanese. Although they come to Australia on fairly limited travel budgets, once they get here they spend something like $60 per day, which goes round the community. That is a figure from the James Cook University. Qantas should look very closely at catering more for the backpacker market with special fares and deals and possibly even charters. </PARA>
<PARA> While talking about that, and continuing a remark that Senator Michael Baume made about maintenance costs, which are referred to in the Chairman's covering letter sending the report to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), I wish to mention just briefly a terrible bungle in Townsville, which city was competing for a major maintenance facility which would have served Qantas very well. It would have been possible to establish the facility in Townsville much more cheaply than in many other parts of Australia and certainly the world. </PARA>
<PARA> A report in the Townsville Bulletin this morning indicates that the maintenance facility base that was being looked at for Townsville has now gone to Mexico. According to the article, those blamed to a certain extent for this are the Mayor of Townsville, Alderman Mooney, and the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss who, it is suggested, have not done their bit in getting the figures together to encourage, in this instance, a Hong Kong based company which wanted to set up a maintenance facility in Townsville. Had that maintenance facility been given the assistance that might have been expected, it is possible that a very economically operated maintenance facility could have been set up in Townsville which would have served Qantas fleets and the fleets of all the other airlines that serve the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly a shortage of maintenance facilities in Australia, as is mentioned in the Qantas report. This has meant that much of our aircraft maintenance is being done overseas, for example, as far away as Ireland. I guess that when this Mexican establishment is set up, aircraft using the Asia-Pacific routes will probably be maintained in Mexico rather than north Queensland, which is probably the closest stable base. Its facilities include a university, a certain lifestyle and the general support infrastructure needed to support such a base. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in the future the Government and Qantas might look a little bit more closely at this issue. I realise that maintenance facilities are not a matter for Qantas as such, but no doubt Qantas and its board would have an influence on where such facilities are established. I hope that if Qantas looks a little further into that, it may see some economic benefits in having a major maintenance facility in north Queensland. It may be able to use its influence to get the Queensland Government and the Townsville City Council moving on the assistance that is needed to encourage airlines to set up these sorts of maintenance facilities in north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak on two issues regarding the Health Insurance Commission annual report 1989-90. First, as to the photographs in the report, I read on the inside fly cover that that the photographs featured were taken on Bondi Beach and that the series is part of a small collection of photographs of art works purchased by the Commission. I would not normally speak on this, but it seems stunning to me that most of these photographs show young and old people on the beach wearing no hats and no sleeves on their arms. The exception is an old person-the sort of person that our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) refers to as a `silly old bugger'-who sensibly has his arms covered and a hat on. There is also a photograph of a beach inspector, a large person of maybe 18 stone or so-I will not mention the size of anybody else in this chamber-who, given what Mr Howe has been talking about in the last two days, is munching his way to death, if he has not already died of melanoma or some sort of overweight-induced disease. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not the Health Commission is trying to teach people how not to do things, it seems odd to me that the Health Commission, in its artworks, would buy photographs showing people doing exactly what we do not want them to do: sunbaking without hats on --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are all dated, yes, but it does not matter. We all knew in 1985 that we ought to be wearing hats. The second issue I wish to raise is in connection with the Health Insurance Commission annual report for 1988-89. One wonders if anybody takes any notice when one speaks for five minutes, but I realise that maybe the Health Insurance Commission has taken notice of what I said when I expressed concern that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was moving into the Health Insurance Commission. I expressed my concern at the privacy issues that would arise as a result of data from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the Health Insurance Commission, from Medicare, being available in the one department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee hearing I asked how long Health Insurance Commission data, especially Medicare data, was kept. Much to my amazement, I was told-and I keep repeating this in the chamber-that the Medicare data was kept on line for two years, and when I asked and probed as to how long it was kept off line I was told since the inception of Medicare. A visit to the local general practitioner, which does not involve giving any details, may not be of great concern as regards our privacy, but it is of concern when some tests-pathology tests and other sorts of tests-and referrals to specialists may in fact be able to assist someone to determine what sort of illness is being investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned about this matter, and in the Estimates Committee hearing in May I asked the Health Insurance Commission whether it would be addressing the issue of privacy in its next annual report, it having been raised in the annual report last year. What was the answer? The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I guess we are reasonably well advanced in thinking out the construction of this year's annual report. We have not had any plans but we will certainly consider your request. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has now considered my request and we have in the annual report of the Health Insurance Commission a whole page on data security and privacy. If, in this five minutes and the Estimates Committee hearing, I can make the Health Insurance Commission more aware of its responsibility with regard to privacy and the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefit records of citizens of Australia, then I have achieved something. In fact, in the Estimates Committee hearing, the Commission said that it was now developing, in conjunction with the Department of Community Services and Health, a policy to look at the question of computerised records, how long they should be kept and for what purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe in this place we can call on the bureaucrats and the Government to be accountable for issues which we think are of concern. I believe that the privacy of Australians with regard to their medical records is an issue of great concern. I commend the Health Insurance Commission for addressing that matter, but I put the Commission on notice that I will be relentlessly following the matter up until something is done about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the motion to take note of the Health Insurance Commission annual report 1989-90. I do so because it is important that some of the details which are held within the Health Insurance Commission but are not contained in this report should be highlighted. I refer particularly to the continuing tragedy of abortion in Australia and, according to the material that has been provided by the Department of Community Services and Health, no doubt from the records of the Health Insurance Commission, the incidence of abortion in Australia and its cost to the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Finance annual report 1989-90 is a very informative report and I think the Department has done an excellent job in its preparation. It is a massive report and in five minutes one cannot say too much about it. But I do want to note in particular the reduction over recent years of staff numbers. That is impressive, given the number, range and complexity of issues with which the Department deals. Those staff cut reduction figures are shown on page 178 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the work of the Department has progressed very satisfactorily in the last year. The Budget documentation, much of which is put together by the Department of Finance, is good and there has certainly been a marked improvement with greater professionalism, sophistication and informativeness in the Budget material that has been presented over recent years. The Forward Estimates are very helpful and the whole development of program budgeting-despite various questions that are raised about it from time to time-is on the whole also progressing very well. </PARA>
<PARA> The outriders of the Department have had large work burdens which they have had to cope with: the Retirement Benefits Office, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust and the Australian National Audit Office. Again, by and large I believe those outriders have worked effectively and efficiently over the period under review. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, though, it is not all praise that I have to offer. I believe that the operations of the Commonwealth task force on asset sales is a matter of major concern, and I note in particular its recent actions on the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. Those activities appear directly at odds with the objective that the task force stated in the report, namely:</PARA>
<PARA>Through the use of best practices from both the public and private sectors, manage specific major asset sales and, as appropriate, oversight the ongoing asset disposal programs by other departments to achieve the best possible outcome for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the objective laid down on page 164 of the report. It is quite clear that best practices have not been followed in several instances, particularly in relation to the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. The activities and methods used by the task force have attracted the wrath of the New South Wales Supreme Court, which has led to costly litigation. I believe this has undermined the integrity of government and has put future buyers' confidence in the Government at risk and therefore added risk premium to all future sales. In support of that proposition relating to the Moomba pipeline matter, Chief Justice Gleeson said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is no light matter for the Commonwealth Parliament by legislation to override contractual arrangements made between a Statutory Authority and a member of the public or a private corporation, even if the Commonwealth is not itself a party to those contractual arrangements. Such action obviously has important consequences for the future willingness of persons to deal with Commonwealth authorities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is a fairly damning statement. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report No. 12 relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and more specifically to the community development employment projects, is a very important paper which requires a lot more study than I have the time to give it today or to research properly. The community development employment project (CDEP) was first instituted by the Fraser Government in 1977. It has had a long and chequered career. In many cases it has been very successful and in others it has had a lot of criticism. It seems to be one of those schemes which could be described as an excellent concept but has been found to be failing in its implementation: when it is good it is very good, and when it is not so good it is damned awful. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look very carefully at the importance of this scheme. In the 1989-90 financial year the commitment to the program was of the order of $134m. Whilst that amount of money needs to be put in the context that most of it is in effect a substitution program for what would normally be met as unemployment benefits through the Department of Social Security, we always need to address the realistic goals and achievable projects that can be assessed under the particular program. All too often-particularly in recent years and probably more particularly since the Hawke Government instituted in 1984-85 the Aboriginal employment development policy-we hear slogans rather than the achievement attached to many of these particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The CDEP can often be described as a make-work situation. In many cases it is inherently phoney because it creates employment for people who would otherwise be on unemployment benefit. The very serious question that I believe has to be addressed at all times is this: how do we get the participants and communities that take part in the CDEP program off the program and into more productive employment and more satisfying work? In many cases the way in which the program is implemented is well based. But, as this particular report has highlighted, there are a number of areas that need to be seriously addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General has found nine major areas that need further attention. To precis them, they are as follows: the community development plans developed by the various Aboriginal communities; the need for the activities to be better targeted; the need for community members to clarify their understanding of their entitlements to CDEP, vis-a-vis unemployment benefits; the assistance that is needed for the significant proportion of people entitled to family allowance supplement; various factors that have contributed to inaccurate payments that need to be addressed; the wage rates under CDEP generally that have not reflected the relevant or appropriate award rates despite the guidelines of the program; support and training, particularly in the areas of management and accounting requirements, and the fact that there is scope for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to improve its administrative procedures in a number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Those comments basically precis what is a comprehensive audit report that has pointed to many areas and issues that need to be properly addressed. I am sure that many honourable members and senators in the Government will pay particular regard to this report. I know that Dr Michael Wooldridge, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, will give it his close attention, as will my Senate colleague Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking through the report it is always easy in areas identified with Aboriginal projects to focus too often on the sensational or particular projects that are often targeted. I do not intend to do that in any way today because the Auditor-General has highlighted the many areas that need particular attention. The areas that worry me personally are where the communities have not devised an appropriate community development plan for the implementation of these important schemes. The Auditor-General is quite critical of a number of these schemes. The development activities need to be designed and valued by the communities in which they operate. Too often the activities are seen merely as a financial means of funds flowing into the community rather than assessing them against the activities and outcomes for the Aboriginal participants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General has found on so many occasions that the objectives are not being met, that the criteria against which the applications are assessed are not proper, and that there is an insufficient level of contact by ATSIC officers. He found that, particularly in the administration and management area, there is a reliance on far too many non-Aboriginals in key administrative positions with regard to the programs. The Auditor-General has very carefully turned his attention to the issues of high staff turnover and community members not having the necessary skills and training to manage the CDEP grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General has made a number of criticisms in relation to the position in Queensland, where his findings are consistent with those of the Queensland Auditor-General with regard to the administration of many councils in Queensland that operate essentially municipal functions but have failed in many areas of accounting and management control requiring serious attention. I would certainly commend this report for detailed assessment by ATSIC, as its predecessor, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, has been involved with this program since day one. The fact that since 1977 these issues have not been satisfactorily addressed I believe heightens the concerns that we should all ensure that the recommendations of this report are very properly implemented in the next couple of years. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA>LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives effect to a number of Government initiatives relating to care for the aged, Medicare, therapeutic goods, and nurse education. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to care for the aged, the Bill seeks to amend section 45F of the National Health Act 1953 to provide that a Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities for approved nursing homes forms a schedule to the Act. The Bill also seeks to make a similar amendment to section l0DA of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 in relation to a Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities for approved hostels. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of a Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities for nursing homes and hostels is one of a number of initiatives the Government is currently implementing which aim to ensure that the rights of residents of Government funded nursing homes and hostels are promoted and protected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Charter is a statement of the principles that underpin all of this Government's initiatives relating to residents' rights. It reflects the basic belief that a person's fundamental rights do not diminish when they move into a nursing home or hostel, regardless of their physical or mental frailty and regardless of their dependence on others for personal care. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of recent debate about the Charter, and the associated Agreement, I would like to say a few words about the rights it contains. </PARA>
<PARA>The Charter does not give new rights to residents that people in Australian society do not already have, but seeks to retain those basic rights for our frail, aged residents in nursing homes and hostels. Just because an individual has reached a certain level of physical or mental frailty, and requires residential care, does not mean he or she should lose any of the rights and freedoms enjoyed prior to entering a nursing home or hostel. </PARA>
<PARA>The Charter is to be enshrined within the legislation to enhance its status as Australian society's definitive statement on the rights of residents in aged care facilities. Embodying the Charter within the legislation will also increase its effectiveness in promoting changes in attitudes about, and perceptions of, the role of older people within society. </PARA>
<PARA>The Charter was also tabled earlier this session under the existing provisions in each Act. This was necessary as the existing legislation requires that the resident-proprietor agreement, which was tabled at the same time, be consistent with the Charter formulated by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments will repeal the existing provisions relating to formulation by the Minister and tabling, and will ensure that the Charters in the Schedules to the Acts will supersede those formulated by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The content, structure and wording of the Charter has been the subject of extensive consultation with consumer, industry and union groups and the final form of the Charter I believe reflects a consensus of the views of each group. These initiatives reflect the Government's commitment to `user rights' in aged care, and this Government's desire to ensure that older people retain the right to make decisions about their own lives regardless of their level of frailty. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains two further measures which also relate to Government initiatives regarding aged care. These measures seek to amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 in order to target Commonwealth funds more appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures form part of stage 6 of the Government's strategy of Aged Care Reform. Stage 6 includes a range of reforms to the hostels program, including expansion of dementia programs, proper geriatric assessment for people going into hostels and a review of the level of hostel recurrent funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The two further measures in this Bill are:</PARA>
<PARA>- the inclusion of the private sector in the Commonwealth's aged care hostel program; and</PARA>
<PARA>- the abolition, for non-financially disadvantaged, of the hostel care subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, let me address the issue of the participation of the private sector in the hostels program. </PARA>
<PARA>While private enterprise has been a major provider in the nursing home industry over many years, it has not been eligible to participate in the Commonwealth's program for hostels. The Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 has specifically excluded private-for-profit organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the provisions of this Bill, hostel recurrent funding will be available to approved private enterprise organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital funding will not be available to the private sector for hostels, as is the case with nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to receive recurrent funding, private enterprise organisations will be required to comply with the same requirements as religious and charitable organisations as provided for in the Act and described in the General Conditions. These include the admission of the same proportion of financially disadvantaged persons as would apply for a not-for-profit organisation in the same area, and compliance with the same respite care provisions, residents' rights, outcome standards and architectural standards. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the General Conditions will be amended to enable private sector organisations to draw some profit from their operations. </PARA>
<PARA>The places approved under this initiative will be subject to the Commonwealth's planning ratios. It will be a condition of approval for Commonwealth recurrent funding that all intending residents of those private sector hostels participating in the Commonwealth program, be assessed by a geriatric assessment team for their eligibility and need for hostel care. </PARA>
<PARA>A target of 1000 private enterprise places has been set for the current financial year and private organisations currently operating hostels will be eligible to apply. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, there is the abolition of the hostel care subsidy for the nonfinancially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>Payment of hostel care subsidy for those residents who are not financially disadvantaged will be abolished from 9 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, recurrent subsidies are paid to assist organisations to provide services to people requiring hostel accommodation and care. Current arrangements provide for the payment of a hostel care subsidy to all hostel residents assessed as eligible, irrespective of their capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>New funding arrangements were introduced in January 1989 which enable hostels to charge residents entry contributions and on-going fees according to their ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>Under these new arrangements hostels can receive higher fees from nonfinancially disadvantaged residents who are better placed to contribute to the costs of their care. </PARA>
<PARA>A range of protections are in place to ensure that all residents retain a set amount of their assets and level of disposable income. These measures are intended to ensure that individuals are protected from any form of financial exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA>Any resulting loss of funding for hostels can be recovered by the hostel from a combination of fee changes, subject to the controls in the general conditions, and the interest from increased entry contributions from new residents able to contribute more. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been increasing the differential between the hostel care subsidy and the personal care subsidy to encourage hostels to care for an increasing number of frail people. The abolition of the subsidy to those not financially disadvantaged will enable Commonwealth funds to be targeted to financially disadvantaged persons needing hostel care and on those needing a higher level of personal care. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the Government's Budget initiatives, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services announced a full-scale review of the level of recurrent funding for hostels. This review is already under way. </PARA>
<PARA>In February 1990, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services announced that new leave entitlements for nursing home residents would be introduced. This is a further initiative which forms part of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the previous arrangements, residents were only entitled to 28 days leave, which covered both hospital and social leave. These arrangements were a constant source of anxiety for nursing home residents and their families, who feared that if they required an extended stay in hospital, they would lose their place in the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA>The new arrangements will be retrospective from 1 March 1990 to allow the payment of Commonwealth nursing home benefits for residents taking hospital leave for an unlimited period as medically required, and for up to 28 days social leave each year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unlimited hospital leave is also to be introduced for hostel residents. Amendment to the general conditions for recurrent subsidies in hostels is currently in train. The intention is for unlimited hospital leave for hostel residents to be operational by early 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The two measures together will afford considerable financial protection for residents of nursing homes and hostels who have to undergo hospital treatment, but who wish to retain their bed in the nursing home or hostel. It will also ensure that residents feel secure in the long-term. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Budget the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services announced new residential respite care arrangements, to be in operation by 1 January 1991. These include allowing nursing home proprietors to charge a booking fee in respect of short term respite care admissions. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure is part of a package of measures to provide support for the carers of frail older people. Other measures in this package include:</PARA>
<PARA>- significant real increases in subsidies to nursing homes and hostels for caring for respite residents;</PARA>
<PARA>- changes to enable nursing homes to be approved for a number of respite bed days, instead of a fixed number of beds; and</PARA>
<PARA>- the development of a co-ordinated booking service for respite care residents through geriatric assessment services.</PARA>
<PARA>Previously, proprietors were not entitled to raise any fees associated with the admission of a patient to a nursing home for respite care purposes. Consequently, there was no compensation to the proprietor when a respite booking was not fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of booking fees for respite care residents in nursing homes is consistent with the current practice in hostels. </PARA>
<PARA>Nursing home proprietors will now be able to charge short term respite care residents a booking fee equivalent to 25 per cent of the on-going cost of the respite stay or one week's respite care fee, whichever is the lesser. The fee is then deducted from the on-going cost of the respite stay. </PARA>
<PARA>This should assist the industry and increase the availability of residential respite care services in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>A further proposed amendment in the Bill will allow the Minister to establish more than one Nursing Homes Fees Review Committee of Inquiry in a State at any one time. These Committees examine requests from nursing home proprietors for review of the scale of fees which has been determined for their nursing home by the Department of Community Services and Health. There are currently over 80 such outstanding requests for review throughout Australia and concurrent sittings by more than one Committee may be necessary in some States to avoid delays in the hearing of these requests. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act relating to Medicare are contained in Parts 3 and 4 of this Bill. The amendments in Part 3 relating to diagnostic services are designed to curb a number of unethical practices in the provision of these services, particularly radiology services, by generally restricting the payment of Medicare benefits to those services which have been provided at the request of a practitioner who has no direct financial interest in the ordering of those services. </PARA>
<PARA>In presenting to the Senate in November 1986 report 260 entitled ``Medical Fraud and Overservicing-Response to Pathology Fraud'', the then Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (Senator Georges) expressed the Committee's concern that the problems it had uncovered in the pathology area appeared to be developing in radiology. He noted that some entrepreneurs appeared to be moving to exploit radiology and indicated that the Committee was of the view that it was the joint responsibility of the medical profession and the Government to pre-empt these moves. </PARA>
<PARA>In expressing these views, the Committee was reinforcing concerns about entrepreneurial activity in the provision of radiology services previously expressed by the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists (RACR). The RACR had claimed that medical entrepreneurs were responsible for the emergence of self-referral radiology and other arrangements designed to encourage excessive services. </PARA>
<PARA>Professional and Government concerns about the rate of growth in the provision of diagnostic imaging services, and some of the reported arrangements surrounding their provision, led in 1987 to the then Minister for Health establishing a Departmental diagnostic imaging services review to examine ways of controlling the provision of these services. The services covered by this review included diagnostic radiology, CT scanning, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear scanning. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments in Part 3 of the Bill before the Senate today reflect the outcome of the review and the consultative process with relevant professional organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal features of the legislation are the introduction of a formal mechanism for the requesting of diagnostic imaging services, the specification of activities which are deemed to be prohibited diagnostic imaging practices, the consideration of suspected breaches of those prohibited practices by a Medicare Participation Review Committee, and the notification of suspected breaches of State and Territory radiation licensing laws to the relevant State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation introduces a number of control measures designed to effect an ``arms length'' referral arrangement in the provision of diagnostic imaging services. Some of these control measures are similar to those which have applied to pathology services for some time. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic principle underlying this legislation is the requirement that for a diagnostic imaging service to attract a Medicare benefit, the service should, except in a limited number of defined situations, be specifically requested by one practitioner from another coupled with the requirement that there be financial distance between the requesting and providing practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Services which have traditionally been seen as falling within the competence of general practitioners remain unaffected by the new arrangements. X-rays of the extremities, chest, abdomen and the shoulder will continue to attract benefits when performed on a practitioner's own patient. </PARA>
<PARA>In general then, a Medicare benefit will only be payable when, prior to commencing the investigations associated with the service, the providing practitioner has received a signed and dated written request from the referring practitioner who does not stand to gain financially from that referral. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of a formal referral arrangement requires that the legislation specify the practitioners who are entitled to request diagnostic imaging services. The legislation stipulates that these practitioners are doctors, dentists and chiropractors. Whereas there is no limit to the range of services which may be requested by doctors, dentists are to be restricted to X-rays of the head and chiropractors to X-rays of the spine. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemptions from the general referral arrangements will apply in certain circumstances. These include emergencies, lost requests, services rendered in remote areas, and services rendered by specialists which fall within their specialty. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is aware that in certain areas of Australia, particularly remote rural areas, reasonable access to doctors specialising in diagnostic imaging services is not possible. In addition, there is no choice of general practitioner. In these circumstances, even if a general practitioner owned suitable equipment and could interpret diagnostic images, it could be impossible for those services to be provided in response to a request from an independent practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation, therefore, provides for exemptions from the referral provisions to be granted to diagnostic imaging service practitioners who practice in areas designated as remote for the purposes of the legislation and who can demonstrate that their patients would suffer undue hardship if the exemption was not granted. Exemptions will apply only to referred services for which there are no corresponding non-referred items and will normally be given only when the practitioner can demonstrate that no other practitioner in the area is equipped or able to provide diagnostic imaging services; in addition, visiting diagnostic imaging services, if any, must not be able to adequately meet the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemptions will be effective for a period of three years with provision for renewal for further periods of three years. The exemption may be terminated if other adequate diagnostic imaging facilities become available in the area to enable the referral arrangements to operate without causing undue hardship to patients. However, the exempt practitioner has at least six months to demonstrate why the exemption should remain in force. The precise definition of ``remote area'' has yet to be determined in consultation with the relevant medical organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Practitioners suspected of breaching the legislation will firstly be advised of the concerns about their practice. If they do not respond, or if the concerns are not adequately explained, the legislation provides for the Minister to refer these matters to a Medicare Participation Review Committee acting as a committee of peers. These Committees, chaired by a legal practitioner of at least five years standing, will include four medical practitioners who must be experienced in the provision of diagnostic imaging services. </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare Participation Review Committees will be empowered to make determinations ranging in severity from no action being taken, to counselling or reprimanding the person, to not paying or recovering Medicare benefits for the services in question, to disqualifying the practitioner from all or some of the diagnostic imaging services he or she is qualified to perform. These determinations may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>A provision has also been included to recover Medicare benefits for services rendered contrary to relevant State or Territory legislation regarding radiation equipment licensing or registration, safety or quality standards for radiological equipment or the operation of radiological equipment. Any recovery of benefits is to be from the person found to have contravened such legislation, not from the patient. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation has the support of the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, the Australian Medical Association and, subject to the inclusion of a temporary `grandparent' exemption clause for general practitioners who are currently rendering services which are to be designated as referred items, by the Royal Australasian College of General Practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>The College of General Practitioners is keen to ensure adequate protection for those general practitioners who currently provide diagnostic imaging beyond the limited range of the proposed unreferred items and who might not qualify for the proposed area exemption. An amendment is contained in this Bill to incorporate such a provision. This would exempt, until 1 January 1993, certain radiology services provided by those general practitioners from the application of the referral requirements. Any exemption beyond that date will depend on the College of General Practitioners being able to develop an adequate accreditation and quality assurance program which has the support of other relevant medical organisations and which is able to establish the appropriateness of general practitioner radiology in terms of quality, efficiency, safety, and cost. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains amendments relating to the payment of Medicare benefits for pathology services. These amendments are designed to allow referral of cases of excessive pathology services to the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry and will give appeal rights to scientists and senior scientists whose classifications affect their employment in pathology laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, cases involving the initiation of excessive pathology services by providers are required by the Act to be referred to the Medicare Participation Review Committee (MPRC). However, this has been found to be an inappropriate and ineffective mechanism for dealing with such cases. All other cases of excessive servicing involving general (ie non-pathology) medical services are referred to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry (MSCI), and this is considered to be the appropriate body to consider pathology cases, at least in the initial stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Under current legislation, MPRC's determine whether a practitioner who has been convicted of a relevant offence or other pathology matters should continue to be allowed to participate in the Medicare arrangements. In this case, the MPRC process is the ultimate sanction against providers who may be in breach of the Medicare legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Experience in this area suggests that it would be more appropriate for all matters involving excessive servicing to be initially referred to MSCI's. The power of these Committees is limited to making recommendations to the Minister that, where a provider has been found to have rendered excessive services, the provider be reprimanded, counselled or be required to repay Medicare benefits incorrectly claimed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is necessary to retain the right to refer to an MPRC a pathologist who has been the subject of more than two Ministerial Determinations from an MSCI which would tend to indicate that the person was a recidivist offender. </PARA>
<PARA>The previous Minister gave an undertaking to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to give appeal rights to scientists and senior scientists who have been refused the appropriate classification (in relation to employment in a pathology laboratory) when the Minister considers an application for approval of premises as an accredited pathology laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA>To carry out this undertaking, it is necessary to provide definitions of scientist and senior scientist in the Act. A new section 23DNA is proposed setting out these definitions. Appeal rights, firstly to the Minister, then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are set out in an amendment to section 23DO of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also amends the definition of `medical practitioner' as defined in section 3 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 to exclude from the Medicare arrangements medical practitioners who have been de-registered or de-licensed following an enquiry by a State or Territory Medical Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Up to the present, some practitioners holding registration in more than one State-Territory, having been de-registered by a State-Territory Medical Registration Board following an inquiry, have been able to continue to practise in States other than the one in which the de-registration occurred, and to attract Medicare benefits for services so rendered. The Government believes that this is inappropriate, and in the absence of uniform registration procedures has moved to ensure that de-registration or de-licensed practitioners will no longer have access to the Medicare arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is designed to prevent services rendered by medical practitioners who have been de-registered or de-licensed from attracting Medicare benefits for professional services rendered anywhere in Australia for the period of the de-registration/de-licencing in that State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment imposes no obligation on the States. Where a medical practitioner although de-registered in one State continues to be registered in another, such practitioner would be able to practise (e.g. in a salaried position) in the State or Territory in which he or she has registration. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently section 3C of the Health Insurance Act enables the Minister for Community Services and Health to determine that a health service and its associated fee, which are not listed in the Medicare Benefits Schedule, shall be treated for the purpose of the health legislation as if that health service and fee were included in the Schedule. The new legislation does not alter the Minister's powers or responsibilities in this regard, but provides that, following a reference to it by the Minister, the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee may consider and make recommendations to the Minister as to the manner and extent treatment or treatments, and the relating fee or fees, should be determined by the Minister to be a specified health service for the purposes of section 3C. The expert advice of the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee will be of considerable benefit in this process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains an amendment to include the most relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 in the Health Insurance Act for the purposes of prosecutions under the Health Insurance Act. In the course of prosecutions it is often more appropriate to charge practitioners with offences under the Crimes Act 1914, however, as a number of offences under the Crimes Act are not specifically referred to in the definition of relevant offence some practitioners have avoided prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains further amendments to update the Health Insurance Act to take account of the implementation of the administrative review mechanisms established under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and rectifies a minor typographical mistake in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes amendments to the States Grants (Nurse Education Transfer Assistance) Act 1985. That Act currently provides for the Commonwealth to make financial assistance available to the States and Territories for students in diploma courses in higher education institutions leading to registration as a nurse. </PARA>
<PARA>It has now been decided that, in future, basic nurse education courses may be granted degree status where they meet the relevant criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed to the States Grants (Nurse Education Transfer Assistance) Act will extend Commonwealth financial assistance to the States and Territories to three years of these degree level courses for people who are not registered or eligible to be registered as a nurse. </PARA>
<PARA>Two amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 are proposed. The first clarifies that the sponsor of therapeutic goods is a person in Australia. The second amendment restricts aggregation of therapeutic devices with common characteristics to those which also have a common manufacturer. Aggregation is used primarily for grouping goods together for entry into the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I now present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION SERVICES (EXPORT REGULATION) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legislative basis to regulate the marketing and provision of education services to the overseas market through the registration of institutions and courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The export of education services by Australian institutions, particularly for full fee paying formal and non-formal courses, has expanded considerably during the past three years. Large numbers of new organisations have become involved in the provision of courses for overseas students. Some of these have failed leaving students stranded; a few have been downright dishonest bringing Australia's reputation into disrepute with the result that formal regulation has become necessary to protect the interests of both students and providers. </PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory governments are well aware of the problems that have arisen, particularly in the non-formal course area, and are fully behind the Government's moves to bring stability to ensure standards for the education exports industry. Support has also been received from the industry itself. This is well illustrated in the ready cooperation that we have received from both the States and the industry in the lead up to the formation of a national consultative body to provide a forum for discussion and information exchange on education export policy issues and to ensure coordination in the promotion of Australia's education and training services. Consultations are continuing with the various interested parties on its proposed composition and terms of reference and an announcement on the body's formation and operations can be expected shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> A formal register of institutions and courses known as the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Course for Overseas Students (CRICOS) will be established under this legislation. Students will only be granted a visa for travel to Australia for study purposes if they are accepted for registered courses in registered institutions. Besides having to be approved as a provider of courses for overseas students by the relevant State authority, institutions have to have satisfactory fiduciary arrangements for the advance payments made by intending students through specially established trust funds, the operation and maintenance of which are prescribed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A penalty of up to $10,000 may be imposed on any institution, body or person that undertakes or attempts to market education services for overseas students without registration under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of obligations and conditions that need to be met to maintain a position on the register. Penalties are provided also for non-compliance with those relating to financial arrangements, insurance to protect monies in the trust funds and the supply of returns and other information relating to recruitment, enrolment and provision of courses. They are not unnecessarily burdensome as similar returns are required of institutions as a result of membership of the peak industry groups such as ACPET and the ELICOS Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Providers and their courses may be suspended or their registration cancelled under certain circumstances as laid down in the Bill. Such action when taken by the Minister is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The regulation of and accountability for actions of some of the newer institutions has been a cause of concern for some time. While the duties of directors of companies are prescribed under the companies codes in each State and the behaviour of agents acting on behalf of institutions is addressed extensively by existing agency law, regulations may be made under this legislation to establish guidelines for the actions of directors and agents of institutions in marketing and recruiting, both in Australia and overseas, and in providing courses and support for their students. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Bill has no direct financial impact since it does not raise revenue or appropriate funds for expenditure, it will have an impact in that it will save potential administrative and legal costs of government action similar to that which has occurred over the past 12 months and has led to the introduction of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill 1990, currently before the Parliament, should this industry continue to be unregulated. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will ensure that Australia's reputation in the education export market is upheld, and that overseas students may be sure of the quality and integrity of the courses being offered to them. Further, it will protect the future of a valuable growing export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill contains amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Defence Service Homes Act 1918, the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 4) 1989 and the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would amend Veterans' Affairs legislation to implement election promises, announced by the Prime Minister in March 1990, to provide for the automatic grant of pension and benefits to widows and dependants of veterans receiving extreme disablement adjustment and extend the operation of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. It would also give effect to Budget decisions and make a range of other amendments to improve administration and benefits to veterans. The Bill would also provide additional Repatriation and Defence Service Homes benefits to certain Australian Defence Force personnel deployed for operational service in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in providing these Repatriation benefits, the Government recognises that Australian Defence Force personnel deployed for operational service in the Middle East face a very real danger as a result of that service. The Government has decided, therefore, that all Australian Defence Force personnel allotted for operational service in the Middle East, including those deployed with United States or United Kingdom units, would be regarded as being on operational service once they reach the operational area. Until such time as they reach the operational area, they would be regarded as being on hazardous service. This would ensure that they receive the benefit of the more generous standard of proof in determining eligibility for compensation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA>With the introduction of these amendments they will have access to disability pensions on the same generous standard of proof basis as war veterans. They will qualify for service pension and thus have entitlement to the equivalent of the age pension benefits five years earlier as do war veterans. They will be eligible for Repatriation medical treatment and associated benefits on the same basis as war veterans. Those service personnel who enlisted in the Australian Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985, will have access to subsidised low interest housing loans, insurance and other housing benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act. Those who enlisted after that date will be entitled to housing ownership assistance under the Australian Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme to be implemented early in 1991. Finally, in the event of a member's service resulting in severe or fatal injury or disease, cover under the Act will also be available to that member's dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President I turn now to another provision of the Bill which relates to arrangements for allotting personnel for service in an operational area. The special benefits under the Act available to persons who serve on operational service are in recognition of the special dangers associated with operational service. </PARA>
<PARA>Until recently, the allotment provisions have not caused any difficulties because the term has always been regarded as having a special meaning. This is no longer the case. In the recent cases of Doessel and Davis, the Federal Court construed the phrase `allotted for duty' as being equivalent to `posted for duty'. On this interpretation, a person who served in an operational area, but who was not specifically allotted for `operational service' for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, would qualify as having had operational service, even though that service was not at a time when it involved increased danger. </PARA>
<PARA>To restore the intended purpose of `allotted for duty', this Bill would give a special meaning to references in the Act to that term. In addition, the amendments would confirm that allotment may be in accordance with retrospective arrangements most often necessarily followed by the Department of Defence. The changes would also provide that allotment would be by written instrument, that it can be retrospective or otherwise and that such instruments will be issued by the Defence Force for use by the Repatriation Commission in determining a person's eligibility for entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA>A further provision would be made to take account of new arrangements instituted by the Department of Defence to allot-by written instrument signed by the Vice Chief of the Defence Force-units and individuals for operational service in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>Savings provisions are included in the Bill so as not to disadvantage anyone in respect of whom a determination to grant eligibility has already been made, or anyone who has lodged a claim or application on or before 8 November 1990 and which has not been decided. This Bill would also give effect to the payment of the pharmaceutical allowance from 20 March 1991. This special allowance is to offset the cost of the charges for prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These measures would ensure that no pensioners would be disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of these new charges. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, to retain consistency with the Department of Social Security in the administration of the income and assets test, this Bill would introduce similar amendments to those proposed by the Department of Social Security to deem a minimum rate of interest of 10 per cent on all cash and deposits held by pensioners in excess of $2,000 in assessing the rate of pension payable. This Bill would provide for the rate of deemed interest to be periodically reviewed. Specific provision is made in the Bill to ensure that pensioners who are eligible for health benefits cards on 28 February 1991, will not lose them as a result of the operation of the deeming provisions. The deeming provisions would apply from 1 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also proposes changes to a range of other benefits to achieve more efficient administration and a more equitable distribution of benefits to veterans and dependants. These include:</PARA>
<PARA>the removal of the three-year minimum service requirement for `hazardous service', which entitles veterans to the more generous standard of proof in deciding claims;</PARA>
<PARA>an increase in the Rent Assistance threshold by $10 a fortnight to $50 a fortnight from March 1991 for both single pensioners and pensioner couples to ensure that the level of rent assistance more realistically reflects the current level of housing costs;</PARA>
<PARA>an extension of the boundaries for payment of the Remote Area allowance; and</PARA>
<PARA>an increase in the rates, and automatic indexation of, a range of benefits and allowances for severely disabled veterans including allowances for specific injuries and disabilities, Recreation Transport Allowance and Clothing Allowance. The rates of these allowances will be increased from 20 September 1990 and will, in future, be increased automatically in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President I now turn to those provisions of the Bill which would give effect to a number of undertakings by the Government to improve entitlements of veterans and dependants. The first of these relates to the automatic granting of war widow's pension to the widows of veterans who were in receipt of, or were entitled to receive, extreme disablement adjustment at the time of their death. The widows and dependants of these veterans would be entitled to the same benefits as the widows of special rate pensioners. These changes will be backdated to 22 December 1988, being the date extreme disablement allowance was introduced and will provide for similar benefits to all severely disabled veterans and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, one of the most extensive changes for veterans and dependants, in terms of responding to the changing needs of an ageing veteran population, is the proposal to extend the purposes for which loans may be made under the Defence Service Homes Act. This extension will make it possible to provide assistance for persons seeking accommodation in retirement villages in which they will have a permanent right of residence. This change represents a significant step towards meeting the housing needs of older veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would also provide increased flexibility for the 140,000 holders of Defence Service Homes loans outstanding at 9 December 1987, by allowing these borrowers to transfer their loans from one home to another. This initiative replaces existing limited arrangements for transfers of loans. An associated amendment also brings to an end the possibility of eligible persons losing their benefits through the transfer of a loan to an ineligible person. As the Defence Service Homes initiatives represent an extension of the lending business sold to Westpac in November 1988, the bank has agreed to purchase the rights to the new lending business. The supplementary agreement with Westpac forms Schedule 1 to this Bill. It is expected that the new arrangements will assist up to 3,000 persons. This will result in Westpac paying to the Commonwealth each year more than one million dollars in fees. </PARA>
<PARA>The extension of the automatic grant of war widows' pension to veterans receiving extreme disablement adjustment will cost an estimated $0.11m in 1990-91 and $0.24m in 1991-92. The provisions to deem income on cash and deposits and the changes to the rent assistance threshold are expected to result in savings of $3.516m in 1990-91 and $15.331m in 1991-92. The proposal to allow portability for Defence Service Homes loans is expected to result in net costs of $0.131m in 1990-91 and $2.015m in 1991-92. I call on all Senators present to support passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 would amend social security legislation to implement some of the measures announced in the Treasurer's February Statement and in the 1990 Budget. It would also provide for increased effectiveness of administration of the social security programs through the introduction of several minor and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The last social security amendment Bill foreshadowed provisions of this Bill. In particular, it said that from 1 January 1991 we would require the provision of tax file numbers as a precondition for payment of most social security payments. This Bill introduces that requirement for remaining pensions, benefits and allowances and is part of a package involving data matching of client records between the Australian Taxation Office and the Departments of Social Security, Veterans' Affairs and Employment, Education and Training. The Department of Community Services and Health will also be involved in this data matching but only in relation to payments made under the First Home Owners Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>This will help in the detection of incorrect payments, for example where a client has provided inconsistent information as to their family composition or employment history in order to obtain two or more mutually exclusive welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Another major new provision to be introduced in this Bill is the introduction of a liquid assets test for unemployment and sickness benefit recipients. Currently, these benefits are available subject to the usual income and assets tests. The result can be that people who have relatively large amounts of liquid assets can nevertheless gain access to payments of benefit after only one week. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who have more than $5000 in cash or on deposit with financial institutions will have to wait an extra 4 weeks before they can qualify for unemployment or sickness benefit. This measure addresses the concern that highly paid temporary workers can be paid benefits during periods of non-employment. The four week waiting period will be in addition to the normal one week waiting period for benefit and in addition to any statutorily imposed periods of non-payment. Those periods of deferment which apply for education leavers and people who have left employment with unused annual leave entitlements will run concurrently with the four week waiting period. </PARA>
<PARA>Only liquid assets will be taken into account. Liquid assets include amounts in financial institutions, be they term deposits or deposits available on demand. Cash-on-hand will also be included. However, superannuation rollovers, to which access is limited, will be exempt. The liquid assets of a spouse will be treated as if held by a beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also introduces new provisions relating to the recovery of overpayments. The Bill would clarify that payments in excess of entitlement would be classed as overpayments only where the person knew or could reasonably have known that the payment was incorrect, where the excess payment involved a lack of qualification for the payments, where the person has received more than the maximum rate of that type of payment or where an overpayment stems from a person's misrepresentation or failure to notify of a change in his or her circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would also amend provisions of the Social Security Act which protect the privacy of clients. It would make it clear that the Department is to protect a client's personal information even after a client has died. In addition, it will be an offence for a person to obtain such information by making a false representation. This is to deter people from misleading Departmental officers by claiming, untruthfully, that they have a person's authority for access to information about that person. These new measures reflect the Government's commitment to boosting the protection of the privacy of Departmental clients. </PARA>
<PARA>I would now like to outline the changes to family payments which would be introduced by this Bill. There are several measures designed to target the family payments more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, entitlement to Family Allowance Supplement is subject to both an income test and an assets test but recipients of Family Allowance are subject only to an income test. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of an assets test for Family Allowance will make it consistent with other Commonwealth income support programs including Family Allowance Supplement, AUSTUDY and most pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The family allowance assets test threshold will be set at $500,000. In addition, the 25 per cent taper on reduction in the rate payable of family allowance payable under the family allowance income test will be abolished. This will mean that once the person's income gets above the limit for payment of full family allowance no family allowance will be payable. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently family allowance is paid without an income test to recipients of Child Disability Allowance and Double Orphan's Pension. The assets test will not apply in those cases. </PARA>
<PARA>One beneficial new provision of this Bill widens the application of the payment of assistance for isolated children. The assistance for isolated children payment is not income tested and is currently paid at a rate of $989 per annum and recognises the costs of isolated families obtaining education for their children. </PARA>
<PARA>Families with students under 16 have been able to receive both that payment and family allowance but those with children aged 16 or more have not. This barrier has meant that some families may have been disadvantaged in providing educational opportunities for their children. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Minister for Social Security, Senator Graham Richardson, introduced the Social Security and Veteran's Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) for 1990, he spoke about a group of measures designed to limit avoidance of the income and assets tests by deeming income from loans and deprived assets. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistent with those measures, from 1 March 1991 this Bill introduces a further initiative which deems, for the purposes of the pension and benefit income tests, a minimum interest rate on cash-on-hand and money deposited in a bank, building society or credit union for the purposes of pension and benefit income tests. No rate would be deemed on the first $2000 in cash or deposits. Such amounts would continue to be assessed at the actual rate of return. For amounts over $2000, the deemed rate of interest would be the higher of the actual rate or 10 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>This initiative will not apply to the income test for health benefit cards and associated fringe benefits for those people who were eligible for the cards on 28 March 1991. The new provision will affect the fringe benefit entitlements of anyone who applies for a health care card after 1 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent major disasters in Australia have called for a re-examination of our capacity to respond quickly and sympathetically to the needs of people who suffer loss of income and property from such terrible events. The Newcastle earthquake and the Nyngan and Charleville floods showed that the existing provision for disaster relief payments was unduly cumbersome. It required applicants for assistance to provide details of assets and income that are not usually obtainable in the circumstances. No additional social security assistance has hitherto been available for existing pensioners and beneficiaries who were caught up in a major disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say that this Bill provides for a new Disaster Relief Payment. It will be payable to a person who has suffered an interruption to his or her normal source of livelihood and to people whose home or place of employment has been significantly damaged in a major disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>Where a person is receiving pension or benefit the Disaster Relief Payment will be paid as a supplement equivalent to 2 weeks of maximum rate pension. Where the person is not currently receiving a pension or benefit, he or she will receive a single payment of the same amount. </PARA>
<PARA>As is demonstrated by the Government's announced disability reforms, the foreshadowed changes to the focus of the unemployment benefit system and the upcoming restructuring of sickness benefit, this Government is committed to encouraging the return to the workforce of pensioners and beneficiaries and reducing long-term dependence on income support. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of this overall strategy, an employment entry payment of $100 for long term unemployment beneficiaries and Job Search Allowance recipients was introduced in February 1989 under the NEWSTART program. This payment is designed to help such people meet the costs of entering employment, such as clothing, tools or equipment, transport to work and union fees. </PARA>
<PARA>Sole parent pensioners joining the workforce have to meet those same initial costs and it has been decided to introduce an Employment Entry Payment for this group of pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also provides for the extension of the area within which a Remote Area Allowance will be paid to social security pensioners and beneficiaries. This extension is allied with a new provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which sets the boundaries of such areas for the purpose of allowing a zone rebate to people who live in remote areas. In the interests of consistency and logic, social security and tax laws use the same delineated areas to establish eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner for Taxation can apply his discretion to nominate an area just outside a special area as being inside that area, as a widely scattered community may fall on either side of arbitrary boundaries. It has been decided that where the Commissioner has exercised this discretion, the area included shall also be considered for social security purposes to lie inside that boundary. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt that Chinese nationals who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre are in a very difficult position regarding their plans to return to China. Given their special circumstances, the Government has decided to introduce special arrangements to provide income support for them although they would not normally satisfy the residence requirements for Australian benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will allow access to special benefit, family allowance and family allowance supplement to Chinese nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 and who have a Class 4 Temporary Entry Permit. This measure will be taken to have come into effect on 1 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to announce some changes to carer's pension which will remove some unnecessarily restrictive criteria for qualification for carer's pensions. Carer's pensions are paid to people who care for a severely handicapped person on a full-time basis and thus are unable to enter the workforce because of their responsibilities. It has been required that the carer live in the same house as the cared-for person and that the person being cared for be an age or invalid pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA>New provisions in this Bill will allow people who are living in adjacent accommodation and who are caring for people in receipt of any appropriate pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs to be eligible for a carer's pension. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1990 provided for compensation for pharmaceutical charges from after 19 March 1991 to be included in the rate of pension, benefit or allowance from the indexation payday in March 1991. Provisions in this Bill will ensure that the compensation will be paid as a separate pharmaceutical allowance from after 19 March 1991 rather than included in the rate of pension, benefit or allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Act provides for agreements between Australia and foreign countries relating to reciprocity in social security matters. Such agreements are incorporated into the Act as schedules to bring the Agreements into force so that they may modify the Act as appropriate. Agreements were signed with the United Kingdom and Malta on 1 October 1990 and 15 August 1990 respectively and those agreements are inserted in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The remaining provisions in this Bill are designed to increase the efficiency of delivery of social security entitlements and the equity of access to benefits for various groups of people. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, the rent assistance threshold is not indexed so adjustments are necessary from time to time to ensure that eligibility remains focused on those paying high rents. Accordingly, this Bill would increase the prescribed rent assistance threshold by $5. This move has been deliberately timed to coincide with an indexation increase for pensions and benefits to ensure that most recipients will not experience a decline in income. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his assurances in that regard. I turn to the issue relating to the new facilities at the Darwin and Alice Springs airport terminals. I have received a number of answers to questions on notice relating to the construction timetable and to the subsequent leasing arrangements for commercial operations and franchises within the terminals and in the general aviation apron areas. Can I receive an assurance that the original timetables proposed by the Federal Airports Corporation are not in any way being compromised either by construction delays or by the financial problems, particularly with regard to the Darwin contractor, John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd, which has received considerable media attention in the last month or so? I gather that the group's holding company is experiencing considerable financial problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government have this matter under close attention to ensure that all of the original commitments to timetables will be fulfilled? The second part of my question is with regard to the leasing of commercial facilities in both terminals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of Senator Tambling's question is yes. Negotiations are well advanced in respect of the commercial arrangements to be made at both of these terminals. I am pleased to see-and of course Senator Tambling himself will have noted this at both Alice Springs and Darwin-the significantly advanced construction at both terminal facilities. The facility at Alice Springs is now visible. Of course, a great deal of work has been going on over some months in respect of footings, slab work and so on, but the Alice Springs terminal building has now reared its head. As Senator Tambling would be well aware, the Darwin terminal is proceeding apace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The value of these facilities to the Northern Territory could not be overstated-it would be impossible to overstate their importance. They are proceeding, I am pleased to say, precisely on track. In an earlier debate in this House Senator Tambling said that they are something of pet projects of mine. I plead guilty to that charge-they are, because they are extremely important facilities. The timetabled date for the completion of construction at Darwin is October next year. At this stage there is no reason at all to believe that that will not be adhered to. The reality is that the project is currently running some months ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course any number of problems can occur, with the wet season still to establish itself in Darwin, between now and October next year. Whilst I am not in a position to give any guarantees that it will be completed prior to October, at this point in time it is certainly running months ahead of the scheduled completion date and there is no reason at all to believe that it will not be completed by October next year, with the Alice Springs terminal due to be completed by August next year. I was recently in Alice Springs and I had a look at the project. I know that the airlines are getting ready to actually fit out the building in Alice Springs in the early part of next year. So things are certainly well advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd, Senator Tambling was in fact overseas on parliamentary business during the entire period of the Northern Territory election campaign. I am not suggesting that the reason for his Party's very good result was that he was not there, but this matter did become an issue during the campaign and I would not reasonably expect Senator Tambling to be aware of it. I am grateful for the responsible way in which Senator Tambling has raised this matter during the committee stage of the consideration of Estimates, rather than the totally irresponsible way in which it was raised-frankly, to my astonishment-by the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works, Fred Finch. In Mr Finch's case, I can only put it down to a temporary bout of enthusiasm because there was an election campaign on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly true that arrangements or discussions are going on concerning John Holland's holding company. As Senator Tambling would be well aware, the construction side of John Holland is very healthy indeed, turning in a profit of some $21m last year. One could only be impressed, and I am sure that Senator Tambling is, by the quality and speed of the work it is currently carrying out. It is in a very healthy position indeed. Although I am not privy to the discussions-but naturally enough I am following these developments very closely-any likely takeover of the holding company of John Holland, which Senator Tambling has raised, is likely to result in a stronger corporate structure for the company rather than a weaker one. But certainly nothing is happening that would indicate that there is the slightest difficulty for the Darwin Airport construction project. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the benchmarks, and a very handy test indeed of whether these things are viable and running well, is whether the suppliers, contractors, workers and everyone else are being paid on time. It is a regrettable feature of life around Australia-for as long as I have been in public life and certainly in the Northern Territory-that it seems inevitable that from time to time when major public works are committed, whether they be in the defence area, the roads area or any other area, companies go into liquidation during the life of the project. That of course is a problem that has beset the Northern Territory Government on many occasions, particularly with regard to its roads contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I am responding to the matter which Senator Tambling has raised about the John Holland situation is that I was both disappointed and angered when I returned to the Northern Territory in the last week of the campaign to be told by prominent Darwin journalists-people I have known for a decade or more-that there was a major problem with the Darwin Airport. In fact, the first question I was asked by a journalist, on camera, when I arrived in Darwin was: how soon will the Darwin Airport project fold? That bowled me over. I was very angry when I found out that these stories had emanated directly from the office of the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works. I could not believe it. But when one is told by not just one journalist but by six that stories were being peddled in the middle of an election campaign-not just by the Minister's staff, as they were, but in two cases by the Minister himself-that John Holland was about to go belly up and the Darwin Airport project was in jeopardy, one gets a little angry. </PARA>
<PARA> The information was very detailed. For example, it was said that contractors and workers were not being paid and it was asserted that the concrete pour at the airport had stopped. This was of no small moment, as one can imagine. In view of the current uncertain situation in the business community this was no small matter, as I am sure Senator Tambling will find out if he talks to some of the people close to that project, because it caused major difficulties. People were ringing up and saying, `Are we going to get paid? Will we continue to supply the project or not?'. It does the Minister no credit that all of these stories emanated from his office when, I would have thought, he would have been most keen to see this project completed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, Senator Tambling could not be reasonably expected to know about that because he was away when it happened. I am pleased to say that the matter was put to rest in the space of 48 hours by the simple act of taking every journalist who was willing to come-fortunately many were-out to the project and showing them visible evidence of the progress being made. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I am pleased to say that I can give Senator Tambling assurances that the timetables are being complied with. As I say, in the case of Darwin they are currently being exceeded. There is no reason at all to suggest that both of what will be very fine facilities-as is obvious from the work that has been done already-will not be up and running by the due date. So far as John Holland is concerned, we are-I think responsibly-interested in and keeping a close eye on the corporate arrangements that may be made with John Holland. But I have no reason to believe that the very successful John Holland construction arm is in any danger at all of not completing the project successfully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Minister, I have also considered Darwin airport to be a pet project. I was Federal member for the Northern Territory in 1982 when Prime Minister Fraser gave the original commitment to that, which has subsequently taken Mr Hawke six or seven years to honour. However, I turn to the issue relating to the provision of additional services to Yulara, particularly by Australian Airlines Ltd. I received in answer to a question on notice advice that negotiations between the Civil Aviation Authority and Australian Airlines were progressing. Of course, the provision of additional carriers into Yulara is most important for the expansion of tourism and the economic health of that region. I note that in the detailed answer it was stated that there was not at that point-whenever the answer was provided-any commitment to a date for the start of operations by Australian Airlines. In light of the fact that the proposal for four services per week to Yulara is an important industry adjunct, I should like to ascertain when the Government now believes that this additional and very desirable service would in fact commence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to tell Senator Tambling and the Committee that things have progressed since that advice was given to him. Australian Airlines Ltd will in fact be commencing four scheduled services a week to Yulara from Sunday, 2 March 1991. It is probably appropriate at this stage to point out that in terms of flights originating in the Northern Territory to Yulara-that is, licensed intrastate flights to Yulara-that matter is governed and controlled by agreements with the Northern Territory Government that give exclusivity of that service to Ansett Airlines of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, no-one in the Northern Territory close to the tourist industry has forgotten, nor is likely to forget for some time, that despite being given a monopoly on the intrastate licensed flights from Alice Springs to Ayers Rock during the pilots dispute Ansett did not fly a single service into Yulara for virtually the entire dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I point that out is that I was not very happy at the time-I make no bones about saying it-that that exclusive deal was struck. It was a deal that was put together by the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham, with Ansett. It was at a time when the interests that operate Ansett were expressing interest in additional development in the Northern Territory, perhaps connected, for example, with hotel or casino development. It was at a time when the Northern Territory Government established Rupert Murdoch as Chancellor of the University of the Northern Territory. It was as a result of some observations I made about that particular matter at the time that Northern Territory people-I think I discussed the matter with Dr James Eedle-changed the name of the university from the University of the Northern Territory to the Northern Territory University, after Rupert Murdoch's appointment as Chancellor. But it was at that time and in that context that this deal was struck. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I raise it, and I am sure Senator Tambling would support this, is that the Federal Government has now deregulated interstate traffic, and we have now had-and I join Senator Tambling in welcoming it-a very welcome indication of an early benefit for the Territory from the deregulated industry with this announcement by Australian. As Senator Tambling would be aware, this has been coupled with an announcement by Australian of a very beneficial discount package for flights to the Territory, involving a free return flight from Alice Springs to Darwin and, I think, four nights free accommodation in Darwin as well, for $800 plus. I was not expecting to see such early evidence of direct benefit to the Territory from deregulation, and I must say I am very pleasantly surprised that that has happened and I hope that it continues. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is important for the Northern Territory Government to have a close look at the agreement that it has with Ansett, which is not, I think, due to expire until 1993, to ensure that it does not stand in the way of improved business for Yulara if there are airlines ready and willing to provide those intrastate licensed services to Yulara. </PARA>
<PARA> I have stated on the public record before that I see no reason why the Northern Territory Government, having struck the deal with Ansett, should want precipitously to tear it up or even attempt to do that when there is no valid reason for doing so. But I would certainly hope that if an interest is expressed in providing additional air services to Yulara-a substantial interest which is not simply a gleam in the eye of a new operator-the Northern Territory Government would give serious consideration to opening up discussions with Ansett to ensure that that exclusivity which has been hitherto provided on that route is addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to a couple of issues relating to communications and draw the attention of the Minister to the answer that was previously given to me with regard to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the provision of children's educational radio and television services. There was a comprehensive answer given to the formal question on notice. What concerns me considerably about this matter is the extent to which these programs are being slashed. Radio National's certainly expensive programs are obviously feeling the pinch of the Government's constraints on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I presume that many senators, including Senator Collins, will have received considerable representation from school children, from schools, and will have noticed the wide national media coverage that has been attracted by the change in these programs, particularly many of the children's radio programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What concerns me is that, with regard to the flow-on to children's television educational programs, tucked away in the final part of the detailed answer given to me is the information that in effect in 1991 the service will be reduced to between one and two hours per day for 30 to 40 weeks per year and in 1992 there will be no school services. In effect, school television programs on the ABC will be taken off the air in 1992 as a result of these constraints. I ask what action the Government and the Minister are taking with regard to the provision of these important educational facilities that reach many children throughout Australia and the extent to which both radio and television programs are being affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, noted today the final sentence in that final paragraph of the response from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to Senator Tambling's question. I was aware of the previous detail that had been provided to Senator Tambling but I have no hesitation in saying to him that I was not aware of the information contained in that final sentence until I read it. I can say to Senator Tambling that I will be discussing that particular matter with the ABC because I was not aware that it was proposing to discontinue these services completely in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also make the point that I have made in the House before, that is, the ABC is a public broadcaster; it is fully funded by Government. I, like a lot of Australians, particularly of my generation, am an unblushing fan of Aunty and always have been. I have a very strong personal commitment, having been brought up on The Goons Show, Round the Horne, classical music and all the other things that the ABC has done such a marvellous job of providing in terms of quality programming for a very long time. I am totally committed to the continuation of the ABC as a quality broadcaster, but it must work within a budget and that budget is not limitless. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government provided an increase in funding for the ABC. While it was certainly not of major proportions, it was an increase and the ABC has an obligation to work within its budget because the amount of money provided is not limitless. I have noticed that governments, irrespective of their political colouring, have a habit of sounding very much like governments while Oppositions-and I have been on both sides of the fence-have a habit, regardless of their political colouration, of sounding like Oppositions. I make that observation to point out that the Opposition has an entrenched position of criticism of the Government in not adopting a far stringent-not mildly more stringent-fiscal policy than it currently has. In fact, the Opposition wants additional billions cut off public expenditure but at the same time it continues to raise in the Parliament criticisms of the Government for attempting to restrain government spending wherever possible. I would simply point out that the ABC--</PARA>

I notice that in one answer to a question on notice this is extended to apply also to Cairns and Townsville. I am sure Senator Macdonald will share my concerns. It is important that these sorts of facilities come to northern Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned about the timetable. Recently, the now Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party Opposition in the Northern Territory Parliament, John Bailey MLA, dangled a carrot during the election campaign when he said that it was possible that SBS television could be seen in Darwin within the next 12 months if the Labor Party were to come to government there. However, the answer provided to me by the Minister for the Estimates Committee was that SBS was scheduled to begin telecasting in Darwin in 1993. There is an inconsistency between the statements made by Mr Bailey in the Northern Territory and those of Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's answer to the question on notice is also qualified in that he said 1993 is dependent on the successful launch and deployment of the second generation of Aussat satellites. In the corporate plan recently released by SBS, I could find no reference to the timetabling of the provision of these services. Therefore, I am at a loss to understand the consistency between the statements made by Mr Bailey, Senator Collins and SBS in its corporate plan. I seek more information. </PARA>

The information with which Senator Tambling has been provided in respect of the Aussat second generation satellites and the start-up date for the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) in 1993 is correct because that is the appropriate way to commence the permanent service of SBS there. I have a close interest in this matter; as Senator Tambling knows, I have been urging the Federal Government for some significant time to provide money ahead of time, naturally enough to provide for the earliest possible telecasting of the SBS services in the Northern Territory. Once again I must confess I belong to that small-relatively speaking-group of Australians who are big fans of SBS. That is so, despite the fact that SBS seem to have a preoccupation with running programs in which people take off their clothes.

<PARA> John Bailey was talking about proposals to advance the establishment of SBS in the Northern Territory by means other than the conventional desire to have SBS provided, as it will be, permanently by Aussat. I have been engaged in a similar exercise. SBS has been telecast in the Northern Territory; a series of trials was conducted in the early hours of the morning for some time a few years ago to trial SBS programs in the Northern Territory. We looked at all kinds of proposals to use transmission facilities over at the Cox Peninsula, with a landline facility being used rather than Aussat facilities. </PARA>

As such, I make no bones about saying that I will continue-as no doubt will Senator Tambling and as did John Bailey-to explore all available means, by whatever innovative means possible, to try to advance the start-up date for SBS in the Northern Territory, if we possibly can. The information provided to Senator Tambling about the official start-up date is correct. </PARA>

<PARA> My next point relates to Imparja television, which operates from Alice Springs. In the last financial year, Imparja received a $2m per annum specific purpose grant which was relayed to it by the Commonwealth Government through the Northern Territory Government under the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Act; in addition, the Commonwealth provided a payment of $2m to Aussat, which was announced during the last Federal election campaign. Given the fact that Imparja television is in considerable debt to Aussat with regard to its further obligations, and that Imparja is now seen as a very important part of the communications network of outback Australia-not only in the Northern Territory; its footprints also reach extensively into New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and parts of Western Australia-I think it is important to clarify the future subsidy arrangements and commitments of government to Imparja television. The capital involvement by the Government in Imparja over the past five years-and I have to give a ballpark figure on this-is somewhere between $10m and $20m, if one takes into account all the grants given by the Bicentennial Authority and the various government departments in its initial establishment and set-up. The Government chose to implement Imparja as, in effect, a quasi government-sponsored organisation, as opposed to allowing the commercial sector to develop in central Australia. It is important to clarify what the ongoing commitment of the Government to Imparja will be. How will the currently outstanding debt to Aussat be dealt with? I understand it is currently in the order of $4m or $5m and obviously the debt will continue to compound unless the debt receives specific attention by the Government. </PARA>

As Senator Tambling said, the channel does provide an extremely valuable and very welcome service to people in the remote regions of the Northern Territory and other States. The matter is certainly under close scrutiny by the Government. The Government will develop a final position on what is to happen to the future funding of Imparja as part of its examination of all these broadcasting related issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettably, the situation is complicated for Imparja, as Senator Tambling has said, by the fact that the $2m that is provided to Imparja through the Northern Territory Government is Commonwealth money. It is simply handed on and there is a lack of any financial support for Imparja Television from the South Australian and Northern Territory governments, whose citizens must directly benefit from it. The governments of Queensland and Western Australia do in fact provide direct financial assistance to the remote television services that operate in those States. The matter is currently under review and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I can advise Senator Tambling that the Federal Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is actively pursuing, in continuing discussions with the Northern Territory and South Australian governments, the failure of those governments to provide any assistance at all to Imparja.

I have read the results-I have not got the document with me-of the negotiations the Minister had with different airport owners. The Minister may remember I asked him a question during Estimates as to how he was going to deal with the various airports. He said that he was going to deal with them on a one by one basis. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether he has dealt with Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have viewed some of those places that received a subsidy under the social requirements which pertain to the ALOP. I know that my local airport has finished up with 25 per cent, and I am not actually complaining about that. I looked at Mullewa-if the Minister knows that place, it is 110 kilometres directly east of Geraldton and it is almost into pastoral country-and it received no help on social needs. I see that Balgo Hills received 100 per cent help. Of course, it would need 100 per cent, because no-one wants to go there, unless one happens to be involved with the place. Balgo Hills has 100 per cent help, and Southern Cross has got 25 per cent, for which I think even our shire is thankful. </PARA>
<PARA> Mullewa, which is a disadvantaged area in many ways-for example, from the point of view of its weather-also has an expanding Aboriginal community. It is 100 or 110 kilometres away from Geraldton and is the first point of call as one comes in from the pastoral and mining areas to the east and north-east of that area. I wonder whether the Minister has any explanation I could give the people of Mullewa for why there is a nil figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct some questions to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) in respect of a reservation made by Senator Tambling under program element 4.1, Road and Rail Policy Development, in respect of review of road transport charges. What assessment has been done of the impact on regional Australia of the implementation of the Inter-State Commission proposals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said at Question Time today, that matter is not yet resolved. I think Senator O'Chee was present during Question Time. The matter cannot be usefully examined at the moment in order to get any reliable analysis of the impact that it might have, for the simple reason that a final determination as to the level of charges and the way they will apply has not yet been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at Question Time today, as a result of the decisions that were made at the last Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) meeting in Hobart, there is ongoing consultation and discussion about the matter with the State governments which have expressed reservations about it. Those discussions are currently under way. It would be more appropriate to determine at the conclusion, or toward the conclusion, of that period of discussions what is likely to come out at the end of the line. </PARA>
<PARA> There are clear problems. Could I just explain to Senator O'Chee that there is, as I have discovered, widespread misunderstanding-not surprisingly, because of the complexity of the proposals-even among members of this Parliament, who of course constitute the most informed group of people in this country. It is astonishing to find that this sort of confusion exists here, but it does, in terms of the actual detail of the ISC's proposals, as they are of beneficial effect to some users and not others. I raise that because, on analysis of recent representations that were made to me on the subject, it was discovered that, with the mix of trucks that was coming into this particular area of Australia, the overall result would have been that the majority of operators in this particular region would have been better off under the ISC proposals-in terms of charging-than they currently are. There are clear and defined problems associated with the larger operators, particularly those that operate small fleets. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own area of the Northern Territory, the commonplace sight of road trains with three dogs behind is one that one does not see in too many other parts of Australia, and they do have a particular problem. For all of those reasons, Minister Brown has given a commitment that all of these matters are going to be subject to further consultation and discussion. This is consistent with the adoption and the support of the overall principle of providing some kind of national scheme to avoid, as I said again at Question Time today, the current difficulty of having State governments which are responsible enough to try to impose on trucks charges that bear some relationship to the actual damage done-in terms of maintaining the roads-fall flat on their faces in being responsible while business simply moves to another State where the charges are less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) to a statement that he made on radio 8DN on Thursday, 19 July, in which he said that he was confident the special needs of remote areas of the Territory, Western Australia and Queensland will be acknowledged by the Federal Government in its national review of road transport charges. I believe there is a slight contradiction in the answer that the Minister has just given because he has said that at the moment it is not possible to make any detailed comment on the assessment of the impact of the increased charges on regional Australia because it was not clear what the charges would be. He went on to say that the matter was being discussed. Either there is some sort of analysis going on that the Minister is not clear on or, I assume, the intention must be to select a range of charges and then discuss the impact. Is that the case?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no confusion in my mind; it is simply in the mind of Senator O'Chee. I am simply ascribing normal English meaning to the words that are used. I recall the statement that I made. I assure Senator O'Chee that, if the matter had been determined and if the analysis had been done, I would not have said on that program that I was confident that the problems of these road train operators would be accommodated. I would have been jumping up and down and claiming victory and asking to be congratulated on what a marvellous coup I pulled off, because of my wonderful representation of the Northern Territory, in achieving the conclusion of the process. I assure you, Mr Chairman, that there is no contradiction at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said that I was confident that the problems of these particular operators would be considered and acceded to because I knew, having spoken at length to Ted Butcher and having made representations to him on the subject, that he was minded to review downwards, if you like, the level of charges originally anticipated for these particular truck drivers, which is why I said that I was confident that they would get some relief. To just throw out some figures-and I can only throw them out because the matter has not been determined-we are talking about potential charges for operators of these vehicles of somewhere in excess of $70,000 per vehicle. In the discussions that are currently being held, that is being scaled down to somewhere in excess of $30,000-odd, which is a reduction. </PARA>

I reiterate and confirm the advice that I have just given to the Committee: the matter has not yet been finally determined and is still under consideration. I am perfectly happy to reiterate and stand by what I said on 8DN. I am confident and remain confident that at the end of the process the particular problems of the operators of these large vehicles will be taken into consideration by the Government. I stress again that this is consistent with the overriding principle that has been supported by everybody-except those who do not want to pay for it-including the governments, of providing a national scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has suggested that there is some confusion in my mind as to what is occurring with regard to the national road transport scheme and the uniform level of road charges. The Minister himself is responsible now for creating a certain degree of confusion because he spoke of charges in excess of $70,000 for road trains and they are now being scaled back to $30,000. I refer the Minister to the revised figures in the second Butcher report on a national road registration charge. The Minister will recall that a type-2 road train, which is one of the larger types of road trains, was suggested in the original report to be required to pay a registration fee in the vicinity of $61,000 for an average year's travel on the roads. Under the revised scheme-that is, under the second report-the charge for that same type-2 road train was reduced to only $42,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is some degree of confusion, I think the Minister's own comments are indicative of the very confusion that many other people in this place and throughout provincial Australia are also suffering. This is why the matter is of such great importance to us. I will move on and ask the Minister: what particular steps are being taken to do an assessment of the effect of the increased road charges on remote and rural Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr Chairman, could I say without being tedious that I was not suggesting that Senator O'Chee was confused in terms of the substance of the issues. I was simply suggesting that he was confused in assuming that the use of the word `confident' meant necessarily that the matter had been resolved. I would have thought that the simple English meaning of the word indicated a future situation had not yet been arrived at. I am confident that with the continuing discussion that is currently taking place and will take place-and it will not be an easy debate, I would think, in terms of the consultations which are continuing between State and Federal governments on this matter-there will be some significant consideration given to people that may be disadvantaged by these proposals. Perhaps there is a danger in even saying these things. Even though I qualified it to death, I will qualify it again. I will say again on the Hansard record: do not hold me to figures like the one of $30,000-odd that I have just thrown out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have found in this business that confusion can sometimes be a very healthy and positive thing. There is confusion still because the matter has not been resolved. There would be one very simple way to resolve it. That would be for the Government simply to say, `We accept completely and without reservation all of the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report'. That would resolve the confusion wonderfully, but as a senator for the Northern Territory I would not be particularly happy about having it resolved. I am happy for a little confusion, if one wants to use that word, to remain in that it is only a product of the fact that these discussions have not yet been brought to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Having heard contributions made to the debate so far at State government level and from noting the various lobby groups that are seeing Minister Brown and making representations to governments, both State and Federal, I have no doubt that there is still a significant amount of discussion to go. Again, as I think Senator O'Chee indicated by way of interjection at Question Time today, it may well be that the matter is finally resolved at the Special Premiers Conference held to discuss State-Federal government relations. </PARA>

<PARA> Whilst the Minister receives a briefing from his staffers-and I am quite happy for him to do so-I also throw out to the Minister another question. Am I correct in assuming from the Minister's most recent answer that it is still not too late for concerned road users as well as other concerned groups of citizens, such as primary producers, who rely on road transport and who have not as yet had or taken the opportunity to make a submission to Mr Butcher, to make a submission to the Minister?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator O'Chee's last question is, of course, yes. I will explain the answer to his previous question. The particular matter that he is talking about is being addressed by the series of working groups that have been set up at State government level, as I explained today in Question Time. Of course, one of the direct matters that those working groups are addressing is the impact of these proposed charges on the States represented by these working groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to Senator O'Chee's question is, firstly, that the working groups are currently giving consideration to the questions that he has raised as to the impact of these charges on remote operators and residents and, secondly, that it is not too late for people to continue to make representations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer because I know that there are many very concerned people throughout Queensland who for one reason or another were not aware of the proposals of the Inter-State Commission. I think one of the reasons for that certain degree of ignorance is that the proposals were tabled in May with the deadline for submissions in response being June. In fact, many people were not aware of the proposals until just before or just after the deadline for submissions in response, a matter which I do not find particularly satisfying and which I and a number of my colleagues in the National Party of Australia are trying to address in an intelligent and reasonable fashion by talking to people about the proposals and encouraging members of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) to travel throughout Queensland with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, there is continuing confusion and concern. More and more people are realising all of the time the consequences of the Inter-State Commission proposals. Only over the last week I have had two meetings of truck drivers-one in Cairns and one in Townsville-which were very well attended. Those people turned up because they had only just heard of the Inter-State Commission proposals. They did not have any input into the first one. They did not have any input, be it for whatever reason, into the revised proposal. They had found areas that were of concern to them. One thing in particular that I note as a good example of the sorts of issues that are being raised right now as a result of continued consultation by colleagues such as Senator Boswell and by me is the following: under the revised ISC report, it is suggested that it might be possible to have some sort of reduction in charges for livestock hauliers because of the fact that they do not usually get back freights. That means that they pick up their livestock in, say, Hughenden or Richmond and drive down to Townsville to the abattoir, but they usually do not get a freight of stock from Townsville back to Hughenden or Richmond, with the consequence that they do a lot of miles unloaded. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that was pointed out at the meeting in Cairns was that, if a reduction of charges for livestock hauliers is appropriate in that circumstance, it might also be appropriate to have a reduction in charges for operators who have tippers-that is, trucks that carry and unload soil-because, of course, they tend to get freight only in one direction and not in two.</PARA>
<PARA> These are examples of the concerns that are only now being raised in the community many months after the original report was tabled, concerns that are of grave significance to me and many of my colleagues in the National Party, who are concerned about the increased cost of living in remote and rural Australia. That is why I raised those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> But perhaps I ought to move on to the question of the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane because I understand that a statement in respect of road transport charges and a national road registration scheme was made by the Premiers and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the end of that conference. I ask whether the Minister could enlighten us as to exactly what the proposals that the Premiers Conference dreamt up really are because there is, indeed, a great deal of confusion in respect of those charges and proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Leaving aside the fact that the words `intelligent', `reasonable' and the `National Party' are mutually exclusive, the fact is that it does Senator O'Chee no credit to talk about things being dreamt up at the Special Premiers Conference. I think Senator O'Chee would advance the interests of the State of Queensland significantly if, instead of using throwaway lines like that, he gave some significant support to the deliberations of the Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, one of the most vociferous public advocates of the success of that conference was his conservative colleague the Premier of New South Wales. There is some reason, without going over the top about it, why that process should have been applauded. As someone who was a delegate at two constitutional conventions, I say that it is very frustrating for people like me who want to see significant change in the huge economic disadvantages that are caused to this country by the fundamental anachronisms that are contained in our Constitution, which are no longer relevant to the proper economic management of Australia, and who want to see those removed, to know the great difficulty in practical terms of achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly applaud the initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), which has not been taken without criticism from some of his own colleagues, in being prepared to discuss or even have on the table in a meaningful way these long held sacred items of State-Federal government relationships. This has promoted a process whereby through agreement between the States we can achieve at least some measure of rationality with these proposals, rather than having to rely on section 128 of the Australian Constitution, which seems to be almost impossible to fulfil time out of number. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee is basically asking the same question again and again. All I can do in response to his question about determinations or decisions that have been reached by the Premiers Conference at its last meeting about these issues is to repeat that no determinations on the detail of the implementation of the Inter-State Commission's recommendations were reached at the Premiers Conference. I simply say again that that matter is currently being addressed by a series of working groups that have been set up by the State governments as a result of the last Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting in Hobart. That work is ongoing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that any submissions that Senator O'Chee wants to make to the Queensland State Government will be welcomed in a completely non-partisan way-I have no difficulty in asserting that-if he wants to bring concerns to the attention of the Queensland Minister for Transport or if he directs other people to do so. They will be reflected in the representations that are made during the process of further consultation that is going on at the moment between State and Federal governments in respect of this issue. </PARA>

I do not intend to get into a debate about what Mr Greiner may or may not want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Collins, in representing the Northern Territory, would have the same regard for the people of the Northern Territory that I have for the people of Queensland. Just because something may suit New South Wales does not mean that it necessarily suits Queensland. That is the substance of the answer the Minister has just given. But he has not answered the question of what was stated in the communique that came out of the Premiers Conference. He has run a mile and looked everywhere else but there. He has talked about working committees and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that the communique talked about charges consistent with those recommended by the Inter-State Commission. It also used the words `full cost recovery'. As far as I am concerned, full cost recovery means that one is going to recover moneys in accordance with the purported cost of road maintenance. As the communique had already made a reference to the Inter-State Commission, I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that the basis of assessing full cost recovery will be the Inter-State Commission's own costings on the cost of maintaining the road network throughout Australia. Therefore, I do not think I am jumping to any conclusions when I say that I have some concern that the matter has not been properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been quite some time since the Special Premiers Conference, to which the Minister has already referred. Yet we are still waiting for a statement from the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown) or a statement in this chamber from Senator Collins. It is a matter that is appropriate for the consideration of the Senate because we are the representatives of the States. It is a matter that we are still waiting for a statement on. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see why, after all this time, Mr Brown cannot make a statement in the other place as to exactly how he intends to follow this process of consultation. I do not see why it is unreasonable to expect Senator Collins, representing the Minister in this chamber, to make a statement before the Senate and say exactly what the Minister has in mind when it comes to consultation and a national road registration scheme. The confusion that Senator Collins has already referred to is being multiplied each and every day in the media because nobody knows what is on the Government's mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins makes grandiose and flamboyant suggestions that I make representations to the Minister for Transport in Queensland. If we are going to talk about the Minister for Transport in Queensland, we could talk about a couple of back flips that he has made since he sent a representative to a meeting of concerned truck drivers and graziers in Richmond two days before the deadline for submissions. We could do that if we wanted to make grandiose statements, but I do not intend to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins ought to know that I have been working ceaselessly since May to tell the people of Queensland exactly what is going on, to discuss the issue with them, to hear their concerns and to bring those concerns back here. He should also know from my many and frequent statements in this chamber that I am continuing and will continue to do so until I get a fair go for the people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I again refer Senator Collins to my original question-and I will keep on asking this question until he starts to give me an answer. What exactly does the Government have in mind? Am I correct in assuming from the communique that came out of the Premiers Conference that we will be looking at a national road registration scheme, the charges for which will be consistent in scale with those recommended by the Inter-State Commission?</PARA>

I also have taken the opportunity of refreshing my memory by reading the Estimates committee Hansard in which Senator Collins did indicate his concern, as he has just again said, for the people he represents in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister give me some indication of the likely form that some action on this Inter-State Commission report would take as it affects the Federal Parliament? Is it likely in some way to involve legislation or regulations, or will it simply be a report? If it is something that is likely to involve the Federal Parliament in legislation, will there be a cost to the Budget? What will that be in the order of and what will be the receipts for the Budget outlays?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is impossible to answer those detailed questions in advance of a final decision being taken. It is perfectly correct to say that-and the matter has been canvassed at some length already-the Special Premiers Conference, as Senator O'Chee has said, did consider the matter at its last meeting. I alluded to that, as Senator Macdonald would recall, in response to his question at Question Time today, and suggested that in fact it would be most likely the Special Premiers Conference would get a final resolution to the issue. I know that there will be a report to the next Special Premiers Conference as to what sort of shape these proposals will take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just point out again for the benefit of all members of the Committee that there is really no need to become agitated about confusion when that confusion is simply being caused by the Government's willingness and readiness to consider further representations on this issue. The communique from the Special Premiers Conference determined, as again I said today, that there will be on a cooperative basis-and that is the key word, because it has to be done by agreement-a national heavy vehicle registration scheme together with uniform technical and operating regulations and nationally consistent charges. That is the principal basis on which this will proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant amount of detail has to be applied to actually put this scheme into operation. Of course, there is no question, to answer one part of Senator Macdonald's question, but that legislation will certainly be required in order to implement a scheme on a national basis which is uniform across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Budget implications of that so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, it is really a little too early in the piece to start predicting any impact on the Commonwealth Budget, except, of course, that the Inter-State Commission report has pointed out in some detail the very significant gains to the national revenue of such a scheme being introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins. I am just concerned to be assured that it will come back to the Senate-which some may say is the most democratic representative chamber in the whole of Australia-so that we may have a chance to discuss it at some greater length. I was concerned that the decisions may be made by the separate State governments working together without something coming back for consideration by this Parliament, but I thank Senator Collins for his assurance that it will come back here. I only raise that issue because people keep approaching me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Reith, and I had a meeting with truck drivers in Townsville last week, and there and in other parts of Queensland people have kept raising these things with me. I must say that, if I were not confused before, I certainly am becoming more confused as a result of the representations made to me. I want to be able to assure the people who approach me that we will have a chance of further considering the matter in the Senate at some stage before it is too late. I am being told by people in the industry that 1 January represents the date when increased charges are to apply. I have not been able to ascertain myself where that information comes from or how accurate it is, but I was not aware of it, and I am assured and relaxed because the Minister has informed me that the matter will come back to the Senate for debate before anything is implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> I might just pass to another peripherally related matter. Senator Collins will be aware, as the representative for the Northern Territory, that, as he has acknowledged here, there are many, many people concerned about this. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has had some discussions with groups of transport operators and I note, as reported in the North West Star on 21 November 1990-that is the Mount Isa paper-that Mr Hawke issued an open invitation to them to present their concerns about the Inter-State Commission report to himself and the Minister for Land Transport, Mr Brown, in Canberra. This invitation to come to Canberra to speak with Mr Hawke and the Minister for Land Transport has been repeated by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) to a group of trucking people in Mareeba. That was reported in the Cairns Post, I think it was, on 24 November 1990. There is also a group of truckies on the Sunshine Coast who are very concerned and Mr John Rosman spoke at a rally I was at yesterday about the same issue. They are all very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, my request to Senator Collins might be: would he ensure that an invitation is extended to the truck operators in Cairns and Townsville, as well as in Queensland generally-and, I suppose for fairness, we should say anywhere else in Australia-who are concerned? Could all of those groups of people be invited, not just the people in Mount Isa and Mareeba? If that is going to happen, it may be a sensible extension of that proposal simply to have some sort of a national seminar between all persons interested, which would enable me and other members of the Liberal Party interested in this matter to come along, participate and hear the answers-and I am sure Senator Collins would want to be involved in that in his dual capacity. So I make the suggestion that all people who are interested be invited to this meeting with Mr Hawke and the Minister for Land Transport and, as I say, it might be a sensible extension of that to have some sort of a national seminar on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come again to the issue of the Special Premiers Conference. Senator Collins was studiously avoiding my question. He refused to answer my question, so I have to come back to Senator Collins on it again. But I will take the opportunity also to raise some other matters that came out of the Special Premiers Conference regarding road transport, matters that have been raised with me and are of concern to me. One of the suggestions that we hear in the press-and I do not know whether these comments are true or not, so Senator Collins now has the opportunity to allay any misconceptions that may exist, and I am interested in having him do so to ensure that there is intelligent and reasonable debate-and one of the suggestions made to me is that a national road registration scheme for heavy road transport will be implemented on 1 July 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is the case, then that is a full 12 months prior to the recommended start-up date for such a scheme under the revised Butcher proposals. Of course, for the Minister's benefit, the revised Butcher proposals said that the scheme should start on 1 July 1992 and be phased in over a period of time so that, for the first two years, transport operators would be on half charges and would subsequently have to pay full charges at a later date, which it was suggested perhaps ought to be 1 July 1994. Of course, there was a sting in the tail of the whole thing because the cost of paying the half charges from 1992 until 1994 was an extra 6c a litre in the excise on diesel. But, assuming one is going to live with that-and I know a lot of truck drivers and a lot of other people who are not particularly fussed with a concession that gives them half registration charges but an extra 6c a litre fuel excise on diesel-if it is true that a national road registration scheme coming from the Special Premiers Conference would commence on 1 July next year, I am very concerned because the pace is going far too fast for intelligent consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> So I would extend to Senator Collins first and foremost right now the opportunity to say whether it is intended to have this scheme start up on 1 July next year. Secondly, I reiterate my question to Senator Collins: is it correct that the starting point for discussions arising out of the Special Premiers Conference is that the road registration charges that will be implemented will be in terms of the same scale as those in the revised Butcher report? That is my second question, the question that Senator Collins did not answer a short time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I come to my third question, a question I have also asked Senator Collins: when is Mr Brown going to make a statement in the other place, and when is Senator Collins going to make a statement in this chamber, in the Senate, before all of us as to exactly what the starting point for discussions is? Senator Collins has made some fairly sweeping and grandiose statements in this chamber this afternoon as to exactly how we could all make submissions to the relevant State transport Ministers, how Mr Hawke was very concerned to hear from affected road transport operators and how the Minister was concerned to hear from people who might be affected by the implementation of increased road registration charges. That is fine, but we have to have a starting point. We have to know what we are really talking about, otherwise every group that will come to the Minister runs the risk of coming on a false premise, of wasting their time and wasting the Minister's time. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that people know the truth behind the recommendations, and know the truth behind the Government's agenda. It is incumbent upon this Government for the Minister and for Senator Collins to make statements in the other place and in the Senate respectively as to exactly what the starting point is. At the moment, we are living in the dark. If Senator Collins is really interested in intelligent debate, I extend to him again the opportunity to tell us when a statement is going to be laid down so that we can start discussing the matter intelligently. At the moment we are only getting confusion, it is impossible to get any reasonable debate, and I ask the Minister to address these questions now and not to hide from them as he did just a few moments ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the adjournment debate that we have just heard for the third time, I actually could not locate the questions that were contained in it. I think the principal one was: when are we going to get to the starting point for the discussions on these charges? The starting point is the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report. That is a public document and it is currently being used as the basis for ongoing discussions. With regard to the discrepancy between the implementation of the recommendations and the Premiers Conference, the Premiers Conference determined that consideration of this issue would have regard to the recommendations of the ISC report, and I have said that again and again. The fundamental principle which was established by the ISC report is that there will be a uniform heavy vehicle registration scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premiers Conference communique confirmed that these decisions, which will be taken by the Special Premiers Conference process, will have regard to the ISC recommendations. It is also true that they are going to be adopted with a view to full cost recovery. But I might add that there is a tremendous amount of scope contained in that statement in terms of a view to full cost recovery for the final shape of what the Premiers, in consultation with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), will hopefully agree to. But that is the starting point for the discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no substance to Senator Macdonald's suggestion that there was a proposal that this scheme would start on 1 January. To reiterate it again, the Premiers Conference did give a commitment that there would be a target of 1 July next year. Although I did make myself a promise that I would not rise to any more baits-the lights which show that the proceedings are being broadcast have a terrible effect-in respect of Senator O'Chee's complaint that a process which is going to take eight months is too speedy, I will remember that next time somebody gives me a hard time about the fact that things are not happening quickly enough in waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Any senator who has been in the Senate for any length of time would appreciate that, although one may disagree with timetables, it is essential to lay them down. I, for one, would hate to sit on a Senate committee that was deliberating on an issue if there was not a target date set-however unrealistic it might be-at least to provide a framework for discussions to take place. When one considers that the total term of office from polling day to polling day in the Federal sphere is three short years, I do not think, in terms of trying to implement what is a vitally important piece of reform in transport, that an eight-month period from now-considering the fact that the coming to fruition of the ISC's recommendations has already taken a considerable time-is too speedy at all. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some people will complain at the end about the length of time that it has taken to complete the process. But that is not just my view; it is also the view of all the State Premiers, Labor and conservative, and the view of the Prime Minister. I do not think that 1 July next year is an unreasonable time by which people could expect to see the start of this reform process. Again, this is speculation on my part because I am not the responsible Minister, but I would be surprised if by 1 July all of the very complex ramifications that are involved not just in this initiative, but in the consistent initiatives in terms of rail as well, would be in place and operational. But it is not an unreasonable start-up date for the process to begin to be implemented. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister said that the starting point would be consistent with the ISC proposals, and he also spoke about full cost recovery. I am not trying to put words in his mouth and I would be very grateful if he did not try to put words in my mouth. Therefore, I am a little concerned that he should suggest that I complained that eight months was too speedy a period. My complaint is not that eight months is too speedy a period, but that too long a period has elapsed since the Special Premiers Conference for us to be waiting around for a ministerial statement. I am going to assume that the details the Minister has given us in the last 30 minutes constitute a ministerial statement, but if he wants to make a full and proper ministerial statement, I would also welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern is that, with the very few sitting days that the House of Representatives has had this year, the failure by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) to make a ministerial statement the week before last-when he had ample lead time to do so from the Special Premiers Conference to then-meant that we would be unlikely to see a statement made by the responsible Minister in the House of Representatives until some time in February next year. That does not cut the period of time for discussion to eight months; it cuts it to something like four months. That is why I start to get concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> For those people who are listening who do not understand the full scale of the whole proposal, let me stress the fact that, in one form or another, the road transport industry, the Federal Government and the State governments have been arguing about and working towards a uniform set of road rules in this country for the last 30 years. I would welcome a uniform set of road rules in this country, as would just about every truck driver. I attended a meeting in Townsville, I think it was, where the truck drivers passed a resolution that they were in support of uniform national road rules because they believed it would lead to more efficient interstate trade, and that is a perfectly reasonable position. What concerns me is that the vacillation by the Minister in the House of Representatives has cut that lead time, not to eight months, but potentially to four months. As I said, I am going to assume that the statements made here by Senator Collins constitute a de facto ministerial statement, although I would welcome a full and frank exposition of what is on the Government's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude-and I know Senator Collins does not like my continuing but I intend to continue because it is a matter of importance to many people-by laying down for Senator Collins and for Mr Brown some of the problems that will arise from the sorts of charges that are contained in the ISC report. It is suggested that the implementation of the ISC report in respect of road charges would lead to increases in transport costs of something like 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to a case study to show the consequences that would have for rural Australia. I refer to a matter that was raised with me by potato growers from the tablelands to the west of Cairns. Those potato growers face costs, in getting their potatoes harvested and down to Sydney, of roughly $9 a bag, $5.50 of which is consumed by road transport charges. That is not the cost of growing the crop or planting the crop; that is just the cost of harvesting the crop-$1 a bag; bagging it-another $1; commission-$1.50 a bag; and $5.50 a bag for road transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may say that $9 a bag is not a lot of money. It is a lot of money when the market price for potatoes in Sydney is $8 a bag. That is why the potato growers in north Queensland are ploughing in their crops this week. That is why there will be no potatoes coming down from north Queensland. That is why not all of those potato growers will plant a crop for next year-they do not have the income coming from this year's crop to buy the seed. If we are going to talk about seed, the growers are talking about enormous charges to bring that seed from Victoria, where it originates; that too adds to the growers' costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to talk about a 20 per cent increase in road transport costs, which is the projected figure if we implement the ISC proposals, then instead of its costing $5.50 a bag to transport those potatoes from the tablelands to Sydney, it will cost $6.10. So the real cost to get potatoes out of the ground and down to the market in Sydney will be $10.10 a bag. When the market price for most of the potatoes put on the market is already $8 a bag, and when the market price for the best grade of potato in large quantities never exceeds $10 a bag, what we are really talking about is the death of the potato industry on the Mareeba tablelands in Queensland. I could go on-I do not intend to do so-to highlight all the other industries that will be affected if we introduce the increased charges for road registration. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that concerns me is that the Special Premiers Conference talked only about implementing these charges in respect of heavy road transport-not all road transport, not all cars. I invite Senator Collins to remember that that was the original proposal in the ISC report and the proposal that was reiterated in the revised report. Senator Collins, has already alluded to it today. He said that the scheme would be compensating. He said that many transport operators under the ISC would receive lower registration charges. That may be the case if we are talking about very small transport operators with vehicles that are smaller than 22 tonnes for a body truck, but for every operator with a truck over that weight, that is, the heavy road transport industry, the charges will be higher. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have a Premiers Conference proposal that is going to touch only on the larger trucks-the heavy road transport industry-and will not include registration of the lighter vehicles of less than 22 tonnes body mass, what we are talking about is not a revenue neutral scheme-that is what Mr Butcher proposed in his first and second reports; he spoke about the scheme being revenue neutral-but a scheme that will be raising a lot of money because all the goodies that Mr Butcher had in his scheme to lure the voters in the city, like nominal registration charges for cars only, will not be there. People will still be paying the same registration charges for their cars because they are not part of the heavy road transport industry. So the concern that I and many people around Australia have is that the ISC proposals, if selectively used in the manner that you have suggested and in the manner that the Premiers Conference communique has suggested, will lead to increased transport costs.

This is why I am so concerned about the matter and this is why I have continued to fire questions at Senator Collins this afternoon. As I said, Senator Collins, I would welcome any fuller statement that you or Mr Brown wish to make.

The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) might recall that at the Estimates Committee hearings we had a discussion about Mr Dick Smith and affordable safety. The Minister pointed out that implementation of any reviews of regulations would be done by management of CAA. My first question is a timetable question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major thrust of the new proposals on airspace management has been delayed. Timetables were established that will not be adhered to. The reason for that is the continuing consultation with the industry. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is being flexible in respect of the responses it is getting. The overwhelming response from the industry has been one of support for the changes that are being proposed, but there are still concerns about having the full impact of these changes explained. On a recent visit to Mount Isa I had a meeting with the aviation sector and those concerns were expressed to me. Currently, I have requested that the CAA send officers to Mount Isa to discuss the concerns about the implementation of the proposals. The answer to Senator Kernot's question is that there has been a change in the implementation date for these proposals which will be consistent-I am happy to keep the Senate advised on it-with the continuing consultation which the CAA is having with the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, one of the reasons why the CAA has to be flexible in its approach to this matter is that, consistent with what is being done on the waterfront, the current system of regulation and management of Australia's airspace is something that we in Australia have simply grown up with over the last 50 years. To a significant extent, this happened in isolation from what was happening elsewhere in the world. Over the past few years the senior management of the CAA has taken the view that this is not an appropriate way to proceed, which is why these reports have been commissioned. Indeed, the ongoing review of the whole range of regulations covering airspace has been under way for some time, as I know Senator Kernot is aware. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals and the regulatory regime adopted by international organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation are now directly relevant to the way in which airspace is going to be managed in Australia. This is consistent with the principle that the CAA is not going to blindly adopt regimes from overseas simply because they exist there, but will adopt regimes which will be largely consistent with the airspace management that operates in the major aviation nations around the world with which we have constant dealings in the aviation sector. Those regimes will, however, be consistent with the retention of any regulatory regime which exists in Australia, unique to the Australian situation, which relates to safety. So the answer to the honourable senator's question is that consultations with the industry are ongoing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My next question is consequent upon that one. The Civil Aviation Authority News of 13 November 1990 states that, because of bad debts, much less money is available to purchase equipment and to pay salaries. Could the Minister comment on that? Is it related to this loss? How does this affect the operation of CAA at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) does suffer from a bad debt problem, as do other organisations in this country, such as electricity authorities and people that sell gas to consumers or private businesses that charge for those services. Certainly there is a bad debt problem with the CAA, but the major problem in recent times, without question, has been the financial difficulties suffered by people to an extent unknown in this country because of the direct consequences of the pilots dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite that, the CAA is currently engaged in the single greatest capital investment that the aviation sector has ever seen in terms of new equipment and facilities around Australia. A program of some $500m in total expenditure is under way around Australia. It is fair to say that the operations of the CAA in terms of a major upgrading of facilities around Australia have not been impeded by the bad debt problem. I am quite happy again to get actual figures on bad debts for the honourable senator. If she wants them we will dig those out. I am happy to get the actual detail of that bad debt figure for the honourable senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from that answer, I will ask the Minister another question. We have heard a lot about the CAA's plans to upgrade radar in Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra to replace equipment that is about 30 years old. Is it true that this has already been delayed? What is the time frame on this?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Northern Territory-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(5.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for the delays are largely unrelated to questions of finance. For example, the RADREP program and the ATCARD program at Melbourne very much relate to the actual decisions to be taken and the decisions that have been taken about the equipment that is being purchased. A number of competing companies are offering a startling array of choices to the CAA in terms of getting state-of-the-art equipment in what is a very expensive replacement program. Companies such as Hughes Aircraft Co. and other competing companies have been showing their wares. So far, delays have been caused largely because of problems with the actual supply of the equipment. I am pleased to say that teething problems in the case of the ATCARD equipment at Melbourne and so on have now been sorted out. But there is such a constant development in the technology available in this area that the delays of the sort that have been experienced are not uncommon, not simply in the aviation sector in this country but also elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The program for radar replacement at Sydney is on track. At this point the CAA has awarded contracts of $50m. Included in the radar sensor procurement project will be a total of eight primary radar, 19 secondary surveillance radar sensors and transportable primary and secondary surveillance radar. The total project is estimated to cost $143m and is anticipated to be completed by late 1993. I was going to say two years; that would have been close to it. The project includes the establishment of air traffic control radar at Cairns and Coolangatta for the first time. There have been delays in the availability-that is, the supply-of the equipment at Cairns and Coolangatta. That is now scheduled to be operational early next year. The new air traffic radar towers at Cairns and Coolangatta were commissioned in July this year. The CAA is also replacing radar display and processing systems at Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1990 the CAA announced that three companies had been short-listed to enter the project definition stage and that this short list had been endorsed by the Air Traffic Controllers Association. In fact, I think that Siemens Ltd is demonstrating some equipment here in Canberra this week. If Senator Kernot is interested-she may well be interested-Siemens has the product that it is offering concerning air traffic control radar in Canberra now. If she is interested she can contact my office and I can assist her to make arrangements to go. In fact, there is no reason why we cannot go together, if it is at a time convenient to her, and look at it in operation while it is here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Final evaluation of these systems will be completed later this year and the project will be completed in 1992. The CAA, in consultation with controllers, has been upgrading the ATCARD system at Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. An amount of $6m is being spent on the enhancement program, which will be completed in January next year. As people who have been travelling in and out of Melbourne would know, while this work has been in progress, to ensure that safety has not been compromised, traffic arriving in Melbourne has been sequenced at greater than normal intervals. This has led to some delays at the airport, but I am assured that the initial problems associated with that radar equipment have been resolved. The answer to the honourable senator's question is that the majority of this upgraded work will be completed by 1993. </PARA>

While the officers of the Department are looking up the answer to the bad debt question which I asked, could they also tell me whether any of the domestic airlines are listed as bad debtors with the Civil Aviation Authority?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that there is now no requirement for the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation to investigate all incidents. I note that on page 44 of the explanatory notes the objective talks about `safety recommendations based on the investigation of selected accidents and incidents'. Where could I find the criteria for how these selections are made?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I answer that question I will provide an answer to Senator Kernot's previous question. The amount approved for reimbursement to the Civil Aviation Authority was approximately $58.3m, which was reimbursed as a result of the waiver of air navigation charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as the new directions for the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) are concerned, the decisions that are taken will be taken by its management. This is an arrangement with which I am totally comfortable because the organisation is one in which I have the highest confidence in terms of its professionalism. It is a very welcome change to get down to the nub of what the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation should be all about. In the past it has been required to investigate each and every incident that has occurred. This has meant, of course, that its resources have had to be directed to investigating incidents of such a trivial nature that they simply did not warrant the amount of time and effort that was spent on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the changes has been to bring about a situation where the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will be a lot more selective in investigating. Of course, it will investigate all of those serious instances that result in loss of life; but, in the main, it will investigate incidents or take pre-emptive investigatory measures rather than simply be reactive to an accident in order to provide an even more positive enhancement of the preventive safety role that BASI currently plays. One example I can give of the sort of work that it has proved it is capable of doing can be found in the analysis that it has been able to give of the problems experienced by the Mitsubishi aircraft which have been suffering icing problems at high altitudes. That is just one example of the sort of approach that BASI can take in terms of a more analytical approach-if you like-to air safety whilst, at all times, investigating those incidents which are serious by any reasonable standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The next question I would like to ask the Minister is related to the question that I asked him in Question Time, on two occasions, concerning Qantas Airways Ltd. How do members of the general public actually find out the information that they might want to know about incidents? One of the objectives under the subprogram description states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>providing information on the causes of accidents and incidents to-</PARA>
<PARA>the usual list of people, and-</PARA>

<PARA>I recall that when I asked my question about Qantas earlier the Minister said that this information was available to members of parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, people are able to go directly to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) to ask questions and the Bureau certainly prepares reports for public consumption on accidents. At all times it is perfectly appropriate-in fact, I would be delighted-for the public to be more actively interested in chasing up these incidents. It might give BASI a real lift if it had an increase in the amount of inquiries from the general public about what it does. There is no difficulty at all in people approaching the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation directly if they want advice about particular incidents. In fact, I would recommend it. The person who rang me at home at one o'clock in the morning about three months ago in relation to what that person thought was a near miss near Sydney Airport would have been far better off going to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation instead of waking me up at one o'clock in the morning. The more I think about it, the more I think it is a great idea.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that it would produce publications. I am not personally familiar with them for the simple reason that I of course receive the detailed reports on the investigations as they occur. A document called the  Aviation Safety Digest used to be published, and I remember it well. It published fulsome and horrific details of why aircraft crashed: from memory, in most cases accidents were directly attributable to pilot error. The reason I remember the Aviation Safety Digest is that charter companies operating in the Northern Territory for some strange reason insisted on sticking the publication in the pockets of the aircraft on which I regularly flew. So I could read about the latest disaster as the plane was taking off from the airport. I do not know what has happened to John Pike. I have no doubt that BASI publishes newsletters and information for the industry which I am sure would be just as readily available to the public. I will get a detailed response for Senator Kernot as to what it does publish.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly would not want to see BASI indulge in unnecessary publication just in case somebody might read it. The reason why in an Estimates committee hearing I am cautious about giving that commitment is that the Government, as Senator Kernot knows full well, has been belted around the ears to a great extent recently about the pernicious practices of the Department of Social Security in putting pot-plants in its offices and sending out letters to social security recipients. So I would certainly be reluctant to give a blanket guarantee that BASI should churn out 10 million copies of a regular list on the chance that someone may pick it up and read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I inform Senator Kernot that John Pike has left. I have been passed a note which suggests that I invite the honourable senator to visit facilities at BASI for a detailed briefing. What a wonderful suggestion. I was going to suggest to the honourable senator at the conclusion of these questions, as a matter of fact, that I think she would find it more than useful if she paid BASI a visit here in Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I thank the Minister but I am also anxious to get some things on the public record-it is not just a matter of looking over the facilities. As that particular gentleman is not here, I shall ask another question. When we were debating migration regulations the matter of foreign pilots was discussed. I understand that they have had exemptions granted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in such matters as morse code endorsements and have had the opportunity to have oral instead of written examinations. My question is: were these exemptions cost cutting measures or is there another explanation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say categorically that in terms of endorsement there were no special concessions made to overseas nationals flying on Australian licences. The testing procedures that were applied to overseas nationals are consistent with those that apply to anyone else. I can certainly assert that because this matter was canvassed at length, and it will be contained in the Hansard records of the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots Dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of morse code endorsement, I have not flown in a Tiger Moth lately but I have not actually seen a morse code key in the cockpits of any of the aircraft that I have flown in recently, so I cannot answer that specific question, except to say that if there is an exemption made for foreign nationals from sending in morse then that same exemption will apply to Australian nationals. But simply to reiterate, I can assure Senator Kernot that, in respect of endorsement for an Australian licence to fly domestic aircraft in Australia, no special concessions or arrangements were made in respect of foreign nationals flying in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I just conclude by saying-and this is where some of the confusion was caused during the Select Committee, as I said earlier-that the CAA is engaged in an ongoing and continuing process of removing unnecessary paperwork and unnecessary regulations that we have simply grown up with over the last half century for no good reason other than that we were doing it the year before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a guide to Senator Kernot, I say that, as a general rule of thumb that I have adopted here, it would be useful to discount completely anything that Senator MacGibbon said about aviation at all. I have found that that is a fairly reliable rule of thumb. The assertion just repeated by Senator Kernot-and I found it astonishing at the time-was in fact made by Senator MacGibbon. That is where it came from. Senator MacGibbon asserted in here that American pilots were forbidden from making public announcements over the PA system of the aircraft. As I said when he raised it at the time, I had just two days before flown to Canberra for the sittings and as we left Darwin in an Ansett 767 a voice came onto the intercom which said, `Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking. We are passing through 20,000 feet at this time', et cetera. If that bloke was an Australian, he needed six months of intensive speech therapy with Paul Hogan because he sounded awfully like an American national to me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He made it up rather than dragged it up, as Senator Faulkner suggests. It is simply not true, as anyone who flies at all regularly with either Ansett or Australian would well know. What happens on flights these days is what has always happened, and that is that the announcements that are made over the PA are made alternately, usually, by either the captain or the first officer of the aircraft, depending on which leg one is on, the particular day or perhaps even the inclination of the pilots in the cockpit at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say, however, without casting any aspersions on Australian pilots, that there is no question at all that the public relations skills of American pilots in particular are considerable in that the American pilots whom I have flown with recently seem to take considerable pains over being friendly and addressing the passengers and providing useful information-as of course many of the Australian pilots do too, some more than others, depending on who one flies with. </PARA>

It was said that the latest safety measure that had been introduced on board these new aircraft was a Doberman pinscher, which was installed in the cockpit, the pilot's job being to feed the Doberman pinscher and the Doberman pinscher's job being to bite the pilot if he touched the controls. I do not think that story was true but there is no question at all that generally speaking these days the safety aspects of aviation in Australia are to a considerable degree safer now, particularly as a result of the enhanced technology that is available on the new designs of aircraft.

When the captain does not speak, I ask on my way out what the nationality of the pilot is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The great difficulty with getting a resolution in respect of Cairns was caused by the very feature of the negotiation to which Senator Macdonald has alluded-that is, rightly or wrongly, it has been seen by many people on both sides of the fence as a precedent. The significant delays in getting a resolution to this issue have not been entirely one-sided. As Tas Bull pointed out to me with some vehemence and a great deal of validity some time ago, it is interesting that this port, which has a long history of being a busy port, has suffered a massive decline in the business it once used to do. I might say that ports around Australia and, in fact, around the world tend to wax and wane. The difficulty with Cairns, as Tas pointed out to me, is that all the emphasis has constantly been directed entirely at the waterside workers in the port, to the exclusion of all other workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question that with the original attitude of the then port authority, that was very much the case. That authority, for whatever reason, had a positive antipathy towards that union and predicated all its suggestions for achieving some sort of resolution to the problems in Cairns on removing the union from the port. That was never a viable approach. I had no difficulty at all in asserting that to the new authority when I met with it. But this significantly impeded any progress. With great respect, an approach by which one party is determined to achieve a solution which would remove from the port the organisation with which it is negotiating and which, rightly or wrongly currently represents the workers, is doomed to failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately that delayed proceedings. There have been some recent changes in the management of Northern Shipping and Stevedoring Pty Ltd that operates in the Port of Cairns, which I hope will not delay the proceedings any longer. However, there has been a significant amount of activity in relation to Cairns port in recent times. Last week the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority convened a series of meetings with all parties involved in Cairns and that process is now being assessed. There will be further discussions with the parties this week. Failing any resolution of the problem this week by agreement, the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority has agreed to make-and I was advised of this by Peter Evans on Friday last week-a determination or recommendations as to the basis on which the problem in Cairns must be resolved and by which the work force has to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect to have that in my hands this week. But, hopefully, the parties with which discussions are now being held will reach some accommodation themselves to resolve the difficulty. I am aware of at least half a dozen proposals around but all of them have proved to be deficient in one area or another. It has now got to the point where if the negotiation that is currently under way fails, the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, as I have said, will make a determination or recommendation to me about what should happen at Cairns, and that will be implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was talking about the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report in respect of union coverage in small ports. That recommendation was to the effect that the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) should-voluntarily, I might add-withdraw its union coverage from small ports. That was one of only two recommendations in the entire ISC report that the Government did not accept. The Government's waterfront reform program is based in its entirety on the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald made an observation that one of the reasons why the antipathy was directed towards the WWF in the port of Cairns by the Cairns Port Authority board was that the WWF had caused all the problems and that that was exactly why the Inter-State Commission had recommended that it should withdraw its coverage from Cairns. Even scant reference to the ISC's report indicates that that is not the case at all. The recommendation that the ISC did make in respect of small ports goes to the very heart of why the Government did not see the recommendation, as industrially naive as I must say it was, for the WWF to voluntarily withdraw its coverage from all of the small ports around Australia-it would have been an interesting exercise in defining what a small port was, apart from anything else-as part of the in-principle agreement (IPA). It had nothing whatever to do with the alleged sins of the WWF. In fact, page 222 of the Inter-State Commission report referred to the desirability of having integrated port work forces. It had nothing whatever to do with any particular criticism of the WWF as a union, as asserted by Senator Macdonald. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The concept of an integrated workforce appears particularly relevant to smaller ports, where it is difficult to maintain a balanced workload for both the port authority workforce and the stevedoring workforce. Combination of these two workforces would facilitate much more efficient utilisation of labour and thus improve the longer term viability of the port. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it would. The reason that the Government did not see the need to adopt that recommendation is that the union movement has done that. The situation currently is-certainly at the time the data for this report was collected it was not apparent, but it is now-that the maritime union movement is engaged in a major process of amalgamation of unions which will result in the formation of a single federation of maritime unions representing the majority of the unions that currently represent workers on the waterfront and, indeed, in shipping and in ports. Negotiations are well advanced in that regard. Negotiations between the Seamen's Union of Australia and the WWF have been going on for some years. Not only have those negotiations been expedited; the Australian Council of Trade Unions has formally moved in recent times to make a section 118 application to the Industrial Relations Commission for such an amalgamation to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, at the same time the inevitable will happen-rationalisation of the awards, which the Inter-State Commission also talked about as a prerequisite to having an effective integrated work force concept in ports. I made some criticism of that particular Inter-State Commission recommendation at the time as being industrially naive, and I do not withdraw from that. There would be the prospect of negotiating an in-principle agreement with, as part of the conditions upon which that agreement was negotiated, the voluntary removal of union coverage from a whole host of small ports around Australia where the union has had that coverage since the year dot. Expecting to have been able to successfully negotiate the IPA, as happened, with that as a prerequisite would have placed a formidable barrier in the front of the negotiation of that in-principle agreement-in fact, it would have prevented its negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not the relevant issue, as I said before. The relevant issue is that the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission for the WWF voluntarily to withdraw coverage from all small ports around Australia had nothing whatever to do with any suggestions about it causing all the trouble in small ports; it had to do with the sensible suggestion of the Inter-State Commission to establish integrated port work forces in smaller ports and is a process which the union movement itself is now advancing with some considerable effort in regard to both the rationalisation of the awards and the amalgamation of all maritime unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised-and I learn every day-to hear the explanation of the Minister. Certainly the Inter-State Commission report recommended:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Waterside Workers Federation should enter into in-principle agreement for withdrawal of its coverage in ports where integrated workforces are established.</PARA>
<PARA>I understood the reason for that to be that the Waterside Workers Federation would only work on certain projects on the waterfront. In the Cairns instance in particular, the idea was to have an integrated work force which would do some stevedoring work, some gardening work and possibly some chauffeuring work-all different sorts of manual work on the waterfronts. The Waterside Workers Federation would not allow its members to do that; it wanted its members to deal with their own particular trades. That has been one of the causes of the high costs of operating the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian Workers Union (AWU), which is a very potent force in Queensland Labor politics, was quite happy to take over the whole integrated work force at the Cairns Port Authority. I understand that the Waterside Workers Federation, naturally, did not want to be pushed out, but the AWU was quite happy to take over this integrated work force at the Cairns Port Authority. It seemed to all involved, including the Inter-State Commission, that that was the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather surprising to me that the Government has accepted, as I understand the Minister to say, all of the recommendations bar two, and this is one of them. I wonder whether that has anything to do with the connections between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with its influence on the Government. Has the Government been pressured into doing something in relation to the Cairns Port Authority which, as the Minister acknowledges, will be seen by many as a precedent for all of the smaller and regional ports around the country? It would seem surprising to me that the Government should accept all bar two recommendations, of which this is one-one which has some influence in dealing with some of its mates in the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly at the moment the parties in Cairns are looking at another proposal but I understand from most of the parties that that is a second choice that they have been more or less forced into by reason of the fact that the recommendation made by the Inter-State Commission has not been accepted by the Government. I suspect that they are the facts of the matter and the reason many people see the reform of the waterfront as a Claytons reform in many respects which does not go to the root of the problem which the Inter-State Commission identified. In the same vein, I ask the Minister when the redundancies are expected to take effect in the Cairns Port area and how those redundancy payments are to be made and funded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A little knowledge certainly is a dangerous thing. As I have just explained, I find Senator Macdonald's assertions about special relationships or connections between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (WWF) as opposed to the Australian Workers Union (AWU) not only startling in their ignorance, but also amusing from a personal point of view. I have served on the national executive of the Australian Labor Party for five years and, at most meetings, I sat alongside my factional colleague and good friend Errol Hodder, who is the General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. I find it extremely amusing to be accused of having some special arrangement with Tas Bull and the waterside, as opposed to the AWU; nevertheless, if Senator Macdonald--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was just a nonsensical assertion, with respect; it was absolute nonsense. I accused the Inter-State Commission of being industrially naive. Senator Macdonald would have to join that club with a vengeance. To say that the AWU was happy at the prospect of taking over the membership of the WWF, as if this were some sort of commendation or some surprising concession on the part of the AWU, is breathtaking. Of course the AWU would be delighted to have the WWF walk into the negotiating room for the in-principle agreements and voluntarily, before the negotiations had even begun, relinquish the union coverage it has had for half a century or longer over members scattered in small ports across Australia. To not expect the AWU to be delighted with that arrangement is breathtaking. I have no doubt that Errol Hodder, being the consummate union leader that he is, would be more than delighted to take over union membership of every other union in the country if such an opportunity presented itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason the Government did not proceed to adopt the two recommendations-one relating to union coverage and the other relating to stand-down provisions-was that in the first instance it was, correctly, in the view of the Government, industrially naive to believe that the WWF would voluntarily relinquish such coverage and, secondly, it was unnecessary in any case because a major reform movement was under way, of which we were well aware, within the union movement itself to provide the very rationalisation that the Inter-State Commission was seeking that can apply to the small ports.</PARA>
<PARA> For the advice of Senator Macdonald, there is no reluctance on the part of the stevedoring work force in Cairns to perform other duties; that is not the difficulty at all. Not only have the workers communicated this fact to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, or whoever else cared to listen to them, but they have personally communicated it to me in meetings that I have had with them in Cairns. They have no objection whatever to working in the port authority, doing all the tasks to which Senator Macdonald referred. What they did object to-I think understandably enough-was the proposition that their union, as a union, should be removed from the port. I do not think that that was ever conducive to getting the matter resolved by negotiation, and that has proven to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of redundancies, I reassert what I said to Senator Macdonald before the suspension of the sitting. A series of meetings were held last week by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority between Northern Shipping and Stevedoring, the unions, the port authority, I believe, and other parties interested in the Cairns issue. Those meetings are continuing this week to see whether there can be some resolution by agreement. If not, then the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority will move to make recommendations about the arrangements that should operate in Cairns, even if that is only on an interim basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister, I will be perfectly happy to accept an interim solution, pending the resolution through the Industrial Relations Commission-which is where it will be determined in the end-of the question of union coverage and award restructuring which the Commission will oversight. That will occur some time this week. If that is finally what happens-if it cannot be resolved amicably or by discussion-as soon as that resolution is implemented, the excess workers will be removed as quickly as possible from the port of Cairns.</PARA>

On checking, I found out that section 1.2, the section that I wanted to speak on, was covered by Senator Kernot's reservation. However, I will leave the ALOP at the moment because the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has said that we can have a discussion later about some fears I have for Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to ask a couple of questions on section 1.7, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The Minister might remember that during Estimates committee hearings I asked what measures CAA takes to make sure that pilots adhere to the strict conditions of abstinence from drinking alcohol so many hours before flying. What led me to asking this question again was a report in the New York Times of 27 October 1990, which someone posted to me. It pointed out that three American pilots from Northwest Airlines Inc. were suspended and, in fact, imprisoned for flying when drunk, with various amounts of alcohol in their blood. At the trial the pilots argued that because the 40-minute flight was uneventful the alcohol they drank did not make them incapable of flying. That was a peculiar defence. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the situation in Australia, I again ask the Minister whether he is looking to ensure that the pilots adhere to these conditions, given that deregulation will bring about more airlines starting up and the employment of more pilots. I am concerned that a case similar to that which happened in America does not happen in Australia. While the conditions under which pilots fly in the United States may be stressful, I do not think they can be too different from those in Australia. As I and many other honourable senators are frequent fliers, I would like to think that these conditions prohibiting pilots from flying within a certain time after the consumption of alcohol will be enforced strictly in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Panizza's question is that the aviation medicine branch of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is evaluating the federal aviation administration legislation regarding drugs and alcohol in the aviation industry recently introduced into the United States. The same unit of the CAA is actively perusing developments in similar legislation in Europe and the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For Senator Panizza's advice, a special committee is considering the screening of HIV positive people in the aviation industry. This committee consists of representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority's aviation medicine branch, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the airline industry employees' unions, the airline industry's medical departments, Worksafe Australia and specialists in HIV disease. I know that Senator Panizza has been pursuing this subject of AIDS for some time. I am sure that he will be pleased to hear that the Civil Aviation Authority's medical branch is actively evaluating this legislation both in the United States and Great Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, it is worthy of note that, to the best knowledge of all the people intimately associated with the industry in Australia, alcohol abuse has never in any way been a problem in Australian domestic-or, indeed, international-aviation. Australia's pilots, and the system within which they operate, have a well deserved reputation and they are much in demand as some of the best trained and most competent pilots in the world. As discussion with the CAA and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will confirm to Senator Panizza, alcohol abuse has never been a problem in this industry in Australia. Despite that, the CAA is evaluating the introduction of this legislation in the United States and Great Britain. I will be happy to keep Senator Panizza advised of the outcome of that examination. </PARA>

The Committee of the Whole will note from the report of Estimates Committee E that I have made certain reservations in respect of Telecom Australia's Discovery service and the 0055 service. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) will recall that I raised these matters at the Estimates committee meeting, following which I placed on notice a number of questions in respect of each service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be addressing my remarks to the answers that I have been given and I will be seeking certain clarifications on those answers. I mention to the Minister that I have undertaken a study of this matter, both prior to and after the meeting of the Estimates Committee. At the Estimates Committee and subsequently I was invited to have further discussions with the officers of Telecom and other persons. I was shown nothing but courtesy by the officers of Telecom. I am grateful for their time and for the opportunity to discuss the questions with them in Melbourne. However, I think that you, Mr Chairman, and other senators would agree-indeed, I think I heard Senator Kernot say this earlier-that it is important that these matters are matters of public record, particularly in the areas of expenditure and the operation of public utilities such as Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be asking certain questions of the Minister arising out of the answers that I have been given. I will refer first of all to the questions that I asked on the Discovery service and I will turn to the answer that I was given to question 5. Question 5 was:</PARA>
<PARA>What are the standards for the display of `adult' information on Discovery services?</PARA>
<PARA>When referring to `adult services', I am using the words used by Telecom and Telesoft. We are really talking about computer porn. The question continues:</PARA>
<PARA>When were these `standards' determined? By whom were they determined and upon whose recommendation? What were the standards operating prior to the new standards?</PARA>
<PARA>The response that was given by Telecom was that attachment 2 contains the standards for the display of adult information on Discovery. These standards were based on those followed for Telecom's Viatel service and were agreed to by Telecom's management in March of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Viatel was a service which was developed by Telecom in 1985. The answer I was given to question 5 does not really address the essence of my question. It does go to a number of points in the question, but it does not address the key point, which is: at what stage did Telecom, or Telecom management as it states there, take the view that the communications network of this public institution could be used by porno merchants for the purposes of providing computer porn?</PARA>
<PARA> That was the essence of the question. It is not mentioned here when that decision was made. I am trying to find out when the decision was made. The answer says that the standards were based on those followed for the Telecom Viatel service. We are not told how those standards were developed and when they were agreed to by the Telecom board of directors. I put these questions: at what stage did Telecom develop these standards? Upon what basis were the standards established? Who recommended those standards? Were they adopted by the Telecom board of management? The essential fact I want to get, and I am sure other members of the Committee would be interested to know this, is when the Telecom board of management decided to allow the services of Telecom to be utilised for that purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again it is just a question of a person's approach to the whole question of censorship. Senator Harradine and I decided a long time ago that we did not have the same approach. I am sure that there are as many different approaches to it as there are senators in this room. To answer the honourable senator's question, the position on censorship that accords with my basic view is that determined by Janet Strickland, who was, in fact, used by Telecom Australia as a consultant on this issue and who in fact reported--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. If I could just explain again, all I am doing in this context is to quote Janet Strickland's view of censorship. If Senator Harradine will just bear with me for a minute, I will quote it. Janet Strickland said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is a widely accepted principle in Australia that adults should have the right to choose what they read, see and hear, and such rights and freedoms can be curtailed by the right of children to be protected from harm and/or offence as well as the right of not to be affronted by unsolicited material which the reasonable person would find grossly offensive. </PARA>
<PARA>That particular approach to censorship very largely accords with my own. The answer to Senator Harradine's question is that the particular service that he is talking about is entered into on a closed basis which involves the exchange of this material on a confidential basis from person to person, that is, by consenting adults. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that it is no different, in that sense, from two consenting adults picking up any telephone at any time and exchanging these kinds of messages with each other simply by using the phone. I have no doubt that consenting adults do this on a daily basis. As we are speaking, this is probably being done thousands and thousands of times at this very minute around the world and certainly in Australia. This is done in precisely the same way. It is a closed system which cannot be accessed by anybody just picking up a telephone. It is done between consenting adults. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the question of what Janet Strickland considers to be indecent, et cetera, when we come to 0055 numbers, but the question that I have raised has not been answered. Here is a provision, a condition, for the Discovery service wherein it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A customer shall not use, nor permit any other person to use the Discovery Service:</PARA>
<PARA>a) for sending to any person any message which is offensive or abusive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that I asked not what the Minister's view of censorship was, but what Telecom's view of censorship was. It has refused to tell me in this document. I put the question on notice. I refer to the question that I asked on notice subsequent to the Estimates Committee. It was question number 6, in which I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Does Telecom agree that Clauses 13.46 to 13.51 of the Report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, Volume 1, contain reasonable descriptions of material about which information and advertising are contained in certain `adult' Discovery services? Has Telecom also noted Clauses 3.56 and 3.57 of the abovementioned report?</PARA>
<PARA>The response was:</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to clauses 3.56, 3.57-</PARA>
<PARA>By the way, I asked that question precisely because of clause 5.5, which the Minister has just quoted. We have to find out what Telecom regards as being in its contract as indecent, obscene or of a menacing character. We have to find that out, and that is what I am trying to do now. Telecom did not answer the question. Its response was:</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to clauses 3.56, 3.57, 13.46 to 13.51, Telecom requires through its contract with service providers that any products or services offered by a service provider must comply with all relevant laws in Australia. To this end, adult material such as X-rated video tapes which may not by law be advertised outside the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory are similarly not allowed to be advertised on the Discovery service. Where adult material such as R-rated video tapes can legally be advertised on Discovery neither Telecom nor Telesoft Communications Pty Ltd places itself in the position of moral arbiter in these matters but rather relies upon the existing relevant legislation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom is saying that it is not placing itself as a moral arbiter. But here in the conditions of service it clearly states that:</PARA>
<PARA>A customer shall not use, nor permit any other person to use the Discovery Service:</PARA>
<PARA>a) for sending to any person any message which is offensive or abusive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, a judgment has to be made. What I was trying to find out is precisely what Telecom or whoever it is-and I will come back to that question because this matter has never been determined by the board of management of Telecom-regards as beyond the pale. That is what I am trying to ascertain. I point out that that matter really has to be answered here tonight because it is a matter which needs to be answered lest we allow a precedent to have been established and allow Telecom or anybody else to get away with that precedent.</PARA>
<PARA> When I say `anybody else', I am referring also to other players that may come into the provision of Telecom services in Australia. We are not just dealing with Telecom at the present moment; we are dealing with precedents that are being established and which stem in an atmosphere of privatisation and `cut-throat' competition. I want to have an answer to my question No. 6. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I was a little puzzled is that Telecom Australia officers assure me that Senator Harradine was in fact provided with a copy of the guidelines for the standards of display of adult information on Discovery. Indeed, I have discovered it, attached as an attachment to the report of Estimates Committee E, `Additional Information Received Volume 2'. It is actually there at attachment 2. That lays out the guidelines. The attachment is headed, `Standards for the Display of Adult Information on Discovery'. It is marked, `Attachment 2 to the Estimates Committee: Additional Information Received Volume 2'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to that set of guidelines, judgments are again made by the senior management of the organisation as to whether material that is used on this service contravenes these guidelines, which are in accordance with section 5.5 of the contract just referred to. But there they are. I am sorry if the honourable senator does not have a copy of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever turns the honourable senator on. But I cannot help him apart from that. He says that he has not been given an answer as to the standards that are set. These are the standards that are set and they are provided in this set of guidelines for that purpose. The decisions are taken by senior management of Telecom so that, where material is to do with prohibited matters-such as child sex or offensive material in the sense that it is violent or threatening-action can be taken to remove it from the service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am again struggling to find out what the point at issue is but I assume it is the word `indecent'. I guess again it is just a matter for subjective judgment. If two people want to make suggestions to each other over the telephone-no doubt thousands do every day-which the honourable senator may consider indecent or, indeed, any other third party may consider indecent, that may be the case. But I stress again that this service can only be accessed by consenting adults. It is not a service that is available to anybody that picks up a telephone. It is a private service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me deal first of all with the red herring that the Minister is throwing across our path about individuals being able to pick up the telephone and speak to each other individually about anything. That has no relationship at all with the provision by Telecom of a service from which hard-core porn merchants can make money. There is no comparison. We have here Telecom acting as the publisher and agent for hard-core porn merchants in the computer porn area. I think I have asked a legitimate question. I did not ask tonight what the standards were because I have them. The office of Telecom provided them to me and I had them in any event prior to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what I did ask was the relationship of 5.5. That was a matter that the Minister himself raised. Now he says that 5.5 is covered by the standards that apply. I am not going to read out to the Committee the provisions relating to the guidelines for material that can be included in this. The Minister has them himself. Telecom has them. What I want to ask is whether they consider that any of those are obscene or indecent. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then arises: if Telecom is able to make that judgment, why did it respond to me by saying that it is not in the business of making a moral judgment? It is in the contract. Some sort of judgment has to be made about it one way or the other. What I am trying to ascertain is upon what basis was the judgment made that Telecom can be used as a publisher and agent for the hard-core porn merchants. I might just say that the response to question 6 included this:</PARA>
<PARA>To this end adult materials such as X-rated video tapes which may not by law be advertised outside the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory are similarly not allowed to be advertised on the Discovery Service.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me go to the official Telecom document that is put out by Discovery service which relates specifically to this material:</PARA>
<PARA>Other adult entertainment services including on-line ordering of X-rated, non-violent erotic videos through the Mature Media Group Orgy Board and Australia's first adult electronic mail.</PARA>
<PARA>Who are we to believe-the official handout of Telecom, or indeed the answer to question No. 6? It might be said that this is another matter. Of course it is another matter, but it shows the deficiencies in the area. </PARA>

I apologise to the Committee for the time it has taken me to get Senator Harradine the most accurate information I can get him on a subject on which I am happy to concede publicly-and did-that I am not an expert. I am not the responsible Minister, as Senator Harradine knows full well; Mr Beazley is. I do not claim to be an expert or to have the level of expertise-as I said before the quorum call-that Senator Harradine has on this subject, and his legitimate interest in it. I have already discovered-and the Committee will have noted it-that the basis for one of Senator Harradine's objections prior to the quorum call is substantiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I apologise to the Committee for the length of time it is taking to get advice on this very detailed matter, on which I do not claim to be an expert. Despite the constant interjections from opposite that provoked that exchange prior to the quorum call, I say again, if I could just speak over the rabble opposite, that Senator Harradine's concern is in fact apparently legitimate. The document that he referred to was published, and I am told by Telecom that it should not have been. I am further advised that in respect of the matters complained of by Senator Harradine, the only 0055 phone service which I use is phonebank. To get into this area of Discovery one requires the same access conditions-that is, a special identification delivered over the computer to allow the person at the other end of the computer to be identified. In other words, the ordering of videos, which no doubt occurs on a one-to-one basis, is done on that basis. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act prevents access to that communication, and quite rightly. Therefore, no-one is able, on that one-to-one basis, to know what transpires. As I said before, it is exactly the same situation with a person who chooses to use the telephone numbers currently available in the Australian Capital Territory and perhaps even the Northern Territory, although I think mainly in the ACT, to order videos; it is a private accessed system, which is not available for public scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am now totally confused. I am trying to get an answer as to who is responsible. I apologise for this, but the responses have come in since the Estimates Committee hearings. The Minister knows the situation in that respect. An answer was given to my question No. 5 about the establishment of standards. My question No. 5 was: what are the standards; by whom were they determined; and what were the standards operating prior? That is the guts of it. The question I asked relates to who determined the standards. The answer states that the standards were based on those followed for Telecom's Viatel service and were agreed to by Telecom management in March 1990. I acknowledge that Senator Collins is not the Minister responsible; Mr Beazley is the Minister. The answer I have here states that Telecom management in March 1990 decided that these were the standards which were appropriate for the Discovery service. Telecom management, presumably, does not mean the board of Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would have thought that in a matter of such importance as this the board of management should have been fully apprised of the situation and should have been the one to make that decision. The reason I say that is that it has implications for the question of pay television. As we know, Telecom is very anxious to be a player in pay television, and if the situation is allowed to develop whereby Telecom is allowed to establish a precedent that this sort of material can be pushed through onto computers and into the homes of Australia, the same precedent could be used for pay television. That is one of the major concerns to which I was alluding in those particular questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Following on from what Senator Newman has asked, I think it is important to clarify this situation. Has the board of management of Telecom decided that the Discovery service should carry this material? As I said before, I am not going to read out what type of material it is. I think honourable senators ought to have a look for themselves at what type of material we are talking about. It is material that is not only in bad taste but also of a nature with which we have been dealing for a number of years. A number of honourable senators around this chamber know what type of material it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I return to the question which I asked and which really has not been answered: what is the view of the Telecom board about clauses 3.56, 3.57 and 13.46 to 13.51 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Video Material? We are talking about material that is contained in those paragraphs, and Telecom has not given us an answer to that question. I really want an answer to that question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a nutshell, I think Telecom's view would be enunciated in the guidelines that have been provided, and that is that consenting adults have a right to read and see what they wish, provided they do not do so in an unsolicited way and that protections are built into the system to prevent this material from being accessed by people who are not entitled to get it. That is the answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to who makes the decision-and I do now see the thrust of Senator Harradine's argument on this matter in respect of the board of management of Telecom-my advice is that the decisions are taken by senior management in Telecom. I understand that management comprises two men and a woman-the General Manager of the electronic information and transaction service, who is a level 4 SES officer; the Managing Director of Telesoft Communications Pty Ltd; and the Database Management Officer, who is an ASO level 6 up to an SES level 1. They are the individuals in the organisation who make these judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the officers who are present whether any consideration had been given to even a general or periodic review of the application of these judgments by the board of management, and the answer that I was given was no. I am perfectly willing to discuss with the responsible Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, whether such involvement of the board is appropriate. Frankly, I would not suggest that it is practical for the board to be involved on a daily basis in every individual case, as a censorship board would be, but I will discuss with Mr Beazley what has transpired in this debate and whether it would be appropriate for the board to play a role in supervising the judgments that are made about this material. </PARA>

Secondly, will the Minister advise the Committee whether the Government supports the guidelines? As far as I could see, they are somewhat inconsistent with the Government's approach to the portrayal of women in the media generally and with women in advertising. In fact, if most women were given their choice, I think they would rather be seen as choosing a soap powder for washing up than in some of the material that is seemingly acceptable under the guidelines for the Discovery service or in the 0055 numbers. So I ask the Minister those two questions.</PARA></TALK.START>

I quite frankly, openly and freely admit that the 0055 service is not an area of particular interest or expertise to me. I have, for the advice of Senator Newman, read all of the material provided to Senator Harradine, cover to cover. Indeed, Senator Harradine, as he quite happily concedes-and that is the purpose of this exercise-is now seeking answers to questions which flow from the information which he has already been given and which I have read.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am doing is providing, question by question, the answers that senators want in respect of the very great detail that has been gone into with this particular service, with which I am not personally familiar. The only service I use that uses a telephone to access is phone-back. I am happy to repeat the undertakings that I just gave, and I would be quite irresponsible to presume to give definitive answers on behalf of the Government in a portfolio area which is not mine. There are fundamental and very sensible rules that apply to that and I am not going to transgress them. I believe the matter is worthy of consideration as to whether the board of management should have regard to these matters. I cannot give the honourable senator an undertaking-as she is seeking-that Telecom will do this, because I am not the Minister responsible for Telecom; Mr Beazley is. </PARA>

I drew his attention to the fact that he is a Minister in a government which claims not to believe in the exploitation of women. There can be no doubt that these services exploit, degrade and use women. If the Government is to be consistent with what it claims is its policy, how is it that it allows this? The Minister is a Minister in a government that claims it does not support the exploitation of women, yet it is overseeing a public authority which is allowing that to happen. It is contracting; if you like, it is living off the earnings of immoral income. It is no good for the Minister to hide behind whether it is obscene, whether Minister Beazley has a policy on obscenity or whether it is between consenting adults. I raised a different matter altogether with him, but he would not come to grips with that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not an issue because adults are simply not free to read and view a whole range of material. In short, adults are not free to read or view anything that is not published. The question really boils down to whether Telecom Australia has the approval of the Government to act as publisher of this material. If we are being fair dinkum about it, that is the question. I ask the Minister to put that question to the board of Telecom and to ask whether it approves of the classification of guidelines which is contained in Attachment 3 to the answers that were given to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the board of management agree that this material should be published over its networks? Does the board of Telecom agree that this public instrumentality should be used as a publisher of this material? The question that needs to be raised with the Minister, Mr Beazley, is whether he believes that the services of Telecom should be used to publish this material on a commercial basis, as it is. I leave aside for a moment the question of private discussions between individual subscribers. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I raised the questions is that it is clear to me from the material that is provided to me by Telecom that the board of directors have not been involved in this. I may not be reading everything correctly but that seems to me to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to me that the board of Telesoft Communications Pty Ltd, which is not the board of Telecom, has been making the decisions. If we want, we can have our differences of opinion on various issues, but we want to get clear what Telecom's views are because a precedent is being established here and if that precedent is allowed to go through, it will be inconsistent with the statements that have been made by the current Minister, Mr Beazley, in respect at least of pay television. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on Discovery, I want to ask one more question which the Minister can take on notice if he wishes: does condition 5.5 relate to what a service provider can place on the Discovery database or does it bind only the consumer? Who is the consumer in this case? Is it the subscriber, is it the service provider, or is it both? Is it possible for Telecom to direct that service providers not include material that is offensive or abusive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already, in response to Senator Newman, answered one part of Senator Harradine's question. As he quite correctly says, it is a matter for the responsible Minister to put the Government's position. The information that I am given, and which I have previously given, is that it appears that the board of Telecom Australia has not had an involvement in this matter. Senator Harradine's assumption appears to be correct. I will raise that question with the responsible Minister, and I repeat the undertaking that I will discuss with Minister Beazley the concerns that have been raised by honourable senators in this debate and put to him whether it is appropriate for the board of Telecom to be involved. On the advice I am given, apparently Senator Harradine's assumption is correct and the board has not been involved. Secondly, I will ask Mr Beazley, as I have already given an undertaking to do, what the Government's position is on these guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the last question that Senator Harradine asked-which I can answer now, but Senator Harradine will probably seek some further documented information on this, which no doubt will be made available to him-the contract for the customer is a standard contract because it applies to all of the customers of the service, but the contracts between the company and the service providers vary from service to service. The answer to Senator Harradine's question is that I am advised those contracts contain a clause in similar terms to condition 5.5 in respect of Customs which prohibits the service providers from providing this kind of material and can be enforced if that provision is breached. </PARA>

There is concern on this side of the chamber about an apparent ruling or lack of a ruling given by the Chair prior to your return to the chair on this occasion. The Minister apparently said to those on this side of the chamber that they should `piss off'. I would have thought that that was clearly unparliamentary and that he would have been asked to withdraw and, hopefully, apologise. It seems that it was either decided by the Chair that it was not unparliamentary, which is vitally important if it is to be used as a precedent in the Senate that such language is not unparliamentary or, alternatively-this is the confusion-that the Chair failed to rule at all. I wonder whether, in your position as Chairman of Committees, you could rule on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect, I think the sensible way of dealing with this matter, whether it is the orderly way or not, is to indicate that such language is clearly unparliamentary.

It is his task as Temporary Chairman of the Committee to preserve order in the chamber as would normally be done by the President in the Senate proper. He tried to discharge that duty, and I believe that the matter ought to be regarded as concluded. As I understand it, under standing order 145, if there were any objection to his dealing with the matter in the way that he did at that stage, then the matter should have been submitted to the Chair in writing and dealt with.

I found it absolutely impossible to hear either what they were saying or what Senator Harradine was saying, because of the non-stop interjections of both Senator Newman and Senator Walters. It did not stop for 10 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it very difficult. It is one thing to interject constantly during a second reading debate-that is fine-but it is another thing in the committee stage of the Appropriation Bill. The questions are very complex and technical, and it is very frustrating, when trying to provide information which has been hastily scribbled down or spoken to me, to have non-stop and very loud interjections coming from the other side of the chamber to the point where I literally cannot hear what is being said to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that Senator Aulich was absolutely correct in saying that it was very noisy indeed on both sides of the chamber. The position that he took on it was understandable, in my view. In conclusion, I say again that the issue can be resolved very quickly indeed because I unreservedly and unconditionally withdraw. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I respectfully submit to you a previous ruling made by a President of this Senate on 31 October 1967. It was a ruling of President Sir Alister McMullin. He ruled on a matter that Senator Tate has raised. Senator Hill suggested that either there was a ruling that the words were in order or that there was no ruling at all. Senator Tate then said, quite correctly, that there was a third possibility, which was that the words were not heard by the Chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I submit this paragraph of President Sir Alister McMullin's ruling, which I believe is of relevance and is, of course, no slight at all upon the previous Deputy Chairman. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> As a working rule, the Chair will always intervene when unparliamentary language is used. But, as honourable senators know, expressions which may be ruled out of order in Parliament cover a wide range. The Chair is often required to make very quick decisions regarding these expressions. If through circumstances at the time quick decisions cannot be made, or a disorderly expression is used which may not be heard by the Chair but which is recorded in Hansard, I think it serves the dignity of the chamber that the Chair should take the first opportunity of informing the Senate of those expressions which will be disallowed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 161 of Australian Senate Practice by J. R. Odgers it is noted that both the then Leader of the Government, Senator Gorton, and the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Murphy, made statements agreeing with the President's statement. Accordingly, I very humbly submit to you, Mr Chairman, that this is an appropriate opportunity for you to make a ruling to ensure that we do not create an unseemly precedent in this chamber and, even if Senator Tate is correct, it still does not invalidate your ruling that the words in question are unparliamentary. </PARA>

It seems to me that under normal circumstances the words which have been alleged to have been used would not have been in Hansard because, at that time, a quorum was being called so, technically, the Senate would not be in session and the words would not be recorded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as that, there is some doubt whether the words would be recorded in Hansard anyway, because they were interjections, and all interjections are disorderly. Like many other honourable senators, I was not in the chamber at the time, but I was watching the proceedings on television and saw most of what occurred. I will quite categorically say that if those words were said in this chamber they were disorderly-in fact, I would probably call them grossly disorderly. At the time the Temporary Chairman tried to call both sides to order because apparently interjections were coming from both sides. I do not want to indicate whether there were more interjections from one side or the other, but they came from both sides of the chamber. He attempted to call the chamber to order. I am not aware whether he heard the interjections, but Senator Collins has now said that he has withdrawn those words and I think the matter should rest there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I raise the matter of the 0055 service, I ask the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) whether Telecom Australia could answer the item about who the `adult' service providers were on the Discovery service. The response that Telecom gave was not appropriate. Telecom said that there are instances where certain service providers have specific industry applications that are not accessible by general users and that in these cases Telecom has an agreement that their identity remains commercial-in-confidence. That response does not suggest that Telecom has commercial-in-confidence agreements with these people. If it has, there is nothing much we can do about it, but I ask that that be taken on notice. In so far as answers can be given, they should be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I want to know, and I think the Senate ought to know, is that the officials of Telesoft Communications Pty Ltd-not the board of Telecom- are at present negotiating with some of these service providers to take over the adult Discovery service. If that occurs, there will be no control over the service at all. We ought to be kept informed about what is happening in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the question of 0055 and go to the answers that have been provided to me by Telecom in regard to 0055. There have been some answers given, but there are some which need clarification. First, I will deal with the question of the appointment of Janet Strickland. In response to people who have asked about this question, Telecom has written letters over the signature of Mr S.M. Fish, Manager External Relations Corporate Secretariat. One letter says that Telecom is currently reviewing its contracts with 0055 service providers and has enlisted the assistance of a respected independent consultant to revise standards relating to 0055 message content and advertising. In question 9, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>When did Telecom first decide to review Telecom's 0055 message content and advertising standards? What specifically gave rise to that decision? Have there been complaints from `adult' service providers about 0055 operational requirements or about any Telecom restrictions on message content? If so, what service providers made the complaints, when were they made and what were the nature of these complaints?</PARA>
<PARA>That question has not been adequately answered. I then asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA>What amounts have been paid and are budgeted to be paid to Janet Strickland and Associates for the work performed or to be performed on revising standards relating to 0055 message content and advertising? When is this work likely to be completed? What procedures are then to be followed by Telecom and by the Government. Were advertisements placed or tenders called for that consultancy? When was the decision made to appoint Janet Strickland and Associates for this consultancy?</PARA>
<PARA>The answers to these questions are totally inadequate, as one will see. The answer to question 10 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The contracted sum to be paid by Telecom to Janet Strickland and Associates for preparation of the Discussion Paper and Final Report is confidential. The Discussion Paper was released in June 1990 and the Final Report which contains recommendations will be released in October. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is: why is this confidential? Questions about consultancies are often asked in Estimates. Surely the public is entitled to know what consultants are being paid, and what they are being paid to do, by government instrumentalities and authorities such as this. That is what we are all about. It is extraordinary that this is not forthcoming. The response goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The commissioning of Janet Strickland and Associates arose from the extensive experience and skills of its principal, Mrs Janet Strickland, to undertake a review of 0055 services. Mrs Strickland is a founding member of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, a former Chief Commonwealth Film Censor and has acted as a consultant to the Film, Video and Television industries since 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>It then states:</PARA>
<PARA>The opinion within Telecom was that the calling of tenders would have been unlikely to attract an organisation with a consultant equivalent to the calibre of Mrs Strickland. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know whether Telecom had regard to the consultancies that Janet Strickland has had in the area. Did they know of her views about these situations and her statements? In the Sydney Morning Herald of 24 June 1986 Mrs Strickland is quoted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the greater government interference would occur through the appointment to the Film Censorship Board and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of people ``with predictably conservative social views and through more restrictive censorship legislation''. </PARA>
<PARA>An industry paper called Freeze Frame of 1 April 1987, under the heading `Censorship Under Scrutiny', states:</PARA>
<PARA>In what appears to be part of a continuing trend towards conservatism, it is expected that the recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on censorship matters will be the tightening of theatrical and video ratings, especially the `R' certificate. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Committee is due to be handed to the government at any time and has prompted swift action by the Film and Video Coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition, a group of film distributors and exhibitors, television program distributors and video distributors met recently to discuss the common concern. It has established a fighting fund to mount an industry and public awareness campaign aimed at maintaining the present guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Janet Strickland, chairperson of the Film and Video Coalition and former chief censor, has been working with the Lintas advertising agency to formulate a major campaign, ``to oppose moves by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to tighten guidelines.'' Strickland adds that the guidelines ``have already been amended twice and we see no reason to make further restrictions.''</PARA>
<PARA>I could give a number of other quotations on her preconceived views about this question, and here is Telecom appointing her to do a survey of 0055 standard and message content in response to public concern about the material-if we are to believe Telecom-which is being published by Telecom in the interests of sexploit profiteers. I would like to know whether Telecom knew of that publicly expressed attitude of Janet Strickland. Does Telecom realise what is involved in the final report of Janet Strickland in regard to the 0055 service, and particularly what Janet Strickland believes to be material that is grossly offensive?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the first part of Senator Harradine's question, I am advised that the review was prompted by two things: direct representation from members of the public to Telecom regarding the 0055 service and a court case involving a company called Omnicall in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the other detail that Senator Harradine is seeking-that is, whether Telecom had regard to or considered Janet Strickland's previous involvement-personally I do not know whether it did or not, but I will inquire. I must say that I would be amazed if it did not; and I assume that it was, in fact, her background and her considerable and significant involvement in censorship that were directly responsible for Telecom going to her as someone with expertise in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that a reading of her final report and recommendations shows that it does not set the standards. In fact, it lays out the appropriate mechanism to be used for actually determining them. I am not quite sure whether any of the positions that Janet Strickland has adopted are necessarily relevant to what she has said in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the recommendation she has made about setting the process in place that can in fact be used to assess this material, the chapter headed `Who should set the standards?' deals with this, but the actual report in itself does not make judgments about setting the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the specific question of whether Telecom had regard to her previous experience, I say again that I think common sense would probably dictate that, considering her reputation and her very public profile as a Commonwealth film censor, no doubt it did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to follow that point. The Minister referred to chapter 3 in the final report Setting the Standards. This is the crux of the issue, and this is why I raised the issue about Janet Strickland. Recommendation 1 of that chapter says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That standards be set for telephone information, message content and advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2 says:</PARA>
<PARA>That such standards attempt to give expression to the philosophy that adults should have the maximum freedom to impart and receive information and ideas; that children should not be exposed to messages or advertising which may be harmful to them; and that the public at large should be protected from messages and advertising which, inter alia, is misleading, false or grossly offensive. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on the report looks at the question of establishing a committee. It recommends the setting up of a committee of seven members to be appointed under the auspices of Telecom to set standards for telephone information service message content and advertising. But that committee will be bound by that alleged philosophy of Janet Strickland. The recommendation says:</PARA>
<PARA>That in setting the Telephone Information Service message content and advertising standards, the Committee seek the widest possible range of views within the community; have regard to standards applying in related areas; and in light of the general statement of objectives contained in Recommendation 2 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the committee has its hands tied, and it will be tied to what is, in Janet Strickland's view, grossly offensive. She will be on the committee to give advice to that committee as to what is grossly offensive. I turn to the Hansard transcript of 12 December 1984, when Mrs Strickland appeared before the then Senate Select Committee on Video Material. She is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>That is the obscenity test which we tend not to use. We use the indecency test. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Elstob, as he then was, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Indecency?</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Strickland said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. That is that `which is grossly offensive to the reasonable man'. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on at page 149:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that has to be the answer, that what grossly offends a reasonable person is bestiality, child pornography, incitement to drug abuse, terrorism and sexual violence. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what is being said here is that everything goes except bestiality, child pornography, incitement to drug abuse, terrorism and sexual violence. The question is whether the Telecom board agrees with that. Does the Government agree with that? Let us not get mixed up and confused by these mealy-mouthed statements about adults being free to view what they wish. That is a specious argument. Adults are not free to hear the anti-female propaganda of porn merchants unless it is published. The real issue is whether the Federal Government and the Telecom board should permit Telecom to act, in effect, as the publisher and agent of sexploit profiteers undermining the status of women in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the issue. What I want to ask is whether the Telecom board accepts the view that is expressed by Janet Strickland. Will Telecom appoint her as the arbiter in this area? What is the Government's view about that and the previous matter I raised?</PARA>

Senator Harradine finds it unacceptable and offensive. I daresay that there would be a whole host of people who, if someone else had been chosen to do this review who had adopted a very hard line on Telecom being a censor, would have been equally offended by that proposition. It is impossible to get something in this area that will satisfy everybody. That is absolutely correct. What some people would find offensive and highly disorderly and so on to an old bush boy like me might be just a matter of course.

<PARA> I draw the Minister's attention to the committee of seven that Senator Harradine has been raising with him. The recommendation of Mrs Strickland is that that committee is to set standards not only for the content of the messages but also for the advertising. I am especially concerned that this advertising is in such a public place. Children in any town around Australia can get access to the classified advertisements and the small display ads in newspapers. So I would be very anxious to see what this committee is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I ask the Minister when this committee is to be set up. Also, I would like to have some details about the membership of that committee. The Telecom press release of 26 October 1990 said that Mrs Strickland's recommendation was that it should consist of a representative of Telecom management-I presume there will be no trouble with that; two representatives from the newly formed industry association, the Telecom Service Providers Association of Australia; two representatives from consumer community groups; a telephone information service arbitrator-I presume that means Mrs Strickland; and an independent chairman. So I now ask the Minister: who will be representing the consumer community groups and which groups are they on this committee; who will be the independent chairman; have they been appointed yet and, if not, when?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I am not only interested in the names of the people. I am also interested in the names of the organisations they represent and that will include the groups that have been consulted. One of the recommendations of Mrs Strickland was that Telecom should provide a toll free telephone number to record public complaints and comments on both message and advertising. In recent weeks a number of my constituents have contacted my office about the mechanism for making complaints to Telecom and I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that this is not as easy as it would seem. Mrs Strickland obviously saw the need for a toll free telephone number, presumably to give ready access to citizens who want to complain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have found that in Tasmania, for example, Telecom Launceston refused to take complaints when people phoned their local Telecom office. They were given a Hobart telephone number-that is, a trunk line telephone that was not toll free. When they rang that number, they were then given another number which was toll free and known as the help number. As if it was not difficult enough and nuisance enough to make three calls, they have had to be `quite pushy'-these were the words that have been used to describe it-if they want their complaints recorded as the first answer that they have received from operators is, `Write to the newspapers; it's not Telecom's fault'. If one pushes hard enough, they will take down the complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister: how many people will bother to phone the 008 number after they have already phoned a local number and a trunk line number without success, and when they get a lacklustre or unsympathetic response from the 008 number, which is meant to be a help number? It was designed and set up to assist people with complaints, consistent with the recommendation of Mrs Strickland's committee. </PARA>

I received a letter dated 2 October from the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Ms Fatin, about this matter. She said that Telecom Australia reserved the right to disconnect services that may be offensive, obscene or that are promoted directly to children. If that is so, why has Telecom not moved to disconnect the services which are unquestionably promoted to children or, at the very least, are made available in family newspapers?</PARA></TALK.START>

It goes on and provides numbers. It continues, `No holds barred. Strictly for adults'. That would be an attractive one for a 14-year-old boy. It goes on, `Just ring and listen to the tele-dateline. She's all alone and wants you to call', and it provides other numbers. Those are advertisements in today's Hobart Mercury. I would be perfectly happy to let the Minister have a copy of others that have appeared in other Tasmanian papers over the last weeks. They are small things in the daily papers which are accessible to every home in Australia. Families have been getting $37 amounts added to their telephone bills. Their teenage sons have made use of the phone in this way. What is Telecom doing about it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Newman has rung the numbers in those advertisements so that she can attest to whether this is correct, because I have not, and I do not know. If anything, the advertisements could be criticised for being misleading. The response someone gets when the number is called is so innocuous that it is hardly worth picking up the telephone. The services referred to earlier by Senator Harradine are the services which, as I said before, have to be accessed by adults on a one-to-one basis. In fact, the communication that then occurs on a one-to-one basis is as privileged and as protected as any other private telephone call. In earlier briefings that I had on this 0055 number I received the same information, that is, that these advertisements produce a result far from the suggestion of what they promise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Since the Minister is now asking me the questions, yes I have rung a number of them to see exactly what Telecom is purveying and what it is making its money out of. On the one hand, I agree with him-some of them really should go before the Trade Practices Commission for misleading advertising. On the other hand, a number of them may be somewhat innocuous but they then direct the caller to make other telephone calls. There is a series. If one number is called, one is dared to call `Strictly for Adults'. One then gets heavy breathing and a girl suggesting that the caller ring Philippa, who offers one sort of thing. She offers another girl who will give a tongue fetish or something. And so it goes on. I have my own transcripts of some of these, and I do not find them suitable for teenagers or for pre-pubescent children. I think that most mothers in Australia, if they took the trouble to ring some of these numbers, would be appalled by how readily accessible they are to their children. Telecom tells people, `We can bar your telephone if you like'. That is fine, except that one bars a home telephone from a whole page of information services which one may not wish to have barred. This will still enable a child to go down the road to the public telephone box or have a giggle and make a naughty call on a neighbour's telephone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that is the answer and, as Ms Fatin said in her letter to me, Telecom reserves the right to disconnect the services that are offensive, obscene or promoted directly to children. If some of those telephone numbers-by no means all, but some-are being advertised directly into a family home, they should be disconnected by Telecom and I cannot understand its lack of action. I am particularly concerned in the committee to see what the guidelines will be. Senator Harradine has already expressed his concerns about the way in which they will be implemented, but I am also very concerned about the consumer groups which will be members of that committee and will be trying to have some action taken. Clearly, Telecom has not seen fit to exercise the right it apparently already has to disconnect these services. Anybody who takes the trouble to ring some of them would realise the truth of what I am saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to not accessing these services, I had only two concerns about the 0055 service when it was first introduced. The first was that it was available to all telephones. The second was that there was no distinction in terms of the accounts that were rendered for calls made to 0055. I, no doubt along with many others, took up both of those issues with Telecom Australia. It responded very quickly and introduced an arrangement-I had this done in respect of my own telephone-where a 0055 bar was available to the consumer at no cost simply by the consumer requesting it. At that stage, never having heard of the Discovery service or any of the associated services, I did not have any concerns about my son ringing the services that were provided to find out about impotence, frigidity, masturbation and the various other things that were advertised in television advertisements. He is welcome to do that any time he likes. I did have some concerns about his ringing the service which provides a recording of the latest No. 1 pop hit over the telephone at STD rates from Darwin. I was not particularly enthused about that happening. I approached Telecom with respect to the bar and Telecom responded. The same service is available to anyone who wants it. Simply by request, people can have a bar put on their telephone to stop access to the 0055 service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second built-in protection that also exists is that all charges to 0055 are separated on consumers' accounts so that their telephone accounts will immediately indicate whether anyone has been using the telephone for these services. With regard to accessing in other people's houses telephones which have the 0055 service still connected, I am on very familiar ground. Again, this is an argument which one could pursue to the nth degree in respect of access to other homes which have video cassette recorders, for example, whilst other families choose-I know such families-not to have access to videos in their own homes. It is very difficult-it is hardly a new problem; everyone has it, including me-to ensure that one's children never speak, see, hear or associate with thoughts, words, deeds or people that one would prefer them not to. It is very difficult to prevent that from occurring, even with the best system in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, people who do want to be barred from the system can organise that with great ease. As a further guard, if anyone is accessing the system that appears separately on an account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do. The answer to the honourable senator's question is that there are hundreds and hundreds of telephone numbers that provide innocuous information. When this was discussed at length in the Committee, I think I said that after an initial flirtation with 0055 the novelty wore off. After I had heard the joke of the day, the joke of the week, found out how to kill cockroaches, found out how to plant various shrubs in my back yard, found out about impotency, masturbation, frigidity and so on, which were the early services that were provided on this system, I lost interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I wish the Minister had simply acknowledged that because, by offering to have one's phone barred, Telecom is hardly providing a solution to the problem. There is a relatively small number of these services that are objectionable, and to have one's phone barred in order to keep one's family from accessing those services is taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some weeks ago I attended a conference on Senate committees and responsible government held in this Parliament House. The conference marked the twentieth anniversary of Senate standing committees. It was excellently organised and I would like to congratulate the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Evans, and his staff for organising such an interesting and valuable conference. A number of first-term senators attended the seminar and I am sure that all of us found it most stimulating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Governor-General, Mr Hayden, spoke to the conference dinner. His remarks on the lack of community knowledge of Parliament and our Constitution are the basis of the remarks I wish to make this evening. The Governor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would be nice to hope that one day Australians may grow up with the same passionate conviction about their Constitution, their history and their political institutions as people in the United States have in theirs. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Governor-General. One reason there is such a passionate conviction among the United States public for their political system is, I believe, that both sides of politics there join together to honour their history, their great historical figures and their political institutions. Democrats and Republicans alike remember the Founding Fathers of the American Constitution, celebrate together most of the great events in their history, and honour the symbols of their nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be said that at least one side of Australian politics-the Australian Labor Party (ALP)-is at best equivocal about some of the fundamental aspects of our political system; for example, the desirability of upper Houses and, indeed, the role of the Governor-General. I am not without hope that some of our more irascible Labor colleagues may come to have a greater affection for a system of which they are, after all, major beneficiaries. When one witnesses the enthusiasm with which the ALP in New South Wales is using the upper House there to defeat industrial legislation which would repeal some trade union privileges, one realises that it is possible we may see some stronger support from the ALP for upper Houses in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason why the public lack, in the Governor-General's words, `passionate conviction' about their political institutions is that parliamentarians themselves seem to care so little about their forebears and their contribution to building our political system. I illustrate this point by pointing to some serious omissions amongst the historical paintings on display in this Parliament House. Often the pieces on display are placed in areas that are not particularly prominent. The founders of our great Federation receive barely a mention. However, if it were not for the energies of individuals such as Sir Henry Parkes, Sir Samuel Griffith, Alfred Deakin, Andrew Clark, Sir Edmund Barton, Sir Richard Baker and Charles Kingston, the Commonwealth of Australia would not exist. Parkes, Deakin and Griffith are key figures in Australian history, as Jefferson, Franklin and Washington are in American history. I suspect that Australians know more about the founders of America than those of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Constitution of Australia has stood the test of time and has been described as providing the basis for one of the most successful federations in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that when members and senators of the 1920s decorated their Parliament House they gave great prominence to famous Australians in King's Hall. The sculptor Montford was commissioned to make eight reliefs, which were inserted into the pillars in King's Hall. The eight great people were: Sir Samuel Griffith, the main draftsman of our Constitution and the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia; the Earl of Hopetoun, the first Governor-General; Sir Richard Baker, the first President of the Senate; Sir Henry Parkes, who is frequently referred to as the father of Federation; William Wentworth, statesman and campaigner for representative and responsible government in New South Wales; Sir Frederick Holder, the first Speaker of the House of Representatives; Sir Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister; and Sir George Reid, the first Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Only two of these famous men, Sir Henry Parkes and Sir Edmund Barton, have been honoured by the parliamentarians of the 1980s in their Parliament House. Certainly, portraits of the first Prime Minister of this country, Edmund Barton, and a notable second Labor Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, hang on the wall above the stairs from the Main Committee Room foyer where they can be seen by a judicious craning of the neck. As yet there is no sign of Australia's great federalist and second Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. Neither is there any sign of John Christian Watson, famous for being not only Australia's first Labor Prime Minister-if one excludes Premier Dawson's brief seven days in Queensland-but the first Labor Prime Minister in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor colleagues should be concerned that the official portraits of the first Labor President of the Senate, Henry Turley, and the first Labor Speaker, Charles MacDonald, have ended up in the Department of Administrative Services storehouse in Fyshwick. The portrait by the well-known artist Joshua Smith of Sir William McKell, the distinguished Labor politician and former Governor-General, has also ended up in storage. By contrast, in the foyer of the Main Committee Room we have been able to find space for the very large contemporary paintings No by John Brack and Movement Nine by Roger Kemp. </PARA>
<PARA> The coming together of the six Australian States to form a federation is a remarkable story and is the real foundation on which this Parliament House is built. I think it is a great pity that the story of Federation is not marked by a permanent display in this Parliament House. I am aware, of course, that a number of temporary displays have been prepared and others are in the planning stage. From what I have seen the Senate staff has done an excellent job with displays. The Senate has already commenced a series of short term exhibitions entitled Towards Federation, which will be held during this decade to mark the milestones of Federation. This would be an appropriate time to consider a more permanent display. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, some interesting items in this Parliament House-the relics from Westminster, symbolising our links to the mother of parliaments, and the Aboriginal petitions attract considerable interest from members of the public. Perhaps the two most important documents-an original Magna Carta and the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act-are of immense value but in my view could be better displayed and better explained. </PARA>
<PARA> The displays in the public area above the Members' Hall are of interest but far too limited for the range of visitors coming into this building. I invite my colleagues to walk around the public areas of Parliament House and note the lack of historical and institutional material on display. I further ask them to note that there is a great deal of area which could be utilised for permanent historical displays. Indeed, we seem to find room for a variety of temporary displays by outside bodies, doubtless with their own intrinsic merit but of little relevance to Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Any examination of the private corridors would reveal vast areas which would certainly benefit from tasteful and well displayed institutional photographs. What has happened to the splendid collection of committee photographs which once hung in the old corridors of the provisional Parliament House?</PARA>
<PARA> We could find space in the main committee room-and a very impressive room it is at that-for the vast mural Red Ochre Cove by Mandy Martin. We could find no space for the photographs of the men and women who laboured long and hard to create the Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that four matters now need to be addressed. First, steps must be taken to ensure that the founders of Australia are appropriately honoured in this Parliament House and are given their due prominence. Secondly, the key political events in our history should be marked in some way in this Parliament House, either by display or painting. At the very minimum, steps should be taken to ensure that the key events which led to Federation are prominently featured. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the art work which is currently made available to members should be widened to include important historical political themes. I have no doubt that many members, recognising after all that we are inhabitants of a political institution, would sometimes prefer to display material commemorating significant historical events. I recall, for example, a most interesting lithograph by the artist Charles Nuttall of the opening of Federal Parliament in 1901 which used to hang on the wall near the post office in the old Parliament House. Where is that famous lithograph today, I wonder?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, some ordered process should be put in place to enable proper consideration of the matters I have raised here today so that a balance is struck between art and history. I recommend that an informal bipartisan committee of members and senators be appointed to make detailed recommendations to the appropriate Presiding Officers. Alfred Deakin ended his account of the Federal story by calling the formation of the Commonwealth a miracle. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>To say it was fated to be is to say nothing to the purpose; any one of a thousand minor incidents might have deferred it for years or generations. To those who watched its inner workings, followed its fortunes as if their own, and lived a life of devotion to it day by day, its actual accomplishment must always appear to have been secured by a series of miracles.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that I hope that those who come after us in this Parliament House will regard our work with more interest than we have so far shown to those who devoted all their energies so that we could have a parliament for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, earlier today you quite properly ruled out of order a notice of motion that I presented. So, at the beginning of tonight's brief contribution, which is to be about two aspects of my shadow portfolio, the arts and sport, I would like to deal very briefly with the subject of that notice of motion. I had wanted the Senate to congratulate Australian sports men and women involved in the five outstanding international successes by Australians at the weekend. The first was the men's hockey team winning the world hockey Champions Trophy for 1990 in Melbourne. I was very pleased to have had the opportunity to watch the final day of that very well organised competition. Australian hockey is, of course, leading the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second was the 3-0 clean sweep by the Australian women's netball team in the test series against England in England. In racing, Better Loosen Up won the Japan Cup, the world's second richest horse race, in Tokyo. The Australian rugby league team won the deciding third test 14-0 against England. That, I imagine, Mr President, is a matter that interested you more than somewhat, and I trust you stayed up to watch it. Finally, the Australian cricket team won the First Test against England in Brisbane by 10 wickets in only three days. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to say that I imagine that all members of the Senate-who unfortunately will not be able to vote on such a motion because it has been ruled out of order-would at least join me tonight in expressing our appreciation of the activities of our sports men and women. Looking down that list of five, I note that, although four of them do not receive the Government's elite sports funding, they are clearly the elite. </PARA>
<PARA> The main matter I want to raise is the extraordinary decision of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Administration not to fund the Canberra City Opera in its round of grants for this year. I am not certain whether the ACT Administration is deliberately trying to kill off the Canberra City Opera or whether the decision not to fund it is simply yet another example of its monumental incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> The request to the ACT Administration for funding is not on the basis that maybe a risky venture such as the Canberra City Opera will be able to put on a performance or two that might attract a couple of people to see it. The fact is that for several years the Canberra City Opera has had an outstanding series of successes without funding, at enormous cost to the participants and immense sacrifice of time and money by those people who are closely involved, particularly the singers who provide their services free so often, although they are in many instances professional musicians, and of course the dynamic people who organise the Canberra City Opera, Mr David Parker, AM, and Ms Marie Van Hove. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about this matter, and I have to reveal an interest. I have been involved in one of the productions of the Canberra City Opera; in fact, Senator Tate, who I am glad to see is in the chamber at the moment, introduced one of its productions, Trial by Jury, in the Great Hall, and I played the judge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for his response. Along with almost every production of the Canberra City Opera, that production received both critical acclaim and capacity audiences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress that the Canberra City Opera is closely involved with this community. It involves itself in putting on free concerts, as you know, Mr President, in the Great Hall, and they have been very successful.  In fact, it is prohibited from charging, quite rightly, entrance fees for the concerts it puts on in the Great Hall. As you know, Mr President, each one has been an outstanding success with people having to stand in the corridors on the first floor because of the enormous attendance in the main part of the hall. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we were not going broke we would be able to put it on as a matinee, Senator. These performances have been put on for free. Unfortunately, we cannot even ask for a donation towards the program, such are the rules relating to the use of the Great Hall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Canberra City Opera has put on performances in other commercial halls, for example in the School of Music, it has been able to do very well; in fact, it is able to survive when it puts on major productions. Dido and Aeneas was put on at the Australian National Gallery and was moderately profitable. Die Fledermaus, which was put on last year in the Canberra School of Music, made a modest profit. In other words, the Canberra City Opera has demonstrated an ability to be commercially sound in the great bulk of its ventures and to put on programs involving the community of Canberra both as the audience and as participants. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of its success it is now being penalised by the ACT Administration. As I understand it, it has never received in its four or five years of life any assistance from the ACT Administration. One gets the impression that the ACT Administration has taken the view, `Well, if you have been able to get by for so long, you can continue to get by', even though it does far more for the community than the other organisation called Opera ACT which has been granted $50,000 in order to put on three performances of one opera. That $50,000 is to stage Tosca in 1991 and its productions usually are largely made up of people who come from outside the ACT area. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the ACT Administration apparently takes the view that the Canberra City Opera can struggle by and can, because of the dedication of the people who are involved, keep on putting in its own money to provide free concerts, to involve the people of Canberra and to be an artistic success, the ACT Administration is prepared to risk that and to direct all its funding to a body which has had very mixed results in the past, and certainly has not received either the audience or the critical acclaim that the local product has been able to produce. I am disappointed not only at the fact that the ACT Administration has given $50,000 to Opera ACT for its one production of the year, but also that that has been given at the expense of the Canberra City Opera. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a range of correspondence in recent times. Sir William Keys, for example, is Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Canberra City Opera. He has written to the Chief Minister of the ACT saying that he is appalled at the recently announced decision of the Arts Development Board to deny any financial assistance at all to the Canberra City Opera. I share that view. I would like to join Sir William Keys in expressing my serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA> That concern is so great that a crisis meeting of the Canberra City Opera is to be held this week at the Canberra School of Music in lecture room 3. The reason I mention that is that I am hoping that some of those people who have benefited from the Canberra City Opera's performances will be prepared to come along or, at least, to express their support for the Canberra City Opera and their disgust at the refusal of the ACT Administration to provide any support at all. </PARA>
<PARA> This crisis meeting could well mean that the Canberra City Opera may have to-I do not want to pre-empt the meeting-substantially reduce its services to the people of the ACT. When I say its services, I mean its involvement as well, because this is one of the key things about the Canberra City Opera. The people of Canberra, through its choruses, through its orchestras and through involvement generally, are participating in the Canberra City Opera in a way in which they simply do not get an opportunity to involve themselves with Opera ACT which has been getting this funding, basically, ever since the Australian Opera ceased bringing its productions to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key reasons why the Canberra City Opera was asking for money for the coming year is because Colin Brumby, the Australian composer, has actually written an opera specifically for the Canberra City Opera. It was to produce the world premiere of it next year. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Faulkner" NAMEID="5K4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think this is serious singing, unfortunately, and I have not been offered a part in that one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A large number of outstanding singers are available in the ACT because of the efforts of the Canberra School of Music, particularly the department of singing. Honourable senators can tell how outstanding they are because of the remarkable achievements so many of them have had in being able to join the staffs of overseas organisations such as the Vienna Opera, the opera in London, and so on. This group has attained outstanding achievements. I will mention some of those who have done so well later. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I was trying to make is that Colin Brumby, who is a distinguished Australian composer, has written specifically for the Canberra City Opera, with the libretto by Tom Shapcott. One of the requests made by the Canberra City Opera was for funding to enable this modern Australian work to be produced and to have a world premiere in Canberra. The ACT Administration could find no money for that, but it could find $50,000 for an Opera ACT production of Tosca, to run for three nights, which will depend mainly on imported artists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra City Opera has provided experience that is vital for the future of young singers in Canberra. Two of Canberra's sopranos are now apprentice principals in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Two other sopranos are now also apprentice principal singers with the Vienna State Opera-I met one of them when I was in Vienna earlier this year. One of Canberra's tenors was this year presented with the United States of America Metropolitan Opera award for young singers. This season he is understudy to Luciano Pavarotti as Duce di Mantova in Verdi's opera Rigoletto at the Philadelphia Opera under the baton of Riccardo Muti. Another of our singers has just been awarded the Mozart prize by Richard Bonynge who was greatly impressed with the professionalism of a 21-year-old performer. All these singers gained their first stage experience here in Canberra under the auspices of the Canberra City Opera. The world is recognising their talent, such is their expertise and ability, but unfortunately the ACT Administration has been unable to recognise the vital need to fund-even in a small way-the Canberra City Opera. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is the ACT Administration denying its funding, it is now also throwing it out of the disused school building where in the past it has been able to store its props. Not only is the ACT Administration throwing it out, it is also deciding that the time to throw out the Canberra City Opera from this disused primary school should be 30 November-in the middle of the examinations that the students in the department of singing at the School of Music are obliged to undertake. The ACT Administration is showing the same commitment, the same dedication, to killing off the Canberra City Opera, as it has shown in its refusal to fund it. </PARA>
<PARA> If I sound angry about this, it is because I certainly am. So far, a range of angry letters have been written to the ACT Administration. A full-page advertisement has been taken out by many groups who are curious about the nature of the funding. When we look at the role of some people who belong to the boards which are making recommendations and the fact that the associations in which they are involved continue to get large amounts of funding at a time when the Canberra City Opera cannot get a cracker, we wonder what on earth is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed to see that the same appalling funding decisions that were made by the previous ACT Administration are continuing under the present one. All I can hope is that the Canberra City Opera will be able to survive. I fear for its future in view of the hostile, antagonistic, unhelpful attitude of the ACT Administration. I hope it is not too late for it to change its mind and at last do something to help this organisation which has done so much for Canberra and, certainly, which has done far more for the arts in this area than other groups in Canberra which are receiving substantial amounts of public money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp raised the question of the neglect of our constitutional history. I think that, as a society, that is certainly generally true. He particularly focused on the fact that here in Parliament House we do not seem to respect, by a provision of proper exhibition space and hanging space, some of the marvellous paintings and photos of our framers of the Constitution, Prime Ministers, Presidents of this chamber and Speakers of the other place. We do not give enough significance to those paintings and photographs which can, of course, stimulate so much memory of the history of this Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that I will take up Senator Kemp's challenge. The coincidence of 100 years of Labor Party history to be celebrated nationwide next year may be a very good opportunity to recover many of those paintings and photographs, from whichever storeroom in which they are held, which portray the Labor side of the story of this Federation. That is not meant by any means to be a partisan comment. I simply say it may be a catalyst from our point of view. Of course, the resurrection of the history of the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia is a matter of bipartisan concern. I am sure it will receive bipartisan support. Senator Kemp's suggestions ought to be taken up in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume has raised the question of the funding of the Canberra City Opera. It seems to me that the local Minister for Health, Education and the Arts, Mr Gary Humphries, has been very badly advised indeed. He is a man with an extraordinary range of complex portfolios. I take it that he has not had the opportunity to give proper attention to what really lay behind the recommendations which were apparently made to him and which he apparently accepted. At least, that is what he told me when I made a telephonic representation to him regarding this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is curious, as Senator Michael Baume has pointed out, that there seems to be an utter disproportion between the efforts of particular companies. For example, one company has received $50,000 to put on three performances of Tosca some time next year, while we have the continuous presentation of the highest quality singing for the Canberra community and, of course, for those beyond the Canberra community. I well recall several marvellous occasions in the Great Hall here in Parliament House. One was a very solemn and tearful occasion-not only on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-when a special concert was held in relation to the terrible massacres in Tiananmen Square. The Canberra City Opera was called upon to fulfil a role there and it did so magnificently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. There have been a variety of occasions, even here in Parliament, when we have had an opportunity to witness the contribution of the Canberra City Opera to the artistic and cultural life of the nation's capital. For that reason, the funding decision seems to be extraordinary. One may wonder at the fact that the alternative company was engaged in recruiting, as I understand it, personnel to perform in Tosca well before the announcement was made by the Minister on the supposed advice of the funding boards. That raises the question of whether there was some sort of animus and some sort of prejudice, which lay behind the advice which was proffered to him. I do not say he shared that animus or prejudice, but I am saying that there was a nod and a wink very early in the piece which I think would need some further questioning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume has put the case very well. If Mr Humphries-whom I take to be an honourable man and a man with a concern for the arts, otherwise he would not have asked for this particular port- folio-wants to be remembered, he ought to be remembered not as the man who attended the second of three performances of Tosca some time next year but as the special distinguished guest at the world premiere of an Australian opera by Colin Brumby. That is the way in which he would be remembered by those who have any concern for the artistic and cultural life of this nation. He would certainly deserve the respect and earn the plaudits of both sides of this chamber. I want him to know that. </PARA>
<PARA> There would be bipartisan support if he found himself, on the receipt of better advice and on further reflection, able to fund the Canberra City Opera. Otherwise I share Senator Michael Baume's fear that David Parker and Marie van Hove will leave Canberra; that the group they have built up over a few short years will disintegrate without their marvellous enthusiasm and sheer skill and expertise; that what was the nucleus, indeed the flowering, of operatic and other excellent singing here in Canberra, the nation's capital, will disappear with them; and that we will not be able to have the sorts of functions, both solemn and for sheer enjoyment, that we have had in the Great Hall of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I ask the Minister in the local House of Assembly to give further consideration to this matter in the light of the representations that have been made tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) The latest available data is for the 1989 academic year. For that year there was a total of approximately 2380 unfunded students (full time equivalent) in all non-government schools in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Of these, approximately 1180 were unfunded students in nonprofit, non-government schools approved for operation by State or Territory governments and which were receiving Commonwealth general recurrent funding. This number represents 184 primary and 996 secondary enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA>The remainder were students in schools which do not receive Commonwealth general recurrent funding. Of these approximately 900 were primary students and 300 secondary students.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not known which of these enrolments relate to proposals which were not approved for funding under the new schools policy, as this data is not collected for all such enrolments. Some unfunded schools have never applied for Commonwealth general recurrent funding.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The amount of Commonwealth general recurrent funding for which each student would be eligible depends on the funding category of the school which the student is attending. This data is not available for unfunded schools because no funding category can be given to them.</PARA>
<PARA> Data is not collected on which unfunded enrolments relate to proposals which were not approved for funding under the new schools policy. No figure is therefore available on the savings to the Commonwealth in respect of such enrolments. However, based on the average grant for primary students in 1989 being approximately $1040 and for secondary students approximately $1400, the notional savings to the Commonwealth in 1989 resulting from approximately 1180 unfunded students in funded schools was an estimated $1.6 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The decision to close Medicare offices at Kings Meadows and Mowbray resulted from a rationalisation by the Health Insurance Commission, which administers Medicare, of its branch office network. In the current financial climate with high demands on limited resources, it was uneconomical to retain three branch offices within a four kilometre radius.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Consideration was given, inter alia, to the availability of alternative Medicare offices within close proximity so as to create the least disruption and inconvenience to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> The Launceston Medicare office (which is only approximately four kilometres from both the Kings Meadows and Mowbray areas) has been expanded to ensure an effective level of service to cater for the increased work load. Coupled with the higher than average level of direct billing in both areas, no member of the public should be unduly disadvantaged by the closures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. In a statement to the Queensland Parliament, on 3 Oct 1990, the State Minister for Primary Industry indicated that a number of sites including a Coomera River site had been rejected. The Coomera River proposal was rejected because of its potential impact on the Army Jungle Training Centre.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 7th July 1990 the Queensland Water Resources Commission conducted a familiarisation tour of the Land Warfare Centre as part of a feasibility study of a Coomera River site. The Water Resources Commission also conducted a preliminary environmental appraisal of the potential site. No known ground surveys have been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In July and August, the Land Warfare Centre, Canungra and Headquarters 1st Military District in Brisbane were approached by the Water Resources Commission and the Department of the Premier, Economic and Trade Development. In addition to the familiarisation tour, the Water Resources Commission asked for information and data from the Army's land management study of the Canungra Training Area. This information was provided. There is no record of approaches at Departmental or Ministerial level.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Government has budgeted in 1991 for a maintenance in real terms of the 1990 level of funding for the Country Areas Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) &amp;(3) The Government establishes guidelines for the program and the Commonwealth Minister is responsible under the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 for determining variations to existing country areas eligible for funding. State Ministers are responsible for the administration of the program in accordance with the guidelines. State committees are responsible for the co-ordination of the program, and local and area committees oversee local activities and provide advice and assistance in planning, implementing and evaluating projects. Prior to the receipt of funding, a State is required to agree to abide by the provisions of the Act and, in general, the guidelines, which include the requirements for the State to apply the funds in accordance with the program objective, and to meet administrative requirements in the guidelines. Where a State does not meet a condition for funding the Commonwealth Minister has the power under the Act to withhold or delay payment of a grant.</PARA>
