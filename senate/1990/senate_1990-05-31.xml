<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In a speech on an urgency motion in the Senate on 23 May 1990, I set out the general arguments for a register of foreign ownership of Australian land, property, businesses and resources. I do not intend to rehearse all those arguments again. Honourable senators will find them in the Hansard  at pages 883-887. </PARA>
<PARA> I also drew the Senate's attention to the deep concern of the public with regard to the question of foreign investment and foreign ownership. During the last two years I have sent out some thousands of questionnaires to newly enrolled voters in Western Australia. Each questionnaire sought to ascertain whether these voters agreed with, or disagreed with, or had no opinion about twenty matters. One of the questions was about the long-standing proposal of the Democrats to establish a register of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Many hundreds of these questionnaires were returned. The question with regard to which there was the highest agreement with the position of the Australian Democrats was the question of a foreign ownership register. Although we did not keep a precise count, I would estimate that not less than eighty per cent, and probably ninety per cent, of respondents expressed agreement with the proposition for the establishment of such a register. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign ownership of Australian assets is a burning issue out there in the electorate and as senators we are morally bound to pay attention to the concerns of the people who have sent us here to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to concerns in the United States about the level of foreign ownership in 1988 the United States House of Representatives passed the Foreign Ownership Disclosure Act. The speech by Representative Frost of Texas describes the purposes of the legislation which is similarly applicable to the Australian environment, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> `Mr Speaker, H.R. 5410 provides for the registration of foreign interests in US business or real estate in order that our Government might know the extent to which foreign investors have significant or controlling interest in US business and real estate. Since 1982, foreign investment has more than doubled exceeding $1.2 trillion, yet our Government, unlike many other governments who impose strict and detailed reporting requirements on foreign investors, does not have a complete and accurate accounting of the extent to which foreigners own or control American businesses and real estate. H.R. 5410 seeks to make that information available to the US Government to ensure that national security is not endangered by concentrated foreign interests in various industries in our Nation'. </PARA>
<PARA> As Representative Frost correctly pointed out, other countries exert very firm control over foreign investment-particularly those former colonial countries which have in the past experienced at first hand the disadvantages of being slaves to foreign economic control and domination. We should heed the harsh lessons of their bitter experience. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a growing chasm between the level of foreign investment which the present Government considers acceptable and the level that the Australian public considers appropriate. The government appears to be confident that virtually all foreign investment is benign and that it is to be encouraged and welcomed. The Australian people are not so naive. They understand that a family which progressively sells off its assets in order to sustain a lifestyle which is beyond its means is doomed to bankruptcy, poverty and powerlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> The entry of foreign banks into Australia has led to major problems which could have been avoided had a register existed. A register would have enabled a more cautious approach to competition between new entrants and established Australian banks. Instead of the massive and expensive advertising campaigns which the banks were locked into and which the ordinary bank account holders paid for, banks could have spent more of their resources in providing a better service to their customers. Rather we have seen banks forced to take more risks in their loans policies in their attempts to win business. Thus the Westpac group has suffered a major slump in profit because of bad debts as a result of injudicious lending to entrepreneurs and high fliers. That Group has been forced to make provision for a much increased rate of bad debts in future months. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, if the banking industry is a test case of the advantages supposed to accrue to the Australian people from deregulation and foreign investment, then all the signs are that those advantages are illusory. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of control over the influx of foreign players into key sectors of the business world is most strikingly demonstrated in the proposed sell off of television licences and the proposed entry of foreign ownership into the print media in Western Australia. The ability of foreign owners to manipulate the press should be an anathema not only to the Australian Democrats but to all members of the Senate and I cannot but believe that both the Government and the opposition would unite to prevent it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications, Mr Beazley, has the support of the Democrats when he states that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Government believes it is vital that Australia's radio and television stations are owned and controlled by Australians because they are major outlets for political debate and the exploration of cultural identity.'' and</PARA>
<PARA> ``Like other democracies around the world, we believe that it is of national importance that there is stringent limits on foreign ownership of the electronic media. There is strong public support for this policy, which acts to reinforce the requirements for certain levels of Australian programming content.''</PARA>
<PARA> Moves by the Government to restrict foreign ownership of radio and television stations in Australia to an absolute maximum of 20 per cent are therefore very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the Foreign Register will be an effective method of monitoring the changes which will undoubtedly take place in ownership of the industry in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in foreign ownership of the Australian tourism industry, while not posing the same problems as foreign control of the media, is causing widespread concern and in terms of the sell off of real estate is widely regarded as contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, on Queensland's Gold Coast foreign investors were clearing development sites and leaving them idle wasteland in expectation that they would appreciate in value. </PARA>
<PARA> Other foreign investors in tourism are seeking full vertical integration. Overseas nationals can buy package tours to Australia in their own country, fly to Australia in aircraft belonging to their national airline, stay at resorts owned by corporations based in their own country, spending mainly in those resorts in shops owned by those same foreign corporations. Most of the profits of the overall enterprise are either generated in the home country at the point of original purchase of the package tour or repatriated to it from the resort in Australia. Australia gains little from this form of exploitation of our country as a tourism destination. A Register of Foreign Corporations will assist in identifying the extent of such integration. </PARA>
<PARA> The dilemma caused by not knowing who owns what in Australia and the consequences of this ignorance are well demonstrated in the mining and petroleum industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the level of foreign ownership of the mineral sands industry is not widely or accurately known. However, it is possible that all the major operators are partially foreign owned, and some no doubt foreign controlled. If the level of foreign ownership were known, the implications could be addressed. This is one industry in which the mechanism of transfer pricing is probably used to ensure that profits on Australian resources are mainly generated on the high seas, after those resources have left Australia-thus depriving Australia of taxation income. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of a Register of Foreign Corporations allows foreign control to occur without Australians having an opportunity to understand the ramifications. I draw to the attention of the Senate the alarming situation which could result from the takeover of Carr Boyd Minerals by Ashton Mining Ltd. I alluded to this in a Notice of Motion to this place on 23 May 1990. Carr Boyd Minerals Mount Weld rare earth deposit is reported to be among the richest rare earth deposits in the world. Yet without a Foreign Corporations Register such a resource can quietly pass into foreign control without the opportunity for public debate about the ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of Cable Sands' existing and proposed sand mines to foreign owners also has major ramifications not only for Western Australians but for Australia as a nation. In addition to the loss of economic benefits to Australia, a foreign owner has been granted rights to operate in very fragile and ecologically important coastal regions of Western Australia, including land designated as national park. The foreign ownership of mines is backed by very powerful mining legislation which puts the owner in a very strong negotiating position when dealing with the State and Federal Governments. The likely losers in the sell-off are the people of Australia. History demonstrates this only too well. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate the enormous environmental damage being done in countries such as Burma, Papua New Guinea, Sarawak and the Philippines by foreign timber companies which are annihilating tropical rainforests to feed the developed world's insatiable appetite for sawn timber. Foreign companies operating in environments to which they have no long term commitment maximise their dollar profits, rip out the resource as rapidly as they can, seek to generate as much of the profit as possible in their own countries and leave the developing countries they exploit to attempt to deal with the resultant massive environmental degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear and undeniable link between foreign ownership and environmental irresponsibility. The more we encourage foreign ownership, the more we hand over control of our environment to people who do not care about it, who do not understand its fragility and who will not have to live with the consequences of their actions. But our children and grandchildren will have to live with those consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The tentacles of foreign ownership by giant corporations already affect significantly the Australian way of life. The people of Australia need to be informed and have the right to know the extent of this influence. A Register of Foreign Corporations is a simple and effective method of achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite statements to the contrary the gathering of data to compile and maintain a Register would not be costly as most of the information is already available from a variety of State government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland leads the way with the establishment of a State Register. If Queensland can do it I doubt that it is beyond the resources of this Government to at least match what has been achieved there. </PARA>
<PARA> We can hardly become the clever country which the Prime Minister aspires to, if we do not ensure that Australia's rich resources benefit our nation rather than being sold for short term gain. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill's provisions will not curb foreign ownership but its passage will establish a Register of Foreign Corporations which will enable us to find out how much of our country and of our economy is already under foreign control. It will also effectively monitor the extent of foreign ownership in key industries and the rate of increase (or decrease). As always, knowledge is power. Once we know what the true situation is, we will be in a position to ascertain where the dangers lie and then by appropriate further legislation or controls we will be able to do something about them. This Bill in respect of foreign corporations may be regarded as a first step towards a full register of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Senate to support the need to establish a Register of Foreign Corporations for Australian land, business, property and resources. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>My purpose in introducing this Bill today is to draw attention to what I see as a most unsatisfactory situation with regard to the use of political advertising during the period of an election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that this is not the first occasion on which I have raised this matter. I have tried on previous occasions to convince both the Government and the Opposition of the importance of the provisions contained in this Bill. By permitting this situation to continue we are, in fact, allowing politicians a licence to lie. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that while we, as politicians, are happy to impose requirements on the business community by obliging commercial operators to tell the truth about the products they are offering to consumers, we permit ourselves the freedom to make untrue and misleading statements about what we or our political opponents are offering to the community in terms of policies for government. I find this situation unacceptable and highly immoral. I believe it implies a degree of contempt, on our part, for the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision similar to the one I am proposing today with regard to the prohibition of false and misleading advertising was included in the Commonwealth Electoral Act in 1983 and was one of many reforms to the Act that were adopted following the tabling of the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform in September 1983. The Committee's second report, which was tabled in August 1984 canvassed a number of matters relating to political advertising, including the definitional problems associated with political truths, of what is opinion and what is fact; what is untrue and what is misleading or deceptive; the potential problems arising from the placing of criminal liability on the publishers of election material; and the potential dangers associated with the injunction process. </PARA>
<PARA> A simple and satisfactory solution to the problems raised by the Committee would have been first, to amend s.329 (2) to remove the onus of guilt from the publishers and printers of material and to confine liability under the Act to the person or political party who authorised that material, which was the recommendation to the Committee of the Advertising Federation and the Media Council. Second, to amend s.383 by restricting the injunction process with regard to s.329 (2) to the Commonwealth Electoral Commission. Instead, the Government took the quite unnecessary step of removing all of sub-section 329 (2) from the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking that action, the Government has said, ably supported by the Opposition, that while we agree truth in political advertising is a desirable objective, we believe that such a law will be too difficult to enforce. So let's put it in the too hard basket and hope it will go away (and in the meantime, we can use the situation to our advantage!). </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions contained in this Bill are modelled on Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act which has been in operation since 1974. Sub-section 52 (1) states: `A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive'. On advertisements, the Act states that corporations shall not make untrue, false or misleading statements or publish advertisements that are false or misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will make it an offence under the Commonwealth Electoral Act for any person to authorise the printing, publishing or distribution of electoral matter containing a statement that is untrue and that is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive during the period of an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for the Electoral Commission to institute injunction proceedings should it be of the opinion that subsection 329 (2) of the Act has been contravened. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous objections in the past from both the Government and the Opposition with regard to the measures I am proposing and we have modified our proposal over the years to comply with most of those objections. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that this provision will be limited in the type of advertisement of statement that it will prohibit. I have always acknowledged that that is the case. The only statements which will be caught under this section are things like: `X Party's official policy document states that it will introduce a consumption tax'. If X Party's policy does not contain such an item then that statement is clearly untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of a statement that would not be caught under the Act is: `When X Party wins office it will introduce a consumption tax' or `A vote for so and so is a vote for consumption tax'. Under the definition contained in this Bill, such statements do not have a truth value in that very strict sense. They are statements about a future activity, a prediction, and therefore could be either true or false. </PARA>
<PARA> Because this provision is so limited in its application, the Government and the Opposition have argued that it isn't worth the bother. My response has been, and continues to be, if we cannot reform the entire world, there is still a legitimate argument for reforming the little bit that we can get hold of, and this Bill will be at least one step down that path. It will catch a limited range of statements that have truth value in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 Senator Ray, on behalf of the Government, raised the likelihood of the democratic process being disrupted and placed at risk by minority groups, desperate for publicity, who would manipulate the injunction process. I agreed that there was a danger of that occurring. This Bill, as I have already mentioned, consequently amends s.383 of the Act by limiting the power of injunction, with regard to s.329 (2), to the Commonwealth Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past (1987) Senator Ray has opposed the reliance on the Electoral Commission as the body with sole responsibility for initiating injunctions, claiming that such responsibility would create enormous problems, put inordinate pressure on the Commission, and leave it open to claims of bias from all sides. I reject those assertions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out before during debate on this matter, under the Act, the Electoral Commission has been given not simply the power to prosecute if something is brought to its notice. It has an obligation to take legal action to enforce the provisions of the Electoral Act in their entirety. It has been set up as the independent arbitrator in our electoral process to ensure that that process is fair and above board. As such, it must necessarily be involved in the political fray. As no attempt has been made to change this situation, I assume the independent power of the Commission to enforce the Act is accepted by the majority as necessary and desirable. Why, therefore, has the case of untrue and misleading advertising been singled out as a special exemption from this general proposition?</PARA>
<PARA> What we are saying is this: The only power, the only area we will exclude from the Electoral Commission, is that relating to electoral advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Courts have been making decisions with regard to Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act since 1974. During debate on this issue in 1984 I stated, and I quote: `Anyone can look, as I have done, at the laws that have flowed from the operation of the Trade Practices Act. There is now a clearly worked out basis in law on how those particular obligations operate, are to be imposed, what will occur, how it will occur and the types of defences available to people resulting from those obligations not to mislead the community about services or products'. It is not difficult to define the sorts of statements that would be prohibited under s.329 (2) of the Electoral Act. It is very clear because we are looking at a very narrow range of statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Australian Electoral Office, in its submission to the first Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform (p.181), suggested a provision be included in the Act regarding the right of candidates to seek an injunction to restrain misleading advertising. The Committee, in its first report, subsequently recommended that the Commission be obliged to seek injunctive relief in respect of issues such as misleading electoral matter (clause 11.7, p.181). So this is not something the Australian Democrats have dreamt up as being a good idea . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I made the comment when this issue was first debated in this place that `A democracy relies on two things: The first is the ability of people to have a free vote and express their free determined will as to who shall govern them in the next parliament, and the second, which is equally important, and on which democracy stands, is information. Without information a democracy is dead'. </PARA>
<PARA> Electors have the right to true and accurate information about policies and issues that concern them during an election in order to make an informed choice. At the moment they are, in some instances, being denied that right. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes an Australian Centennial National Rail Transport Development Program to assist in the development of a national standard guage rail network comprising mainline interstate and mainline export links capable of moving heavy freight tonnages efficiently and without undue delay. This will require substantial upgrading of parts of mainline track in New South Wales and Victoria. Whilst the Bill provides for encouragement of parts of State systems to be merged with the Federal system, Australian National, such mergers are not compelled. There is also provision for retirement of debt for earlier gauge standardisation works, notably in Western Australia, and evaluation of the economic and environment costs and benefits of rail upgrading. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that the Bill represents an affirmation of this country's intention to rid itself of the limiting trappings of colonialism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Centennial National Rail Development Program is motivated by the clear need to reduce the total costs of land freight transport in Australia. This need to reduce transport costs is widely acknowledged and has been the subject of several major privately and Government funded studies. What is not so clearly recognised in all of these studies is the need to reduce the external costs of transport, including the tragic costs of road accidents involving semitrailers on our highways. </PARA>
<PARA> The point was well made by the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Rail: Five Systems-One Solution. In his foreword to their report released November 1989, the then Chairman Mr John Saunderson said:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The plain fact is that a greatly increased amount of freight could be carried across the continent by rail more efficiently and with greater safety than it ever could be by road. Road has been preferred because it is seen as providing reliable transit times. If rail were more efficient and carried the amount of freight it should, lives would be saved, less non-renewable resources would be used and less pollution would be generated. For rail to become more efficient, money has to be spent upgrading such things as the permanent way, communications and terminal facilities and providing more and purpose-designed rolling stock.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``The case for one national rail system for freight and passenger services is obvious. All that stands in the way of such a system are the vested interests and parochialism of the existing authorities.''</PARA>
<PARA> Although a commitment has been made by the Federal Government for ``major changes to Australia's transport infrastructure'' including the allocation of some $4000 million for National Highway and National Arterial road development over the next five years, this commitment is yet to extend to rail upgrading. Here, a major need is the improvement of the track alignment in South East Australia's mainline interstate rail network along with Adelaide Melbourne gauge standardisation. The Australian Centennial National Rail Transport Development Program meets this challenge, and the need to get a national rail network that is capable of efficiently moving interstate and export freight by the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Federation, the Commonwealth has assisted the development of strategic parts of a national rail system. During the First World War, a transcontinental rail link was built between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Between the wars, this link was extended to Port Pirie, and a standard gauge link from the north coast of New South Wales to Brisbane was constructed with Commonwealth assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> After World War Two, standard gauge was extended to Melbourne in 1962, then from Kalgoorlie to Perth and from Port Pirie to Broken Hill in the late sixties and then to Alice Springs and Adelaide in the early eighties. A further stage in national rail development was the formation of Australian National by the Whitlam Government in the seventies. The result of these investments by the Commonwealth has been upgraded track west of Adelaide and Parkes so that standard gauge links all mainland capital cities and intermodal trains can now operate profitability between Adelaide and Perth, plus Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> These intermodal operations involve road trailers being moved on rail wagons in trains 1800 metre long. Such trains, with a trailing load of about 5000 tonnes, require well constructed track with gentle grades, easy curves and good clearances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling the progress made by Australian National since taking full control of the Tasmanian and South Australian non metropolitan railways in 1978. At that stage, Australian National was given a direction to operate mainland freight operations on a commercial basis within ten years. With bipartisan support from the Federal Parliament, hard work by the Australian National board including its former Chairman Mr. Lou Marks, and the support of staff and unions, this goal was achieved in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as reflecting good management and union support, this shows strategic mainline investment for rail freight can pay dividends. Assisted with the road trailer `piggybacking' on rail wagons and more recently double stacking of containers, rail now takes about 70 per cent of all land freight in and out of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of contrast, rails share of land freight on the important Sydney Melbourne rail corridor is less than 30 per cent. The vast majority is carried by heavy trucks on the Hume Highway. </PARA>
<PARA> Rail's share of Sydney Melbourne land freight was over one half in the mid sixties. The shift away from rail is for the most part due to levels of service. Here road transport has an advantage offering door to door deliveries. Other reasons for road transport increasing its modal share include improved truck technology and better roads. Today, one vehicle in three on the Hume Highway is a heavy truck. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the establishment of the National Highway System in 1974, the Federal Government has fully funded the Hume Highway. In 1974, it would take at least 15 hours to drive from Sydney to Melbourne; now a modern heavy truck can do it in 10 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> Although more than $730 million dollars have been spent in upgrading the Hume Highway by the present Government, it has not spent one dollar on upgrading the existing Sydney Melbourne railway. Even when a further $600 million has been spent on the Hume Highway over the next five years, there will still be problems with large numbers of heavy trucks on this highway unless the rail system is upgraded. Without rail taking a lot more Sydney Melbourne freight, large amounts of money will still be needed for maintaining and reconstructing the existing Hume Highway. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government in 1986 formally asked the Federal transport Minister to have the Bureau of Transport Economics conduct a evaluation for the costs and benefits upgrading the Melbourne Sydney railway. It is unfortunate, in my view, that this request was then declined. We have since seen considerable effort made by a private consortium in conducting studies to assess the viability of a Very Fast Train or VFT linking Sydney and Melbourne in 3 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the VFT will be unsuitable for the transport of shipping containers or steel along with other bulk freight between Sydney and Melbourne. In October 1988, the Victorian Government proposed a Fast Freight Train or FFT concept. This involves upgrading of the existing Sydney-Melbourne train line to reduce the transit time of freight trains from about 13 hours to 9 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> How much longer will it take to upgrade the existing Sydney Melbourne railway? In 1980, the Fraser Government made an offer to NSW and Victoria to electrify the Sydney-Melbourne line. Although this offer was not taken up, and later withdrawn, it would be appropriate for the Federal Government to now reconsider the benefits of an upgraded Sydney Melbourne railway. The cost of such evaluations is provided for in the present Bill under `inquiry projects'.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal of a standard gauge link between Adelaide and Melbourne was recently examined by Australian National, who find the break of gauge at Adelaide as a costly one affecting the east-west movement of some 800,000 tonnes a year of freight. Various estimates of the cost ranging up to $500 million have been given for this proposal along with the preferred option of a new route to the north of the Adelaide Hills. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, consideration should be given to more effective mainline interstate rail access to Brisbane, and its port at Fisherman Islands. Whether this should include a rebuild of the present standard gauge line through Grafton, or reconstruction of lines to the West of the Great Divide is a matter for detailed evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for upgrading of the railway between Burnie and Hobart. It is again a matter for detailed evaluation whether it is worth converting to this line to either standard gauge or dual gauge track, so as to allow standard gauge wagons to cross Bass Straight in ferries and move to Hobart the way narrow gauge rolling stock daily crosses Cook Straight in New Zealand to moves, say, between Auckland and Christchurch. There is also provision for upgrading the Brisbane to Cairns section of track, although much of this work has already been undertaken by Queensland Railways in their mainline upgrading and electrification projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the present Government's legislation, the Bill before the Senate provides scope for Federal investment for mainline export railways. One obvious candidate would be the 35 kilometre Maldon Dombarton rail link that would provide improved rail access for export coal to Port Kembla. Completion of this link, started in 1983 by the Wran Government and stopped in 1988 by the Greiner Government, would get coal trains out of inner city areas in Sydney and reduce the numbers of coal trucks on Wollongong City roads. At present, a massive five million tonnes a year of coal is moved by road for export through Port Kembla. This means during each working day, one coal truck a minute converging on the Port Kembla coal loader. Both Labor and Coalition Federal Governments have allocated millions of dollars for road used by coal trucks. It is time some Federal funds were made available for measures to get some of this export coal off public roads. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be of concern to the Government when a Canadian authority on transport, Professor Stevenson, who visited Australia in 1985, found in his recent book, Rail Transport and Australian Federalism (on page 94) that the present Government appears to have attached ``a lower priority to rail transport than any other Commonwealth government since the Second World War. It was apparently much more interested in highway freight transport.''</PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the millions of dollars paid by the Government rail systems in diesel fuel excise that have been diverted into road building, and the lack of Commonwealth funding of rail development or even the planning of selective infrastructure upgrading throughout the eighties, substance is given to this charge. The diversion of rail funds to road works has arisen through the provisions of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act and the former Australian Land Transport Program that permit the States to divert potential mainline interstate rail funding to road works has already been noted by this Senate (by Australian Democrat Senators). The figures are telling: from 1 July 1985 to 31 December 1988, the Australian Land Transport Program collected some $60 million from the Government rail systems for fuel excises, and allowed a maximum of about $35 million to be diverted from roads to mainline interstate rail projects. Instead, only some $2.68 million was applied to rail projects. </PARA>
<PARA> This is at a time when the rail systems have been paying rail fuel excise to the Commonwealth that now amount to over $100 million a year, and Australian National's overall deficit has fallen to about $55 million a year. It is also at a time when the external costs of long distance trucking are increasing. As well as a conservatively estimated shortfall of some $140 million in fully distributed financial costs of road systems costs for interstate trucking in 1985-86 as noted by the Inter-State Commission in its 1987 report on cost recovery, we are probably looking at a community cost of similar order for road crashes involving the interstate movement of freight by heavy trucks plus other social and environmental costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This safety factor is highlighted by the tragic crash involving a semitrailer and a bus near Grafton that claimed no fewer than twenty lives in October 1989. This was followed in December 1989 by the collision of two buses on the Pacific Highway. We cannot wait for the years it will take to build a four lane Pacific Highway to reduce this tragic road toll. Instead, the Commonwealth has a responsibility to make a real effort to improve the efficiency of interstate rail freight and passenger operations. This is additional to its work with the Rail Industry Council which has just reported and its support of the National Freight Initiative Committee. This Committee also reported in May and found considerably improved intersystem operations could have considerable economic and social benefits including a positive impact on the nation's GDP with a boost of up to $1000 million. </PARA>
<PARA> A further incentive to get heavy long-distance freight back onto rail is provided by our decreasing self sufficiency in oil, and the need to reduce Greenhouse gas emissions. It is generally recognised that rail is about four times more fuel efficient when compared to road transport for moving reasonable tonnages of freight over some distance. In a paper given to the CSIRO Greenhouse and Energy Conference in December 1989, Dr Philip Laird of the University of Wollongong found that if the mainline interstate rail links in South East Australia were upgraded to Fast Freight Train (FFT) standards so as to give easier ruling grades and better track curvature, and, rail was to win 70 per cent of land transport on the 10 main interstate transport corridors linking the five mainland State capital cities, there would be savings of about 200 million litres of diesel each year. This is about 10 per cent of the some 2000 million litres of diesel used each year in the late eighties by trucks in Australia, a saving too large to be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Energy conservation was in vogue some 10 years ago. With declining self sufficiency in Australia's proven oil reserves, and oil industry projections of Australia's oil import bill reaching $5.5 billion by 1998, it is about time that it come into fashion again. The Australian Transport Advisory Council views stated in 1979 are still relevant; they include the observations that: Transport is almost wholly reliant on petroleum fuels and there are no widely available fuel substitutes at this time. Nevertheless, rail is relatively energy efficient compared to road for long distance freight . . . (and) . . . does have fuel substitute options, such as coal-oil slurries or electrification . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980, a Senate Standing Committee on National Resources found that the competitive position on railways on routes with high load factors should improve if equipment was modernised and tracks were improved as well as changed freight handling practices to meet users needs. The Committee's report noted ``. . . Ideally Australia's inter-state haulage should be by rail between city freight depots with local distribution by road vehicles.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Centennial National Rail Transport Development Program will make this a reality for all but high value time sensitive interstate freight. In regards to funding, the program is to be funded from fuel excises paid to the Federal Government by State and Federal Rail Systems to 1 July, 2001 in stages. Firstly, there would be a transfer in funding from the Australian Centennial Road Development Program (ACRD) of the amount of fuel taxes paid by rail to the ACRD trust fund. This is about $30 million a year. Secondly, as recommended last year by the Standing Committee of Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, there would be backpayments from the ACRD to rail development to account for the diversion of former rail fuel taxes to road works. Thirdly, there is scope for a reduction of about $75 million paid to consolidated revenue from other fuel excises paid by the rail systems. However, the provisions in the ACRD Program for urban public transport will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal fuel taxes have been imposed on rail operations since 1982. It may be argued, that they should be abolished, as they are soon to be abolished for coastal shipping. Some State Rail Commissioners, now with the support of the Inter-State Commission in most recent report Road Use Charges and Vehicle Registration : A National Scheme, have argued for the abolition of Federal rail fuel taxes. However, this is outweighed for the urgent need to properly develop a national railway network. Such development has a very good precedent the formation of the National Highways System in 1974. As the then Federal Transport Minister observed in effect, if we left it up to the States alone to build a national highway, their own priorities would not allow it. So also with a national rail system. This is why the bill also allows for the cost of absorbing, with the agreement of the relevant State Government, any suitable part of a State Rail system into Australian National. This could usefully include Broken Hill to Parkes, or Adelaide Melbourne, or indeed the entire V/Line rail system. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill also allows for the retirement of debt to the Federal Government from earlier gauge standardisation projects. This will be of help to Western Australia and with the provision for upgrading mainlines in Queensland and Tasmania will help balance the likely expending of most funds in South Eastern Australia. Thus, there are potential benefits for each state and territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the proposed Australian Centennial National Rail Transport Development Act will help take parts of Australia's interstate mainlines out of the nineteenth century with their steam age alignment and broad gauge track. The Act will also provide funding and a basis for a true national railway system ready for the demands of the twenty first century. The funding is from rail systems themselves and returned for cost effective projects that will improve freight transport and reduce the demands on our road system and road users. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion. I was not aware of any arrangement made between the Government and the Opposition on this matter. I had heard that the Government intended to move that government business take precedence over general business today. That was why I did not deny the Manager of Government Business (Senator Robert Ray) leave so to move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I strenuously object to the motion, for two reasons. It is only proper and polite for individual senators to be consulted about whether government business should take precedence over general business. General business is one of the few times when individual senators can take the opportunity to express the views put to them by constituents about a whole range of issues. In this case there is a whole rack of Government papers which need to be considered at some stage. Those papers are generally considered on each day of sitting, but the time available on each sitting day is only 30 minutes. Generally there is an excess number of Government papers which cannot be dealt with in that time. Thus, we have that situation today. We have a range of Government papers which need to be further considered by the Senate. If this motion is carried, we will not be able to consider those papers until August. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason I believe that this motion should not succeed is that for the Senate to exercise its proper control over executive government it is important for the Senate as a whole to safeguard general business time. I understand that this is the second last day of our sittings, but at the rate we are going it appears that we have plenty of time to deal with all the matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are about 16 speakers listed on the wool legislation, but my recollection of final sitting days is that once people hear the revving of the planes, the speakers on the list tend to disappear. We can get to that very important matter of wool earlier than expected. Thus, all the speakers on the list can have the opportunity of expressing the views conveyed to them by their constituents and their own views after they have given mature consideration to the matter. I know that it is a forlorn hope; nevertheless I hold to the hope that this motion will not succeed. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 2, subclause 3 (1), line 7, at end of subclause, add ``and commerce''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 outlines the objects of this Bill, about which we have had a great deal to say in the debate so far. One of the deficiencies we have exposed in this legislation is the difference between the general objectives of the Bill and the ways in which the Government seeks to give effect to them. The objects of the Bill are stated in clause 3 (1), which says:</PARA>
<PARA> The principal objects of this Act are to increase, and improve the quality of, the employment related skills of the Australian workforce so that it works more productively . . . thereby increasing the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the major criticisms that we have made of this Bill is that it seeks to cover the whole range of employment. For example, the definitions of `employer' are extremely wide. As I said, it covers the whole range of economic activity and not just industry. The object of this amendment is to make this clause consistent with the legislation's objectives. This may seem to be just a tidying up measure, and if that is so I am sure that the Government and the Australian Democrats will not object to it. We basically see the amendment as doing that and making the objectives consistent with the operation of the Bill. Nevertheless, the addition of the words `and commerce' does serve to emphasise the point that we have been making that the ambit of the legislation, which covers a whole range of economic activity and employment in the community, raises basic difficulties with a number of other clauses in the Bill which need further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this has been emphasised in a letter which I received only yesterday from the Secretary-General of the Law Council of Australia. It also raises a matter which I wish to discuss later in relation to clause 27. The letter includes a statement which sums up very well what the Opposition has been trying to say during this debate. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Law Council would have preferred to have seen the legislation expressly recognise the differences in the training requirements of manufacturing, retail and service industries and the professions. If this had been done there would have been no need to deal with such matters in the proposed guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>They are matters which we have been complaining about. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to find that a peak professional body in Australia has made the point again, and it is still being made by the Opposition. That is interesting, in the light of the Minister's reply to the Opposition's criticism of this legislation that all these bodies had been thoroughly consulted and were all satisfied with the way the Government had brought in this Bill; that there was no need to give it further consideration; and that the Opposition had been wasting everybody's time. So much for that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly clear that this legislation has been drawn up with regard to the needs of one segment of industry and has not had regard, in its present structure, to the needs of commerce and more particularly professions. It may well be that the guidelines, when we finally see them, will overcome the problem. We would certainly like to find out more about them before we pass the Bill but presumably that is not going to be possible. Nevertheless, the Minister may be able to help by answering some questions that arise, particularly under clause 27. Clearly the structure of the Bill will be an impediment in applying these basic notions of what is eligible training, even with the help of guidelines. The basic problem is that the thinking behind the Bill is restricted in the way in which this objective has been restricted, namely, the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If the words `and commerce' were added it would be helpful for the Government and the Minister in drawing up guidelines. It would serve to give further support to guidelines which, hopefully, will recognise these distinctions, whereas clause 27 does not do so. It may be that there could be difficulties in developing guidelines sufficiently flexible in the light of clause 27. I think there could well be legal argument as to whether the guidelines, if they have the necessary flexibility, will be consistent with clause 27. It would help to give force to those guidelines if they have that flexibility, and it would help to give further legal force to them if the Opposition's amendment were accepted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the Opposition's amendment. It does so for a very clear reason. The objective of the legislation is to increase and improve employment related skills of workers in all branches and sectors of Australian industry, and that includes commerce. Training programs, training expenditure and programs which will be considered eligible include those targeted at workers in the commerce sector. It should be recognised that the term `industry' as referred to in the Bill is one which is both widely and generally used to include all branches of industry whether it be the agricultural, mining, manufacturing, retail service or commercial sectors. This is the meaning intended in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also consistent with the usual dictionary definition of the word `industry', that is, a branch of industry or trade. The addition of the word `commerce' would add absolutely nothing to the meaning or the intent of the legislation. In stressing that last point, I indicate that there have been extensive discussions in the preparation of the legislation with associations representing most of the service sectors as well as manufacturing, professional and commercial associations. It is widely understood that the legislation covers commerce, as intended by the Opposition. There is no need for the amendment and the Government opposes it. </PARA>

<PARA> (3) Page 6, clause 4, definition of `skill', line 30, after `includes', insert `expertise,'. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4, page 6, refers to the definition of skill and is a sort of hybrid exercise. `Skill' is not really defined. It simply states that it includes competence and knowledge. Page 27 of the explanatory memorandum, in dealing with the definition of `skill', says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has the standard dictionary meaning, namely, practised ability, expertness and facility and it includes competence and knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>It is intended that the term have a wide meaning. It seems very extraordinary to me that, when one tries to give it that widest meaning, the Bill only says it includes competence and knowledge. Clearly, what the Government is seeking to achieve in this whole exercise is to improve the meaning of the word. It is obvious and we have already dealt with that. The explanatory memorandum uses the word `expertness' and I think the word `expertise' is a better and a better understood word. It is used much more than expertness. Although that is a word, it is not a commonly used word. To give this definition its full force we believe that the word `expertise' should be included in the definition of `skill'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the definition of a particular word. This always seems to me to be somewhat fruitless. With regard to this amendment, the word `expertise', in all of its accepted definitions, means expert knowledge. Expert knowledge, of course, is a subsection of knowledge which is included in the Bill. I think the notion of having `skill' defined as competence and knowledge refers both to the residual understanding and its application in practice. I fail to see why we need to extend it. In saying that, I am not fussed either way. It does not seem a matter of great moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For essentially the reasons that Senator Macklin states, the Government opposes this amendment. We see the point that Senator Durack raises as being covered by the definition already in the Bill. Amendments to include `expertise' would be purely cosmetic and would add nothing to the substance of the definition. As Senator Macklin, I think, explained, `expertise' comes within the Oxford Dictionary definition of the word `skill'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to clause 8, why is the threshold figure $200,000, when for payroll tax, I think, in every other State it is at least $400,000? Why was the figure of $200,000 chosen and how was it calculated?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of that mechanism is that, whilst about 75 per cent of the work force will be covered, about 85 per cent of employers will be excluded. One per cent of $200,000 is $2,000, so we are talking about small amounts being recouped thereunder. A lower threshold would have involved a large increase in the number of employers required to comply, a relatively small increase in the number of employees covered and compliance checking for trifling amounts of expenditure. Whilst average training expenditure is lower amongst small firms, almost 60 per cent of firms with payrolls above the threshold spend nothing on formal training. The training guarantee aims to directly improve the level and quality of industry training of firms above that threshold. That is essentially why that figure was seized upon.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also in regard to clause 8, I raised at the second reading stage the discrepancy in the treatment of payroll tax between the States. There are two questions involved. Firstly, how will it be done? As I understand it, in New South Wales, for example, the end user incurs the payroll tax for the employee, while in Victoria the agency does. That is with regard to those agencies we were discussing at the second reading stage, employment agencies. There seems to me to be some confusion. How does the Commonwealth intend to deal with the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Macklin says, a discrepancy currently exists between States in the treatment of payroll tax legislation. I think it relates particularly to employment agencies. In some States or Territories, the Australian Capital Territory for example, employment agencies are explicitly deemed within the legislation to be the employer in every situation. That is not necessarily the case in all States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the training guarantee legislation there is no presumption that either the employment agency or the client is the employer in every case. The decision on who is the employer depends on the type of relationship that exists between the worker, the employment agency and the host of expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> I could probably go on without specifically addressing Senator Macklin's point but I will not do that. I will seek further information. I am informed that there have been no problems with firms crossing State borders and also national payroll and training expenditure count.

But there is indeed some essential and basic constitutional question as to whether the Crown can prosecute itself in a court of law. Senator Reid went on to ask whether the Crown can actually prosecute an employee of the Crown. That raises other, diverse, questions as to whether that person was working inside or outside his terms of employment and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Very briefly, the Public Service officers obviously do not have a clue about Care at Home, otherwise they would be able to answer my question. That seems extraordinary to me. I do not know whether this particular agency covers all those criteria. It seems incredible to me that the officers beside the Minister for Administrative Services are not aware of it. For the Minister to say that people employing trained nursing staff need to spend one per cent of their payroll on upgrading the training of that trained nursing staff is unbelievable. Is that the advice the Public Service officers are giving the Minister? It is absolutely ridiculous for them even to suggest that one per cent of the payroll tax should be spent on upgrading nursing skills when the nurses are already fully qualified and fully trained and are going into homes not to do highly technical work that is done in hospitals but to give home nursing care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I presume that the Government is saying, `If this particular group does not need to train its staff, then it can pay the tax as a payroll tax to assist others'. It seems that this is what this Bill is all about. There are a number of groups, industries and agencies that do not need to spend such a large amount of money on upgrading training because they are using trained staff of such quality that this is not a requirement. But the Government will still enforce the payment of that amount. I might be wrong.

We are in the business of providing the criterion-that has been provided to Senator Walters-and in the business of assisting further. I gave Senator Walters further assistance in terms of how that organisation can be assessed. The other thing we can do is check the whole nature of the organisation and come back to Senator Walters on that.

Changing research means that new products are on the market and new needs have to be met in terms of sicknesses. Senator Walters can sit there and shake her head, and sometimes I wish she were back in nursing, but I am glad she is here now to keep us going all morning. The reality of nursing, as with a whole list of other professions, is that nurses do not live in a static world. Because of different research developments, different medicinal developments and different sicknesses, we can argue quite strongly that training in techniques for those in the health profession-from doctors to nurses-can be augmented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the greatest respect to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), his last answer to Senator Walters was quite extraordinary.

What he is talking about in the particular instance of the program that Senator Walters raised is training nurses beyond what is required for their purpose, which, for certain, means that, having been trained by that organisation if it were required to do so, they would then have to move on to get jobs commensurate with their new skills.

Public benevolent institutions are those that rely on public donations and government funding for their operation, and are often staffed by volunteers. Requiring them to meet the requirements of the training guarantee could force them to cut back services to the poor, sick and needy, which we acknowledge as being an undesirable result. The Government acknowledges the need to ensure that those sorts of organisations are exempt, but we will have a look at the actual structure, details and funding of the particular organisation Senator Reid mentioned and come back to her.

I am wondering about seminars, the difference between the sorts of courses that are generally appropriate to unskilled and professional people, and the matter I raised in the debate that came to me from the Real Estate Institute of Australia about the sorts of magazines that people subscribe to, which are their means of learning and skilling themselves in new areas. Would subscriptions to certain types of magazines for the benefit of employees in the way of self-education, perhaps, be exempted?</PARA>

If the guidelines under clause 30 were available perhaps none of these questions would even occur to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will first answer the previous question, that being the question about clause 18. I am informed that the reason we have that exemption is essentially that the cost of administration outweighs the very small number of people who would be exempt under clause 18 of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid asked questions about a number of aspects which may or may not be covered by the legislation. I am informed that most seminars and conferences will not be structured as defined in the legislation and they will not be counted as eligible training as a consequence. However, the cost of attending employment-related seminars will count if the seminar is part of a broader structured training program which has been designed by any employer for an employee or a group of employees. For example, a partner of a law firm could design a training program for one of his or her junior colleagues. The program, for instance, might cover a year and have the objective of improving knowledge of tax law and practice to a certain level. The means of so achieving that objective may include attending specified courses, undertaking supervised reading programs, attending appropriate seminars organised, for instance, by the Australian Taxation Office or a consultant. In those cases the cost of attending the seminar would count. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the subsequent question was whether subscriptions paid to industry associations would be eligible expenditure. Where, for instance, an industry association undertakes eligible training activities using funds derived from those subscriptions, then that portion of the subscription which is used for training activities will count as eligible training expenditure claimable by the employer who is a member of the association. </PARA>
<PARA> The types of eligible activities which an association may undertake are covered in subclause 25 (2). I think one example is the development of training programs which include the development of training materials for programs and books as well, so we would be there covering the question of books being allowable as part of the expenditure. Where an association also charges a specific fee for eligible training activities, that fee will, of course, count as eligible expenditure for the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that Senator Reid made the point at the start-it is one which is quite accurate-that we could spend probably the week rather than just the day going through item after item across the country, but she mentioned also the questions of articled clerks and whether their wages would count as eligible training expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has held discussions with the Law Council of Australia on this particular issue and clause 30 of the legislation was included following these consultations. This clause allows the Minister to make guidelines which will simplify the record keeping for designated entry-level training arrangements. The Law Council has said it would be interested in working with officials to develop these guidelines and such guidelines will allow employers to claim a minimum amount of expenditure for each articled clerk without keeping training records. </PARA>

<PARA> (4) Page 14, after paragraph 26 (1) (k), add the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>; and `(m) expenditure incurred by the employer in engaging replacement staff (including all hiring and salaries expenditure) to undertake the duties of an employee during the period that the employee was solely or principally engaged in participating in an eligible training program'. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is to add an additional limb to subclause 26 (1). Subclause 26 (1) sets out in very considerable detail the types of expenditures that can become eligible to set against the levy. We commend the detail that appears in the subclause despite a lot of other criticism we make of the legislation. Also, this particular clause does seem to have had regard to some of the comments that had been made in relation to capital expenditure. One of the weaknesses under the original proposals has been rectified by the Government. Expenditure within a corporate group is to be claimable against the group and not just in relation to each particular member of it, the related company. Certainly, on capital expenditure the amendment has been made by the Government to take the matter up. </PARA>
<PARA> But when one looks at the various items of expenditure, one sees that the expenditure incurred by an employer in engaging replacement staff, including all hiring and salaries expenditure, to undertake the duties of an employee during the period that the employee was solely or principally engaged in participating in an eligible training program is not included. The Minister may be able to show us where that type of expenditure would be included, but it does not appear to be in the provision. It is clearly the sort of expenditure that will be, or is already being, incurred by employers who provide training that the Government would desire. </PARA>
<PARA> After this legislation comes in, an employer is induced to engage in the desired training and will incur all sorts of expenditure as a result of it-the variety of which, as I have said, is already set out pretty clearly in subclause 26 (1). There are difficulties in doing it that way, even though the subclause makes clear that it provides only examples of such expenditure. Nevertheless, it might be helpful, again, if we had guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly believe firmly that another example-and a very obvious example-is the one we are addressing in this amendment. I commend it to the Government. If, as I said, the Government can point to some other basis for it-how it can be claimed, without any doubts about it-then this amendment will not be necessary. In the absence of that, we believe that it is a very important addition to the examples that are set out in clause 26 (1). It should be agreed to by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not support the amendment. We see it as a classic case of double counting, in fact. There are obviously obligations on industry to fulfil; the priority being, of course, to increase levels of training. If that is not done, then obviously industry has to meet obligations in terms of the one per cent. As part of the mechanism of the outcome of this particular Bill, where an employee undertakes a training program there will be short-term costs to the employer, represented by the wage of the employee. Employers can count the wage of the employee while he or she attends a training program as eligible expenditure. The mechanism of the legislation is such that if one were able to include the cost of replacement staff, then there would be a classic case of double counting. The outcome of this would be that no cost would be incurred by industry and the Government in fact would be paying the whole cost of the particular training programs, either by way of the guarantee or other tax mechanisms so we oppose the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say to the response of the Minister for Administrative Services is that it is just as well that he and his advisers are not in business. If one does not do some double counting when one is facing costs, one would be bankrupt pretty quickly. That is in fact what employers are faced with. When employees go on a program like this-or for whatever reason because there are many other reasons why they may not be able to be working at the task which they were employed to do-the employer has to keep paying them their salary for a period of time; he does that, clearly, when they are training. At the same time, replacement staff have to be obtained. In many cases replacement staff have to be employed to do the work, if the work is there. That is an additional cost. That is why, of course, the oncosts of employment in Australia are so high. That is one of the most obvious problems facing Australian business. To say that that is something which cannot be counted because it is double counting is ridiculous when the reality is that there are double costs that are incurred. It is ridiculous to say that because it is double counting that is a reason for being against it. Of course our amendment is proposed because of double costs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition amendment is based on a notion which I do not think is correct. Senator Durack just argued that there was a cost in terms of replacement staff. That is perfectly true. In fact, the taxation system treats the situation that way. But we are not talking about the taxation system. What we are talking about is training costs. Presumably, replacement staff are fully productive. If they are not, any additional training may be counted with that replacement staff. In as far as members of such staff are fully productive, it is not a training cost. The cost there is towards productivity and hence is dealt with under the normal methods of taxation. It is dealt with in terms of the costs of a company dealing in whatever it is that the company is doing. What we are talking about here in this legislation is training costs. It is not a training cost, except in so far as training of any of those replacements is a cost to the company, and it will be able to be counted under the one per cent exercise. Anything outside of that is a cost to the production operation of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think any answer to that question would have to be a figure plucked out of the air. It depends, as Senator Reid has just said, on the individual determination of the person. Secondly, under this legislation a person would not necessarily be paying anything. That would also have to be a consideration. Hopefully, if that employer were so interested in this exercise he would be doing it to go over the one per cent, in which case he would not be paying a penny. So the Government, at the end of the day, would not lose anything. But surely it would depend on the individual determinations, how the person was employed and what the employer did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Macklin has said is precisely right. The revenue under the higher education contribution scheme (HECS) would be the same. As to the revenue under the training guarantee scheme, it would depend upon the individual involved, the individual employer and the level of training that that employer has already committed himself or herself to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also ask a question with regard to HECS and clause 26. At the second reading stage I raised the possibility of distortions between private and public institutions. If one looks at the example which Senator Reid has just given, a private institution would be treated differently from a public institution. According to calculations that I have done, taking into account that the institutions would be paying fringe benefits tax, in terms of the Taxation Commissioner's recent ruling, on almost every occasion there is a distortion against public education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, if one looked at a course in Japanese at a private institution and one at a university or technical and further education college, there would be a marginal gain in choosing the private institution over the public one. I am quite sure that the Government is not intending that. We could not do anything in this legislation to fix that up, but I wonder whether the Government has any intention of trying to regularise that situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin raises a problem which we recognise as one we will have to monitor. We accept that it is essentially a problem if public and private trainers offer comparable courses at comparable prices. However, it should be taken into account that HECS applies only to courses with a high public subsidy and that these conditions may not be met all that often. However, we are prepared to look at the tax treatment of employer payments to HECS to ensure that public institutions are not put at a disadvantage.

Where an employer provides a training course for a person that significantly upgrades his skills, which is what is intended, is there any possibility-the employee having been put in a category whereby his salary might go up, say, $10,000 a year, or he would be worth that much more-that the employer would have to pay a fringe benefits tax as well for the benefit that has been conferred on the employee? I think that needs to be clarified beyond doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that it is fair for Senator Reid to ask for clarification. Essentially the question of whether the fringe benefits tax is payable where an employer incurs the cost of training an employee very much depends on the circumstances of the case. But generally it should be recognised that so long as the training has work related to it, that work would not be subject to fringe benefits tax although classified as a fringe benefit. This is because the employee would have been entitled to an income tax deduction if the training cost had been paid by the employee personally. This is generally known as the `otherwise' deduction rule. In this case the employer would also be entitled to an income tax deduction. This contrasts with the situation where an employer reimburses a higher education contribution scheme debt. Although this is also a taxable fringe benefit, its value is reduced to nil because the employer is precluded from obtaining an income tax deduction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I have two more questions on clauses 39 and 43 as to confidentiality. It is fairly obvious that from time to time, although not as often with this Bill as under the previous one, that details of specific training courses will have to be provided to the national training body, whatever that may be, or to an industry training body when that comes into being on 1 January.

This provision is similar to that under the income tax legislation and the same penalties prevail for both.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is any point in talking again about how unsatisfactory not having the guidelines is. In clause 30 and clause 27 (4) (c) one sees the phrase `cannot include any generally supervised practice or work experience'. What would be the position of a housemaid or cleaner, the nature of whose training really is supervised practice or work experience? That is the nature of training given to people to upgrade skills and to teach them. If one takes somebody who is totally unskilled in those areas, say in cleaning an office, it has to be supervised practice. Will the guidelines make that plain? If the Minister intends not to do anything under this legislation to enable an unskilled person perhaps to acquire the skills of a housemaid or a cleaner, what is he trying to do? Why is it that that sort of very valuable training for some people seems to be excluded?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did get on to the subject of cleaners when we discussed the Bill yesterday. I think Senator Reid will find that one has to look at people not purely in the actual job they perform at the time, but at other courses which may assist them in their overall skill levels. I refer, for instance, to small cleaning firms-and one must remember that we are talking about firms above the benchmark-which undertake management training for some of their managers, which is obviously essential in all businesses; supervisor training, including training to design and provide supervisors on the job; training workers in, for instance, the use of chemicals and equipment in which they may need to have training and guidance; and occupational health and safety training is another area. As we are talking about the cleaning industry, I imagine that English language training may also be encompassed by skills and training in that area and would be quite useful for the industry to commit itself to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am almost tempted to accuse the Minister of unnecessarily prolonging this debate. Most of the matters the Minister has mentioned of course are as appropriate to a larger cleaning firm as they are to a smaller one. I suggest that even training in the use of certain chemicals would be on site on-the-job training and not something that necessarily a person would go off somewhere else to do. The example I gave the Minister involved a cleaning firm that was large enough to do so electing to take on a person who is totally unskilled. Where would the firm send such people to be trained? It is on-the-job training by the firm's own supervisors and managers that gives that person his or her start in life. Why is that sort of training specifically excluded? The Minister seems to be assuming that everybody is already trained, and he is talking about extra training.</PARA></TALK.START>

But if it is all rather general with no actual program and no training, but just a matter of someone saying, `Here is the cleaner; here are the instructions; go and read them', then that cannot be included as a commitment under the training guarantee. There has to be closely supervised practice. As I pointed out a couple of answers ago, structured instruction is one sort of supervised practice that would be covered, but it is not the only one.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that there is no problem about the distinction between closely supervised and generally supervised practice. Anyone who has ever been involved in training people knows that distinction. With regard to Senator Reid's particular example about the cleaning firm, it seems to me relatively clear that if instruction is given on the operation of the new cleaner-that is, if a person is shown how to use it, the pitfalls and dangers of it, and how to get the best out of it-that is closely supervised practice. If, however, the cleaner is in some back room under a pile of rubbish and the person says to an employee `There it is, go to it', that is not closely supervised training; it is just work experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The distinction between the two has been drawn often in professional areas. In fact, almost every profession has a distinction between those two and has employed it for a long time. I have discussed this matter with a number of industries, and the industries know the difference. I think that the structure will be very easy to operate in practice in the industries themselves. I wish to ask a question which arises from clause 43 and deals with the ability under that clause for there to be a shopping exercise in relation to one's structured training course. If one nips off to a particular registered industry agent and finds that that agent does not think too highly about one's structured course, one can go to someone else and then someone else again. In fact, one will be able to make a tour until one finds someone who is willing to agree to that particular structured course. That seems to me to be a very undesirable practice. Has the Government looked at this item and will it be covered in the guidelines?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is very much aware of the problem and this will be one of the issues that will be considered in developing the guidelines which operate for industry training agents. For instance, if an agent rejects a training program but fails to provide adequate advice to the employer on how to structure the program in order to make it eligible, then the employer should be able to seek advice from another agent. However, we would not want an employer who had his training program rejected by one industry training agent to take that rejected program to another agent rather than appealing the decision to the training advisory body. The training advisory body will monitor the performance of industry training agents, so it should be difficult for them to provide certificates incorrectly over a long period. These two responses indicate that this is a issue on which the Government will keep an eye.</PARA></TALK.START>

During the comments that have been made across the chamber, it has become fairly clear that recognition will be given to `closely supervised practice'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately three Bills, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1990, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990. Each of these Bills could well do with a separate debate, but because of the time schedule the Government has brought these together and we are, in effect, debating three entirely unrelated Bills. However, I thank Senator McMullan for at least separating one Bill, which was debated earlier, because in the other House they had to face the prospect of debating four unrelated Bills in a very restricted time. Fortunately, we have slightly more time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1989 failed to pass through the Parliament before the March election and was introduced earlier this year to give effect to the Budget announcement relating to the timing of remittances of pay as you earn (PAYE) deductions and to adjust the operation of the quarterly instalment system of paying provisional tax. This Bill repeats the earlier remitter provisions but omits the provisional tax proposals of that earlier Bill. The Government's failure to organise its program adequately to serve passage of a Bill before the election necessitated the Australian Taxation Office revising most provisional tax assessments. Since there was no legislation for several of the components in the original assessments, such as the uplift factor amongst others, I believe that the Australian Taxation Office handled the situation very professionally. However, there needs to be a mechanism to overcome a future situation of this kind. In fact, most taxpayers received reduced assessments but some had increased demands over what they expected to pay in situations, particularly where their taxable incomes tended to fall as compared with the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the earlier remitter measures, group employers who have total PAYE remittances exceeding $5m for a financial year will be required to pay group tax twice per month in lieu of the current practice of once per month. This stage is the first step towards PAYE remittance arrangements aimed at moving, according to the Government, larger group employers to a bi-monthly system, and small employers, comprising the majority of the remitters, to a less frequent payment system than at present and possibly with the discontinuation of the tax stamp system. We have had a lot of criticism of alleged pressure to move some of these people off the tax stamp system. I endorse the move to less frequent remittances from the small employers. That is one of the reasons why we are not proceeding with some of the amendments that we had proposed earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the 1989 Bill the Government claimed that the estimate of the one-off revenue gain would be $550m in 1989-90. This claim, strangely, is repeated in respect of the current Bill, notwithstanding, that it is not intended to operate until June 1990, whereas the other Bill operated from 1989. Given the procedures necessary to be undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office once this legislation is passed to put these measures into place, I think it is doubtful that the full amount could be realised. However, I am not prepared to estimate what the figure should be. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the consideration of the issues, this Bill is one of last year's Budget Bills. The changes to PAYE remittances will have the effect of bringing forward revenue from 1989-90 to 1990-91. We have described that as an example of the innovative accounting of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) designed to magnify the size of the Budget surplus in this financial year. Essentially, the major component of the $550m is a timing difference. It will dress up the surplus for the current year. In effect, the interest gain will be quite small. In part, one must dispute the financial impact of the $550m since this is an exact repeat of the figure when the Bill was introduced last year, and yet this time around it will not operate until the month of June. It is now going to have an operation of only one month. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989 Bill was blocked by the Senate on three occasions. A Senate amendment sought to exempt public benevolent institutions from the earlier remitters provisions for the following reasons. We believed, as an Opposition, that at the time there was a lack of recognition by the Commonwealth of the shortfall, which this measure would introduce, to these sorts of institutions so far as their revenue was concerned and it would cause them a loss of working capital. However, in the intervening period we have had over six months, and almost a new financial year, in which governments, both State and Federal, have had time to rectify this Budget position. At the time we acknowledged the unique position of these institutions utilising public funds for community purposes. Honourable senators must recall that we pressed the Government on three occasions in regard to this matter. The Government was quite heartless and failed to recognise this important position faced by these community organisations which included public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and community purposes. It was really a question of just how far can an opposition press a government on humanitarian grounds to recognise an urgent need within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the new arrangements virtually amount to unannounced tax on these institutions, which have limited power to recover the extra charges, because the finance for these organisations have been established in the previous year. Yet after 1 July we had a further impost which they would not normally have been able to cover and there would have been a shortfall of funds which we detailed at some length last year. The fact that these institutions are already exempted from a wide range of both Federal and State taxes I believe, highlighted an obvious anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that in the intervening time the Opposition has had lots of representations from other non-profit organisations seeking to be covered in our exemptions. We were very cognisant of the fact that, once one starts introducing particular items for exemption, there will always be difficulties for those who are left out. We are in favour of making a tax system fair to everybody of all classes across the board. We believe that six months has given these organisations time to reorganise their accounting routines. Because of the proximity to the start of the new financial year to get the additional revenue that they need, we will not be proceeding with the original amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time we still recognise that the Government has failed to give proper regard to the negative cash flow that this Bill will have on public funded bodies such as hospitals, universities and public benevolent institutions. On the other hand, we have to recognise that there is a quid pro quo in that the Government says that as part of this deal it is offering small employers a strategy of paying group tax much less frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's decision not to pursue the amendments was taken recognising that the institutions concerned have now had over six months to reorganise their payroll systems and that the Government has had a similar time to adjust for extra finance to compensate for the loss of working capital. It is not our responsibility to back-door finance to these sorts of organisations. It is the Government's responsibility to provide finance through the normal financing patterns. So the only period where there should be a genuine shortfall is probably less than one month. </PARA>
<PARA> To pursue the amendment further, we believe, would be both technical and difficult to justify, given that it is a Budget measure and that the Government deems this money to be absolutely necessary. The Government raised the fallacious argument that it would impact on the Government's decision as to whether interest rates could be lowered at that time, but I suppose any argument is better than none in a storm or when one is in an embattled position. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the amendments we posed at the time should never have been seen as a replacement for funding from both Commonwealth and State governments. Government assistance to public benevolent institutions, hospitals and universities is provided for by means of outlay measures which are subject to review each 1 July. Seeing that these will be reviewed to operate from 1 July, these institutions as a result of our delaying tactics will now only have to suffer a penalty for less than one month. </PARA>
<PARA> Further consideration had to be given to the Government's response that it was the first step in small employers paying group tax less frequently, a decision which the coalition welcomes and which we did not want to jeopardise.</PARA>
<PARA> It has never been the coalition's intention to play politics with government-I used this word in the sales tax debate the other day-in regard to what I call genuine, non-political revenue-raising legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A flaw which we raised in regard to the earlier Bill still remains, that is, the inconsistency in the time period in which remittances must be made. A group employer paying its employees on the fourteenth of the month gets only seven days to make the remittance, as it must be paid by the twenty-first of the month. However, a group employer paying its employees on the fifteenth of the month has 22 days to make the payment, which is not due until the seventh of the following month. So in its present form the amendment Bill will serve only to encourage businesses to pay their employees once a month, preferably on the fifteenth, with their pay as you earn remittances due on the seventh of the next month. Thus the revenue gain will be minimal. A far more equitable and cleaner arrangement would have been for payment to fall due either seven or 14 days after payday for those group employers affected by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this Bill was drafted rather hastily has resulted in a possible loophole for large employers in that there are no grouping arrangements. I find this rather strange. What large employers can do is split off into company A and company B for the purposes of group remittances and avoid the twice monthly provisions. So a certain weakness exists in the drafting of the Bill. There should have been provision for consolidation to stop the artificial demarcation of companies into separate companies simply for the purpose of overcoming the early remittances provisions. The loophole will be exploited by certain companies. It was an issue that we raised earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990 addresses at least 10 principal areas. Two of these areas, quarterly provisional tax and provisional tax instalments for 1990-91, replace similar measures previously contained in Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, which lapsed due to the election, and which have been omitted from the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1990, which I have just discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> The section on quarterly provisional tax gives effect to two Budget proposals adjusting the operation of the instalments system for the paying of provisional tax. Effective for assessments on or after 4 December 1989, the threshold for general provisional tax exemption will be increased from $5,000 to $8,000-I note that date because if we did not have that date included there would be further complications such as the necessity to have a further revision of provisional tax arrangements-and this exemption is applicable to provisional tax payable in the current year and subsequent years. In addition, any excess provisional tax credit no longer will be offset against a quarterly instalment of provisional tax for the succeeding year which has been notified but is not yet due for payment. This is a matter that we have been pressing on the Government and the Tax Commissioner for quite some time because it is a matter of some concern to provisional taxpayers. So we welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to provisional tax instalments for 1990-91, where the amount of a taxpayer's instalment of provisional tax for 1990-91 would ordinarily be calculated by reference to his total liability for provisional tax for 1989-90, those amounts are instead to be determined by reference to a notional income. These are the sorts of problems that the Government got itself into by its failure to properly organise its legislative program before the March election. The amount of that total notional liability will be the amount that would have been determined in accordance with the method proposed by the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 had that Bill become law. I believe that this is further reason why we do need, in similar circumstances in the future, a mechanism to overcome these sorts of impasses. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned previously that we need this sort of mechanism. As one can see from the legislation, the Government has made the changes to the tax law apply even though they were not passed at the appropriate time. I trust that no penalties will apply to those who may have done their tax calculations according to the previous rules in this instance due to a lack of ruling. To do otherwise, in the absence of such a mechanism, I believe would be unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the various laws as a result of amendments to Commonwealth and State companies codes, allowing companies to buy back shares in themselves, are also included in this amendment Bill. The arrangements whereby the amount paid to a shareholder for a share will be taken to be a dividend to the extent that the amount is drawn from the company's distributable profits, except where the buy back is made on the stock exchange, is agreeable to the coalition. For Australian-owned, non-resident companies the exemption which excluded them from the definition of foreign controller, and hence from the scope of the thin capitalisation control system, is removed effectively from 1 July 1990. This term `thin capitalisation' is used to describe the funding of foreign investment in Australia that is excessively geared with in-house loans instead of equity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a distinct tax advantage in maximising the amount of in-house debt, which allows profits to be lifted to the foreign owner in the form of tax deductable interest payments, rather than in the form of non-deductable dividends. So the thin capitalisation rules control profit shifting by imposing maximum permissible debt-equity ratios on foreign controlled Australian enterprises where the prescribed ratio is exceeded. Interest deductions are derived on excess debt owing to the foreign controller and other non-resident associates. Thus the lifting of the exemption for Australian-owned non-resident companies to thin capitalisation rules would imply that they are now subject to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition notes that the gift provisions for gifts of $2 to the National Foundation for Australian Women Limited, Landcare Australian Limited and the Foundation for Development Cooperation Ltd will be tax deductable under this Bill. The inclusion of Landcare Australia is particularly pleasing to the Opposition, as we believe there is a large amount of work to be done on combating soil erosion, which this group undertakes. We also note an extension, which is part of the Government's shipping reform strategy, of the current fiscal regime for new ships for a further period of five years from 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition also concurs with the fringe benefits tax amendments included with this amendment, which will extend the period of amortising the taxable value of certain fringe benefits provided under remote area home ownership schemes from seven to 15 years, subject, of course, to certain conditions of ownership being met. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of quoting the tax file numbers for investment purposes, certain investors are to be exempt from these requirements. The Bill will widen the manner in which pensioners may claim an exemption from quoting a tax file number other than in writing and including by phone. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the need for superannuation funds to obtain actuarial certification when claiming deductions for the cost of death and disability cover for members of the fund will ease the burden of people in these strenuous situations. I think this was a matter that I referred to in earlier legislation about two years ago. It is pleasing to see it introduced now but I regret that it has taken two years. Having just passed other superannuation Bills this week, which will no doubt create more work for the superannuation funds, I trust that this amendment will work towards easing their administrative load. In discussing those Bills I did put to the Government further measures aimed at easing the administrative load and increasing the efficiency of those funds. I trust the Government will proceed in that direction but I hope it will not take two years to effect it. In summary, the coalition does not object to the Bill and will not propose any amendments, nor oppose its passage. However, I will raise certain matters in the committee stage. Because of the time constraints in this second reading stage of this Bill, I will raise other matters during the committee stage of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). This addresses a significant number of measures, most of which arose as a result of the 1989 Budget. The first measure is in regard to beneficiary rebates. Currently a rebate is granted for social security beneficiaries, which includes sickness, unemployment and job search allowance, so that where these payments are the person's sole or predominant source of income no tax is payable. This is a fair and reasonable amendment. We have no problems. It is proposed to vary the rebate on an age related basis because the various social security benefits are now paid on this basis. For example, those in receipt of the single, under 18 years and living at home benefit will have a separate rebate for tax from those on single, under 18 and living away from home benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the Medicare levy measure, the coalition welcomes the addressing of the anomaly where an exempt person has a dependant who pays the full levy and then when the exempt person must pay half the Medicare levy that his or her income would otherwise require. This covers, basically, people in the Defence Force. In other words, they were no longer exempt. This amendment, we believe, rectifies the situation, which will be particularly pleasing to people associated with the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The third measure relates to losses. I will debate this in a little more detail at the committee stage; but currently taxpayers are allowed to carry forward losses incurred for income tax purposes for seven years. If they have not been recouped by that time they lapse. For primary production losses and capital losses, an unlimited carry forward is allowed. This Bill proposes allowing unlimited carry forward for income losses incurred in 1989-90 and subsequent years. Some criticism has been levelled at this move in terms of not allowing income tax losses only and not all losses to be carried forward indefinitely. However, the coalition does not propose to amend this legislation. That is a decision of government; it has to carry it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth measure relates to quarrying operations. Again we have some concern here because there is a number of inconsistencies. Special deductions have been available for decades for capital expenditure in connection with mining and petroleum operations. These provisions have not applied to quarrying operations because of a High Court decision to that effect in 1969. However, just prior to the Budget the Federal Court ruled that open cut extraction of limestone to produce cement was mining. Thus, the extension to formally include quarrying operations in all except two instances can be viewed as affirming the Federal Court decision and a modifying of the rules accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst mine development expenditure is allowed as a deduction over the life of the mine or for 10 years, whichever is the shorter, because of the generally longer life of quarries, development expenditure is proposed to be allowed as a deduction over the life of the quarry or for 20 years, whichever is the shorter. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, capital expenditure on housing and welfare to employees is deductable for mining purposes. Because of the proximity of quarries to urban areas, the value of the land and the buildings provided to employees would be expected to maintain or increase in value and hence no tax benefit would be appropriate in these circumstances. I would like to put to the Government that a fairer concept would have been to exclude housing welfare except where the quarry is located in an isolated rural area, rather than having a total exemption. Had it followed this course I believe it would not have got itself so confused over some of these provisions. As I will explain in the committee stage of this debate, a number of the provisions are superfluous and redundant or unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth measure extends the current income tax exemption for non-profit clubs which are engaged in athletic sports or games in which human beings are the sole participants to all non-profit bodies established for the promotion of or encouragement of any game or sport or community purposes. Again, in the committee stage I will be referring specifically to a problem that arises in relation to clause 6. The coalition applauds this move by the Government in encouraging sporting and community service based bodies who, we believe, make a very important contribution to our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth area covered is the removal of the income tax exemption for the Australian Wool Testing Authority. This company, which was formed in 1982, has had a tax exemption applicable since then. In order that it operate as a competitive player in the market place, as was originally intended, again we support the move to remove this tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh and eighth amendments deal with dividend streaming of imputation and securities lending arrangements. I have several comments that I would like to make in relation to this. Problems associated with recent chemical contamination of land have placed farmers in a difficult position where they voluntarily dispose of livestock. The new provisions provide relief by extending concessions to voluntary disposal of livestock, similar to those available for certain specified forced sales of animals. Owners who voluntarily dispose of stock arising from contamination of land may either use the profit to reduce the cost of the replacement stock or spread the profits forward by equal instalments over five years. Following these amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act, we now provide a concessional taxation basis in circumstances of profits now arising from voluntary disposals resulting from contamination of land, death or compulsory destruction of livestock for control or eradication of disease, and finally fire, drought and flood. </PARA>
<PARA> The tenth item covered by the legislation is the increase in the pensioner rebate. This will ensure that a single pensioner may earn non-pensionable income up to the income test free limit of $40 per week and married pensioners up to $70 per week combined and still not pay tax. In the case of married pensioners, the transferring of the rebate excess from one spouse to another I believe will be a move appreciated by the pensioners. The date on which this ruling is to have effect has been causing some concern. The change was proposed in April 1989, almost 12 months ago. As I understand it, it is to apply to the financial year 1989-90. However, as recently as last week I had a constituent contact me to say that social security was not acknowledging the new ruling and thus she was being penalised by having her pension benefits cut despite her husband's excess rebate. I trust this matter will be cleared up by the passage of this Bill and that she will receive entitlements to the announced date. I would like a clarification on that, if I may, during the response. </PARA>
<PARA> The eleventh item refers to allowable tax deductions for gifts of $2 or more to a number of worthwhile organisations. I am particularly pleased to see deductability allowed for the life education centres. The work being done through these centres for today's youth will be invaluable in future years when we have a generation coming through who refuse to become involved with drugs and alcohol to the detriment of their bodies as a result of the learning they have received through these life education centres. </PARA>
<PARA> The twelfth item refers to a change in relation to Australian films. It covers division 10ba which provides generous tax concessions for tax investment in Australian films. This is a technical change. Tax concessions for the funds invested have to be deposited in the Australian Film Industry Trust Fund. The amendment before the Senate today removes this requirement and will, I believe, simplify the administration of this concession. </PARA>
<PARA> The thirteenth measure exempts from sales tax imported uncut precious and semi-precious gemstones and imported coins. Since sales tax is not levied on Australian produced uncut diamonds or Australian coins, it was deemed appropriate to also exempt imported equivalents. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, because of the shortage of time, perhaps I may refer to the tax file number and the scrip lending during the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank Senator Watson for his broad support for the three Bills that are before us and, as usual, for the constructive nature of his comments. Can I respond to some of the points which need response at this stage; others, more appropriately, will be dealt with, as he has indicated, in that committee stage. Senator Watson queried in two ways the question of the $550m. I suppose none of us can be absolutely certain, until after the event, whether that is the precise amount. His other question was: how could it be a $550m bring forward if we passed it in December and still be a $550m bring forward if we pass it in May?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that there will be one fortnightly payment brought forward that would not otherwise have been made in this financial year, whenever the Bill is passed. All the other fortnightly payments which would have been made have been caught up in the monthly payments. There may be some slight effect but it will be substantially the same. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the public benevolent institution point that Senator Watson made, I do not accept the original reasons that he put forward, and the Government never did. I will not reiterate the debate about that. One of the problems with the Senate is that we have that debate too often. We certainly do not want to have it again now. I do acknowledge that even if those arguments had been valid at the time, the six months that have passed since the matter was first debated would satisfactorily have obviated them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson also raised a concern about grouping provisions. At the moment we think that the question of people entering into artificial arrangements to avoid liability is adequately addressed through two parts of the Bill. The new section 221ed in clause 4 groups wholly owned companies for the purpose of applying the threshold. Also, the new subsection 221ec (5) allows the Commissioner to determine that an employer remit twice monthly. We think that those two proposals overcome the perceived drafting weakness. We are confident that that will prove to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want, at this stage, to go into any of the matters raised in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). Anything that needs to be dealt with can be dealt with in the committee stage. I do note Senator Watson's claim that we are two years behind him in regard to one matter. Without necessarily conceding it, I think it is an indication of the role that debate in the Senate can sometimes play. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 2, there are two matters that Senator Watson raised that I think need to be looked at: the question of deductability for housing for quarries in isolated rural areas and the definition of community welfare groups. I am not sure that the suggestions he is raising for possible future consideration are ones that will necessarily improve the situation, particularly the one concerning the definition of community groups. I understand the point he is trying to achieve. I think the change might, in fact, narrow rather than broaden the matter, but we will deal with that in the committee stage. On the question on which he sought clarification, that is essentially a Department of Social Security matter on which we will try to get some advice to him as soon as possible. I do not have any information to provide at the moment. I thank honourable senators for their support and urge the passage of the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, this Bill is not opposed by the Opposition but, in saying that, we recognise that there are some aspects of it which may cause concern for the future. Given the number of present and former Commonwealth public servants that live in my electorate, it is not surprising that it is a matter in which I take an interest. No doubt the Minister on duty at this time will do so also. It is a Bill which will result, perhaps, in hardship to some public servants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not surprising that the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers Association is very concerned about the way the Bill may be implemented and operated and the impact that it will have on its members. I think it is totally reasonable to think that a person who has been off work for a long period, while he might seem to be medically fit and able to earn, is not able to obtain any form of employment. He may even have lost some of the skills that he had previously and thus not have any skills which would enable him to re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the concern of the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers' Association is that the able to earn provision should not be implemented harshly and its implementation should take into account the fact that some people may have been off work for quite a long time. Implementation should take into account the social consequences of that being the case. Sudden withdrawal can be quite traumatic indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that the scheme should be administered sympathetically. We ask the Government to give an undertaking that it will be administered sympathetically and take into account hardship. We give an undertaking that we will be monitoring the operation of this Bill very closely indeed. I certainly will. I shall bring to the Senate any cases where I believe there is hardship and where sufficient sympathy has not been exercised in its operation. </PARA>

<PARA>This particular matter is one of long-standing in terms of the Senate. This particular Bill was first introduced on 26 October last year and it was passed in November. In the committee stage Senator Watson moved an amendment that the Australian Democrats supported. That went down to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives disagreed to the amendment on 27 November and sent it back up to us. The Senate insisted on its amendment on 30 November and sent it back down to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives disagreed with the Senate's amendment and sent it back to us on 30 November. The Senate continued to insist on it on 11 December and sent it back down to the House of Representatives. The Bill has now come back to us today. Unfortunately, at this stage the Opposition has indicated that it will go to water on the exercise and allow the Government to pass this particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 November, Senator McLean, speaking for the Australian Democrats, said this with regard to the amendment then proposed by Senator Watson:</PARA>
<PARA>We identify with the amendment proposed by Senator Watson, which simply reverts to an exemption which has been granted under previous tax policies to hospitals, benevolent organisations and universities in not imposing upon them an unnecessary requirement to meet twice monthly group tax payments. We cite that exemption as having been appropriate in the past. We have not had a reasonable explanation from the Treasury as to why that exemption should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>On 2 November, speaking to his amendment, Senator Watson moved that amendment and then said this:</PARA>
<PARA>In opposing the amendment, the legislation will go down to the other House and will then come back again. It is not a taxing measure. We are not taking money away because, as I mentioned, it is a machinery Bill; it is just rearranging the collection of tax. It has an indirect effect. If the Government is using this measure as a taxing Bill, then it is a disgrace. It is morally wrong and outrageous to use the back-door methods that it will be attempting to apply to get extra revenue from public hospitals and public universities which, according to its logic, the Government should not be doing. </PARA>

For five years it operated as a self-help organisation relying on the voluntary efforts of members and their families and friends. After it received a community development fund grant of about $5,000 in 1984, it employed a part time welfare worker, which enabled it to expand its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the following year it received a large and very generous donation from Miss Gloria McKerrow which permitted it to proceed with some of the things it had been talking about and to meet the needs of the community in a different way. At that time it employed a part time executive director and set about raising funds to build a facility in Canberra. There had been extensive consultations under the leadership of the then President, Sir John Overall, to ascertain what members of the Society and their families believed would benefit them and were needed. A firm of architects was engaged, a block of land was obtained at Deakin, and a building was built. The Society recognised at the time that there were to be three stages in the construction: initially, a day care centre and some office accommodation; subsequently, a very much needed respite care house; and, eventually-and this has not yet happened-a separate office block. </PARA>
<PARA> The suitability of this site included that it is near the centre of Canberra; it provides reasonable access from all suburbs; it is on the ACTION bus route; it is only about a kilometre from shops; it is opposite a swimming complex with facilities for people with disabilities; it is close to the John James Hospital, which has doctors and other specialists relevant to people with multiple sclerosis; it is near the rehabilitation services of the Woden Valley Hospital; and is near two schools, both of which indicated that they would welcome interaction between students and the Society's members. So the proposal proceeded. A public fund to raise money was successful and stage one was built. Miss McKerrow gave a subsequent large donation which enabled the second stage to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister for Community Services and Health, the Honourable Neal Blewett, MP, opened the first stage on 10 November 1987. It was a day care centre. People suffering from multiple sclerosis and similar problems could go to the centre and engage in activities and discussions. It removed them from being socially isolated, as many were, and gave them the opportunity to meet other people. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage involves a four-bedroom respite care house. Respite care is something that is desperately needed in Canberra at all levels. It is something that is very scarce. This house was built at a cost of just over $200,000 and was opened on 20 February 1989. The reason I am raising this matter today is that it has scarcely been able to be used since that time because the Government, for the most extraordinary reason, has refused to consider appropriate funding for it that would be available in any other situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The day care centre which I referred to has operated most successfully over the last 18 months. Over 100 people attend each month and participate in a range of activities. The respite care house can be used only by those who can afford to care for themselves totally or who have a carer that they can bring with them. Of course, not all people can afford to do this. All others are excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> Applications have been submitted to the Department of Community Services and Health under the Disability Services Act, and to the Australian Capital Territory Government. Some money came from the Australian Capital Territory Government but all avenues have been rejected by the Department of Community Services and Health and the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons why funding has been rejected make interesting reading. The Society has been told that the respite care house is not in a residential area. It has been built in Deakin on land provided by the Government. At the time, it was the Federal Government which approved construction on that site. But another part of the same Federal Government, the Department of Community Services and Health, rejected funding for people going there for respite care because it is not in a residential area. It is right next to the day care centre. Any person who goes there for respite care is able then to go across the path to the day care centre and mix with other people without any travel and transport hassles. It is, I would say, less than two kilometres from a street with residential houses. If it happened to be located two kilometres away, it would get funding. It is not isolated; it is not out in the middle of the Brindabella Ranges on it own; but it is said that it is not located in a residential area. Yet it has been approved by the proper authorities to be what it is-a respite care house-in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason given-and in some ways from the correspondence one might think that this is the more significant reason-is that it is on the same site as the day care centre. I defy anybody to give an explanation that makes sense of that. The day care centre is the place to which people with disabilities go for companionship; to indulge in activities that they are able to partake in together; a place where they can talk and have meetings with doctors, physiotherapists or others and generally share some social interaction of which they are otherwise deprived. But it is on the same site as the day care centre. If it were not on the same site as the day care centre it could receive the appropriate funding that the Department of Community Services and Health would otherwise make available for those who were eligible to use it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Society says that it is there for short term respite purposes with a maximum occupation of three weeks. It is not a permanent residence. There is no intention for it to be that; it would not be suitable for that. It is for respite care. Very significantly, it gives people staying there for a time an opportunity, while they are away from their home indulging in respite care, to be near other people and not to be isolated, as might otherwise be the case, had they stayed in their normal home and were merely visited by someone to provide services from time to time. It means that they have interaction with a variety of people and that is of benefit to them. It provides easy access to both the paid staff of the Multiple Sclerosis Society and to the volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA> The present location was determined after extensive consultation with all of the people concerned. It is on an absolutely lovely site which has an absolutely splendid view of the Brindabella Ranges. It could not be a more appropriate location. I could say that the decision is mindless; I could say that it is unbelievable. The building was opened, I remind the Senate, in February 1989. The Society has been more than patient in attempting to deal with government to work its way around these unbelievable barriers which have been placed in front of it-that it is not in a residential area and that it is on the same site as the day care centre. I cannot believe its patience. It has worked hard to continue to raise funds to enable the building to be used as best it can. I invite honourable senators to go and look at it to see how lovely it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will scarcely believe this: the Society has been told that funds could be provided on an interim basis while it finds a permanent site in another location. One really cannot credit that anybody could have said such a thing. Of course, there would be an additional capital cost to acquire another place. Let us remember that it is on the same site as the day care centre, so it cannot be sold as it is of no use to anybody else for any other purpose. The concept of placing it elsewhere does not meet with the users' wishes. The members of the Society do not want that to happen because they recognise the isolation that would flow from it and the additional costs of transport to bring people staying in the respite care house to the day care centre each day so they could have some companionship. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about the recurrent costs which would enable those who cannot afford to use the respite care house from their own resources to have access to the sort of government funding which is available and which other people get. Others are not deprived of it because their buildings are not located on the same site as a day care centre and they are located in a residential area.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is present, knows of this story. I hope that he will not just regard this as a Thursday lunchtime chatter during which time senators get things off their chests. I hope he and I between us can see that the mindless bureaucracy that somehow interprets rules to allow a thing like this to happen can be changed and that this Society can get on with the work towards which the community here has so generously donated. It is not as though government has been asked for the capital costs. The buildings have been built with donations from Miss McKerrow and public subscriptions. It just seems unbelievable, and that is why I bring the matter to the attention of the Senate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday next week it will be one year since the massacre by the Chinese military of peaceful demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. I think it is timely to reflect on this tragic anniversary, to look at what has happened since to the People's Republic of China and at what implications there are for Australia's relations with one of the major regional powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amnesty International, as honourable senators are aware, issued a comprehensive report in mid-May this year which put to rest any lingering doubts about the scale of the Chinese military crackdown on the peaceful student and worker pro-democracy demonstrations. Amnesty's figures contrast sharply with those of the Chinese leadership in their revisionist assessment of how the peaceful demonstrators were crushed. Sadly, some of the same misinformation has been given credence in Australia. This is most certainly to be regretted. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International says that over 1,000 citizens were killed in Beijing alone, and at least 6,000 have been detained, tried or executed throughout the country since the June crackdown. The real number of those who have been detained, it is believed, runs into the tens of thousands. In its report Amnesty lists more than 650 prisoners that it has been able to identify. Given the forthcoming sad anniversary, I think it is appropriate for the Australian Government to call on the Chinese Government to reveal what has happened to these many thousands of unidentified prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty also noted in its report that secret executions had been extensive. Although only a few dozen executions have been publicly reported, some sources say several hundred people were secretly killed in Beijing alone between June and August last year. Of course, following the massacre there was widespread international condemnation of the killings and the People's Republic of China was subjected to wide diplomatic isolation. Many Western nations undertook some form of protest to express their disapproval over China's actions. Although there have been some attempts at normalising relations-notably by the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom-this process has not gone far. Indeed, the limited sanctions that have been applied, notably on military weapons, have had an effect on the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA> One interesting aspect of the international condemnation of the regime's activities is that China's current international isolation has been compounded by the massive political changes in the Soviet Union and in eastern Europe. At a time when eastern Europe is opening to the winds of democratic change, seemingly, the People's Republic of China is heading in the opposite direction towards greater repression and state control over the daily lives of its people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the aftermath of June 1989 there have been some dramatic changes within the People's Republic, both at the political and at the economic levels. There has been widespread police action, including arrests and executions. This suggests that overt political repression has become a routine instrument of control of the leadership of the People's Republic of China. While the regime admitted in October 1989 to a total of 2,500 detainees as of late June, according to informed Western observers nationwide arrests are probably somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000. Of great concern to Australia should be the comments by the President of the Supreme People's Court which discounted the notion of the presumption of innocence of the accused. </PARA>
<PARA> The repression is aimed, of course, both at the intellectuals, the students, and at the ordinary working people. It has been assisted by a compliant judiciary and a renewed propaganda campaign against the so-called `bourgeois liberalisation'. Despite the lifting of martial law on 11 January this year, indications are that the campaign of repression is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> China's leadership has recognised the importance of political stability, both for its own personal reasons and for the sake of ensuring continued Communist Party leadership. To this end there has been a deliberate policy of political stabilisation. Amongst other things, this has involved a re-emphasis on orthodox ideology and a move to strengthen the organisational and ideological leadership of the party. The current leadership has stressed the need for ideological indoctrination through the inculcation of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong thought. This is currently being juxtaposed against that bourgeois liberalism which I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> At the national level, the current leadership is inherently unstable. This is, of course, as a result of the current policy of political repression, the continuing problem of political succession, given the age of many of the current leaders, and as a result of the growing role of the military in political affairs, as is witnessed by the substantial increase in the defence budget. Of course, that could be seen as both a cause and a function of the instability. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the elderly Deng Xiaoping, who has resigned from all official party posts and government leadership positions, seemingly retains a supreme control position, is obviously indicative of the very delicate and unstable nature of the leadership issue, which is unlikely to be resolved until Deng Xiaoping dies and then, of course, only by a clash between the conservative and progressive elements of the leadership factions. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with the importance of political stability, the People's Republic regime has also recognised the importance of economic stability. This is spelt out in the decision of the Fifth Plenum, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Economic stability is the foundation of political stability. If the economy is in trouble for prolonged periods, it will be difficult to have political stability and maintain social order. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence the emphasis of the current regime on a policy of political stabilisation to try to control what was in fact a rapidly overheating economy. The regime's emphasis has been on a return to the 1950s style of planned economy, with priority being given to state-owned large and medium enterprises. The factory manager responsibility system, introduced under the previous party secretary, Zhao Ziyang, is now obviously under threat. So, too, are the advances in production and efficiency which were made under that free enterprise system. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospects for stabilisation of China's economy are not good. The inflation rate last year was in excess of 20 per cent and industrial output increased only marginally. Most commentators believe that in the first quarter of this year China had nil economic growth; it may even have been negative. One result of the new economic policy restrictions post-June 1989 was the increase in unemployment, which went from 2 per cent to 4 per cent of the work force-that is, four million people. The real prospect of increasing unemployment tends also to enhance social and political instability, thereby ensuring continuing economic instability. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout all of this turmoil, my Party has been supportive of the Government's policy with regard to our bilateral relations with China. We supported the full review of our relations, encompassing diplomatic, cultural, economic, development assistance, and political relations. We supported the broad thrust of what the Government was doing in cutting off party and political visits. Of course, there are now signs that the Government is relaxing this stance. There was a visit recently by the Chinese metallurgical Minister to Western Australia, to attend the opening of a joint venture. Similarly, the Australian Government has altered its earlier policy of suspending all ministerial visits. We now have a policy of reviewing each visit on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairly obviously, a fine line must be drawn with regard to the question of our relations with the People's Republic. On the one hand we have to recognise China as a major regional and, indeed, world power. The nations of the region have a direct interest in ensuring that China remains an important pillar of regional stability. From Australia's point of view, it is obviously important that some lines of communication be nurtured so that our interests and concerns can be made known to the People's Republic. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Democrats believe strongly that Australia should continue to speak out on human rights abuses in the People's Republic, and that this be a continuing factor in our bilateral relations. The recent report by the United States based human rights group, Asia Watch, which concluded that the Chinese authorities have increased the use of torture and political repression to suppress Tibetans is, of course, of great concern in this regard. We should reject outright Chinese criticism of so-called `interference in its internal affairs' and maintain the international push for the basic recognition and acceptance of fundamental human rights throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Australian Democrats' point of view we urge the Government not to take the road that the United States Administration has taken with regard to the Chinese leadership. The United States has, to quote a media headline, `dropped human rights for ruthless pragmatism'. While there are some important economic arguments for continuing preferential trade relations with China for the United States, the Bush Administration's rhetoric on human rights concerns has not been matched by its actions. We have seen the same thing happen with regard to United States relations with the Soviet Union on the issue of the Baltic states. We will be better able to judge Australia's position with regard to these matters when we have seen the results of the current review of the position of Chinese students in Australia, which the Government is currently undertaking. It is our hope that the Australian Government will not wash its hands of its responsibilities as a good international citizen and that it will continue to highlight human rights abuses wherever they may occur, regardless of the attitude taken by those countries. Many people in China still doubtlessly thirst for democracy. I think it is very important that, whatever Australia does, we not be seen to be supporting, in any shape or form, the repression which occurred and that any subsequent movements with regard to our relations with the People's Republic of China be based very firmly on the basis that we want it to understand our total abhorrence of the human rights abuses that occurred at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my hope that the transition in leadership in China will be peaceful, and that that transition will lead to a freeing up of the political regime within China. I hope that, in time, we will see China follow the route that so many other Communist countries have followed: that it will recognise that the repression, abuse, torture and killing of its own citizens is not the path to stability and that, indeed, the only way is to trust its own people and truly to become a People's Republic of China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the conservation issues that I have raised while I have been in this chamber I would have to say that the south-east forests of New South Wales would take first place, for a number of reasons. The first reason is that I have had a long professional association with those forests in acting as a scientific editor on studies conducted on the effect of woodchipping on wildlife in those forests. I have such a real appreciation of these particular native forests in south-east New South Wales that I was prepared to be arrested twice. This was not a light decision that I took because I am what is known as a cleanskin; I had never been arrested before and certainly had no convictions. I was certainly not the only one. More than 700 people were arrested in the south-east forests of New South Wales last year, including many prominent figures and many, many more ordinary citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In raising the issue of the south-east forests so many times last year and, indeed, devoting to it the only matter of public importance that I was allocated in my term in parliament, I felt that I was representing the concerns of conservationists and locals living in the area and whose campaign led to the National Estate of the south-east forests becoming an issue of national concern. As a result of the concern expressed by so many people and my own concern, last year I introduced a Bill, the Australian Heritage Commission (National Estate Protection) Amendment Bill, in an attempt to provide the Government with a piece of legislation that it could usefully adopt, not to prohibit logging and other activities in the National Estate areas, but merely to regulate activities by foreign and domestic corporations which might adversely affect National Estate areas. In other words, it was not a piece of ambit legislation but a moderate and very realistic piece of legislation that I thought the Government could very usefully have adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, both the former environment Minister, Senator Richardson, and the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, threatened to use the corporations power of the Constitution-perhaps I should not say threatened but promised-in relation to the south-east forests of New South Wales. Not long after I commenced the drafting process for this Bill, the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), Director, Phillip Toyne, sent a letter to Prime Minister Hawke in May last year in which he specifically requested that the Government use its corporations power under the Constitution to protect the National Estate in the south-east forests of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> In the latter part of the year the other major conservation group in this country, the Wilderness Society, launched, with much fanfare, a National Estate campaign at which Senator Richardson was the guest and major speaker. After the request by ACF Director Phillip Toyne and the launch of the Wilderness Society campaign, it was a great disappointment to myself and the many thousands of people concerned about the protection of the National Estate forests in New South Wales and elsewhere that the two main conservation groups in this country did not make this an issue during the election campaign. The much heralded Wilderness Society campaign sank without a trace during the election campaign and Phillip Toyne's letter was put on the back-burner by the Australian Conservation Foundation-much to the relief, I suppose, of the Government. I think the lack of judgment by those two groups and their inability or unwillingness to negotiate forcefully with the Government in the lead-up to the election led to the loss of a major opportunity to protect those forests and led also to the disappointment of many thousands of conservationists around the country who had been concerned about them. </PARA>
<PARA> Very recently, in fact just this month, there was the release of a report by two museum scientists. The report is called Wildlife Conservation in the South East Forests of New South Wales and it was prepared by Graham Pyke and Paul O'Connor. It is a very thorough review of the existing information on wildlife conservation within the south-east forest region of New South Wales and on the effects of logging and associated practices on the conservation values of these forests. The New South Wales Forestry Commission, in what has become fairly typical fashion, has criticised the report because the scientists who prepared it did not carry out any original research. This in my view was an irrelevant and actually quite a mischievous piece of criticism and unfortunately reflects the siege mentality of an institution which is desperately in need of reform in all its echelons, but particularly at the top. </PARA>
<PARA> The museum report was never intended as a piece of original work-it is a review of the work of dozens of scientists who carried out original work in the area. The value of the museum study is in its collation and assessment of the many scientific studies that have been carried out and in the sound recommendations it puts forward on the basis of examining those studies. To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to incorporate the recommendations in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA>The aim of this paper is to review existing information on wildlife conservation within the S.E. Forests Region of N.S.W. and on the effects of logging and associated practices on conservation values of these forests, and to then make recommendations based on this review. We consider Land Systems, Forest Types, Plant Communities, Plant Associations and individual animal species. We do not, however, consider individual plant species. </PARA>
<PARA>Our conclusion and recommendations are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Logging of forests brings about essentially permanent changes in the distributions and abundances of their plants and animals and destroys any wilderness value of the forests. There should therefore be reservation of some areas essentially free from the effects of logging and associated practices. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Present National Parks and other Reserves are essentially unlogged or ``oldgrowth'' and have generally low timber value because of their rugged topography. These existing reserves should therefore form the basis of a reserve system in the S.E. Forests Region. Additions to the Reserve system should come from the region's state forests as they contain almost all remaining old growth forest. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Five of the Region's ten Land systems, as defined by Keith and Sanders (1988), are inadequately conserved (i.e. Rainshadow Valley, Western Flat Country, Tableland, Granitic Hinterland, Escarpment). The same should be true for the Forest types (sensu Forestry Commission of N.S.W. 1989a), Plant Communities (sensu Keith and Sanders, 1988) and Plant Associations (sensu N.S.W. National Parks and Wildlife Service, 1986a) associated with these Land Systems. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. A number of animal species are rare or endangered within the Region and are therefore of concern. These include 15 mammal, 2 bird and 1 fish species. Also of concern are the Region's 17 Microchiropteran bat species as their distributions are very poorly known and they are likely to be adversely affected by logging. The Region has been inadequately surveyed for all animal groups. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The reasonably large Coolangubra Wilderness area is not totally included in the present reserve system. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The conservation values of each of the Region's State Forests were assessed in terms of extent of old-growth forest, presence of areas of poorly conserved Land systems, wilderness area, records of animal species of concern, potential to join with or link other reserve areas, and presence of areas of high predicted arboreal marsupial density. Based on these criteria, the Coolangubra Wilderness Area and adjoining parts of Coolangubra State Forest have the highest conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. We recommend that the Coolangubra Wilderness and State Forest be added to the Reserve System. This would result in the reservation of the last remaining unreserved old growth area of poorly conserved Western Flat Country, significant areas of Escarpment and Granitic Hinterland, which are also inadequately conserved, and an area containing many animal species of concern and high densities of arboreal mammals. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. We also recommend reservation of:</PARA>
<PARA> a) The last remaining unreserved old growth areas of the poorly conserved Tableland land system within Tantawangalo and Glenbog State Forest;</PARA>
<PARA> b) Additional old growth areas of the Escarpment Land system from within Murrabrine, Glenbog, Bemboka and Tantawangalo State Forests. </PARA>
<PARA> c) All unreserved old growth areas of the Rainshadow Valley land system and any areas of this very poorly conserved and largely cleared land system that could be rehabilitated. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 8 b) and c) will require further survey before appropriate areas can be identified. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. The existing forestry practices in the Region will in many respects, help to conserve wildlife. We have, however, identified the following deficiencies:</PARA>
<PARA> a. The existing filter strips (20m wide on either side of gullies with catchments exceeding 50 ha) and, to a lesser extent, the wild life corridors (100 m or more wide along watercourses or gullies and connecting neighbouring catchments) will be inadequate for the long-term survival of species which require large home ranges such as the Yellow-bellied Glider and Powerful Owl. We recommend that these areas be expanded and/or extended in areas where such species occur. </PARA>
<PARA> b. Results of the logging research program in the Waratah Greek Flora Reserve are not yet available even though the initial logging was carried out in 1984. We recommend that high priority be given to the presentation and publication of results so far. </PARA>
<PARA> c. The present burning regime in the Region's State Forests is overly simplistic in design and will result in fires that are too frequent, at too low an intensity and at the wrong season for some wildlife. We recommend that the burning regime be modified to ensure a reasonably high diversity of fire histories across forest areas, that many areas experience fire at 10 to 25 year intervals rather than 4 to 7 years, and that many areas experience hot, summer fires (or their equivalent, if this can be established). We also recommend that controlled burning be used as a management tool to promote the long-term survival of rare or endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA>10. There is a great need for more research in the Region and in comparable areas. We have identified the following subjects as being in particular need of study. </PARA>
<PARA> a. Relationships between written forestry practices and what actually happens in terms of retention of trees and other vegetation in logged forest and in terms of timing, intensity and extent of fires. </PARA>
<PARA> b. Effects of logging and burning on plants and animals, especially those that require tree hollows (e.g. arboreal marsupials, owls, Microchiropteran bats) and those that are rare or endangered. </PARA>
<PARA> c. Population biologies of rare and endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA> d. Distributions and abundances of species throughout the Region. </PARA>
<PARA>11. Current estimates of future timber yields from the Region's State forests are based on assumptions that are overly simplistic and not well substantiated. In order to ensure that approximately constant timber yields will be available in perpetuity, it is essential that a comprehensive and accurate computer model of forest growth and harvest be developed. Such a model would also assist in the consideration of alternative short and medium term strategies for timber harvest. </PARA>
<PARA>12. Most of the remaining old-growth forest in the Region's state forest is of high conservation value. Alternatives to logging these areas should therefore be fully explored and any increases in availability of timber should be used to enable additional old-growth forest areas to be added to the Reserve System. Any logging of the remaining old-growth should be postponed as long as possible and start in the areas of lowest conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA>13. Alternative strategies to logging the remaining old-growth forest, such as those proposed by the South East Forest Alliance, have not been adequately considered. We recommend a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the range of alternatives along the lines of the current Resource Assessment Commission's Inquiry into Australia's Forest and Timber Resources. </PARA>
<PARA>14. Documentation of past land-use decisions (e.g. State Forest vs. National Park) and their justifications is poor while that for land-management decisions (e.g. control burning regime) is reasonable. There is also little opportunity for interested parties to comment on land-use and land-management proposals. We therefore recommend the establishment of procedures for the preparation of supporting documentation in association with proposals for National parks, Flora Reserves and National Estate Listing, for soliciting and evaluating comments from interested parties on these proposals, and for comparison and combination of competing proposals. Advisory Councils, with appropriate expertise and representatives from a variety of interests, could make well-considered recommendations to the State and Federal Governments concerning the operations of the Forestry Commission, Heritage Commission and other Government Bodies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having incorporated that document in Hansard, I would like to read one section from the body of the report which I consider to be a really significant comment on and, indeed, criticism of, the Forestry Commission practices, particularly in relation to logging and burning in those forests. On page 11 the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is ample evidence that forestry practices affect wildlife. Shortly after burning and/or logging some species are more abundant than before while for other species the reverse occurs . . . With time these effects may disappear . . . but some effects such as those on animal species that require tree hollows will persist for two hundred or more years. Since S.E. forest areas that are utilized for timber supply will be heavily logged after at most 150 years after the initial bout of integrated logging . . . these forest areas will never return to a state approximating in all respects, their unlogged condition. </PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Government asked a scientist called Pryor to comment on the alternative strategies proposed by the South East Forest Alliance (SEFA). He was very critical of its proposals. However, in this report by the museum scientists, their comment on Mr Pryor's report indicates the very slim basis on which Mr Pryor criticised the South East Forest Alliance strategies. I read from page 31 of the museum report:</PARA>
<PARA>Pryor, in reviewing the SEFA proposal, focuses largely on eucalypt plantations and does so inadequately. He asserts, without presenting supporting evidence, that the minimum annual rainfall for eucalypt plantations is 850 mm rather than 800 mm as assumed by SEFA. He states, without describing his methods of calculation or presenting his data, that the total area within the S.E. Forest Region that is suitable for eucalypt plantations is 12,000 ha as compared with the SEFA estimate of 14,000 ha. He presents some data on growth rates in eucalypt plantations and deduces that timber yields from these plantations would average about 15 m3 per hectare per year using present plant stock and technology but could possibly be about 30% higher with improved stock and technology. The figure of 20 m3 per hectare per year assumed by SEFA may therefore be slightly optimistic but is within the realms of possibility. Pryor's basic conclusion is that the claims by SEPA are overly optimistic. He might be correct but he has not so demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pryor report is also inadequate in terms of assessing the consequences of pursuing the SEFA suggestions. Pryor asserts that timber mills will be closed and jobs will be lost. However he presents no supporting evidence or calculations. The extent to which the SEFA suggestions would reduce or eliminate job losses is therefore unclear. Pryor does not evaluate the consequences of earlier than planned logging of the regrowth forest. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also a very significant comment on environmental impact statements (EIS). I have long been concerned, as have many resource managers and ecologists, about the failure of environmental impact statements to take into account the alternatives to those proposed within the EIS. In this respect it is significant that the museum scientists have this to say about the procedure of the EIS:</PARA>
<PARA> The procedures associated with these EIS's-</PARA>
<PARA>namely, in relation to the south-east forests-</PARA>
<PARA>are reasonably well known and will not be described here. However, it should be mentioned that, by its nature, an EIS does not deal evenly with all land-areas within a Region nor with all alternative land-use and land-management options. In other words, it is an inherently biased document. The EIS's prepared in connection with logging in the S.E. Forest Region are no exception to this generalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>SEFA has put out a press release in relation to this museum report. I have to agree with its comment on the report, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The independent scientific report highlights the growing body of evidence questioning the validity of the basis for the Commonwealth/NSW agreement which allows logging to continue in these high conservation value areas. The joint Commonwealth/NSW Biological Resources Survey (BRS)-due to be released at the end of June-has been held up by the NSW Forestry Commission and the previous Federal Minister for Resources Senator Cook as providing the answer to the dispute. Yet, as the Museum Report shows, this forms only a small part of the information base, and its outcome is already compromised by the proforestry stance of 5 of its 6 members, 3 of whom are employed by the NSW Forestry Commission. The BRS interim report has been severely criticised for its bias toward timber production over ecological protection. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret that these recommendations and comments from SEFA, whose team includes people from the Wilderness Society and the ACF, have come too late to achieve any significant commitment from the Federal Government. Nevertheless, I would have to lend my support to the specific SEFA proposals; that is, an end to logging in National Estate areas, including a condition of future export permits that timber must not be taken from the National Estate; a full investigation of conservation values of potential high conservation areas, including old growth forests, adequacy of existing reserves and linkages between high conservation areas, and migration corridors; a moratorium on logging in these areas until a comprehensive biological study is completed, and the full range of high conservation value forests are protected as national parks; and Commonwealth assistance for industry restructuring and plantation establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisive Commonwealth action is certainly well overdue. Certainly, despite the repeated posturing of the Federal Government before the election, nothing has been done and I fear that nothing will be done at this point. However, I do add as a last note that the adoption of the Australian Heritage Commission (National Estate Protection) Amendment Bill would go a long way towards satisfying claims by conservationists and all Australians concerned with the preservation of a vital part of our national heritage and would place the responsibility for the preservation of our National Estate and our national heritage squarely where it belongs, that is, with the national Government of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of this matter of public interest debate today to comment on the parlous state of the Northern Territory's economy and the direct relationship of that economy to the actions of the Hawke Labor Government or, rather, the inaction in so many areas. During the Estimates committees hearings, and recently here in the Senate, I have pursued a number of questions that would affect the personal finances of many Territories, particularly with regard to the tax zone rebate scheme that has been unaltered by this Government since 1984. That has meant, in effect, that the taxation arrangements of Northern Territorians, or taxpayers in northern Australia and many parts of Central Australia, have been very adversely affected because there have been no adjustments to this very important scheme which takes into account the additional expenses required to live in either northern Australia or remote parts of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that the Hawke Government in 1988 established the Prime Minister's country task force, which made recommendations for movement in this area, and the fact that the Government has subsequently chosen to ignore any action in either the 1988 or 1989 Budgets, is very serious. I will be looking very carefully at the 1990 Budget for an adjustment that is substantial and which recognises that it is now six years since there has been any adjustment to assist personal taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that impacts very seriously on Territorians is, of course, housing. The availability of housing and the finance for it, particularly through the government sector, are of major importance. Honourable senators will be aware that recently the Commonwealth has negotiated and arranged for a new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. This Agreement is going to have very dire consequences for the Northern Territory because substantial cuts which will flow through to the capital works program of the Northern Territory and subsequently into the housing programs will be very harshly felt by many Territorians. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that during the Federal election campaign Senator Collins, who is now the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, commented on this matter in the Northern Territory media. I quote from the transcript of a radio program in which Senator Collins said, on 22 February 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> The housing agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory is an eminently fair one. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be a reduction. There's no question about that. It won't be in the order of $100m. </PARA>
<PARA>History has proven that Senator Collins was very wrong in that assertion because, contrary to his earlier assurances, the signing of the new Agreement has meant that consequently there will be a loss of $100m in housing funds up to 1992-93 and $370m over the next 10 years. That is going to have extreme consequences for all Territorians, particularly for that group in the community who rely on Housing Commission funds for the provision of adequate and proper housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The business sector of the Northern Territory has suffered a number of very harsh consequences because of decisions by the Hawke Government in recent years. The Government's lack of resolve and lack of action in being able to solve the pilots dispute last year cost the Northern Territory economy well in excess of $100m. The consequences are still being felt. It will take years to restore confidence among the travelling public and tourists who come to the Northern Territory. Whilst it is pleasing to note that the marketing plans put in place by the Northern Territory Government for the tourist industry this year are working, the consequences will still flow on. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasurer Keating recently announced very significant cuts to defence allocations. Defence has an important effect in northern Australia. Those cuts-they were in the order of $214m-will mean that programs will either be deferred or very important commitments in northern Australia will not happen in the appropriate timetable. The commitment from government will not be there. In many areas of the capital works program over the past few years the Government has continually deferred or delayed the commencement of projects. Again, that affects the very important building and construction sector of the economy and we see major changes in that area. So the business community is also reeling from these very direct economic areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that I comment on is one on which I throw a challenge to both Senator Collins and to the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon. They need to be very vigilant and very aggressive in arguing for funds for the coming financial year, 1990-91, relating to the Government's ongoing commitment to the recurrent funding for the Northern Territory. We are well aware that the Commonwealth injects in the order of $1 billion in to that recurrent funding. But it is very important to note that the provision of services is aggravated by the special conditions of remoteness and the very high proportion of Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territory. That does impact very substantially on funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as Commonwealth funding to the States has been cut back substantially over the past few years, there has been a very disproportionate cut in similar funding, whether it be of a capital nature or of a recurrent nature, to the Northern Territory-far in excess of cuts suffered by the States. I believe that the figure is in the order of a 16 per cent cut in the last few years to the States, whereas funding to the Northern Territory has been slashed by 27 per cent. No government can continue to provide the level of services which are required when it is faced with that sort of considerable and continual butchery by the Department of Finance and the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> The options, of course, for meeting shortfalls in future years represent a great challenge. I believe that the resources of the Northern Territory Government and its agencies have been stretched to the limit by the action of the Federal Government in the last few years. They have done everything possible and responsible in order to meet their fair share of contributions in the required areas. But as we are aware, there has always been the need for top-up funds for the Northern Territory, and they will certainly be required again this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Marshall Perron, has recently made submissions to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) explaining the seriousness of the problem and outlining that, because of the serious cuts and the shortfalls in so many areas, the Northern Territory Government will face a gap as high as $70m in the coming financial year. There will have to be some pretty creative types of political work to make up this gap. As I said earlier, I challenge Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon to make sure that the Commonwealth increases funding in an appropriate way, to look carefully at the reports of the Grants Commission, particularly with regard to the relativities, and to ensure that those relativities are argued in such a way that they properly reflect Northern Territory needs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, many issues, projects and ideas are on the table that will have to be met. The Commonwealth will have to accept its responsibilities. For example, the innovative Northern Territory university was created by the Northern Territory Government and it is still not being funded by the Commonwealth in an appropriate manner which treats that university in a similar manner to universities in other States. It should look at and review the funding arrangements for tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the capacity to fund roads, repairs, maintenance and public works supervision, the Commonwealth has a very direct responsibility that it must exercise. The research undertaken by the Menzies School of Health Research, located in Darwin, has a very wide and important application across the whole of northern Australia. Research is being undertaken into the prevention of trachoma, otitis media, AIDS, hepatitis and other infectious diseases; the prevention of alcohol, Kava and other drug related problems; and improvements in nutrition to prevent diabetes, heart disease and other problems. It has, of course, particular relevance to Aboriginal health and public health in the countries to the near north of Australia. The Commonwealth should accept further responsibility for funding in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory, as I mentioned, has been adjudicated by the Grants Commission in recent years and because of the action of the Federal Government is treating it as a State. But long-term debts have accrued since self-government and there are special arguments and special reasons why many of these debts should, in fact, be written off by the Commonwealth at this time to alleviate the special budgetary problems of the Northern Territory. There are special arguments for the needs of northern Australia and, in particular, the Northern Territory. It is an important, resource-filled area of Australia that contributes phenomenally to our export earnings and, of course, will play a very significant role in the future. It is important that the Hawke Labor Government meets its commitments in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 June last year I was holidaying with friends in the United Kingdom. I awoke on that Sunday morning to be told that there had been a massacre in Beijing. At first I was incredulous. I could not believe that a government would kill its citizens in cold blood; that it would walk into a square and shoot them because they asked for democracy. But as news report after news report after news report flooded in, the sad truth dawned, not only upon myself, but upon millions and millions of people around the world that what had happened in Tiananmen Square was a massacre of the innocent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say that very, very purposefully: it was a massacre of the innocent. These people were not-I hasten to advise-dangerous saboteurs. They were not setting about trying to destroy the country. They were there for two reasons, and two reasons only. They had two grievances that they wished to take to their Government. Those grievances were, firstly, that corruption be rooted out of the Government; and, secondly, that democracy be allowed in China. The massacre that occurred in Beijing on that morning, the subsequent slaughter of people throughout the country, the subsequent persecution of people who held those beliefs, are very difficult for us to understand. But for that Government it was nothing but a callous and ruthless attempt to hold on to power for a little bit longer. It is very difficult for us to understand because we take principles like accountable government and democracy for granted, and we are lucky in that we are able to do so. But the people in China are not so lucky. They certainly were not so lucky then. </PARA>
<PARA> What these people in Beijing did was fundamental in their country's history. They had never had democracy; they had never had accountable government. They had never experienced these things. But they knew what they were, they knew that they wanted them, and they knew that they were willing to lay down their lives to win them. And lay down their lives they did. Sadly, the forces of the old men in the walled city prevailed, and I will tell honourable senators how they prevailed. They prevailed because innocent people were shot in the streets. People lying in hospitals were bayoneted to death. Old men, women and children were crushed by tanks, by armoured personnel carriers. People who dared to oppose the Government were rounded up, tortured, tried without fair judicial process, and many of them were executed ruthlessly, without feeling and without compassion, so that their blood would purchase a few more pitiful years for these evil men in the walled city. </PARA>
<PARA> This Sunday, throughout the country, many Chinese and many other ordinary Australians will be gathering to remember that sacrifice. We will be remembering the sacrifice of well in excess of 4,000 people in China who died trying to win freedom for their country. It may seem that that sacrifice has nothing to do with us, but it has everything to do with us because it should remind us that our freedom and our democracy in this country are precious and that they are worth standing up for. They are so precious that people in other countries who do not have them are willing to lay down their lives to win these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that in the course of history the men who were responsible for that massacre, the men who were responsible and who are still responsible for the persecution of those people in China, those evil old men, Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng, will be judged as the butchers of Beijing. They will be judged as the people who chose to bleed the life out of the young people of that country to maintain their cynical, twisted and bitter grasp on power. I urge honourable senators, as I urge everyone in this country who is interested in democracy, freedom and truth, to support those rallies against the Chinese Government. I shall certainly be supporting those rallies. I shall be attending the rally in Brisbane and I shall be addressing that rally to remind the people of Australia that our freedoms are precious; that they are very, very fragile; that we should be grateful that we have our Constitution; and that we should not give up in the fight to support the people of China who cry for freedom, to support the people around the world who cry for freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the sun will one day dawn upon a world in which everybody may take freedom, liberty and truth for granted. But between now and then this Senate can rest assured that I shall not give up the fight to win those things. I urge, beg and plead with people to support freedom and democracy in China; to support freedom and democracy wherever it is needed; and to support these rallies so that those evil old men, those butchers of Beijing, will not be allowed to escape the condemnation of history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The State Coroners Acts have been criticised by former Commissioner Muirhead in his interim report on Aboriginal deaths in custody. Coroners, he states, have insufficient powers and resources. In Western Australia, for example, witnesses are not obliged to give evidence or to come under cross-questioning during coroners' inquiries. I have referred before in this place to the example of the death of Stephen Wardle on 4 February 1988. During the inquiry into his death the 17 policemen and women who were present in the police station when he died were not asked to present evidence at the inquiry. The coroner is attached to a section of the police department and must rely on police evidence. This poses obvious concerns when a death occurs in police custody. Had our State Coroners Acts been stronger, there probably would have been no need for a royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to make just a few brief remarks on the death in custody of Daniel John Morris. He was found dead in police custody at 4.05 a.m. on 18 August 1988. The findings of the Coroners Court at Westmead were brought down on 29 August 1989. In his findings, Mr Hiatt, the Coroner, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The determination of the court is, that Daniel John Morris died on 18 August 1988 within cell one, Mount Druitt Police Station, Mount Druitt, from hanging wilfully self inflicted with intention of taking his own life. With recommendations made by the Court to the Minister of Police. </PARA>
<PARA>There appear to be many irregularities that are not conclusive or consistent with Mr Hiatt's findings. The forensic pathologist witness and Government Medical Officer, Dr P. S. J. Ellis of Westmead Hospital, indicated that cause of death was inconclusive. Part of his evidence included reference to major bruising to part of the deceased's neck which was not consistent with hanging, but with strangling. That evidence is clearly in the transcript. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, evidence given by Detective Sergeant R. L. Wyse which, again, may be seen in the court transcripts, reveals that there were no fingerprints of the deceased in the area. So it is alleged that Mr Morris managed to climb approximately 10 feet, secure one leg of his jeans to a crossbar, secure the other leg by means of a knot tied around his neck, then proceed to jump in order deliberately to hang himself. During the questioning at the inquest, this question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> So there are in fact prints that are identifiable but not capable of being compared to any known prints, is that the situation?</PARA>
<PARA>Sergeant Wyse responded:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, the prints are identifiable but we can't find out who owns them. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he stated that the prints found had been compared with palm prints on file of Mr Morris, and then compared again with prints taken at the morgue, both with a negative result; both with a `no'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other questionable irregularities. For example, there are time discrepancies between the police car diaries and the police radio log. There are other discrepancies. Daniel John Morris's blood alcohol reading when he was picked up by the police the previous night at 11.30 p.m. was 0.231. He was last spoken to about 20 to 25 minutes before he was found dead. When he was spoken to at that time he was told that he would soon be released on unconditional bail. Yet despite this, a press account in the Sydney Morning Herald of 30 August 1989 was headlined; `Danny, a typical case of cell death'. I quote from that article:</PARA>
<PARA> His case was typical. He had a blood alcohol reading of 0.231 when he was picked up. Police figures show that 27 of those who have died were intoxicated, and at least 13 had a blood alcohol level of more than 0.2. </PARA>
<PARA>It is implied, therefore, that his death in custody was typical in all other aspects. He was not processed, as I said before, for unconditional bail until 3.40 a.m. yet he was picked up at 11.30 p.m. When he was picked up he was in the company of his young son, Timothy, aged 3 years old at the time, and he was arrested on a charge of offensive language. He was taken to the police station where he was left handcuffed to a metal rail of the dock until he was formally charged at 1.00 a.m. I quote again from the same article in the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> At 1.30 a.m. he was moved to Cell One, the only cell in Mt Druitt station where he could effectively hang himself. He was moved ``because he was noisy'', said one officer. </PARA>
<PARA>The coroner did make certain recommendations as it was responsible for him to do. He recommended that written records should be kept, countersigned by a supervisory officer, showing the times that cells are checked, and that the record should be made immediately after the cells are checked. He recommended putting video cameras in the cells of the Mount Druitt police station and for these cameras to be monitored at all times when the cells are occupied. He recommended that if a cell death does occur, the radio room immediately start to record on cassette all information relating to the event. Finally, he recommended the removal of all horizontal bars in the cells. </PARA>
<PARA> The family of the deceased is calling for a full and open inquiry into the death of Daniel John Morris. They have asked for my support in this. I give them that support wholeheartedly, and it is for that reason that I have made these remarks in the chamber today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some remarks about the forthcoming commemorations of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I will not go over the points that have already been made, nor will I elaborate to the Senate on the points that I have made about the deals continuing to be done by big business with the Chinese. On a previous occasion I detailed to the Senate the advertisements by one of our biggest companies-if not our biggest company-that had appeared, saying that whilst the West was concerned about the activities of the regime in China, this particular company was keeping business going. That was, admittedly, before the Tiananmen Square massacre. My concern, however, is that nothing much has changed. I will, if it is appropriate, detail to the Senate on another occasion material relating to that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I wish to focus on now is an aspect of gross and continuing violation of human rights in China supported by Australian taxpayers' money provided under the Foreign Affairs vote by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), which gives financial and moral support to the China population program. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Senate know that on 7 June 1989, just three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities allocated $US57m to the world's most inhuman population control program, that in China? Does the Senate know that Australia doubled its grant to UNFPA in the 1989-90 Budget and that, therefore, we share in legitimising the gross violations of human rights that occur in China? The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has stated that he had a particular interest in increasing the amount of money to UNFPA. I quote from the Senate Hansard of 18 August 1989, at page 416:</PARA>
<PARA>The population control program that is conducted in China . . . has never been one about which I have seen evidence to justify the allegations that are being made about coercive abortion, involuntary sterilisation and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>A very large number of people throughout Australia saw the 60 Minutes program of 8 April 1990. They heard the presenter say a number of things, including that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Chinese say they only want a better way of life for their children and the world looks the other way as China wields the one child policy like an axe. The communist master plan is killing millions. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I knew that. I asked at Estimates committee hearings for the Government to examine the evidence that was before it. There is so much evidence that I cannot present it to the chamber in the time available to me. Let me refer to an up-to-date quote from Shen Guoxiang, the Director of Publicity at the State Family Planning Commission, reported by the Reuters correspondent in Beijing on 14 April 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> This year's campaign'-</PARA>
<PARA>that is 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>aims to instil zeal into local officials to enforce the punishments and rewards, educate couples on the benefits of small families and persuade women to abort unauthorised babies. He said local authorities have much autonomy in deciding punishments for couples who have too many children. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Normally the women are willing to abort,'' said Shen, ``But if they are not then the local cadres come round to persuade them a little . . . the time limit for abortions was normally three months into the pregnancy but some `stubborn' women resisted persuasion at first and had to have the foetus removed in the fourth month or later . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These gross violations of human rights have been understood and responded to by the United States. I quote from a statement by the United States Agency for International Development:</PARA>
<PARA>UNFPA participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation in the People's Republic of China within the meaning of the Kemp/Kaston Amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>UNFPA praises the China program. I quote Manfred Kulessa, China representative of UNFPA, of 11 July 1987, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is significant that here in China . . . the government has shown its full commitment to a family planning program that has been internationally acknowledged as one of the most successful efforts in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA>Success is considered in many ways. I do not think that those millions of Chinese citizens who have been subject to gross violations of human rights because of the China population program supported by UNFPA think that it is a success. It is not only a gross violation of human rights, it is also a gross violation of workers' rights. The Country Reports on Human Rights for 1989, US State Department, Washington, which was issued only a couple of weeks ago, says:</PARA>
<PARA> Couples are not allowed free choice about whether to practice family planning, how many children they may have, or when they may have them . . . </PARA>
<PARA> When national targets are not met, officials call for stricter implementation, and some have advocated more coercive methods than central government policy currently authorizes . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Disciplinary measures against couples who violate the policy include stiff fines (often as high as a year's salary), withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments. If a unit-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a work unit-</PARA>
<PARA>exceeds its allocation, punishment may be meted out to the offending couples, to unit officials, and to the unit as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a gross violation and subjugation of workers' rights. Yet we, by our taxpayers' money, are supporting that subjugation of workers' rights. Three days after the events at Tiananmen Square the United Nations allocated $US57m. What did our delegate do? The tears were not dry in this Parliament when our delegate got up, three days after Tiananmen Square, and supported that allocation to assist the most inhuman population control program in the world. It was opposed vigorously by the United States, which had done some homework about the violations of human rights and workers' rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government, I appeal to the Senate, I appeal to the whole of Australia to recognise that there are violations in this area and that, in the words of that 60 Minutes program, `the world unfortunately looks the other way as China wields the one child policy like an axe; the Communist master plan is killing millions'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Blewett, in a statement of 29 May, said that the Australian Government strongly supported democratic reform in Myanmar and welcomed the holding of national elections on 27 May-the first in 30 years. Although counting is still continuing, there is little doubt that the NLD has scored a major success. As of yesterday, the NLD had 67 officially declared seats and has claimed unofficially that it has won 366 out of a total of 485. This result would give the NLD at least 75 per cent of the seats in the National Assembly. The strong support shown for the NLD is a testament to the courage of the people of Myanmar and is a further condemnation of the attempt by the military regime to intimidate and harass its political opponents through widespread arrests and detentions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, to the regime's credit, the elections appear to have been conducted in an open and orderly manner. The Australian Government calls on the military regime to recognise and respect the result of the elections and to move quickly to hand over political power to a new democratically elected government. The high level of popular support for the NLD adds increasing urgency to the need for the regime to release immediately Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD, who has been under house arrest since July 1989, with the NLD Chairman U Tin U and other political detainees.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government believes that the elections provide a real opportunity to achieve political and economic reform and national reconciliation in Myanmar.

In the terms of reference of this review it is referred to as ASP90-typical Defence language. How has this document in any way refined the White Paper of 1987?

If there is no problem with that either in the document's original form or its amended form, I will give some consideration to making it public. It should not be seen as a document, however, that contradicts the White Paper, but one which merely develops themes within it. I must express to Senator Durack-not that I am saying that he espouses this attitude-that I am surprised how many people regard the White Paper as set in concrete, almost tablets handed down from on high. I do not think that was ever the intention. The White Paper was to set the main themes. Of course, the variations on those themes are just as important. Several of those will emerge, and, no doubt, the new force structure review will point in some other directions in which to extend the White Paper and may even occasionally contradict some minor elements of the White Paper. I will have the thrust of Senator Durack's question examined. If it can be made available, I will certainly make it available.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1562" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Jones will be aware, the Government has long recognised the need for independent, free and accessible dispute-handling mechanisms for consumers having difficulties with banks. In October last year, after 18 months of quite arduous negotiations between the Australian Bankers Association (ABA) and the Government, my predecessor, Senator Bolkus, announced the establishment of the banking ombudsman scheme. I wish to pay a tribute to Senator Bolkus for his sterling work in this area. It is an initiative which I very much welcome as it will provide Australians with a quick, free, efficient and effective way of resolving disputes with banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of the scheme, a council comprising three consumer representatives and three industry representatives has been established. Sir Ninian Stephen was appointed to chair the council, an appointment which illustrates the commitment which the scheme has to independence and fairness. The council was charged with the task of selecting the first banking ombudsman. It has now completed that selection task. Earlier today Sir Ninian announced the council's choice for Australia's first banking ombudsman. He will be Mr Graham McDonald, who is a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and has had a distinguished legal career in Western Australia. He exhibits a strong commitment to public service. The many highlights of his career include being the inaugural solicitor with the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service between 1973 and 1975 and a member of the Western Australian Aboriginal Police Relations Cabinet Subcommittee, being a founding partner in two legal firms, and the Western Australian Commissioner for Corporate Affairs between 1987 and 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past the high costs associated with the legal system and the small amounts often involved in disputes have prevented many consumers from pursuing disputes with banks. With Mr McDonald's appointment consumers will now have an independent, free and accessible dispute-handling mechanism which will enable them to pursue such complaints. Under the scheme a bank will in the first instance attempt to resolve the dispute with the consumer concerned. Should the dispute not be resolved at this level, the consumer will have access to the ombudsman, who will investigate and adjudicate on the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman's jurisdiction will cover disputes between individuals and banks involving claims of $100,000 or less relating to transactions on or after 10 May 1989. He will have no jurisdiction over bank policy issues, including the setting of interest rates. The guiding principle for the Ombudsman will be what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, having regard to legal principle and to what constitutes good banking practice. The Ombudsman will set his own procedures for determining disputes but will attempt in the first instance to try to settle them by conciliation between the bank and the customer. Although the Ombudsman's decision will be binding on the banks, customers will still be able to take legal action should they not be satisfied with the decision.</PARA>
<PARA> The four major banks and most members of the ABA have agreed to be covered by the banking Ombudsman scheme. State banks are not at present participating members as they are covered by State ombudsmen. The only major consumer lending bank that has so far refused to join the scheme is Citibank and the Government very much hopes that in due course it too will agree to participate in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman is currently seeking office premises in Melbourne, which will be operating by early July. In the meantime the ABA has established a secretariat in Melbourne to handle public inquiries regarding the scheme. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr McDonald on his appointment, thank the Australian Bankers Association for its part in setting up this scheme, and, as I say, I look forward very much to Mr McDonald taking up his duties on behalf of customers in their relations with banks throughout Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the Repatriation Commission is aware of various reports coming from the United States on a wide range of issues and decided that it needed to have first-hand reports to consider. The Department of Veterans' Affairs made three of its senior officers available to meet with Veterans' Administration authorities in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first question about seriously reviewing the stance of the Department in relation to the findings of the royal commission, it is not the object of the officers' visit to collect material to review the findings of the Evatt Royal Commission. Those findings are not being reviewed. Investigation by the Repatriation Commission is to examine and gain first-hand a full understanding of the policy and scientific environment surrounding recent decisions by the Government of the United States. The officers will also discuss possible future developments with the United States Veterans' Administration. Once the officers have returned with this information I expect the Repatriation Commission will give further consideration to the material and views gathered by the team.</PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator McLean's second question, as I have indicated, the departmental officers are visiting at the request of the Repatriation Commission. When the Commission has an appreciation of the situation it will report to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The Minister will inform the Parliament of conclusions reached by the Commission and of any decisions which might subsequently be made by the Government. Any announcement will be made as soon as it is reasonable and responsible to do so, but, of course, overall the Government will maintain its stance of being absolutely committed to meeting veterans' needs and is monitoring the matters of concern very closely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fairly well established-or at least I hope it is-that in Australia we do not seek to introduce a system of A grade and B grade citizenship: we have only one kind. The Government rejects the suggestion, absolutely, that benefits should be paid to Aboriginal people only in their home community. In the Senate we have been debating, in the last few days, policies of restricting benefits to those who have moved to areas where their prospects for employment are lower. Yet, we have Mr Perron suggesting that when people go to areas where employment prospects are higher, we should, indeed, cut out their benefits. That is an extraordinary suggestion and one that I find totally and utterly abhorrent.</PARA></TALK.START>

So, I say to Senator Zakharov that the Government will not be taking up Mr Perron's suggestion. We have, however, had officers in Alice Springs in recent times discussing with the council some of the problems that are occurring there. We look forward to working with Mr Perron and finding solutions to the many problems which beset people in isolated communities.

Is it true that the infrastructure costs for the core city, to be located in Adelaide, will be considerably less than in other cities, and that an Australian national opinion poll has identified that South Australians are more tolerant of foreigners, particularly Asians, than other States?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The joint steering committee which has been managing this program will report to the Government at the beginning of July. It will make recommendations about a number of issues. As far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, we either act on the recommendations of the joint steering committee or we do not. Of course, as the honourable senator is aware, in the last few weeks State governments have been putting forward proposals to the joint steering committee about possible sites for the MFP and, of course, South Australia is one of those States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think rather than add anything more to the answer, I will just deal with what I regard as some of the difficulties in the honourable senator's question, which may be based on misconceptions. As I understand it, the Arthur Andersen report figure of $8 billion, to which the honourable senator referred, was based on a city of a particular size and, of course, the investment will take place over years, if not decades. It is not as though a lump sum has to be found for that sort of level of investment. I suppose it is true that if Adelaide were chosen as the site for a MFP, on the recommendation of the joint steering committee, the infrastructure costs there would be less. Some of the building costs might be less, depending on the nature of the site and on what contribution was made by various parts of the Adelaide community, whether it be government or private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other part of Senator Olsen's question with which I think I can deal is that concerning the hub and spoke concept-that is, a central point with various other points connected by sophisticated communication systems to the core. That is an option which has been canvassed widely by the private sector and with which I think I have some agreement, but the joint steering committee will make a recommendation about that. The reason why I have some agreement with it is that our research capacities around this country are rather scattered because of the very nature of Australia, with six States on the mainland and six population centres. In my view, there are very good medical research facilities in Melbourne and in electronics there are better facilities in Adelaide, for example. The connection of those centres to a core, as I said earlier, would be in the best interests of the national research effort. I think that view has something going for it. But in so far as the rest of the question is concerned, these matters have to await recommendation by the joint steering committee.</PARA>

In the case of Stephen Whitlam, the document alleged that he had improperly received some $30,000 for the boarding expenses of his son at Canberra Grammar. Stephen Whitlam wrote to the Secretary to the Department to answer those allegations. Let me quote from his response in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To my knowledge I have not received any benefit to which I was not entitled nor have I sought to receive any such . . . benefit. The Department paid the board but not the tuition.</PARA>

<PARA>In conclusion, I would point out to the Senate that these allegations were made without any effort by Senator Chapman to verify the facts.

<PARA>Dear Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA> On 24 May Senator Chapman asked Senator Evans a question without notice in the Senate. That question referred to me and to a person who once worked for my father, the former Prime Minister. The reference to me was offensive and inaccurate and a gross invasion of my privacy. I write to you now to seek to incorporate an appropriate correction in the Hansard. Moreover I believe that the Senator who posed the question made absolutely no effort to contact me to ascertain whether what he said about me was correct. One is entitled to expect more of the elected representatives of the people.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA> On 18 May a document was circulated in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the `Officers Revolutionary Council' (ORC). There were no names or signatures at the end of the document but only one person has ever been known to be associated with the `Council' and that person was also seen distributing the document. The document named five people (including me) who allegedly benefited financially from improper decisions by the senior management of the Department. In my case, the document alleged, inter alia, that I had improperly received some $30,000 for the boarding expenses of my son at Canberra Grammar.</PARA>
<PARA> On 21 May I wrote to the Secretary of my Department answering all of the accusations made by the ORC. I am happy to provide you with the full text of that letter but the key portions are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>-``To my knowledge I have not received any benefit to which I was not entitled nor have I sought to receive any such undue benefit''</PARA>
<PARA>-``My son (born 1971) attended Canberra Grammar from 1983 to 1986. He boarded from third term in 1984, i.e. for two and one third years. The Dept. paid the board but not the tuition. . . .The total cost to the Dept. was probably about one quarter of the figure concocted by the ORC.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary replied to me on 24 May. The key portion of his message is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>-``I want you to know that you have my full confidence as an able and honest officer of the Department. The Department has examined the allegations which have been made about the way in which your situation was handled. This investigation concluded that the decision made at the time was appropriate and that it was also appropriate for you to receive whatever entitlements flowed from that decision.''</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background you can imagine how appalled I was to see the Parliament of the Commonwealth used as a platform for achieving further dissemination of the malicious, misleading and inaccurate accusations made against me. It was curious that when Senator Chapman referred to the ORC document he quoted only two names, the names associated with the former Prime Minister. Yet other names in the document were alleged to have received much more money than I received. Why this selective use? Was it a desire to expose a possible abuse?-in which case there was no justification for naming names unless the accusations had been verified. or was it to achieve a gratuitous attack on a newsworthy name regardless of the damage done to any innocent person?-in which case it was most reprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA> A great wrong has been done to the reputation for integrity of me and my family and the Parliament has been used to exacerbate that. I ask that the Parliament, through you, now do what it can to put matters right-by publishing a correction in the Hansard and by reprimanding the Senator who chose to be the channel for spreading the unfounded accusations.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Baume asks me two questions and I shall try to take them in order. First, it was said that I would not intervene in the case of the Bow Truss building in Geelong. As I think Senator Baume is aware, I wrote to the Victorian Minister at the time, Mr Roper, indicating my concern at the Victorian Government's proposal to allow demolition of the building to continue. I did so on the basis of advice I had received from the Australian Heritage Commission and I conveyed my feelings to Mr Roper. However, if I was attempting to stop demolition of that site on the basis of World Heritage listing, I would have been battling in any event. The reality is that we cannot list anything for the cultural heritage list of World Heritage until we have put in an indicative list to the World Heritage organisation. We have not done that yet and it will take quite some time to prepare. A number of States have shown interest in having nominations put on the list, including the Greiner Government in New South Wales. An indicative list of that kind will probably take at least another 12 months, perhaps longer, to prepare. Therefore, I would not have been able even to attempt to prevent the demolition of the building using that as a basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the question relates to whether this indicates a change of Government attitude to World Heritage nomination.

Is the Minister aware that in that article an opinion was expressed that Australian industries could reduce work force layoffs and subsequent skills wastage, as well as greatly improve productivity, if they adopted new policies which encouraged the commitment and trust of their employees?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister confirm that the article referred to a pay system, known as the independent cooperative system, which has been developed by a British brewery, reporting that 100 per cent productivity improvement had been achieved within four years of introducing that pay system, which provided for payment to employees of a fixed number of overtime hours irrespective of whether those hours were actually worked. Can the Minister indicate whether the introduction by Australian companies of such a pay system would be acceptable within the framework of Australia's present wage system?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The focus of the current wage system is to encourage multi- skilling and flexibility at the level of the enterprise, but within an overall framework which ensures that genuine restrucuturing takes place and that individual outcomes are consistent with broader objectives and requirements. Senator Colston has identified a practice employed at the Ind Coope brewery at Burton in Britain which led to significant productivity gains through cashing out the overtime payments. In effect that removed any incentive to prolong the time to undertake a particular task, as the rate of pay remained fixed regardless of hours worked. The principle underlying such a system is that which underpins the structural efficiency principle in the current wage fixing system-that is, the company negotiated the removal of particular work practices which were constraining productivity and efficiency and apparently the results were substantial and provided benefits to both employer and worker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether such a system would be appropriate for Australian businesses would depend on the work practices of a particular enterprise. Indeed, there are examples where such arrangements have been implemented. For example, a recent certified agreement at ICI Botany cashes out a range of long-established employment conditions, including overtime penalty rates, with the cost of these entitlements being included in the base salary, which is now related to the levels of skill. I understand that, with the introduction of these new arrangements last year, there has been a significant reduction in absenteeism and overtime.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the agreement also addressed training, which was considerably upgraded, and supervisory layers with greater responsibility and autonomy given to the workers. That agreement demonstrates that there are avenues for enterprises wishing to tailor arrangements to their particular circumstances. The particular avenue of certified agreements was opened up by this Government through its amendments to the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA> However, this is only one example of the substantial change that is currently under way in Australian industry. Significant changes are also being achieved within mainstream award structures. I can conclude the answer by saying that obviously it is up to management in particular cases to take advantage of the opportunities that are now available through the Act and to engage their work forces, through their unions, in the creative use of the opportunities that are now there to make the types of gains that ICI Botany has made and those referred to in Senator Colston's question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the Minister to the latest report of the Auditor-General on departmental finances and, in particular, the condemnation of the agreement entered into by the Department of Social Security (DSS) with Telecom Australia on the last day of the 1988-89 financial year for the prepayment of $12.7m for future telephone charges. Does the Minister share the view that this transaction has all the hallmarks of a deliberate attempt to prematurely expend the Department's budgetary allocation, to the clear detriment of the overall state of Commonwealth finances? Was prime ministerial approval of the prepayment sought by either the Department or Telecom? Was ministerial approval sought for the additional appropriation in March 1989 of $11.5m, when the Department must have known that it already had a sufficient surplus to cover this figure?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston put out a news release which covered two matters in addition to this one, and he had them all wrong. Given that he has chosen to ask a question about one of them, I am happy to refer to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department advised that the prepayment was in accordance with Appropriation Act and Finance Direction 8d. It concluded that the prepayment was a valid agreement which achieved substantial savings for the Commonwealth. In addition to this discount, which, by the way, was worth approximately a million dollars, the Department was able to make significant administrative savings by rationalising its billing arrangements. The prepayment arrangements removed the need for the Department to issue to Telecom about 800 cheques every month.</PARA>
<PARA> The prepayment arrangements were a product of several months of negotiation between the Department and Telecom to secure a satisfactory billing arrangement. The funds expended on the prepayments were not spare funds but were diverted from other expenditures and plans on the basis that, given the level of discount that was offered, the best value for money was to be obtained by maximising the prepayment.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston would no doubt be aware that departments have the capacity under existing financial arrangements to carry up to 2 per cent of funds from one financial year to the next. The Department of Social Security did not use that capacity fully in 1988-89 and therefore the prepayment, clearly, was not a device for avoiding the lapsing of the appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Alston had studied the Department's explanatory notes for its additional estimates for 1988-89 he would have seen that the funds sought at that time were not comparable to those out of which the prepayments were made; $11.07m of the $11.5m he referred to was for salary to offset the costs of national wage case increases. Finance Direction 8d, if read in full, includes supporting statements, and Senator Alston would have seen if he had taken a look that provision is made in it for prepayments. In particular the supporting statements note the need for flexibility in the interpretation of the restrictions on prepayment.</PARA>
<PARA> Prepayments are permitted where they represent a better deal to the Commonwealth than that which it would achieve if payments were made after receipt of accounts. When DSS concluded its prepayments with Telecom, the arrangements were within the existing Finance directions. The Department operated on the policy that prepayments must achieve a discount which is greater than the long term bond rate. At the time the arrangement was made with Telecom the discount was almost 2 per cent above that rate. I would be happy to organise for Senator Alston a briefing with the Department on this matter so that he can fully understand it.</PARA>

Having regard to this discrepancy between the minutes of the last meeting of the working party and that report, does the Minister believe that: firstly, by withholding its concerns about safe versus unsafe acupuncture the working party has offered encouragement to untrained and potentially dangerous acupuncturists to set up practice; secondly, by refusing to publicly recommend the registration of well trained and safe acupuncturists the working party has made it more difficult for members of the Australian public to make an informed choice of safe acupuncture practitioners; and, thirdly, that the withholding of information that reflects positively on traditional acupuncturists accredited by the organisation exclusively and unfairly promotes the interests of medical acupuncturists?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that yesterday Mr Bilney announced that all three Services would open combat related roles to women; that is, those duties requiring a person to work in support of and in proximity to a person performing combat duties, and work that is performed in circumstances that involve the risk of being killed or injured by an enemy. People doing that work may be inadvertently drawn into combat but their primary role is not to close with and destroy the enemy. That is the distinction in the Australian Defence Force wide policy decision which Mr Bilney has taken on the recommendations of the Chiefs of the Defence Force and the Chiefs of Staff. It was taken with the primary objective of giving women a broader range of quality career opportunities in the Australian defence forces. This will have a major influence on the range of trade and professional skills they may develop and on future promotion possibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This policy has required each of the Services to consider the particular operational circumstances it will face. The Royal Australian Navy has decided that women can serve on all Navy ships with the exception of submarines. The Australian Army has decided to provide progressively further opportunities for women where this can be achieved without detriment to operational effectiveness. Women will be excluded from armour, artillery, infantry and combat engineers. The Royal Australian Air Force has decided that women will be excluded only from operating combat aircraft which have offensive capabilities and from being airfield defence guards. The Royal Australian Navy has a situation where persons performing combat related duties are-and I cannot avoid the expression-in the same boat as persons performing combat duties. Navy had the choice of continuing to exclude women from warships or, excepting that, if making combat related duties available to women in the Navy were to mean anything they would have to be posted to warships, and there is no practical reason why any restriction should be placed on the types of duties available to women at sea. That means that they may take primary combat roles. I am glad to see that the Navy took the second course of action.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chiefs of Staff will review implementation of the new arrangements annually and review the policy in June 1993. That policy review will certainly include further considerations to the general exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act for combat roles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, this is in fact an extremely important issue involving the protection of lives and, indeed, the prevention of personal injury to a great many travellers in Australia. The issue was debated extensively at the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting in Perth last Friday. One of the emerging problems in the analysis of the injuries, horrendous injuries in some cases, inflicted on victims of these crashes is not simply the injuries inflicted when passengers have been thrown off seats but unfortunately the very serious injuries caused by people being thrown against the seat supports after the seats themselves shear off the supports and the jagged edges of the supports are left exposed, with the seat support still screwed to the floor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of this, investigations in which Australia is taking part are going into not simply the question of seat belts but the provision of strengthened supports for the seats themselves. The Minister for Land Transport, Mr Bob Brown, has provided me with the following information as to the Commonwealth's position on this. Following the tragic events at Grafton and Kempsey last year priority was given to expediting mandatory requirements for stronger seats and energy-absorbing padding to provide protection for occupants of seats behind other seats. These requirements are based on the latest international standards and incorporate additional requirements for armrests and other seat fittings.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that in Perth last Friday, following excellent cooperation from the industry and State and Territory governments, the new national standards were endorsed at the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting that I referred to. In addition, a national standard to limit the road speed of heavy trucks and buses to 100 kilometres per hour was endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA> I expect that Mr Brown, the Minister for Land Transport, will formally sign the order promulgating the new standards shortly. The new seat standard will become effective from 1 July 1992 and the new speed limiting standard from 1 January 1991. I am also pleased to advise the Senate that the Minister for Land Transport has directed that the merits of even stronger seats and seat belts for all coach seats be examined as a matter of urgency. Work is well under way to develop better emergency exit arrangements for coaches.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has reacted quickly to give priority to the development of the new standards and has worked closely with industry and State and Territory governments. Australian coaches will be built to standards equal to or better than those applying anywhere in the world. Under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 the Federal Government has sole power to determine safety standards of new vehicles. The Minister for Land Transport is committed to maintaining the broad-based consultative processes that have served Australia well in the past, and work well, in developing the new heavy vehicle standards. State and Territory governments will retain responsibility for regulation of areas such as registration and seat belt use. The Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 provides for national standards to be determined by orders approved by the Minister and tabled in the Federal Parliament. The process of developing new standards requires consultation with relevant parties, governments, industry, unions and users, and often requires testing and performance analysis to determine the best solution.</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the Senate that the work in relation to coach safety will be given the highest priority. A test program is already under way to determine the performance of existing seats and provide a basis for further developments. We must be sure that our safety standards are based on facts and careful analysis and design, not immediate reaction to unfortunate events.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The environmental group called Coalition for Denmark's Environment has put forward a proposal entitled Toward a Forest Accord in Western Australia. Whilst all contributions to the forest debate are welcomed by the Government, I believe that this report contains several basic misconceptions. The first point I would make in response to Senator Vallentine's question is that the report proposes a strategy to reduce the area of Western Australia forest havested through restructuring the Western Australian timber industry. The report is based on achieving improved resource utilisation standards extrapolated from milling studies of only seven first grade logs. This is an extremely small and, might I say, a questionably small example compared to an annual sawlog cut of between 200,000 cubic metres of karri and 500,000 cubic metres of jarrah. That is, the sample size cited in the report is less than 0.01 per cent of the total annual cut of karri sawlogs. This in itself casts some doubt on the accuracy of the claim that the higher recovery is sustainable across all qualities of karri logs currently harvested in Western Australia. I believe the Western Australian government would need more reliable data than that offered in the report before it could consider altering its existing contractual obligations to licensed sawmilling companies which have geared up their operations on the basis of the current allowable cut of karri sawlogs that have been determined under the sustainable yield strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I would make is that larger sawmills can bring to the forest industry a number of advantages which the smaller sawmills cannot. These include the injection of capital to develop sophisticated technology and equipment in drying and value-added processing systems, better industrial safety and welfare programs and greater investment in research and development. While each situation needs to be looked at on its merits I do not consider it desirable as a general rule for large sawmillers to be replaced by a plethora of smaller ones.</PARA>
<PARA> The third point that I would make is that the mature karri forest in Western Australia will never be exhausted because the State Department of Conservation and Land Management has adopted a management regime under which some 30 per cent of the forest is reserved permanently from logging. A further 15 per cent is excluded as a result of specific proscriptions such as the allowance for river and stream side reserves. In addition, the area available for harvesting for logs is managed and regenerated on a 100-year rotation cycle. Concerning the final part of Senator Vallentine's question about target royalties for chiplogs, the question of the royalty rates paid by Western Australian companies is a State government matter. I am advised that the West Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management pricing system is set to maximise returns from these resources and their utilisation.</PARA>

Corporatisation of the Suva shipyard is under active consideration but is yet to be finalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be of some significance that the shipyard has several commercial rivals in Fiji. But following inquiries I have made with respect to the Qantas-Captain Cook Cruises project, it is my information that no Fijian Government subsidy has been paid to the shipyard. It is also of interest that Australia has derived benefit from the Qantas-Captain Cook Cruises shipbuilding project. Virtually all of the raw materials have been, and will be, sourced from Australia. One thousand tonnes of steel for the project have already been purchased from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. In turn, this steel has been pro- cessed by the Brisbane-based company Steelmark; which has also been contracted to cut the steel. I also understand that the shipping to Fiji of all materials has been on Australian vessels.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report by the Remuneration Tribunal was an attempt by an independent body to establish what would be a fair and reasonable rate of pay and allowances to parliamentarians. It is a subject about which this Government and previous governments, whenever an independent inquiry has been established, have continually known better. They have continually overridden the recommendations contained in this report. Today, for example, we understand that the Australian Labor Party Caucus had a long, heated and, in fact, adjourned meeting on this matter which resulted in its having to meet again at lunchtime. As I understand it, the Labor Caucus bowed once again to the dictates, for political reasons, of its leaders. There will be interference with the independent determination of a tribunal set up to establish what is the right, proper and justifiable remuneration of members of parliament and what their allowances should be. The fact that the Labor Party in government has done this simply reflects what happened when the coalition was in government. A Prime Minister in those days who, I believe, had inadequate concern for the terms and conditions under which members of parliament worked, decided that he knew better than the independent tribunal which had been set up. I do not know of any other instance in Australia where a group of people having been awarded by an independent tribunal a set of wages and conditions which involve an improvement have refused to accept them. There is no other group in Australia which has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet-and I stress this-every time the Government interferes with this independent Tribunal, the highly intellectual members of the media take that as an indication that members of parliament somehow establish their own salaries and vote themselves pay rises. For the benefit of the press gallery, I say once again that the only possible thing that members of parliament can do in respect of their own salaries is reduce them. That is what we have done again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested to hear the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support say, `Hear, hear'. I wonder whether he says `hear' hear' because his salary is not going up or because he believes that it is good that the press gallery at last recognise that no longer should we have the politics of envy every time there is a pay rise. It might be relevant if in this chamber every now and again, in view of the enormous amount of public money, taxpayers' money, paying the most extraordinarily highly paid people I have struck in the media-those working for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-their salaries should be subject to the same sort of scrutiny, the same sort of debate, the same sort of sneering remarks that we get from the media whenever the question of our salaries is raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find what the Government has done in this instance to be absurd and damaging. This Tribunal should be treated with the respect it deserves. Its determination should be dealt with with respect. It should be recognised as independent and proper. Every time a government interferes with such an independent determination for crass political reasons-the Prime Minister has interfered this time because he was dictated to by his mates in the Australian Council of Trade Unions-it creates the false impression in the public mind that politicians set their own pay and award themselves pay rises. It is false; it is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> The response, in general, of the media has been appalling and, I believe, is aimed at holding politicians up to ridicule and contempt. By the way, I except from that Milton Cockburn of the Sydney Morning Herald, who wrote a reasonable and fair piece on this the other day. But I imagine that today's report will be greeted with the usual sneering ratbaggery of a great number of my former colleagues in the media. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a tabling statement relating to the report which was prepared by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The report that I have just tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory was prepared by the Committee in the previous Parliament. The new Committee recently appointed in this Parliament resolved to adopt the report and to table it without amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The report deals with the Draft National Capital Plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority. In July last year the authority released volume one of the draft plan and this was followed in October by volume two. The report that I have just tabled is the result of the previous committee's inquiry into those first two volumes of the Draft Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee completed its report and had intended to table it last February but was unable to do so because of the dissolution of the Parliament for the election. </PARA>
<PARA> Matters have progressed substantially since the report was prepared and the National Capital Planning Authority has extensively revised its draft. It appears that the authority has now considered the comments and criticisms made during the extensive public consultation process. The authority has also considered many of the concerns expressed by the Committee in the public hearings that were part of the committee's inquiry and in the private briefing sessions the Committee had with the authority. The authority has also taken account of matters that I raised with them on behalf of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report I have just tabled was prepared before the authority published its revised plan. However, I think it is important for the Parliament and the public to be able to weigh-up the new draft in the light of previous concerns and criticisms. I believe that this report needed to be tabled without amendment because it will help establish whether or not the National Capital Planning Authority has taken the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee itself now intends to proceed to a review of the revised draft and I hope to be able to report back to the Parliament in August. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Committee examined all the submissions received by the National Capital Planning Authority in response to its public consultation process and held a series of public hearings and briefings. It found both support and opposition, and also considerable misunderstanding of the plan. Expressions of concern about the role of the National Capital Planning Authority, the legislation dealing with planning in the A.C.T. and the adequacy of A.C.T. self-government arrangements were also confused with comments on the provisions of the plan itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee considered that the National Capital Planning Authority had produced a draft plan that, if adopted, would comply with the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act in so far as the Act relates to the National Capital Plan. The Committee concluded that the draft plan contained proposals which would provide a sound basis for the continuing planning and development of Canberra in a way that would preserve the character of the city as the national capital. The Committee rejected criticisms that the National Capital Planning Authority had exceeded its authority or had usurped the role of the A.C.T. Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some short comings in the plan and the Committee found that it failed to anticipate or deal with many of the issues that subsequently became important. This led the Committee to recommend a series of significant changes to be incorporated before the plan is finalised and brought into the parliament. For example the Committee recommended that the plan be revised to stress and clarify its role in relation to the proposed territory plan. The Committee also suggested that the proposal to adopt and incorporate gazetted former National Capital Development Commission policies be made more explicit and prominent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned that the draft plan contained neither an adequate, full or explicit vision of Canberra's future nor analysis of alternative outcomes. It therefore recommended that the plan present more substantial economic and demographic data. The discussion about the future composition of the territory's economy, population and work force and how the trends in these factors would affect the development of the territory in its role of the national capital was found to be inadequate. The Committee also found that there was a need to discuss the implications of the plan for Commonwealth-Territory financial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases the Committee found that the proposals in the plan were quite acceptable but that many of the people who had responded to the draft plan were unaware of these proposals. In some cases they were aware of proposals but did not understand them. The Committee therefore recommended, for example, that the plan make it clear how the principles, policies, standards and special requirements it sets down are linked to the old NCDC policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The future role of the plan itself needed clarification and the Committee recommended that the National Capital Planning Authority's intention to review gazetted policies be made explicit and that a timetable for the review be included in the plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations that I have referred to so far dealt with the plan in a general way. The Committee also made a number of recommendations about specific proposals for areas of land to be identified as designated areas or areas where special requirements will apply. The approach adopted by the Committee, when reviewing these proposals, was generally that leased land should not be made designated land nor should land where a significant Commonwealth involvement does not exist. It was felt that these areas should only be designated where it is necessary for the integrity of the character of the national capital. There were instances where the Committee thought that for some areas a better balance of Commonwealth, Territory and private interest would be better achieved if special requirements were applied rather than designation. In each case the Committee believed that such an approach would not jeopardise the national capital role of the A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Capital Planning Authority's revised draft was recently tabled in the Parliament as the certified draft national capital plan. The Committee has not yet had the opportunity to look at the certified draft in any detail. It appears that, in taking previous comments and criticisms into account, the National Capital Planning Authority has rectified many of the problems identifed by the Committee. However the adequacy of the certified draft is a matter for the further review that I referred to when I began my comments and I do not want to pre-empt that review. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This audit report deals with the Royal Australian Mint's coin production. It deals with a matter of some concern which has been costing taxpayers multimillions of dollars a year. The Auditor-General has recommended that some action be taken to stop this unnecessary drain on public funds. It has emerged from a gross miscalculation some years ago about the demand for coinage. The Auditor-General found that stocks above the recommended levels had been accumulated in the early 1980s, with a production cost of over $20m, and had been on hand from 1983 to 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>Using a long term bond rate of 13% it calculated that the carrying cost of the capital tied up in this excess was about $3m per year. </PARA>
<PARA>It was said that the excess stocks had been difficult to dissipate `largely because of a fall in demand for circulating coins'. I understand that the Treasury's estimate now of the need for coins in the next few years is nil. In fact the Treasury's comment, as I recall it, was that it envisages that demand estimates for each coin-20c, 50c and $1-over the next three years will approach zero. I am not necessarily blaming anyone for that miscalculation, but it is evident that the structural change in the demand for coinage seemed to emerge in part from the introduction particularly of the $2 coins and to some extent of the $1 coin. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank repurchases coins which are surplus to the community's re quirements. It told the Auditor-General that during the 1980s it accumulated stocks of 20c, 50c and $1 coins in excess of its normal trading requirements and that the Mint's excess stocks have been increased by its repurchase of $100m face value of 20c, 50c and $1 coins from the Reserve Bank in 1987-88 and 1988-89. The cost of production of these coins was about $13m. The Audit Office, using the current long-term bond rate, calculates the carrying cost of excess stocks at the cost of production is now about $3 3/4m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is, how are we to resolve this problem? The facts are that from 1985-86 the Mint virtually ceased new production of 20c, 50c and $1 coins, so there is no new production coming on, although the Mint seems to want to keep lots of blanks. I am not quite certain why that is the case, but it seems to want to maintain a large stock of blanks just in case demand changes. As I have said, apart from the issue of bicentennial coins in 1988, the Mint virtually ceased new production of 20c, 50c and $1 coins, and a trial meltdown was conducted in July 1989 after the Treasurer's approval had been obtained for the conversion of surplus stocks into metal cake. In late 1989 the Mint decided to melt down progressively $55m face value of its stock of 20c and 50c coins and the Mint will use this metal to produce 5c and 10c blanks. The meltdown will be undertaken on an as-needed basis, and the Mint expects that this will provide the metal for the production of 5c and 10c blanks for about five years. At present, though, the excess $1 coins are to be stored to meet demand, and consideration is to be given to the feasibility of their meltdown.</PARA>
<PARA> The Audit Office is critical of the delay in addressing the problem of the excess stocks of 20c coins which became apparent as early as 1982-83. It recommends that the meltdown should begin as quickly as possible to realise offsetting savings in the cost of 5c and 10c blanks and eventual savings in storage costs. As I have said, the only criticism is in the delay in resolving this problem, although the Auditor-General makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of inefficiencies inherent in the present system of distribution which lacks sufficient mechanisms to encourage the efficient management of stocks of coins. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope, as I am sure do other senators, that the Auditor-General's recommendations are carried out with speed by the Royal Australian Mint, which clearly will not be in great need of great volumes of funds, I hope, in future estimates, as it will not be producing a large number of coins for quite some time. I look forward to seeing some reduction in future estimates requirements at the next Estimates committee meeting. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Eighty-sixth report of the Committee which deals with its operations from July 1988 to June 1989. The report describes in detail the scrutiny by the Committee of the 1,352 instruments which came before it in the course of the year, to ensure that the Executive and other law-makers comply with its principles of parliamentary propriety and personal rights and liberties. It sets out statistics of the types of instruments examined and the ministerial undertakings obtained in respect of concerns raised by the Committee. It also lists undertakings implemented during the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The report sets out in one convenient document the whole of the operations of the Committee. The Chairman makes a statement to the Senate at the end of each group of sittings on the Committee's work during those sittings. It is also usual to incorporate in Hansard correspondence with Ministers and a short statement in respect of each instrument where the Committee feels obliged to give a protective notice of motion of disallowance. The report draws together these threads into a single source of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegated legislation considered by the Committee is, of course, made under the authority of Acts of Parliament, and imposes duties and grants rights which are in no way less than those derived from Acts. The Committee believes that it has a trust from the Senate in its non-partisan scrutiny of delegated legislation for breaches of its principles which relate to compliance with the enabling statute, observance of personal rights, provision of review of administrative decisions and avoidance of provisions more appropriate for enactment by the Parliament. These are principles with which I know the Senate is closely associated. </PARA>
<PARA> The report should also be of benefit to officers of departments and statutory authorities who are involved in the making of delegated legislation. Ministers should take this opportunity to direct their departmental officers to meet the requirements noted in the report when preparing delegated legislation to place before the Minister or the Executive Council. It is a test and a yardstick of efficient administration in departments that the standards of the Committee are known and applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the report demonstrates that the Committee has carried out its high duties in a manner which justifies the continued confidence of the Senate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the statement of the work of the Committee during the Autumn sittings of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT OF WORK OF COMMITTEE</PARA>
<PARA>DURING AUTUMN SITTINGS 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The work of the Committee during these sittings has been unusual in that the number of sitting weeks has been much less due to the elections on 24 March 1990. The scrutiny which normally takes place over the whole of a normal sittings has been compressed into four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The considerable volume of delegated legislation which came before the Committee in that short time illustrates its position in Australian public administration. Although the Parliament did not meet for more than four months, the parent Acts which authorise the Executive and others to make laws remained in operation, and delegated legislation was added to Commonwealth law at a rate scarcely less than during a normal sittings. It may be that the Executive could not function without delegated legislation, especially where flexibility and technical detail are elements of a particular scheme or a continuing program. Such law making by the Executive does not occur in a vacuum. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee acts as a surrogate of Parliament to scrutinise in minute detail every instrument of delegated legislation to ensure compliance with parliamentary propriety and personal rights. </PARA>
<PARA> This scrutiny is procedurally possible because of the legislative requirement that all delegated legislation be tabled in both Houses and be liable to disallowance. In practice, however, it is only in the Senate where disallowance occurs. Such extreme action is rarely necessary, however, as a Minister will usually undertake to amend an offending instrument to meet the concerns of the Committee or will explain the provisions of the instrument to its satisfaction. The Senate has never failed to act on a recommendation of the Committee. This confidence of the Senate in its longest serving committee, with the exception of certain domestic committees; is due not to any procedural formalities. It is because the Committee has earned this respect due to the most notable characteristic of its operations. That is, that it operates in a non-partisan fashion, with no consideration to party loyalties or to the broad policy merits of individual instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> This trust of the Senate is, in turn, reflected in the dealings of the Committee with Ministers. A communication from the Committee is recognised by Ministers and administrators as dealing with only technical legislative scrutiny which could not affect the efficiency of any properly conceived administrative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The following Table lists the different instruments of delegated legislation which have been considered by the Committee during these four weeks of sittings. The list is noteworthy for its length and variety. A number of entries in the list have themselves been telescoped for ease of reference. The Education Determinations, for example, are made under various provisions of a number of parent Acts. It is not possible conveniently to list these in any other form due to deficiencies in numbering and citation. The same applies to the Health Determinations. The legislation in the list was made under parent Acts administered by Ministers through every Department of State and important statutory authorities. Even the Statutory Rules series alone is made on the advice of almost all Ministers and in some cases directly by judges of Commonwealth courts. The Parliamentary Presiding Officers' Determinations are made by officers of the Parliament. </PARA>

When a defect comes to its notice a letter is sent to the Minister responsible for making or administering the legislation in question, with a request to amend the offending provision or parent Act, to take administrative action or to provide further background explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> In these sittings the Committee detected what appeared to be defects in 107 of the 550 instruments which it considered. These defects are set out below under each of the four principles. These principles are not mutually exclusive. For example, failure to provide proper review of an adverse exercise of a discretion is also a breach of personal rights. </PARA>
<PARA>(a) Is the delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA> This principle includes the general reference of parliamentary propriety. This is not interpreted narrowly to mean only that an instrument is within the authority granted by Parliament to the Executive to make laws. Like all the principles of the Committee it is broad and evolutionary. The Committee was concerned at the following aspects of various instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental principle of parliamentary propriety that if delegated legislation authorises instruments of a legislative nature then provision should be made for parliamentary tabling and disallowance of those instruments. Such provisions may grant power to exempt from provisions or fees or to otherwise affect the operation of the principal instrument. If such power only applies to individual cases then a right of review of the merits of decisions may be appropriate. If, however, a group or class is affected then the resulting instrument may be legislative and should be subject to control by Parliament in the same way as the principal instrument. The Committee questioned a provision for Departmental by-laws with no tabling and disallowance requirements. Another case required a certificate of exemption from review procedures to be tabled but did not provide for disallowance. In another a definition of ``drugs'', which was an important element in the entire scheme effected by the delegated legislation, could be varied by a declaration in the Gazette with no tabling or disallowance. The power to exempt or vary may be a power equal to that of the original law maker. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary propriety is also affected if an instrument on its face is unusual to the extent that its provisions may have been unintended. In such cases the Explanatory Statement should fully describe the background. For example, one instrument which determined the remuneration of important office holders was followed a few days later by another, next in the series, which duplicated the same remuneration for the same office holders. In another case, one instrument made in 1990 was expressed to come into operation on the date of the coming into operation of a provision of a 1980 Act. One instrument determined allowances for every State of the United States in one part and in another omitted one State. In one instrument the Chairpersons of various Committees set up by regulation could appoint an acting member, whereas in most similar cases the Minister had this power. On a lighter note, the Committee was intrigued by a breakfast allowance for New York which was double that for lunch. This was made up for, however, by a dinner allowance which was six times that of lunch. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee always checks that particular procedural requirements for the making of delegated legislation have been met. In suitable cases this should be actually advised in a recital in the enacting words. In other cases it may be sufficient to include the advice in the Explanatory Statement. In one case the Minister was required to approve a project before determining an amount of money to be spent in respect of the project. The instrument itself, however, did not refer to an approval or even a project, but merely determined a sum of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Following instructions from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, Acts of Parliament now provide in effect for commencement at least within six months of Assent. This beneficial development has not been followed by all delegated legislation. The Committee questioned two instruments which provided for commencement on a date to be fixed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette, which could be any time in the future, or even not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that delegated legislation should be drafted and made to the same high standards as Acts of Parliament. The Committee questions instruments where these high standards are not met. One instrument was headed with a particular citation but referred to another citation in its body, a citation which was also used for a later instrument in the series. Some copies have been defective, with pages missing or with printing so poor that it could not be read. Others contained drafting and typographical errors serious enough to confuse users. One contained more than 100 handwritten alterations with no initials or other evidence of authentication. One instrument was described on its face as having been made on the advice of a Minister whose title was evidently transposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases Explanatory Statements were still not provided and in others there was no system of numbering or citation to assist the Parliament, the Committee and the public. Citation was poor or lacking completely even for instruments which in one case authorised the release of private information and in others authorised the payment of Commonwealth money. As discussed later in more detail, a number of Explanatory Statements did not explain reasons for increases in taxes and fees. </PARA>
<PARA> One recent development has been a tendency to make different Statutory Rules with the same title, on the advice of the same Minister, amending the same principal Regulations made under the same parent Act, on the same day and with consecutive numbers in the series. There have been many such examples of this in the last six months. In the most extreme example of this trend, eight separate such Statutory Rules, all with the same title and other features described above, were made on the same day. The Committee has questioned the legislative policy which results in this apparent duplication of time and resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Another characteristic of the sittings has been the number of Statutory Rules issued with a pink slip attached advising that the copy is to be substituted for an earlier, presumably defective, copy. Two such Statutory Rules were issued with a pink slip advising that the copies were to be substituted for two earlier, separate, defective, copies. This is a level of presentation which falls below that expected by the Committee. In almost every case the Explanatory Statement is silent on the reasons for the substitution, even where the different copies have different dates of making by the Governor-General. In other cases there is no apparent difference at all between the two, or three copies, with even typographical errors reproduced in the later versions. The Committee was particularly concerned that some of these defective copies may have been distributed to the public or other users. Again, there was no assurance on this point in the later Explanatory Statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The substituted copies raise problems of invalidity. Several of the sets of Statutory Rules were expressly advised as having been made in reliance on amendments of the parent Act which received assent after the putative date of making of the first copy. There may also be invalidity questions under s.48A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which provides that regulations are not to be remade while they are required to be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Does the delegated legislation trespass unduly upon personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is always particularly vigilant where personal rights are concerned. During the reporting period the Committee was concerned about the following matters. </PARA>
<PARA> One area where the Committee always raises questions is where provision is made for the issue of search warrants without including the highest possible safeguards. The right of entry of public officials onto private premises, in many cases by force if necessary, requires close scrutiny. One instrument provided for the Secretary of a Department to issue a warrant. This was a breach of the important safeguard that warrants should only be issued by a judicial officer. In addition, the Secretary could delegate this power to any person at all. Another instrument empowered the Minister or a delegate to issue warrants, although delegation was restricted to senior officers of the Department. Again, this was a breach of the principle and safeguard that in these matters a person should not be a judge in their own cause. Such issue was a serious matter, as the warrant in this case authorised the destruction of certain buildings and property found on the premises. The Committee questioned another case where a warrant could be issued by a magistrate, who is a judicial officer, or a Justice of the Peace, who is not, and where the prescribed form of the warrant was not mandatory. In another case the Committee was concerned at the lack of provision for a mandatory form of warrant even where issue was required by a judge. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is always concerned at provisions creating strict liability offences, that is, where there may be no intention by a person to commit an offence, or even no knowledge that an offence exists. Such provisions have potential for breaches of personal liberties and the Committee accepts strict liability only in exceptional circumstances and after full explanation from the Minister. Strict liability provisions included a failure to provide information to a public official and a prohibition on discharging more than 20 persons from a tourist boat in certain areas, even apparently if the boat caught fire or was sinking. Another instance involved a prohibition on keeping certain hazardous objects on land or interfering with authorised public officials who entered upon that land. The Committee was especially concerned that in this latter case there was not even a provision requiring such authorised public officials to carry and produce proper photographic identity and evidence of their authority. In this context, the Committee normally insists that any public official with the power to enter private premises, whether by warrant or otherwise, carry the fullest identification. </PARA>
<PARA>Another aspect of offence provisions that draws an immediate response from the Committee is any reversal of the normal onus of proof which, of course, lies with the prosecution. It is a principle of personal liberty that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The Committee will accept the reversal of this presumption only in special circumstances. This is the position even where, as in the one case considered during these sittings, there were a number of elements in the offence of which only one reversed the onus of proof. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee questions any provision which gives the executive unusual powers which affect personal rights. One instrument made extensive provision for a number of committees to advise the Minister on important policy issues. The Minister was empowered to appoint Committee members, who were required to be highly qualified and eminent. Although the maximum period of appointment was only three years the Minister could remove members for no reason and with no explanation. The usual provision in such cases restricts removal to proven misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Wherever an instrument imposes, or provides for a change in the rate of taxes, charges or fees, the Committee requires the Explanatory Statement to set out the basis for the calculation of the rate, the change from the previous rate and the period during which the previous rate was in force. The level and calculation of taxes and charges directly affects personal liberties and any unusual or unexplained increase may breach those liberties. One instrument advised that an increase in charges from $860 to $2000 in little more than 12 months was ``to meet costs''. Other increases from 2.5 cents to 13.5 cents and an increase of 50% were not explained at all. On the other hand, a reduction of 40% in a levy was also unexplained. </PARA>
<PARA>On a related issue the parent Act of one instrument provided that fees charged by the regulations must not amount to taxation. There was no such assurance in the Explanatory Statement. In addition, the Explanatory Statement stated that the fees had been set following advice from an Industry-Government Consultative Committee. The Committee asked whether such advice had actually been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Delegated legislation may deprive people of their property in the course of provision for a scheme or program. In such cases the committee is vigilant to ensure that the compensation process is as fair as possible. In one case personal service of a notice for compensation purposes could be substituted by a notice in the Gazette and in a local newspaper. Failure by an affected person to take action then generally resulted in loss of a right to compensation. In addition, compensation was not payable where another person had been compensated in good faith in respect of the same matter. Such a provision prevented payment where the government may have acted in good faith, but negligently. </PARA>
<PARA> Procedural requirements, as with the substituted service just mentioned, have the potential to affect personal rights. In one instrument, involving appeal rights, persons had to be `told' of the result of a hearing. In another, the Reserve Bank had to `tell' banks of an accounting day. It appeared that telling for these important matters could be merely oral. This contrasted with another instrument which required `telling in writing'. </PARA>
<PARA> Expressions in delegated legislation should be precise and certain. Subjective and vague provisions could breach personal rights. Some such words and phrases questioned by the Committee include `adequately supervised', `keeps up to date', `successful business record', `distinguished talent', `has a national reputation' and `regional and global priorities of the Commonwealth'. Failure to comply with such provisions could result in prosecution or the exclusion from personal and economic benefits. In such cases, of course, the Committee believes review of adverse decisions should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) Does the delegated legislation unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal?</PARA>
<PARA> This principle complements the Committee's vigilance with respect to personal rights and liberties. Any discretion granted to a Minister or administrator to make a decision which could adversely affect an individual is scrutinised for appropriate external review of the merits of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee prefers independent external review of the merits of administrative decisions rather than internal review, even if such review is conducted by an independent specialist tribunal constituted expressly to consider such reviews. The Committee generally refuses to accept that final review should be conducted by a public official or a delegate of the Minister. In this context the Committee questioned provisions under which a specialist internal review tribunal could not make a final, binding decision but could only recommend in respect of an earlier decision, following a procedure where only the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police was entitled to be represented. Review by the Minister personally is more acceptable as the Minister is, of course, liable to be examined in parliament on his or her actions. The Committee's preference is for review of executive discretions to be conducted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which is an independent body of legal and technical experts able to place itself in the position of the original decision maker and to substitute its decision for the original decision made. The case for review is more pressing where a statutory decision maker is given authority to delegate that power. </PARA>
<PARA> In some instruments external review was provided for some discretions but not for others. In these cases the Committee believes that if review is appropriate for some discretions which are part of a general scheme, then in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, review should be provided for all such discretions. In some situations it appears that absence of universal review rights in a particular scheme was a mere oversight, corrected as soon as the Committee drew attention to the defect. In other cases the Minister explained to the satisfaction of the Committee why external review was inappropriate. Such reasons included decisions to be made in emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee always looks carefully at discretions involving the rights of individuals to carry on a business or to practise a trade or profession. Such considerations are also part of the Committee's brief to safeguard personal liberties. Decisions affecting important commercial rights, such as the power to withdraw or cancel export entitlements, were raised, as was the failure to provide review of a decision not to waive or reduce fees, where such fees could amount to tens of thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases the Minister may advise the Committee that a discretion relates to the allocation of a finite resource, where the overturn of an existing decision and its substitution by another will result in a chain of alterations to other decisions, to the detriment and confusion of those affected. The Administrative Review Council, the peak Commonwealth advisory body on all aspects of administrative review, has accepted that in such cases independent external review of the merits by a body such as the AAT with all the rights of the original decision maker, may not be appropriate. The Committee may accept such advice although where this is the case it will look with particular care to ensure safeguards exist with respect to the original decision, such as detailed and precise criteria to guide and control the decision maker. </PARA>
<PARA> Such criteria should be provided wherever possible in all delegated legislation. In several cases, however, the effect of detailed criteria was diluted by the addition of an additional criterion such as `any other factors that are relevant' or `any other factors that the Commissioner considers relevant'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is particularly concerned where discretions are provided but there is no mention of review rights either in the instrument itself or in the Explanatory Statement. Such rights may, of course, be provided by the parent Act, by the parent regulations in the case of certain Orders, by the principal regulations or by other instrument. Review rights should in such cases be set out in the Explanatory Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In one such case a statutory authority could determine payments out of a fund to holders of equity in the fund with no apparent review of any adverse decision in respect of classes of equity or even between individuals in a class. This was even though the Explanatory Statement advised that there was no automatic right of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee questioned a reference to `reasonable costs' with no indication of a right of review of an adverse decision, as it did with a discretion to determine whether costs were `excessive'. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Committee asked for further advice where, although AAT review was provided, the Minister could exclude this right by giving a certificate on public interest grounds, with provision only for tabling but not disallowance of the certificate. In this instance the Explanatory Statement advised that the right of review was included on the recommendation of the Administrative Review Council. There was no corresponding advice on whether the exclusion certificate had been recommended by the ARC. </PARA>
<PARA> Discretions may affect individual employees of the Commonwealth as well as commercial enterprises. The Committee asked for clarification of review rights of a discretion to reimburse interest where a public servant is transferred and subsequently takes out an unregulated mortgage in place of a regulated. Similar discretions in respect of a disability and other allowances were questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In one set of regulations there were 11 separate decision makers expressly mentioned, including State and Territory Ministers and officials and, in two cases, non-government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>(d) Does the delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA> No instrument was questioned under this principle during the sittings. The Committee awaits, however, resolution of a matter which it first raised several years ago and which it has continued to press. The Sex Discrimination (Operation of Legislation) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 200, continued in operation for a further 12 month period, to 31 July 1990, certain legislation which would otherwise be in breach of the parent Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This was the sixth year in a row that these discriminatory laws had been prolonged by regulation. The Committee indicated to the Minister that amendment of the Act would be appropriate rather than further regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> An analysis of the legislation which has come before the Committee this sittings emphasises a trend noticed before in these statements. This is that the Statutory Rules series, which is the best drafted and produced of all of the scores of series of delegated legislation, is a clear minority of the instruments which come before the Committee. As noted earlier during the survey on the principles of the Committee, the Statutory Rules series may have defects. It is, nevertheless, markedly superior to all other series, due largely to the safeguards imposed by the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903. Much of the other delegated legislation lacks this protection and, although subject to tabling and possible disallowance, is not acceptable in quality of drafting or presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the legislation is encouraging. The considerable numbers of Civil Aviation Orders, Defence Determinations and Public Service Determinations all deal with matters which are particularly suited to executive law making. The Civil Aviation Orders deal with technical engineering requirements and the other Determinations largely with the minutae of financial aspects of personnel administration. Other series of instruments, which are not equal in presentation to these series or, of course, to the Statutory Rules, sometimes address issues which are less obviously appropriate to delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the generally good response that the Committee receives from Ministers and departmental officials there are still areas of concern. When the Committee reconvened after a break of more than four months it found that some replies to correspondence were still outstanding. It is essential that officers address such queries with a priority that reflects the importance of the subject matter and the gravity of a communication from a Committee of the Parliament. On behalf of the Committee I have written reminders in respect of this correspondence, indicating that if necessary the Committee would repeat its initiative of last year and invite senior departmental officials to appear before it to explain long delays. Such an option is also available to the Committee in respect of undertakings to amend legislation which remain outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Committee are grateful to their colleagues in the Senate for their commitment to its non-partisan parliamentary ideals of protection of personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the first report by the Committee under the new procedures for review of annual reports by standing committees. The report is self-explanatory in its assessment of the 35 annual reports referred to the Committee in the second half of 1989. All of the 34 reports for 1988-89 were judged to be `apparently satisfactory'. One 1987-88 report was tabled extremely late and the Committee has commented on this unsatisfactory aspect, the inadequacy of the explanation and the failure to comply with the requirements of the Act. This report was the only one amongst the six listed by the President as apparently tabled late which was in fact late. </PARA>
<PARA> The unusual sitting pattern in the current session made necessary by the timing of the election restricted the scope of the Committee's survey. As the report makes clear, the Committee envisages in the Budget Session a review process which will include short public hearings and a focus on particular areas of concern. Among issues highlighted in this report is the failure of most reports to meet the Government's requirement that reports should specify `results achieved and progress towards the achievement of objectives and targets'. The Committee will give particular attention to this issue in its current inquiry into Estimates committee procedures. The Committee intends to hold hearings in this inquiry and to report during the coming Budget period of sittings. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were discussing this matter earlier today I was going through the reasons put forward by Senator Watson when he moved this amendment on 2 November. I wish to quote from the Hansard again where Senator Watson emphatically points out that this is not a taxing measure; it is a machinery Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If the Government is using this measure as a taxing Bill, then it is a disgrace. It is morally wrong and outrageous to use the back-door methods that it will be attempting to apply to get extra revenue from public hospitals and public universities which, according to its logic, the Government should not be doing. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time the amendment moved by Senator Watson was carried 32:24. We next debated this matter on 30 November when we had a message from the House of Representatives saying that the House of Representatives had disagreed with the Senate's amendment. Senator Watson said this:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is not impressed with the reasons given by the House of Representatives in transmitting its message No. 577 . . . In response to that, I remind the Senate that the reduction in revenue has been estimated by the Government at $50m. While this is a deemed loss to the Government, it is an imposition of $50m on public hospitals, benevolent institutions-perhaps only one would qualify; the Australian Red Cross-and public universities . . . Can the Minister . . . convince us that that $50m has been given back by virtue of payments to the States and others, to public hospitals, benevolent institutions and universities?</PARA>
<PARA>We have not been convinced of that in this debate and yet we are told that we should not proceed with this amendment. Senator Watson continues:</PARA>
<PARA>If so, we would be quite happy to allow this amendment to lapse. But he cannot. The Government is trying to claw back, by a backdoor method, revenue to these vital institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in his speech he says this:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not asking for something that is unreasonable; rather, we are asking that the Government fund these bodies adequately and that it does not claw the funds back through the back door. </PARA>
<PARA> These bodies, particularly public hospitals, operate on deficit finance or overdraft arrangements; they are nearly always in the red, with their funding from the public purse in arrears rather than in advance. Therefore, most are faced with making interest payments on their overdraft; so the Government's interest gained is their interest lost and that is what we must recognise. Those interest payments are currently at rates of between 20 and 25 per cent. Should they now be expected to make twice-monthly remittances of pay as you earn tax, this will disrupt their planned cash flows and place them further in debt. </PARA>
<PARA>That is still the case. That has not changed. They will still be further in debt. If that was a reason given on 30 November to support this amendment I believe that it is a reason now. Senator Watson then goes on to point out the consequences of these actions:</PARA>
<PARA>These bodies-the public hospitals, public universities and benevolent institutions-also rely very heavily on donations and bequests from individuals, particularly for capital works and equipment purchase projects. So, what will happen? People donate money to the Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital for beds and redecorating children's wards but, in the future, as a result of this legislation some of that money will be used to pay the debt interest. </PARA>
<PARA>That is still the case. Nothing has changed. The losers, Senator Watson summarises, will be the kids and the facilities the donors provide. That is still the case. Nothing has changed. The kids and the facilities will be affected. `This type of legislation is not the humanitarian sort of thing which governments should be involved in', Senator Watson says. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is disgraceful. It will not be possible to transfer debt to the public funding body. </PARA>
<PARA>Now we have the Opposition, however, being willing to do that-being willing, in fact, to hit those kids in the public institutions, being willing to load benevolent institutions with further debt and in fact not holding the line on this. Opposition members know that if they had held the line the Government would have accepted it this time round. But they went to water. They went to water and are quite happy to allow this to roll over now, having done that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why does Senator Watson not actually listen? In that particular debate, Senator Haines, speaking for the Democrats at that time, said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To require those sorts of institutions to come up with tens of millions of dollars, just because the Government wants this one-off boost to revenue, is bizarre, to put it mildly. They will have to acquire this money from somewhere, and that means either cutting their expenditure in some area . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and Senator Watson agrees with that: that is what they will have to-</PARA>
<PARA>or borrowing the money-</PARA>
<PARA>and Senator Watson agrees with that-</PARA>
<PARA>which will impose additional stresses on their finances for repayment, to say nothing of the additional pressures that it will apply to lending institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Stone also at that stage supported this particular proposition. I think honourable senators in here remember him for his very dry approach to economics. He said something which I think was very interesting. In referring to what the Minister had done by way of reply when he said that the interest payments would minuscule, Senator Stone said this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he has described the interest cost to these bodies as minuscule . . . 22 per cent of $50m is $11m, as far as I know. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is worth repeating. If that in fact is the case-and it used to be when I was at school; I do not think it has changed since-and we have had an admittance from the Government that is the amount of money we are talking about, then that is not a pittance for public institutions that are in debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The type of response that the Government made, of course, was that at some stage they will start to look at this issue somewhere down the track to decide whether or not they should readjust the exercise with regard to public hospitals, tertiary institutions and benevolent organisations. We are now further down the track and nothing has happened. This particular amendment is not in fact asking anything different from what currently happens. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to go through what is the situation with regard to the tax treatment of these particular bodies. Are we suggesting something out of the ordinary with regard to them? Let us have a look at what the current situation is. Public benevolent institutions, including public hospitals, are exempt from the fringe benefits tax. Religious, scientific, charitable and public education institutions, are exempt from income tax and hence capital gains tax. Public benevolent institutions, public or non-profit hospitals, universities and public or non-profit schools are exempt from the bank account debit tax. Similar institutions under State imposts are exempt from financial institutions duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Public hospitals, public universities and public benevolent institutions qualify for exemptions from State stamp duties. Public hospitals, public education institutions and non-profit bodies are exempt from State land taxes. Public hospitals, public education institutions and benevolent organisations are exempt from State payroll taxes. Public hospitals, public education institutions and benevolent organisations are exempt from local government rates. Public hospitals, public education institutions and benevolent organisations are exempt from sales tax. They are also exempt from diesel excise, and from alcohol excise where it is used for sterilisation and not for consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> So what we have is a vast range of exceptions made for these particular bodies. What this amendment is suggesting is in fact not to establish a regime that makes them different; this amendment in fact is to establish a regime in keeping with the way that they have always been treated. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this was worth supporting last year. We supported Senator Watson last year when he moved this on behalf of the Opposition, and we supported him when it came back the first time. We supported him when it came back the second time. I really do believe that if the arguments were valid then-and, as Senator Watson must acknowledge, nothing has changed-those arguments are valid now. Under those circumstances I believe, since we are not talking about a tax Bill but a machinery Bill, the Opposition cannot say that this is a matter of taxation unless Senator Watson wishes also to renege on that explanation to the Senate last year. So I think we quite properly ought to continue with our support of this amendment and send the Bill back to the House of Representatives in the amended form so that those particular institutions that are named in the amendment-those public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities-are not further imposed on with regard to costs and charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position of the Opposition was fully outlined during my second reading address, and I refer Senator Macklin to those comments. But I would like to add that governments and the three affected bodies have had now almost six months to adjust their accounting provisions, to adjust their finance. We are approaching a new financial period-1 July-and these bodies will be affected for approximately 14 days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that essentially, overall, as a maximum we are looking towards $50m but it is not really $50m because it is only a timing extra cost on that $50m-that is, $15m, which is interest for about 14 days applicable to the $50m. That is the real cost that these people will incur and we believe that governments will finance these bodies appropriately in the coming financial year commencing 1 July. These provisions do not apply until June this year and I believe that we were right in putting forward those amendments. We put the pressure on the Government. I believe it will respond adequately with the financial arrangements for the year commencing 1 July. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel almost irrelevant to this debate. I almost left it to Senator Macklin and Senator Watson but I thought I should briefly reiterate the Government's position. Obviously we oppose the amendment. We, as I said in the second reading debate, did not accept the arguments that were put in November when the legislation was deferred. We do not think they were correct then and we have not changed that view, but we certainly endorse the view now adopted by the Opposition that had it been true then, the changed circumstances have certainly overcome such problems as there might have been, Senator Macklin referred to the changed circumstances, and Senator Watson said I think in November that it would disrupt the planned cash flows of the institutions. It certainly will not disrupt the planned cash flows of the institutions now. They have had six months to cope with two weeks of disruption before the next financial year and six months to cope through their governments and other bodies with subsequent funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not go into all the arguments that we put in seemingly never-ending debates last year. I will simply say that what we are talking about is the transfer of taxpayers' money to the Government through an institution which is merely the conduit for that transfer, and that is the role which ideally it ought to play. Administratively it is necessary for some accumulation. We are trying to minimise that accumulation because it is not the institution's money; it is the taxpayers' money en route to the Government and it ought to get there as quickly as possible. It is part of a broader strategy that will in the end lead to a beneficial variation for small employers who will be able to remit on a less frequent basis than at present as the system develops, and therefore we oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not disagree with the proposition put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan)-that is, that if the Government wishes to rearrange the way in which these taxes are collected, then it is entitled to do so. In fact, when the Government made this announcement, we expressed support. The Opposition at that stage expressed opposition. The reason the Bill went through is that we supported it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not that particular matter with which we disagree. We disagree with the imposition of the tax on these particular bodies. We think that the item that Senator Watson raised last year was an important one. Earlier today Senator Watson, in response, said that he is now confident that the Government is going to do something. I am very happy to see this newfound confidence of the Opposition in the fact that the Government is going to do something, and I welcome that. I am not confident that it is going to do anything with regard to these matters. I am not confident that it is going to find the additional amount of money that it is going to cost those institutions or put that in its Budget in August for those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Watson has that firm, undying, unswerving faith in the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that I must admit is missing from my breast, then let him have that. I would say, `Grab this now and, if the Government comes up with it, we can do something about it then'. The politics of the matter are that one does not trust the Government; one makes sure that these institutions are protected first, and then if the Government comes up with the money, one says `Fine'. What Senator Watson is doing is selling them out now in the hope that we can rely implicitly on the word of the Treasurer-a person I have never heard Senator Watson express a great deal of trust in previously but who is now a new-found friend and buddy-to help these institutions out. It is nice for him; it is not nice for us. We persist with the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The incorrect assertions from the Australian Democrats demand some comment. In terms of timing charges the cost to the Government in lost revenue might be $50m. The cost to these institutions in respect of the one month is only the financing cost on that $50m, and that is for basically a full year. So it is quite incorrect to say it is going to cost hospitals, et cetera, $50m. It is a timing charge because it is slipped into the current year vis-a-vis the next year, so it is only a financing cost of the $50m. I think that correction deserves to be made. Certainly it is a cost to the Government in terms of the extra revenue it will give, but that is only a transfer cost, a timing difference. Senator Macklin has confused the difference between a timing cost and a financing cost.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that there is a need for a definition of a community service and community service organisations. I refer to page 10 of the explanatory memorandum. I believe that it would be preferable for the legislation to stand on its own. Therefore, the definition of community service and/or community service organisations should be included in clause 6 of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) because I think in future years people will refer to that Bill and I do not believe they should have to refer to an explanatory memorandum to get the full interpretation of what a community service organisation is all about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond briefly to that question. The objective is a shared objective of making the definition as clear as possible. I should say firstly that a lot of time was put in trying to get as specific a definition as possible and to get something comprehensive and precise beyond that which we have proved extremely difficult. While giving an undertaking that I will look at it again, for future reference I have to say my first reaction is that an attempt to be more specific is more likely to narrow than broaden the definition because, in the attempt to be specific, by being inclusive one tends to exclude the things not specifically referred to and it may cause a problem. I am not antagonistic to the thrust of the suggestion and I am happy to give an assurance that we will look at that matter, but I do not want to generate great optimism about the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move on to clause 7, which proposes to insert new section 26bc, securities lending arrangements. Scrip lending involves, for example, a seller of shares who has not yet received scrip from an earlier purchase on the Stock Exchange borrowing comparable scrip purchases, usually through a major institution to effect the transfer arising from the sale. The borrower of the scrip subsequently returns to the lender the scrip received from the earlier purchase to complete the borrowing transaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such arrangements have existed on Australian stock exchanges and most overseas stock exchanges for many years and are important in assisting the proper functioning of the Stock Exchange. However, capital gains tax questions have arisen as to whether the lending-borrowing of scrip constitutes sales-purchases of the shares. The legislation before us seeks to overcome these perceived difficulties, but anti-avoidance measures, for example, the prescribing of disqualifying events such as dividends or rights issues occurring during a borrowing period or lending scrip for more than three months, make scrip lending impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a capital gains tax arises when the loan is returned after the books close for dividend rights entitlements, despite the amendments. Thus, on the advice that has been obtained by the Opposition, it appears that the Government's intention to facilitate the practice of scrip lending is prevented by the previous two mentioned anti-avoidance measures. However, scrip lending from offshore, I remind the chamber, can still occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that shortly after the Budget announcement of the change, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia wrote to the Treasury seeking clarification as to the treatment of the dividend distributions during the period of lending and a Mr G. R. Potts replied as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant legislation is to be framed such that dividends and associated franking credits paid during the term of a scrip lending arrangement that are received indirectly by the lender of the underlying scrip will be treated as though they had been received directly by the lender. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the chamber that it would seem that this undertaking was overlooked in the drafting of the Bill and cuts across effectively the whole practice of scrip lending. I seek an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that meaningful discussions between the Stock Exchange and the Treasury will proceed immediately to overcome the impracticalities to enable Australia, once again, to have a proper settlement process. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the Government was always to have a proper settlement process. It frames its anti-avoidance measures so widely that it has created this impasse. So the amendments do have imperfections; this is widely acknowledged. They also impede the efficacy of scrip lending. Unfortunately, the provisions are having very serious consequences for Australian stock exchanges and the need to receive serious consideration is important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now refer to clause 11, proposed changes to section 79, which involves proposed subsections 79e (8), (9) and (10). I recommend a reading of page 14 of the provision. Proposed subsection 79e (8) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In spite of any other provision of this section, if, before a year of income, a taxpayer: (a) has become a bankrupt; or (b) not having become a bankrupt, has been released from any debts by the operation of an Act relating to bankruptcy; then no loss incurred by the taxpayer before the day on which the taxpayer became a bankrupt or was so released is an allowable deduction. </PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 8 and 9 follow a similar theme. I wish to remind the Committee that these provisions have been drafted almost in an identical way to similar subsections of section 80 of the current Income Tax Assessment Act. I also remind the Committee that these specific provisions of section 80 were actually criticised by Mr Roach of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in case X1090 ATC149. There is a strong view now that there should be further amendments. Again, statute law revision seems to be the appropriate place to recognise the comments that have been made by Mr Roach in relation to section 80 to ensure that those comments now relate to the new provisions that have been drawn in. </PARA>
<PARA> We are disappointed that, Mr Roach having made these comments in relation to section 80, the Government did not pick them up when drafting proposed new subsection 79e, (8), (9) and (10). A consequence of Mr Roach's suggestion would be that the amendments would allow a deduction in respect of losses actually incurred and paid prior to the bankruptcy and also in respect of losses that have been paid in the course of the administration of the bankruptcy. In fact, the view that is expressed under proposed new subsection 79e (9) would also allow a deduction for debts paid in the year of the bankruptcy, but subsequent to the bankruptcy, where the debt was incurred prior to the bankruptcy. I believe it is unfortunate that we are now continuing to draft laws contrary to the intention and statements as emanated from, say, Mr Roach of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a long contribution to make in response to Senator Watson's comments. I appreciate the nature of concerns raised by Senator Watson. Only recently the Taxation Institute of Australia wrote to the Government about this matter. The provisions relating to losses in the Bill are identical to those in the draft, which was released in February. We did not get any such comments at that time. It made reaction difficult. It is the first time that these matters have come before us. We will look at them. I cannot give any current indication of what the likely reaction will be, other than to say that the representations are from reputable organisations and they will be examined accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to clause 22, particularly quarrying operations. Again, perhaps through a statute law revision Bill, or a miscellaneous provisions Bill, the Government could look at this. I would like the Government to consider a different approach in the treatment of housing and welfare in relation to quarrying operations. It is the belief that it would have been better to exclude housing and welfare from the Bill, except where the quarry is located in an isolated rural area, rather than having a total exclusion of such housing and welfare expenditure. I believe that because of the difficulties that the Government ran into in relation to its treatment of housing and welfare, the proposed new subsection 122jc is now actually not required as it does not, unlike its equivalent in section 122a, contain any reference to expenditure on plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I believe there is an unnecessary complication and inclusion when we refer to proposed new paragraph 122jc (4) because it is unnecessary for subparagraph (b) to refer to plant as expenditure in relation to plant is already excluded by the proposed new paragraph 122jc (2). In any case, it was referred to above all references to expenditure on plant in section 122a (1) and it has not been reproduced in proposed new subsection 122jc. As a consequence, I think the Government has run into some problems in relation to how it differentiated the housing and welfare by trying to make them as comparable as possible with general mining operations. I believe that those are purely tidying up provisions that should be considered at a later date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will have a very big statutes law or miscellaneous provisions Bill at this rate. Senator Watson did me the courtesy of raising the matter of quarrying with me prior to the committee stage. I thank him for that. There are significant concerns expressed by the officers advising about each of the proposals raised but it does not exclude consideration of them. The question of housing and welfare in isolated rural areas, as far as we know, does not arise, but there is nothing inherent in the nature of quarrying that makes it impossible-though it makes it unlikely-when we think about the economics of the operation. We can have a look if there are any examples of where there might be a problem caused by that. It is worth considering, though, that comparable circumstances to those arising in mining towns are not likely. Nevertheless, it is worth looking at and if there are circumstances we will consider that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are fairly concerned that the definitions should not be left open. We try to make them as only putting those things which are necessary as a safeguarding provision. But we are never averse to looking at positive suggestions about change. At this stage, we think, with the exception of housing and welfare, none of them need changing. Only if examples could be shown where an adverse consequence would flow would we be prepared to look at housing and welfare. We certainly have no intention of dealing with quarrying and mining differently in that regard. It is simple. On our best information the circumstances do not apply. But we are prepared to have a look at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to drawn the Committee's attention to clauses 42 to 45. This covers the insertion of a proposed new subsection which covers the insertion of proposed new section 160aqcb. It is a general anti-avoidance measure which will take effect from 1 July 1990. It concerns dividends streaming arrangements which are schemes to provide franked dividends; that is, those with imputation credits to those taxpayers who can use them-for example, taxable Australian residents who perhaps have a higher income. Also it relates to unfranked larger dividends for those who cannot derive benefits from imputation tax credits such as overseas people, charities and people on low incomes, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments, for the most practical purposes, will discourage the practice of companies giving shareholders a choice of accepting a streamed or selected dividend. I have received substantial representations stating that the amendments have unintended consequences of detrimental effect as they relate to arrangements between Australian companies and non-resident parent companies. The Government might like to consider the quarantining of these provisions just to Australian resident companies and allow the streaming operations to continue to extend to a parent company overseas. The Australian provisions that are to be inserted into the Act are very much more stringent, for example, than those operating in New Zealand which has similar provisions but they are far less onerous. In New Zealand, for example, they allow the dividend streaming to operate between New Zealand and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision before us will not even allow reciprocity between Australia and New Zealand. Perhaps an easy amendment could well be the insertion of the word `resident' on line 14 of page 47 of the Bill, between the words `another' and `company'. By that simple technique we would quarantine the anti-avoidance provisions purely to Australian operations and allow the full force of the law in existence prior to these amendments to flow to the parent company overseas. The application of withholding tax tends to minimise the impact of tax-avoiding proposals. The big anti-avoidance losses that are likely to occur and that these amendments seek to overcome occur in relation to deals done within Australia rather than with relationships between Australian companies and overseas parent companies. We believe that the legislation has unintended consequences which will create detrimental effects between Australian resident companies and their non-resident parent companies. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned about retrospective application. Good law would demand the application of proposed section 160AQCB(4) to limit the application of this section to dividends arising out of dividends streaming arrangements entered into after 15 August 1989, which would effectively stop them, or shares acquired after 15 August 1989. Accordingly, as existing shareholders who may be perceived to benefit from existing dividend selection arrangements dispose of their shares, the perceived loss to revenue reduces and ultimately disappears. I put two alternatives to the Senate: either quarantine the arrangements just to Australian resident operations or, preferably, eliminate the certainty of retrospective application by limiting the application of proposed new section 160AQCB(4)-that is, the new provision we are inserting into this Bill-to ensure that these arrangements do not apply after 15 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I will attempt to explain the detriment that can occur as a result of the provisions before us today, particularly in relation to an Australian company and its overseas parent. There is no significant loss to Australian revenue because the arrangements are not directed at the erosion of Australian revenue collections. The arrangements do not result in any significant erosion of such collections. There is a retrospective effect which we on this side of the Parliament believe is reprehensible because there will be a substantial and continuing detrimental impact on employees, foreign corporations and Australian investors, all of whom have acted and made substantial business decisions in good faith, based on the law and practice at the time. There will also be a detrimental loss to the Australian economy because of a substantial leakage of Australian-sourced profits to foreign jurisdictions. There will be a lower ability to attract Australian finance for the Australian operations of foreign corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from everything else, there will be a reduced capacity to buy back the farm. Ultimately, when our problems have been overcome, surely we should be interested in not putting forward tax laws that are going to inhibit Australian investors from buying back the farm because, effectively, this will dilute the overseas shareholding, particularly if those shares are issued on the Australian stock exchange. This will have quite detrimental effects. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of clarification, I seek leave to table a document that supports the comments I have made. I believe that by tabling this comment the Australian Taxation Office, the Government, et cetera, will be able to recognise fully in detail the summary that I have given to the Committee today. </PARA>

<PARA> ``160aqcb (1) where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) on a particular day after 30 June 1990, a company pays an unfranked dividend or a partly franked dividend (which unfranked dividend or partly franked dividend is in this subsection called the `scheme dividend') to a shareholder in the company; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the scheme dividend was paid under a dividend streaming arrangement:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) in relation to the company (in this subsection called the `debit company') or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in relation to another company (in this subsection called the `debit company'):</PARA>
<PARA>there arises on that day a franking debit of the debit company equal to the amount calculated using the following formula, as reduced by the amount (if any) of the franking debit of the company arising under s.160aqb in respect of the payment of the scheme dividend:</PARA>

<PARA> (a) on a particular day after 30 June 1990, a company (in this subsection called the `debit company') pays one or more franked dividends or issues tax exempt bonus shares (in this subsection called the `scheme dividend' or `scheme bonus shares' respectively) to a shareholder in the debit company; and</PARA>

I simply indicate that I will refer that document to the people involved in the simplification process.

<PARA> We do not believe that there is any retrospectivity or any unreasonable pressure on arrangements established by Australian corporations. One of the reasons for deferring the commencement of the measure to dividends paid under arrangements after 1 July 1990 was to allow companies time to adjust their arrangements. They have had some 11 months in which to do that. So we are not persuaded by that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Isolating the application of this to resident corporations seems to us to be not much more than an incentive to Australiana companies to move their operations offshore, which is not, I am sure, what Senator Watson intended and not what we wish to achieve or would approve of. We are not therefore persuaded that these sorts of changes ought to be approved at this time, and I do not want to indicate at this stage that we are likely to be moving in that direction. We believe that, on the evidence available to us at the moment, the proposals outlined are those which are most likely to achieve our objectives.

<PARA>(NO. 3) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 15-Insertion of new Division 16k (``Effect of Buy-back of Shares'') into Part III of the Act</PARA>
<PARA>The Institute notes proposed s.159gzzzt which is intended to operate to incorporate proposed ss.159gzzzn and 159gzzzq and 159gzzzs into Part IIIa of the Act. Specifically, the proposed section provides that, for the purposes of the application of Part IIIa to a taxpayer, where the expression ``provision of this Part'' or ``provisions of this Part'' is used in Part IIIa, the expression is taken to include a reference to ss.159gzzzn, 159gzzzq and 159gzzzs. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Institute notes that, although s.160zd (1) of the Act is expressed to be ``subject to this Part'', neither the expression ``provision of this Part'' nor ``provisions of this Part'' is used in s.160zd (1) of the Act. That is, a literal reading of the provision may render it inapplicable to s.160zd (1) of the Act, and, accordingly, both the specific provisions of the buy-back provisions relating to the consideration in respect of the disposal of a share and s.160zd of the Act would prime facie apply to buy-back transactions. In the Institute's view, a Court would be unlikely to construe proposed s.159gzzzt so narrowly, with the consequence that such a Court would be unlikely to hold that s.160zd of the Act has application in respect of a transaction involving the buy-back of shares. However, it is suggested that proposed s.159gzzzt should refer to the term ``this Part'', rather than the expressions ``provision of this Part'' and ``provisions of this Part'', in order to more precisely bring within its scope the words ``subject to this Part'' contained in s.160zd (1) of the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not opposing the Australian Securities Commission Amendment Bill, which we recognise the Government has had to introduce to provide for interim arrangements in the transition of corporate regulatory functions from the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) after 1 July this year. The NCSC will continue to exist until the changeover to the national scheme, whenever that might be, and new members will need to be appointed on or about 1 July. This Bill will enable full time members of the ASC to hold appointments as full time members of the NCSC as well; that is, the new members of the NCSC will be able to carry on as members of the ASC. The Opposition is not opposing this Bill because we recognise that it would be difficult to attract suitably qualified applicants to be members of the NCSC when it is likely to operate for only a few months. Overlapping appointments will avoid this problem and ensure a smooth transition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original intention was that the national scheme would commence operation on 1 July. The cooperative scheme arrangements must stay in place after that date because the Commonwealth and the States are still in the process of negotiating on major aspects of the national scheme, particularly the funding and staffing arrangements. It is now about a year since the package of corporation legislation was passed. The Australian Securities Commission was established on 1 July 1989, although that part of the Act which establishes the watchdog parliamentary committee has not yet been proclaimed. We believe that this is quite extraordinary in view of the emphasis given when the package of legislation was introduced to having the ASC and corporate regulation subject to the scrutiny of one parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The ASC's major problem is, however, that although it has a wide range of powers and functions which relate to the regulation of bodies corporate, it unfortunately has no Act to administer. The Corporations Act was passed a year ago, but has not yet been proclaimed. We now have the interesting situation where we have one commission, the NCSC, which has plenty of legislation to administer, but a rapidly diminishing number of staff to administer it; and another commission, the ASC, which has plenty of staff, but no legislation to administer. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the Government's Corporations Act has not been proclaimed is that several States launched a constitutional challenge to the legislation in the High Court of Australia. We warned the Government that what it was trying to do in attempting to take over the States' powers in relation to the incorporation of companies was simply not constitutional. The High Court, unfortunately for the Government, was of the same view. Therefore, the judges' decision vindicates what the Opposition had been saying all along-that the Commonwealth corporations power does not extend to making laws about the incorporation of companies. Now the Commonwealth, as the loser, must pay not only its own costs in relation to the High Court challenge but also the States' costs. Added to this is the cost of running two commissions since 1 July last year. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders why the Government embarked on this disastrous plan in the first place. It has been ruinously expensive and a constitutional and administrative nightmare. If the Government's objective was to simplify and facilitate corporate regulation, so far it has achieved exactly the opposite. The real problem with the cooperative scheme was not that the legislation was wrong but that it was not being properly enforced-at least I suggest that that was the principal problem. The regulatory authority that was supposed to enforce it was under-resourced, as we demonstrated on so many occasions in Estimates committees and in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that it is the courts and the proper investigatory bodies which do the enforcing of the legislation. There has recently been a worrying tendency, I suggest, towards prosecution by the media in the area of corporate regulation. The Opposition believes that the guiding principle in corporate regulation ought to be agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on uniform legislation. That is the only way to achieve a legislative scheme which is both uniform and constitutional. The Opposition welcomes the recent moves in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also urges the Government to take account of the dangers inherent in a uniform scheme, particularly the tendency for the administration to become too centralised. It is vital that everybody-not just those who happen to be near head office-has direct access to those who have power to make decisions, a point I have made before in this chamber and a point particularly stressed by practitioners in my State of South Australia. This means that staff in regional offices will have to have real power to make decisions. The Opposition wants the mess which the Government has created of corporate regulation in Australia to be cleared up as quickly as possible, and that is why we support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Hill in this debate on the Australian Securities Commission Amendment Bill. It is clear that it is because of the ham-fisted handling of this matter by the former Attorney-General and the current Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that this transition legislation is essential. As Senator Hill pointed out, it is now necessary for the staff of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to take over the jobs of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). There is no doubt that attempts to recruit staff to continue with the functions and role of the NCSC would be impossible in the current climate. Indeed, the uncertainty that has existed since the original announcement in 1987 about the new national scheme has created an incredible decrease in morale at both the NCSC and the various corporate affairs commissions around Australia. Staff members have a lower morale because, as Senator Hill said, they have no idea when the new legislation will come into effect. The original legislation was enacted over a year ago now and is still a long way from being proclaimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to what was said by Mr Ray Schoer, formerly of the NCSC and now of the Australian Stock Exchange, about staff problems within the NCSC. On 22 October 1989, on the Business Sunday program, Michael Gill interviewed him and asked him:</PARA>
<PARA>Given the sorts of doubts that exist obviously, is there any doubt that the NCSC will be effective, in the meantime?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Schoer replied:</PARA>
<PARA>They have some very good staff, very dedicated staff. Certainly it's true that unless job offers are made to them soon, then a lot of those staff are going to leave. </PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>When you say. `very quickly', how long can it drift like this?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Schoer replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Another couple of weeks in my judgement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate should understand that that interview occurred on 22 October. On 6 May, the head of the NCSC, Mr Bosch, appeared on the Business Sunday program, again discussing the matter of the ASC approaching the NCSC staff. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is extraordinary, indeed incredible, that the staff of the NCSC are being asked to work in very difficult circumstances within two months of the announced termination of the organisation with no offers being made to them, no assurances being given to them about the continuity of employment. It is something I would not really have believed possible. </PARA>
<PARA>On 22 October Mr Schoer claimed that it was necessary to act on this matter within a couple of weeks. Some eight or nine months later, in May, no action has been taken. Therefore, there is not doubt in my mind as to why morale in the corporate affairs commissions (CACs) and within the NSCS is quite low. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, since the initial announcement of the scheme and the uncertainty, particularly during the last 12 months, the cooperative scheme has continually been criticised, particularly by the Attorneys-General. I wish to quote from a letter from Mr Chris Sumner, the Attorney-General in South Australia, to the Federal Attorney-General, Mr Duffy. In the letter, dated 24 April, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . criticisms of the Cooperation Scheme have been exaggerated to attempt to achieve the aim of a national takeover irrespective of constitutional uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA>This sort of thing has been going on. The Attorney-General and the proponents of the national takeover of the companies and securities legislation blame a number of problems on the cooperative scheme. If there were problems, it is important to ask what the Commonwealth has done in the last 10 years to resolve them. It has not proposed any amendments in the past 10 years. In the past three years any of the amendments proposed by the States have been opposed by the Commonwealth-unless, of course, the States agreed to this national scheme. In other words, the Commonwealth used the proposed amendments from the States as bargaining chips in trying to get the States to agree to the national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General would also have us believe that corporate collapses can be visited upon the failures of the cooperative scheme. These collapses have been an unfortunate part of Australian corporate life since the October 1987 share crash. The Attorney-General would have us believe that the crashes of the Hooker Corporation, Qintex, Girvan, Spedley Securities and Rothwells can all be blamed on the cooperative scheme. I do not think that anyone out there in the real commercial world would even consider that the national companies and securities legislation and the cooperative scheme, as it has existed for the last 10 or so years, could be blamed for these collapses. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Business Sunday program on 6 May, Mr Duffy referred to $8 billion to $10 billion in corporate losses which will probably occur in Australia over the next year or so. Again he would have us believe that these corporate losses are the direct result of some failure of the cooperative scheme. I would remind the Senate again that although the Commonwealth is blaming this cooperative scheme for all these misadventures in Australian corporate life, the Government has done nothing to try to fix it during the seven years that it has been within its control. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, would have us believe is that the cooperative scheme has caused a lack of new foreign equity capital coming into Australia. Again I suggest that this is an absolute furphy. I suggest that the reason there may be a lack of foreign equity capital coming into productive Australian enterprises has more to do with this Commonwealth Government's other policies. If we want to attract foreign capital to Australia, we should start looking at the regulation regime, the industrial relations system and the environment, fiscal and monetary policies. Obviously there have been failures in all these areas under the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask, then, what the Commonwealth Government's agenda is in relation to the corporations and securities regulation system in Australia. Is it really about trying to fix up the system and create a better environment? I do not think so. I think that this Government is really about getting more power for the Attorney-General, his Government and his Department. Of course, all of that is at the expense of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the problems which have been identified quite properly with the cooperative scheme-and these were referred to earlier by Senator Hill-are the funding and resourcing. I suggest to the Senate that this can be solved by upgrading and maintaining the current cooperative scheme. But is is a problem that we have to face and it is not one that will go away. I am not saying `She'll be right'; it must be fixed up, but it will not be fixed up by centralising everything in Canberra. If that were to happen, Sydney and Melbourne would be looked after while Perth, Brisbane and Hobart would be left to wither on the vine. Of course, the business people and those who have to run the branch offices will not have a lot of pressure or persuasive power to try to alter that funding situation. They will be so far away that they will not have any political clout to try to increase funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to look at what Mr Bosch said about the resourcing of the National Companies and Securities Commission. Here we have this organisation trying to keep a tab on all the corporate players and at the same time become a reliable watchdog. In an article in the Age on 9 May Mr Bosch refers to this resourcing of the NCSC in an address to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He said that the best news of all was that under the new scheme there was reasonable hope that adequate resources would be applied to the area of companies and securities regulations. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me quite extraordinary that at the present time the national body responsible for policy and administration in the entire area of companies securities law should have a budget equivalent to the subsidy of school buses in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously that is quite an abysmal set of circumstances. I guess if I were trying to ruin the cooperative scheme and create a new national scheme, I would start bleeding the cooperative scheme and the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problems which needs to be addressed is accountability and responsibility. People who are against the cooperative scheme have claimed that there is no accountability and that the whole scheme is not accountable to any one Minister or any one parliament. I suggest that under any new scheme or an upgraded cooperative scheme there are a number of reforms that could be introduced to ensure that the ASC, as it will be once this Bill is passed and has been proclaimed, is accountable through the ministerial council to the Attorney- General. There is no doubt that that sort of accountability could be upgraded. There have always been doubts about this Parliament's ability to debate or discuss amendments to legislation proposed by the ministerial council. With a clear indication from this Parliament in new legislation, this accountability could be upgraded. Of course, the CACs are responsible to their State parliaments and this responsibility should stay where it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem that is associated with the current proposed national scheme is that of the independence of the corporate watchdog. Again in that article in the Age on 9 May, Mr Bosch told the group from the Institute of Chartered Accountants that there would be a very great increase in the power of Canberra public servants and this could be bad news. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the independence of the new commission is something that will have to be watched with considerable care because the system that has been set up will, in fact, pass policy control entirely to Canberra. </PARA>

It is a level of service that the business people of Western Australia do not want to see diminished by passing responsibility across here to Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to look at what has happened since the High Court ruling, in a 6 to one majority, that the Federal Government did not have the power over the incorporations section of the ASC legislation. Since then the Attorney-General has blamed the States for creating all of this uncertainty. As we have restated a number of times today, this Bill has now passed through the Parliament and has been waiting for proclamation for 12 months. The Attorney-General has gone out and said, `What we will do is go ahead and proclaim this legislation and just leave the incorporation bits out, try to blunder through, roll over the powers of the States and just push on with it and see how we get on'. There have been various forms of negotiations since then, and the holding out of various sorts carrots. He has got the Victorians and the New South Welshmen to agree on some sort of compromise. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure honourable senators that the business people in Western Australia, and the Liberal Party in Western Australia, do not see the Victoria-New South Wales compromise as any sort of compromise. It is just a sell out and an easy way to hand power straight to Canberra. It is something that the Liberal Party in Western Australia will not be part of. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria's part of the deal was to get the Deputy Chairman of the ASC based in Melbourne and the Chairman of the Corporation and Securities Panel based in Melbourne. Of course, the other big carrot that Victoria had handed to it was the LaTrobe Valley database. Victoria got what it wanted and said, `Okay, you can have it all up there'. New South Wales got the Chairman and the headquarters of the ASC based in Sydney. New South Wales is also trying to get the funding that it requires. The debate that is going on at the moment is about the funding level and how much the Commonwealth is going to have to use to buy off the States. As I said in my maiden speech, I implore all of the business people around Australia to ensure that their State governments cannot be bought off. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is supporting this scheme? Who is supporting the Attorney-General? He claims to have business people begging him to get this national scheme up and running. Of course, it is the Business Council of Australia. It is the top end of town. It is big business. It is the businesses that represent roughly 2 per cent of the 800,000 public companies in Australia. Those big companies do not mind because it is not much for executives from a BHP, or a company such as that, to jump on a plane and go to Melbourne. But persons in a small business in Western Australia, Hobart or Brisbane will have to pay quite a few thousand dollars to get to Canberra to lobby for a cause if they are not enamoured of or feel aggrieved by part of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Who on the other side of this country is opposing this legislation? In Western Australia the following groups are vehemently opposed to the centralisation of power in Canberra: the Law Society of Western Australia, the Confederation of Western Australian Industry, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Mines, the Stock Exchange Members of Perth, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Directors, the Trustee Companies Association of Australia in Western Australia and, finally, the International Association of Finance Planning. That is a fairly significant and representative group of Western Australian business people. </PARA>

One only needs to look at the establishment of the Information Processing Centre (IPC) to see the costs that we are already meeting this year and will be meeting next year, in what Senator Hill has already referred to as a duplication-that of having an ASC and a National Companies and Securities Commission. The South Australian Corporate Affairs Commission has done a study into the establishment of this national database, and the incredible level of duplication and additional expense I do not think has been publicly revealed. The facility to establish this national database will almost entirely duplicate existing facilities within the corporate affairs commissions in the State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to that later. The lease costs in the first year will be between $1.4 and $2m per annum. Furniture and standard office equipment, not relating to computer equipment, will be about $2.2m. Microfilm maintenance in the year 1990-91 will be $1m. The cost of entry of data of the 800,000 registration forms for the companies, and these are all ASC figures, will be $2m. The other costs, which we should be aware of, are the telephone and fax links to the central national data base, which will all be at local call rates and will involve a significant subsidy from Telecom. The national data scheme proposes imaging of documents which will cost $1m in 1989-90 and $4.45m in 1991. The electronic data interchange (EDI) and EFT development of hardware have a budget of $1.5m per annum. It is proposed that this new EDI system will, in full operation, totally obviate the need for imaging. In other words, $5m could be saved if they just went slowly and moved towards the system which the CAC is developing. Telecom line costs will be another $2.2m. The South Australian Consumer Affairs Corporation concluded that the IPC microfilm storage, and associated systems plans, fail to recognise that more than 95 per cent of business handled by the CACs is local. Public companies comprise only 2 per cent of Australia's 800,000 companies. Excluding wages and computer equipment, small business people and business people will be paying $13.55m for something that they have already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, I would like to move on to the impact on businesses of all sizes in Western Australia. The important thing is that local businesses will feel that they are a long way from the corporate regulatory action. As I have said, it will be okay for big business people because they can fly here relatively easily and can lobby people in the Attorney-General's Department and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There will no doubt be long delays in registrations, and other services currently provided by the corporate affairs commissions in the States, due to the physical removal of lodgment documents to the LaTrobe Valley. Businesses will be faced with very little control, or political accountability, over the fees and duties which they will have to pay to Canberra instead of the State governments. The State governments and the business communities will lose control in developing and innovating small business at a State level. This will mean a lack of progress in this area because there will not be six or seven State governments moving forward to try to have a better environment for small business. The Commonwealth Government will control that sort of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem for a State such as Western Australia, because the corporate affairs powers has moved to Canberra, is that practitioners, lawyers, accountants and other tertiary sector employees will have to move from Western Australia and to Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra where the corporate affairs action will be taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem is that the handing over of this power will see some subsidiary powers moving to the Federal Government and its control over a number of non-commercial social policies. I note, for example, that the Federal Government would have control over board compositions, more control over industrial policy, consumer laws and privacy laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that how we should move in negotiations now is not towards trying to buy off the States with big handouts of taxpayers' money. What we should be doing is moving towards upgrading the cooperative scheme and facing the problems which I have delineated, that is, accountability and funding. This can be achieved by having agreed minimum levels of funding for the ASC and the State CACs. It would not take much of an advance in funding over what Mr Bosch described as the subsidy to the Australian Capital Territory buses to create a slightly more powerful and active national corporate watchdog. </PARA>
<PARA> The CACs are already moving towards a national networking. This could proceed. There can be a national database but it does not need a national scheme to create it. We can have the independent CACs under the coordination of the Australian Securities Commission creating a national computer network which will create a far more effective and far more reactive information system across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate affairs commissions must remain responsible to, and funded by, the States. Therefore, political accountability rests with the State governments. The Australian Securities Commission must become responsible through the ministerial council to the Attorney-General, as it is now, but this level of accountability can be upgraded with a number of small reforms within the existing cooperative scheme. The Federal Parliament must have the clear right to debate legislation approved by the ministerial council and to refer legislation back to the council. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the Liberal Party and the business community are totally opposed to the centralisation proposed under the national scheme. At the meeting held between shadow Attorneys-General, Attorneys-General and our shadow Attorney-General in Melbourne on Monday it became apparent that a number of State Liberal parties and upper Houses will be opposed to the national scheme. It is incumbent upon the Attorney-General to take into account the quite significant opposition to this national scheme in future negotiations. I hope that, as Senator Hill said earlier, the negotiations can proceed in a more open, more honest and more accountable way than they have in the past and that the very real problems which the business communities in a number of the outlying States are finding with this proposed national scheme can be taken into account and resolved as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> I speak in support of this Bill. I also want to use this opportunity to speak in support of the establishment of a strong Australian Securities Commission. It is extraordinary that there has to be any debate at all in this country today about the establishment of a strong ASC. I refer honourable senators-particularly Senator Campbell-to a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs tabled in April 1987 called The Role of Parliament in Relation to the National Companies Scheme. In its conclusion it makes it quite clear what that Committee's view was about the establishment of a more up to date and stronger securities commission in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to Senator Campbell, in particular, that that Committee not only had Labor members on it-Senator Bolkus was chairperson-but when this report was tabled Senator Robert Hill was a member of it, the Deputy Chairman; Senator Richard Alston from Victoria was a member of it, both Liberal members; Senator Barney Cooney from Victoria was a member of it; Senator Christopher Puplick from New South Wales, another Liberal, was a member of it; Senator Margaret Reynolds was a member of it and, for part of the reference, Senator Tate was a member of the Committee before he went on to bigger and better things as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> When I heard Senator Campbell speak I thought I had better just check in case there was a minority report from the Opposition members at the back of the document saying that they disagreed. But no, there is no minority report. It is a unanimous report by the Labor and Liberal members on that Committee. They were the only members of the Committee. I want to quote a couple of paragraphs from the conclusion, particularly for Senator Campbell's information. Paragraph 6.2 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee received evidence that, under the circumstances, the scheme performs remarkably well. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the present scheme. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Committee believes that it has now outlived its usefulness. The Chairman of the Ministerial Council and Attorney-General of New South Wales described the scheme as a `hybrid institution' which `imposes severe limitations on developing necessary policies' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 6.4 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Many people and organisations regard the Commonwealth takeover of this area of the law as the next step in a natural progression . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is pretty clear what the Committee believed should be happening. As I say, there was no dissent from Opposition members. Paragraph 6.6 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has taken into account the support for the retention of the cooperative scheme. Much of this support was accompanied by constructive criticism and suggestions for reforms, which were discussed in chapter 4. The Committee commends these suggestions to the various governments which are party to the scheme in the event of the rejection of the Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>I suspect it anticipated that there were a few people like Senator Campbell around who would reject any progressive move. Finally, the recommendation of paragraph 6.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Parliament should enact comprehensive legislation covering the field currently regulated by the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Simple, succinct and to the point. That was a unanimous report by Labor and Liberal party members. If it was good enough for April 1987, Senator Campbell and others cannot complain when the Federal Government proceeds on the basis of bipartisan support from a standing committee of the Senate to introduce the scheme. Senator Campbell has not been here that long and he will have a chance to read the report, but it is very clear what, after detailed examination, an all-party committee of the Senate wanted unanimously. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Campbell mentioned business support. He talked of the Business Council of Australia being the only group of business organisations roughly supporting the Commonwealth's position. He is right in that. A press release of 28 March 1990 put out by Nobby Clark, the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank and Clive Speed, the Assistant Director of the Business Council of Australia, says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>In the absence of support by the States for the second option the Commonwealth should proceed as quickly as possible with its plans to establish the ASC with such amendments as are necessary to the Corporations Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Campbell may say that they represent only 2 per cent of businesses in Australia, but most people would recognise that although they may be the top end of town they are certainly the biggest companies in Australia, the ones that have the most decisive influence on business activity, the ones that are listened to most. Certainly I have heard plenty of members of the Opposition in many other debates in this place quoting from the Business Council when it suits their purpose. But in this case Senator Campbell just dumps the Business Council's support in the bin because it does not suit his purpose at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do the major businesses of Australia want to support the Commonwealth's wish to have a strengthened ASC? It is because they know that unless we get a comprehensive national scheme we will still be treated as the cowboy country of the Western world as far as the regulation of companies and securities is concerned. </PARA>

We do not rely on the upper House of Western Australia, of all places, to decide what the national aspirations of this country will be. It is an absurd, bizarre joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To my mind this is amazing. I was astonished to hear Senator Campbell, in his maiden speech, setting out his view about a commitment to federalism. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our commitment to federalism must be based on this principle and not on reactionary States rights dogma. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Campbell has expressed in this debate one of the most bizarre nineteenth century States rights dogmas ever heard. He has aligned himself with the most antediluvian conservative and reactionary forces in Western Australia.

<PARA> We want to overcome all of that to make sure that ordinary people in this country have the confidence to invest in the stock exchange without their money disappearing down black holes. That is what is happening and that is ruining our reputation around the world. That is why the Business Council of Australia, as it says in its press release, wanted this new system adopted. It is saying that it finds it difficult to borrow money overseas for investment in Australia because, quite rightly, someone sitting in New York or anywhere else says, `Invest in Australia with your system of regulation? How do we know we'll get our money back? How do we know it won't be spent in devices to enable company directors to enhance their position at the expense of shareholders?'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. With such provocative remarks being made earlier in this debate it is hard to contain oneself. But I certainly respect your comment. Senator Campbell said, `What about South Australia? What about the Attorney-General of South Australia?'. I have already made my view known to the Premier and the Attorney-General of South Australia. I think it is a disgrace that a State Labor Government went to the High Court of Australia to challenge this legislation, and that the Labor Government in my home State was in league, at one stage, with the New South Wales conservative government in trying to thwart the establishment of an Australian Securities Commission. I have pointed out to both the Premier and the Attorney-General of South Australia that they are in contravention of the national platform and the State platform adopted years ago by the Labor Party to establish the ASC. I have given fair warning to them both that at the next State Labor Party conference, at the end of June, in one month's time, there will be a debate in the South Australian Labor Party about whether we will have a national scheme with a national aspiration or whether we will have a States rights nineteenth century horse and buggy approach to company securities regulation. It will be a very important debate in the South Australian Labor Party, which I represent in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that I win the debate but even if I do not and if my view does not prevail I will not let up. In the end, if this country is to have any future in the area of developing a modern, competitive economy, it can be done only if the national will, expressed through this Parliament, prevails. There is no future for this country-economically, diplomatically or in any other way in our relations with the countries within our region-if we consistently say, `We don't worry about the national view; we worry about the individual, parochial State view', because three local Western Australian businessmen got hold of a junior senator from Western Australia and said, `This is terrible. This is centralism. This is evil'. No other Western country has ever taken that view about a similar matter; only in Australia do we have this view. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear bleatings from the Opposition-and it was mentioned in Senator Campbell's maiden speech-about the need for micro-economic reform. There is no more important micro-economic reform Bill on the agenda than this Bill. We will not get a decent, modern competitive economy unless we put regulation into the national sphere. We will go on crippling the economy; we will go on making people queasy about investing in Australia if we do not have a national securities commission. I am amazed that even to this day some people in this national Parliament are willing to express a view similar to that of Senator Campbell. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that before this year is out we can get an agreement with the States. But it should not be an agreement on the basis of surrender. That would be the worst possible decision that the Federal Government could take. If it surrendered to get some unanimity, which would be the lowest possible common denominator, it would mean that the States would still run the show. We would have to get agreement with six State Attorneys-General and two Territory Attorneys-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot think of a more bizarre approach to trying to get a national view than going to a ministerial council where only one person-only one under the States rights approach of Senator Campbell-would have the power to veto activity of the ASC. Does any businessman in Australia run his national business on the basis of one State manager being able to veto the decisions of the overall company? Of course not. We do not want that for the ASC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak with any great fervour on the Australian Securities Commission Amendment Bill but I am provoked by earlier contributions, particularly that of Senator Campbell. I totally disagree with Senator Schacht's condemnation of the people in the 1800s. I am glad that we had far-sighted people in the 1890s who managed to get federation. I am sure that had we left it to the 1990s we would not have a hope if Senator Campbell had anything to do with it. I am so glad that those far-sighted people managed to get a nation in this continent. In getting a nation-though many people do not seem to have read the Constitution-they gave the corporations power to the Commonwealth. There is a very good reason for that. At the time the people saw where commerce was going. They knew that it would be central and crucial to the economic health of this country that we should have a single voice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been a number of reports. Senator Schacht referred to one, which was a very early report. I recommend that Senator Campbell also read the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which took exhaustive evidence with regard to this matter. I think he will find a lot of new information there because obviously in his speech he was riding on information which was so out of date and so wrong as to be embarrassing. One of the most embarrassing items was his whole discussion of funding. There has been a very good reason why the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) has not worked. It is because of funding-because it has been bled white by the States, which had the control of the funding. We needed to move the NCSC because we have not had that. Every company in this country knows that it has been bled white by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate we are having at the moment is nothing to do with principle, State rights or the NCSC wanting to be in Perth or anywhere else; it is to do with the dollar. When one looks at the State budgets one sees how much money is coming from this. It is bled straight out of the companies. But they are not getting the service back; they never have had the service back, because that has been used as a milch cow and the States have taken every penny and run off with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Government of Senator Campbell's State. It has done the same whatever political persuasion has been in power-as has South Australia, my own State of Queensland, New South Wales and every other State. It is nothing to do with all this hand-on-the-heart `We have got to be in Perth' business; it is to do with the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The dollar must get back into the regulation. That is where the debate is at the moment and that is where it is stymied. It is not on any of the other matters. They were easily solved at the end of the day. If people just sit around a table and talk they can agree on those matters. After all, we have modern communication. Senator Campbell was even decrying the amount of money we were spending on telephones. I think it is a reasonable investment in today's world. I was forced to interject `Bring back Edison'. Senator Campbell would have been one who said `Let us stay in there with gas' when Edison invented electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the national data centre is that the States did not do that, and every company that knows how this place operates wants it done. Senator Campbell was talking about the physical lodgment of incorporation material and carting it off to the LaTrobe Valley. The whole mechanism with regard to the data centre means that no piece of paper has to move anywhere. That is the beauty of the exercise. That is why we are having that exercise put in place and that is why we need it. In this country now we need an exercise which will enable any company to incorporate in Queensland or anywhere else. If that is going to stay, it is going to stay. With regard to that, fairly obviously the High Court has made a determination that allows the States to stay in that particular area. But it still wants to cover the situation where a company's investors are in Western Australia and it is incorporated in Queensland, or vice versa. We saw a magnificent account of the collapse in Senator Campbell's State of a company that in fact was incorporated in my State and had grown out of a clothing store. The exercise obviously means we have to move around. The State boundaries are no longer relevant with regard to business in Australia and they cannot be allowed to get in the way of a developed system of regulation for companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Campbell said that it was a top of town exercise. If he had been on the joint committee exercise he would have known differently. The people who came before us represented the majority of business activity in this country. Whether he likes it or not, they happen to be, firstly, the Business Council of Australia, whose members conduct the majority of business activity, and, secondly, the group that represents the majority of actual companies, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, which came before us and supported the proposals. The small business associations wanted them. So both the majority of business and the majority of companies came before that Committee and gave evidence that they wanted this to pass. That has not been recognised in Senator Campbell's speech but that is what actually happened. It is in the evidence. It is in the Hansard transcript. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise has been thought through; the debate has occurred. What we have to do now is get this in place, because Australia has to have a future in trade and business. It is absurdly difficult for a company anywhere else in the world to try to find out what is happening in Australia. What Senator Campbell was suggesting, if it came to pass, would leave our situation worse than the post-1992 European context. Only 50 years ago the countries there were fighting a war to the death, and they have been able to cooperate better than the States of a federation have in this continent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is an indictment of us in not being able to put aside our parochial feelings, say what is in the interests of the entire country and try to go down that path. Brisbane has the same problems other places have but the structure has been dealt with. The regional offices would be able to provide all of the exercise that is currently provided. Senator Campbell talks about people having to go somewhere and lobby somebody. I suppose if someone wants to nip around the back and lobby a State Minister with regard to something it will be more difficult. But we are taking this out of the control of State governments and giving it to the Commonwealth Government. The ministerial council which ran this thing was constituted from executives. The parliaments never got involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Campbell never sat in this place when time and time again we had Bills coming through. We had the power to amend that; we had the constitutional power to amend everything that came into this chamber. We could not. We could not even take notice of our own Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The reason for that is that, if we finally got all of the States and the Commonwealth in this continent to agree on something, the last thing we would want to do is say no. It happens so rarely we almost fall over ourselves being glad they have actually agreed on something. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what happened. Time and again it came into this place. Read the Hansard debates. People from Senator Campbell's Party-not only from the Australian Labor Party or my Party, the Australian Democrats-time and time again stood up and said, `This cannot go on'. That is why Senator Campbell has got the report that Senator Hill, now Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, signed. That is why he has the report that his leader for business in this chamber signed. It was because we had the frustration of not being able to amend the types of things which obviously ought to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the operation we had incontrovertible evidence before us that the items that had been put before that ministerial council for reform were still sitting on its table. That was not anything to do with the Commonwealth; it was the fact that all of the groups would not agree. The Commonwealth did not even have the chair most of the time. At least the States have acknowledged it ought to have the permanent chair if the national companies and securities system continued. In fact, that was one of their compromise proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Commonwealth government, whether the Fraser Government or the Hawke Government, cannot be blamed for those matters. The system is outmoded; it does not work any longer. I think it is now time that we put aside the outmoded concepts, look to the future and know that we have to have in place a streamlined, effective operational method of dealing with these matters. There is now an agreement in regard to the compromises that all of the States have agreed to on policy items at least, and that is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The hurdle we have to jump over is the money split-up. At the end of the day I think the Commonwealth will have to give way. It hurts me to say that, but it will. We can use the phrase `buying them off'. I would agree with that. That is what will happen-the inevitable Federal compromise. But I can tell honourable senators who will suffer. The States will get their pound of flesh and bolster up their own budgets but that money will not go into corporation regulation at all. We will still have inordinate delays in incorporation even if they are under the State governments which have all this money because those governments will not put another penny into the scheme but will use the money for subsidising their school bus runs. That is where the money will go. It will come out the pockets of business straight into the State coffers. There will not be any advance. I wish there were some other future for a lot of that money so that we could in fact do the types of things that Mr Bosch pointed to, not just in the article I mentioned but time and time again, when he asked for resources and was denied. We will have the Australian Securities Commission asking for resources and being denied them. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is a pity because that money is paid by companies for their regulation. That is why they are paying those fees-not for somebody to go off and subsidise a bus exercise. But that is where it has always been spent. That is an unfortunate exercise, but I suppose that Federation being what it is that is where the compromise will end up. The Commonwealth will give way; we will come to some kind of guaranteed formula; the money will be passed over; and this system will be put into place. I hope it does not give way too easily. I hope it kicks and fights for every penny it can get, because every penny will be needed to make sure that the system works and works well. Money is paid by business not as a subsidy to Consolidated Revenue, but for the regulation of corporation legislation in this country. If business cannot get a good service, it has every right to complain. It has not been getting a good service; it has been getting it from a shoddy slipshod exercise that has been starved of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know of the inordinate delays and the difficulty the NCSC has in taking legal action; it is not broadcast anywhere, but we know. We know that it has to ascertain whether it can go in and take a company to the cleaners. It has to add up its pennies, and sometimes it has to say that it cannot do it because it does not have enough money to do it. It has to say that it cannot face a whole barrage of Queen's Counsel again because it has run out of dollars. We cannot even enforce the law. Not that business has not paid for that because for every shoddy company that operates in this country other companies suffer. Those companies are happy for shoddy companies to be taken to the cleaners because it helps the properly regulated companies in their businesses. They do not want shoddy companies hanging around the business establishment. They want them out; they want them prosecuted. They want those crooks who are wandering around in business to be fined, to be out of business entirely. But we cannot afford to get them out. It is not because business has not paid up; it has paid up every year. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that that money has been used for every other purpose other than the regulation of the corporations legislation as it was under the NCSC exercise. Unfortunately, I think that is the exercise that will go on in the future when the Commonwealth finally rolls over and agrees to the inordinate State demands. It is a pity, because I believe that the Joint Select Committee had a fair and reasonable look at the legislation; we went through every clause and invited submissions on every clause; and the vast bulk of the legislation stood up. There was one dissenting report with regard to the substance, not the principle. I am glad actually to have been on the side of the minority which ended up as the majority in the legislation on that particular one, because we had the right view. We were not in the majority at that stage, but we managed to convince the right people at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA> I inform Senator Campbell, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Joint Select Committee was made up of members of both Houses, members of all political parties. In terms of the substance, we have good legislation here to run with. We have a number of innovations. The close corporation exercise, for example, is an interesting innovation. I do not know whether it will work, but small businesses want it. It has not got a very good history around the world, but it is there. There is a lot of good stuff there and I hope it is given the chance to work. This transitional exercise is an important one, but I hope that it is not, as it were, the first of a further delay in what this country needs, and that is to get a truly national companies and securities scheme in place and operational. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with what Senator Schacht and Senator Macklin have said. May I say in respect of Senator Macklin that it is sad to think that his voice will soon not be heard in this chamber. I think he has contributed mightily to this Parliament and it is sad to see him go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Australian Securities Commission Amendment Bill, as has been said, is a short Bill. I suppose the real intent of it is to make sure that after 1 July there is a common chairperson for both the National Companies and Securities Commission and for the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). The purpose of that is so the proper regulation of companies will continue to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Campbell has come in for a fair bit of criticism from the previous two speakers. It seems to me that all he was doing was putting his position, which I think is a respectable position; it is the position of somebody who believes passionately in States rights and that they should have the ascendancy over a centralised system of government. He simply put his philosophy into operation and I thought he did it very well. </PARA>
<PARA> What should perhaps be more commented upon is the position of his colleague Mr Peter Costello, the shadow Minister for corporate regulation and consumer affairs, who apparently also wants a national scheme interdicted, if one can gather that from the reports in the Australian Financial Review and the Australian newspaper of 29 May. Mr Peter Costello acted as a convener for Liberal and National Ministers and shadow Ministers in Melbourne on Monday 28 May. He then apparently gave a press conference. He said that the meeting expressed great concern about the scheme that was being established and he called upon Mr Duffy, the Attorney-General, to deal with the representatives of the upper Houses of various States that opposed it. They were specifically Western Australia-Senator Campbell has pointed out its position-Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly an argument can be made for a proper servicing of smaller companies in States and I can understand a legitimate concern on their part that a national scheme will overlook them. That fear has been put to rest by what has been said about the proposed agreement that is sought between the States. That is the first thing: their concerns will be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I raise the point that has been made several times in this debate already: we need a national scheme if we are going to take part in an international economy. Mr Costello has been foremost in proclaiming the need for micro-economic reform, for the reform of unions-his great case was the Dollar Sweets case; he proclaimed the Mudginberri case, and so on. If there is one area in which politicians-as distinct from employers or employees, people who run manufacturing businesses, farming businesses and so on-can be most effectively engaged in micro-economic reform, it is in this area of company regulations. It is up to the politicians to prepare the proper legislation for micro-economic reform in company regulation so that companies can engage properly and sensibly in the international community. It is in this area that politicians can play an effective role. </PARA>
<PARA> I am simply saying that it is peculiarly within the power of politicians to carry out that micro-economic reform that they so loudly proclaim should be carried out by other sectors of the community, whether they be farmers, metal workers or any sort of blue-collar workers, clerks, doctors or whatever; this is one area where the politicians themselves can do it. Unfortunately, there is great danger that the politicians, when challenged with this opportunity of doing something about micro-economic reform, are failing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that if Australia is to take part in an international economy-and we have heard speeches from all sides in this House again and again that that is what it ought to do-it must set up the proper legal structure, the regulatory structure, whereby the exchange of securities around the world, including Australia, can take place efficiently. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, entitled the Role of Parliament in Relation to the National Companies Scheme to which Senator Schacht has referred and which was chaired successively by the present Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who deserves to be congratulated on the report, and then by the present Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, was recommended by all parties. Senator Schacht has quoted that. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to chapter 3 of that report. Paragraph 3.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> On 1 April 1987, the six State stock exchanges-</PARA>
<PARA>and that included Western Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>amalgamated to form the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the one stock exchange operating in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA> According to the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd, Mr Ian Roach:</PARA>
<PARA> There is only one market for securities in Australia and it is part of the global market . . . it is essential that we pool our resources as one united stock exchange . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are then quotes from Mr Henry Bosch; from Mr Robert Gardini, who represented the Confederation of Australian Industry at the public hearings of the Committee; there is a reference to Mr Ray Schoer who, I think, Senator Campbell has also referred to; and there is a statement by Mr Leigh Masel, the inaugural Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission. All of these statements said that there ought to be a single scheme because Australia had developed to the point where it was needed and the international market required there to be one. That was in 1987. Here we are, three years later, still struggling to achieve a proper structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Court of Australia has said that the Commonwealth has not got full control over the regulation of companies, that it has not got control over the incorporation of companies and, therefore, the Commonwealth has to work with the States. But that decision was not an invitation to the States, may I say with respect, to cause frustration, to cause difficulties, to cause all sorts of harm to a national scheme simply because some people wanted to score political points-indeed, they should not do it for any reason, but especially not because they want to score a political point. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Financial Review of Tuesday, 29 May there is an article headed `New company law runs into more meddling' which talks about the meeting that Mr Costello convened. Unfortunately, that is true-the problem that this legislation faces is meddling, which has the most dire consequences for the sort of economy that Australia wants to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the legislation. It has arisen out of a draft agreement, as I understand it, between the Attorneys-General about how the structure, operation and new regime for companies and securities in Australia will go. As I understand it, there are a number of issues still to be resolved. They have been touched on already. One is the staffing in each State of the Australian Securities Commission and, in that context, what will happen to the employees of the corporate affairs commissions that operate in those States? I put on the record now that proper attention should be paid to their situation and proper accommodation should be made for them. That is the sort of thing that I think we ought to be concerned about, rather than whether or not the States rights have been properly stroked. It seems to me that it is hardly a consideration when Australia is facing the dire economic problems that it presently is. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that has not been fully agreed upon yet, as I understand it, is the revenue which the States used to derive from their regulation of companies. I think that is a proper matter whether or not that money was going to be used for company regulation. If States have got a source of income available to them, and that is going to be taken from them, of course they will be concerned. In my view it is proper that the Commonwealth pay attention to that and make sure that their economies are not affected by taking away a source of revenue that they have had up until now. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two matters which, I think are properly calling for attention from the Commonwealth and, indeed, from the States. First, what will happen to the staff of the corporate affairs commissions, and will they be accommodated properly? Secondly, what will happen to replace the revenue that otherwise would have been earned by the States in their regulation of corporations?</PARA>
<PARA> I go on to the person who has been, in recent times, most active in this field and deserves to be mentioned; that is, the Victorian Attorney-General, Mr Jim Kennan. In this context, I quote to illustrate my point what was said in a media release on 4 May which is pertinent. Mr Kennan had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that Australia will have certainty in its regulation of companies and securities and have its position in the international business community restored. </PARA>
<PARA>He was able to say on that day:</PARA>
<PARA> All the States have recognised the need for a truly national scheme and the further damage that could be done to the Australian economy had there not been co-operation and conciliation today. </PARA>
<PARA>All of the governments of the various States have agreed but unfortunately, apparently, the upper Houses of at least three States have taken a different view. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was Mr Kennan who made the suggestion-that other excellent Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, who has already shown himself as one of the great Attorneys-General of this nation agreed with what he said-that there are four basic principles that ought to operate in this area. First, that there ought to be a single regulator; secondly, that that regulator should be accountable only to the Commonwealth Minister-that is, to the excellent Mr Duffy; thirdly, that the laws should be made and amended by the Commonwealth Parliament only; and fourthly, that the key national issues should be within Federal control. If those four principles were adopted, much would be done to recover the damage that has been done to the economy as a result of the uncertainty that has grown in the area of corporate regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> That damage, as has been said before, is real because people overseas and stock exchanges overseas want to know who is in control of securities in Australia. If they are going to buy and sell Australian securities, they want to know what laws govern that; they want to know whether, when a particular situation arises if it needs rapid legislation that that legislation can be enacted; they want to know the sort of body that will carry out the regulation of companies and the regulation of the exchange of securities; they want to know whether that can act quickly and decisively. At the moment, unfortunately, they are unable to do that. If the agreement which is presently afoot can be concluded satisfactorily, that matter would be attended to. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill deals with the Australian Securities Commission and, hopefully, that aspect of company control can be quarantined from the other functions that the corporate affairs commissions presently perform. It is important that the ASC be established as the sole body that regulates securities in Australia. I think the Opposition, which I understand is going to support the Bill, has shown a very responsible attitude in doing that and I congratulate it. I hope that the draft agreement-perhaps I should say the suggested agreement because I understand that it has not been concluded-which is presently in the various offices of Attorneys-General around Australia and in the office of the Attorney-General here, will result in a finalised agreement and that that will be done very rapidly so that we can get about the business of company regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, once again I congratulate the State governments that have worked so hard with the Federal Government to come as far as we have already come, and I encourage them to continue down that line. In particular, I congratulate Mr Kennan and Mr Duffy, who have struggled nobly and, hopefully, successfully to bring about what is much needed-that is, a good system of company regulation in this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I claim to have been misrepresented during Senator Schacht's speech earlier this evening. He suggested that three businessmen had found themselves a junior senator to come here and oppose the national scheme. I think the statement of Senator Schacht conjures some unpleasant images of me being in the pockets of three business people. I inform the Senate that I certainly did not speak to three business people. Indeed, as I said in my speech, the position I am advocating here today is supported by a great number of organisations in Western Australia, including the Law Society of Western Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, stock exchange members in Perth, the Company Directors Association of Australia, the Trustee Companies Association and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other unfortunate misrepresentation Senator Schacht made was in his referring to me as a junior senator, suggesting that these three imaginary business people in Perth could not find a senior senator to do their dirty work. The only apology I make to the Senate is that, although I am a junior senator, I have very little control over my age. I guess one of the unfortunate things about me is that I was born at a very young age. That is why I am so junior. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point. Senator Faulkner got it. I am glad to see that one senator on the other side was bright enough to actually get the message of Senator Campbell's last few words. This evening we are talking to the Australian Securities Commission Amendment Bill. Of course, this is only a minor piece of legislation in the saga of Labor's power grab for corporate regulation. It is not opposed by the coalition. In effect, all it does is continue interim arrangements and enable members of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to be appointed as members of the National Companies and Securities Commission (ASC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I take this opportunity to state briefly that the coalition deplores the incompetence that two successive Attorneys-General of the Hawke Labor Government have displayed in the long history of this legislation. Equally, as a Liberal senator for Western Australia, once again I place on record my opposition to control and decision-making in the corporate field being transferred out of our State. In so doing, I speak for a great many business and professional people. At the risk of someone else having a cheap shot at me-that is S-H-O-T, not  S-C-H-A-C-H-T-I can tell the Senate that I have not been lobbied by any businessmen, but I am very much aware of what the situation is in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, in speaking to the original legislation, I warned that as the Commonwealth lacked constitutional power to legislate for corporations, according to the Law Council of Australia, implementation of the scheme would require complementary State legislation and could involve expensive High Court litigation. We in the coalition are now richly entitled to say, `I told you so'. That is rather sad because much time and money has been wasted on this quite unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think it is pertinent to query the costs of running both the ASC and the NCSC, the former having no Act to administer and the latter having continued responsibly but with insufficient personnel. Indeed, it was made clear on Tuesday in the Australian Financial Review that it would be extremely difficult for the ASC to take over corporate regulation in the New Year, let alone on 1 July. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister how the Government plans to do that when it is already expressing concern about next year. This Government has failed to organise the appointments of key personnel to the ASC and is making no effort that is apparent to us-to fill vacancies looming in the NCSC. No agreement has been made as to the funding of the ASC; nor have Bills been redrafted for the States to copy, even assuming that they choose to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this Government has been grossly incompetent in seeking to implement what it has the cheek to declare is part of its program for micro-economic reform. Among those parts of last year's legislation that it has not proclaimed is part 14 of the Australian Securities Commission Act, which would establish a parliamentary committee to scrutinise the legislation. Small wonder that it does not want its incompetence exposed, I guess would be the answer to that. This Labor Government has sought to make a virtue of its supposed pragmatism, but I ask: Where is the common sense in trying to pretend that Australia is not a federation, that we do not have a Constitution, and that we do not have a high court that can make judgments? Thank heavens it does. It is thanks to the High Court that governments are stopped from doing exactly as they please. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his predecessor have tried to override the Federal system. Even those who support the concept of a more centralised scheme recognise that this approach will achieve nothing except the waste of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Above these considerations is the principle that the national interest will not be served by the further centralisation of economic power wherever it might be-whether in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne. The coalition has maintained that the cooperative scheme of corporate regulation should be subject to any necessary change. We support the principles of uniformity and certainty in corporate administration. I do not really think there are too many businessmen in Australia who would oppose the concept of uniformity, but they certainly oppose the concept of its being centralised. I think we need to take that into consideration because, potentially, a number of people could be seriously affected. It is probably not so bad for national companies, but what happens to family companies, private practices, small businesses and so on as opposed to national companies?</PARA>
<PARA> This must not mean that decision-making should be centralised and the local expertise built up in State corporate affairs commissions abandoned. That is one of the real concerns about what is going on with this legislation. It must not mean delays for Western Australian firms, for example, in getting decisions made or their incurring extra costs in communicating with a distant centre of authority. Heaven only knows that we in the west have enough problems with isolation now, let alone if all this administration is to be centralised in Melbourne. It must not mean a consequent relocation of company offices away from outlying States, with the loss of professional careers. That is another major concern. People are worried that there will be a mass exodus from the outlying States because their services will not be required where they currently are. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I commend my Liberal colleagues in the Legislative Council of Western Australia, who, on 16 May, passed a successful motion that any complementary State legislation would not be passed if it transferred constitutional power and authority to the Commonwealth, or conceded the benefit of any undecided constitutional doubt in favour of the Commonwealth. Rightly, the Legislative Council, the only chamber that represents majority opinion as expressed at the last State election, insists that the State should retain the benefit of the High Court decision and retain real political and administrative powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise also that Western Australia is not alone in its stance. As my colleague Senator Campbell pointed out earlier, the Opposition parties in South Australia and in Victoria-a State that can hardly be described as outlying-have adopted similar positions, foreshadowing rejection of enabling legislation in their respective upper Houses. The concern is not just shared among people in Western Australia; it is quite clear that there is concern in various States throughout the country. It is not unkind to point out that in each of these States a majority of voters gave support to the coalition parties when State elections were last held. This is a logical response to reports that civil and commercial aspects of corporate affairs be centralised in Sydney and criminal and compliance functions placed in Melbourne, with a centralised data processing centre in the Latrobe Valley. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a scenario is far more than a loss for any concept of States' rights for their own sake. It would represent a downgrading of the commercial life of Western Australia in a way that would not enhance our national economic performance, quite apart from its impact in Perth proper. Clearly that impact will be devastating. Centralisation of commercial activity is nothing to do with micro-economic reform, and by damaging alternative centres of economic power it will actually retard this objective. In limiting my remarks to this Bill, I give notice that I will have a great deal more to say if further legislation comes before the Senate seeking to advance Labor's centralist ideology in the face of administrative commonsense and the long-term economic interests of the Western Australian and national commercial sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by restating people's concerns about the funding and revenue sharing issues that are still far from being clarified. I repeat that this is not just true of Western Australia; the Liberal and National Attorneys-General and shadow Ministers for the States, who have no conflict at all with the desirability of a uniform system of company law, are as concerned as I am about the centralised administration of company law in one national body. There are many examples and I do not wish to go into them again this evening, but I express concern about the future and where this trend will take us in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, and I have no doubt the independent senators, for their support of the Australian Securities Commission Bill, which I hope will have a speedy passage shortly. Although the Bill itself is rather technical and administrative, it is true, as honourable senators have said in this debate, that it is part of a movement towards giving Australia an effective administrative structure for the regulation of companies and securities as benefits a nation in a trading and commercial world. We are senators, albeit elected from our various States and Territories, who are here as members of an Australian Parliament. It was a Parliament that was set up by the people federating in a Commonwealth of Australia in order to achieve together national objectives which could not be achieved as colonies or States. The matters which properly might come within the province of the national Parliament change over time. Clearly the time has been reached, in the 1990s, where we need to have an Australia-wide administrative structure which is not bedevilled by State boundaries in a way which fragments the effort which must be at the heart of our future as a trading nation with a vibrant commercial life. We need effective regulation to ensure that the moneys which are given by Australians and overseas investors to certain entrepreneurs and business people are used in a way which is honest, in the first place, and effective in creating a sound economic future for all of us so that the wealth is then shared in the community for generations to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why people like Sir James Balderstone, the chief of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, said only a few days ago that the establishment of a national corporate regulatory body to tackle the speedy prosecution of errant directors was an absolutely vital part of restoring the confidence of investors both within Australia and from overseas in the Australian economy in so far as that is represented by the trading and commercial activities undertaken by companies throughout this nation. I believe that we need to listen to that voice, not because it is from the top end of the market but because it indicates one of the reasons we have reached a situation where we have become fragmented, territorially circumscribed. Parochial is not a word I like to use, because I am a Tasmanian, but there are always tendencies within our Federation which emphasise and give undue weight to local concerns as opposed to the needs of the whole nation. It is a tendency which must be overcome in the regulation of companies and securities. </PARA>
<PARA> Two main arguments came from Opposition senators relating to their concern that the proposed scheme should not go ahead and that somehow the national companies and securities scheme should be enhanced or reinstated. One was to do with funding and the other with the way in which the new scheme will relate to local business communities. As for funding, it has to be firmly said-I say this particularly to Senator Campbell, but also to Senator Knowles, as the junior and senior senators from Western Australia who are now sitting together-that the States were very amply supplied by the corporate sector with funds to carry out regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a fact that the States diverted those funds into other purposes, into their Consolidated Revenues. I would like to illustrate that point because Senator Campbell was not in the chamber at the time last year when the following happened: In the autumn of last year the Ministerial Council on the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) met and decided precisely to remedy the disability which Senator Campbell, Senator Knowles and others have pointed to-namely, that it was under-resourced; that it did not have the funds to carry out the regulation of Australia's corporate and securities sector that it ought to have had. The Ministerial Council met in the autumn and devised a scheme whereby more money would be derived from the corporate sector, but this required legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Within two months, in June of last year, the Commonwealth Parliament-and I give credit to the Opposition for supporting the measure-passed the necessary legislation to enable greater funding to be given to the NCSC. It was there in our appropriations; we discussed it at the Estimates committees. Only one State, New South Wales, has passed the necessary legislation to achieve that greater funding for the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the States have not been interested in securing greater funding to enable their corporate offices to regulate companies and securities activity within their own borders. That is a great shame, but I think after 12 months' experience of that particular effort to provide sufficient resources and funding one can see why exasperation is felt. Quite clearly completely different funding of a much more national regulatory body is now undoubtedly required. The national companies and securities scheme was not supported by the funding political will of the State governments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that you mentioned WA Inc., Senator, because in today's Australian Financial Review there is a very interesting editorial entitled `Company law debate federalism at its worst'. It points to a particular paradox which Senator Campbell and Senator Knowles might like to ponder. The Western Australian Opposition is simultaneously lobbying for a major inquiry into the deals surrounding WA Inc., while opposing the creation of a well funded national administration and enforcement operation that would go a long way towards remedying the deficiencies that have been highlighted in Western Australia. The fact is that the NCSC was always underfunded. I admit this in relation to Western Australia, and Senator Schacht has pointed to the same dangers in South Australia-that there is a danger of the local political power brokers becoming too closely involved with their local business community and its companies and securities activities. That is a real danger and I think the Western Australian experience has pointed to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Knowles will agree that for the past 18 months I have been subjected to question after question, particularly from Senator Durack, in relation to WA Inc., precisely because he understood that what was happening in Western Australia was having a national impact. Time after time I was unable to give him the answers that I wanted to give because, not being a responsible Minister in the sense that the NCSC was not answerable to me or to the Commonwealth Attorney-General, I had to await a fax from the NCSC, which might be four or five days late in coming, in order to reply to Senator Durack's queries. The fact is-and this is why the Senate Committee came into its unanimous conclusions-that we need to have not only a single administrative body but also proper parliamentary responsibility for the regulation of companies and securities throughout this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what really lay at the beginning of this process within this chamber. As Senator Macklin pointed out, there was very clear evidence that there was no real line of political responsibility for the regulation of companies and securities in Australia. This was so diffused through the Ministerial Council that in no parliament could one Attorney-General or Minister for companies regulation, or whatever you like to call him, be held accountable for the laws or the administration which were supposed to regulate the companies and securities sector. In that situation, those who committed misdeeds, such as in the case of WA Inc., were able, because of that diffusion of political responsibility, to get away with a lot more for a lot longer than they should have done. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need now is either meetings of the Ministerial Council or a telexed consensus reached in relation to, for example, how to set up an inquiry or who should do what in relation to a particular malfeasance by some person involved in companies and securities in the jurisdiction concerned. Therefore, what we are proposing is something that is absolutely consistent with parliamentary accountability and that is something which should appeal to senators, because this chamber, of all chambers, tries to insist that the Parliament take the Executive and hold it responsible for, in this case, the regulation of companies and securities. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very valid point was raised by Senator Campbell to which some weight must be given, and that is that despite the fact that we are talking about a national administrative structure with all the advantages of uniformity that are involved, there must be an ability to relate to, and be sensitive to, local business communities, and particularly smaller businesses. Mr Hartnell has indicated that there will be separate business centres in the various regions. This does not just mean in cities such as the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra nexus, but also in places such as Geelong and Townsville. These regional offices will be staffed at a high enough level to provide the sort of interaction with leaders in the local business community that Senator Campbell quite rightly sees as an important part of the operation of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that one has to realise that the legislation that we passed last year also provided particular consideration for smaller businesses. As senators will know, the Close Corporations Act, which is part of the package of laws implementing a national scheme, provides a new, simpler and more flexible form of incorporation for small business. Many of the current detailed rules applying to companies that are appropriate for larger companies admittedly impose inflexible and unnecessary rules and costly burdens on small businesses. The close corporation will enable the small business to obtain the benefits of incorporation, such as limited liability, simply and cheaply. There is also a reduction of the regulatory burden on proprietary companies. Right through this operation there has been a consciousness of the need to differentiate between the large companies and the small companies which operate to the great benefit of our economy and community. This sector creates the wealth which is then used for other purposes and is distributed in all sorts of ways, including taxation and charges on business, in a way that helps the whole community. Small businesses have to be nurtured and they are being nurtured under this very scheme. I believe that the indication that the regional offices will work in a way which is sensitive to the local business community, will sufficiently enable that interaction that is so important to occur without allowing the local business community to capture the regulatory and political agents within that local community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well Senator, they may not believe me, but we must ask what is the alternative. Mr Peter Costello, who is, I believe, playing a reasonably constructive role in these matters, had something to say about this. I do not know what they will say about that in my office downstairs when they read the Hansard! The shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs put out a press release on 28 May after his meeting with Liberal shadow Ministers and political leaders throughout Australia. In that release he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If legislation is rejected in any of the States, Australia risks ending up with a system much worse than its predecessor with different laws and different administrative bodies between the States. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Peter Costello said and I absolutely adopt every word of that. His concerns, like those of some senators, are about funding and the local business community relating to the national body. Those are concerns which must be addressed and I believe that they can be successfully addressed. One must also consider that the Hon. Nick Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales-the only Liberal politician in power, as opposed to being in opposition or a controller of an upper House-has also played a very constructive role in the past few weeks in relation to this matter. When one looks at his experience of the exercise of power and his knowledge of what is needed in Australia, one gets a very different picture. I am sure that Mr Greiner is motivated by the same fear expressed in Mr Peter Costello's remarks in his press release, which I will now repeat. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If legislation is rejected in any of the States, Australia risks ending up with a system much worse that its predecessor with different laws and different administrative bodies between the States. </PARA>
<PARA>That would be an absolute disaster. After all, the Attorneys-General have sat around the table, thrashed this out, and agreed that one has to keep within the constitutional limits. The High Court has set down certain boundaries. I understand that references of powers is not now the way it will go. The States will pass an application of laws Act which will pass through their own parliaments, and adopt the substantive laws that are passed by this Parliament in relation to companies and securities. That keeps the constitutional division of powers between the State Parliaments and this Parliament very clear. I believe that is a neater way to go and certainly does not involve any dubious claims for a constitutional bridge on the part of the Commonwealth which might be brought undone in the High Court. I think this has been acknowledged before, about this proposal as a whole, but it sets this particular piece of legislation in some sort of context. </PARA>
<PARA> I would plead with Senator Campbell, and Senator Knowles, to speak with the Hon. Nick Greiner, and with Mr Peter Costello, to see the dangers that might unfold if the upper Houses do not pass the legislation, which may be presented by those governments to their Houses of Assembly, and realise the great danger that that puts Australia in. This is not my opinion alone; it is shared by many in the community. Many editorial writers and many people in the business community have been saying over the last several weeks that unless Australia can present to the world a regulation of its companies and securities sector which will be seen to be efficient and sound and capable of controlling situations such as WA Inc.-none of us wants to see that situation emerge ever again-and if that terrible situation is to be averted the national Parliament, and senators as part of the national Parliament, must take political responsibility for keeping a Federal Minister responsible for the regulation of companies and securities throughout Australia, through one administrative structure, namely; the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank those senators who have indicated their support for the Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Vanstone moving a motion relating to the order of business of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone's notice of motion is the one that concerns the televising of this chamber during the Budget Session of parliament this year. The reason that we are seeking to have it dealt with on this occasion, rather than when we come back in the Budget Session, is for the obvious reason that televising will start from the commencement of the Budget Session. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that it would have been better if there had been more time for consideration of this matter by the chamber between the giving of the notice and the time that we are seeking to have it debated, that is, today. But, unfortunately, the details of the notice-that is, the terms and conditions which we put forward as having been agreed with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)-were not concluded until, literally, a few minutes before the notice was given yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if it is a new issue. Some might say that it has been an issue that has been around for 25 years. Of more relevance to the debate today is the fact that the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings of this Parliament recommended in October last year that a trial period be commenced for the televising of parliament. That was adopted by the Opposition parties in their party room, but it seems that at that time the Government was not prepared to enter such a trial. We think that is regret- table and therefore we have taken this action in order to let the Senate decide whether it might be broadcast in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there is quite a bit of work that would need to be done during the break with regard to technical and management matters on the procedures that would have to be adopted by the ABC. Apart from the work that would have to be done by the ABC in relation to educating its audience to program changing-all of those matters might seem mechanical to us, but no doubt to the professionals they are time consuming and have to be done in an orderly manner-it is necessary, in our view, that this matter be disposed of now rather than when we come back so that those who will be concerned with implementing the resolution, if Senator Vanstone's motion is adopted, have an opportunity to do so. It is for that reason that we say that it is urgent that the order of business be changed so that her motion be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> We undertake that it be a short debate and that if this motion is carried we would have one speaker who has agreed to speak for approximately 10 minutes. We do that because we recognise the weight of business still to be dealt with by the Senate in this session. We do not wish in any way to interfere with the orderly management of that business program. I urge the Senate to accept the urgency on this occasion and let the Senate express its view on whether it should be in a position to be televised commencing on Budget day this year. </PARA>

One wonders why, when the Manager of Opposition Business indicates that there will be a response tomorrow morning on this, on the public record, it is dragged in at this particular time. The normal procedures when something of this nature affecting the chamber is brought in are that we give notice and then have a consultation period and each party can made up its mind. There is no doubt that this issue has been canvassed. Let me not be hypocritical on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But when it came to moving the changes to the Estimates committee procedures, or the committee system, several times I moved an adjournment in this place until everyone was happy and made up his mind. When it came to Senator Coates's motion, on continuing orders, did we proceed with it and try to push it along until others were ready? No, we did not. What we have today is people moving helter skelter on this particular issue. What is the motive? So one senator can get up some Brownie points with the Fourth Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Rushing into this for such opportunistic reasons worries me in that sense. The sorts of procedures and understanding that are essential to make this very anarchistic chamber work are being breached on this occasion. Everyone knows that no-one has the numbers in this chamber. Everyone knows that debate cannot be artificially restricted by the gag in general. Therefore, one has to have a certain degree of understanding and cooperation. This has been blatantly breached on this occasion. I have not had an opportunity or sufficient notice to have this matter finalised in my party room. If it had been moved even a week ago, I would have had the opportunity to say, `Look, this is going to be decided on the Thursday'. </PARA>
<PARA> I also made, I thought, the reasonable offer to have this matter debated and, I said, finalised on 24 August. One wonders what the motive is for rushing into it now. I can only divine one motive-opportunism, wanting to ingratiate oneself with certain elements of the media. Of course, they want Parliament televised and turned into a circus. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to go to the substantive issues. I will do that later in the debate. But there is no reason why it should be rushed in on the second last day of the session and determined by a few speakers when every other time we have been considering something that has a major consequence in this chamber, a decent amount of time for discussion, negotiation and internal decision-making is allowed. It is not allowed on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed in members of the National Party that they would want to divert Government Business at this time when the whole wool debate is awaiting. Does it reflect very well on their priorities that they want to get into this sort of debate when important issues are going to be decided?</PARA>
<PARA> I admit that in the job of Manager of Government Business I have become a bit soft; I have become a bit too accommodating. Well, no more Mr nice guy any more on some of these matters. When the Opposition comes to us and asks for extra time we will probably give in because we do not have the numbers; but it will not be coming from the heart any more. We will not try to be so accommodating in future. We will do so only under the pressure of the vicious use of numbers in this chamber and not because we are trying to make the place operate and work properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is coming in today trying to shanghai a decision. Senator Brownhill is sitting over there, not researching the wool question or anything else, but wasting his time on this proposition. The Government opposes the suspension of Standing Orders. We will divide on this issue. But when the substantive issue comes up, because we do not have a firm position we will not seek to divide. We will be moving what I hope will be a minor amendment to this substantive motion that we are no doubt going to discuss in a few minutes. </PARA>

While we may agree, when we get into the substantive debate, with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, that this might not be the most urgent issue ever to come before the Senate, if, as the Democrats believe, the people of Australia have a right to televised broadcasts of the Parliament as they have to radio broadcasts, then that must begin at some point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also agree that when that happens we will want to review what happened in the first instance and perhaps look at the way it has worked and maybe go into some other mode. This motion, which we believe ought to be debated today, gives us that opportunity. It is for a trial period. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgency of the matter now and why we support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that, if we are going to do something, then obviously the Budget session is the period in which to do it. It is an informative and interesting session for the community. If we do not act now, today, then the work that is necessary to be done will not be able to be done in the winter recess period. Again we will be delayed further and further on a matter which, I might say in supporting the Opposition's motion, we have really only been delayed on because the Opposition has taken so long to come to a view about it. We have been clear for a very long time that this is something the Democrats have supported and we consider it as urgent as anything because now that Opposition members have come to agree with us and have taken this action we want to get it in place before they change their minds again. I think Senator Ray might have some sympathy with us on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go to the substantive issues, nor do we want a long debate. When the substantive issue does come before us we, too, guarantee not to blow out this debate.

<PARA> 7. The instructions of the President of the Senate or his or her delegates in respect of the broadcasting of excerpts, which are not inconsistent with these conditions, shall be observed. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight the Senate will have the opportunity to give Australians greater access to their Parliament. A parliament which deprives its people, the people it purports to serve, of access to its day-to-day operation is a parliament which has forgotten the fundamental premises underlying its own existence. The taxpayer is entitled to see what his elected representatives are doing, and how they are doing it. Taxpayers paid for the building, they pay for our salaries and they pay for all the associated costs. How could we possibly justify not letting them see how their money is spent?</PARA>
<PARA> This motion allows for a two-month trial period of televising Question Time. During that trial period it allows excerpts of proceedings-that is, all Senate proceedings-to be used by all the networks in their news broadcasts and current affairs programs. In that sense it is doing exactly what Senator Ray would like us to do; that is, giving us a first look at how such a thing would operate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no risk in adopting this motion. We will be having a trial procedure. The Senate, of course, retains the power to ensure that the media do not misuse this opportunity. I believe that it is in everybody's interest to maximise the opportunities for Australians to see what is happening with their dollars in their Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Other parliaments televise their proceedings. The United States House of Representatives started doing so in 1979 and the Senate in 1986. In the United Kingdom the House of Lords commenced televising its proceedings in 1985, as did the Commons in 1988. In Canada the matter was raised in 1977. It may be instructive to look at some of the debates on the subject in the House of Commons and note some of the remarks that were made. A Mr Nelson said on 9 February 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have come a long way in the past 400 years since the time when our proceedings were secret. The evolution of our democratic system has been one of gradual and increasing openness . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I believe and hope that we shall enhance the character and standing of this place in the world outside. </PARA>
<PARA>If the public live in ignorance because they are unable to see what happens here, that will ferment and breed suspicion and misunderstanding of our proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that is. Many members of the public have a misunderstanding of the proceedings in this place. There is not the time to detail all Mr Dobson's remarks but he made the point that most members of parliament are very keen to get on television. They will stand in the rain to get on television. They will go almost anywhere to get on television. Yet for some, when it comes to televising what they are doing in their own chamber-nicely airconditioned and away from the rain-there seems to be some reluctance. That reluctance is difficult to explain. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a number of points as to why the Senate should adopt this motion this evening. The first point relates to access, which I have partially mentioned it-people having the opportunity to see what happens in their Parliament. In this large country that is very important. The wealthy can travel here and see what happens. The print and radio media also have the opportunity to see what is happening. I am asking the Senate to adopt a motion tonight to let everyone else who cannot be here not only read about the Senate's proceedings in the newspapers and hear about them on the radio but also see them on television. That really is the limit of the change that is being suggested this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I made the point that allowing the televising of Parliament, at least during Question Time, and providing excerpts to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and other broadcasters, would give all Australians greater and improved access to Parliament. Since it is such a large country that is a good thing, since it is only wealthy people who can come to sit in the chamber and watch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now make the point that this proposal is for a trial period only. It is not uncontrolled access; it is access in accordance with some conditions. I understand that Senator Robert Ray wants to move an amendment to allow the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure to look at those conditions and perhaps come back and make some recommendations for change. Nonetheless, this is not a suggestion for totally uncontrolled access by the media to excerpts of Senate proceedings. After all, the signal is controlled by our Parliamentary Sound and Vision Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the additional point that the taxpayer has already forked out about $50m for the sound and vision systems in this Parliament. I know that some of that is not related to the televising of proceedings, but the most substantial proportion of it is. Who now gets the benefit? We televise Parliament to our rooms and to the press gallery but, for some reason, not to the public. It seems absolutely ludicrous. The cost has already been incurred. This building has the biggest television production studio in the country. It should be put to good use. We can put that cost to a good use by a simple flick of a switch so that the ABC can take Question Time live and the other networks can take excerpts as they see fit. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowing the televising of Parliament will result in an improvement in standards-both in the substance of debates and most certainly in the standard of behaviour. I do not suggest for a minute that there is any problem with behaviour in this place, but should the Senate adopt this course of action my view is that the House of Representatives will very rapidly follow. That chamber could very well do with an improvement in its standards of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I now canvass a couple of the arguments that have been put against this proposal. One is that if we televise Parliament it will in some ways stifle debate; that honourable members, knowing that they may well be on national television later that night, will somehow hesitate to take a tough stand or raise contentious issues. This is a ridiculous proposition to put, for a few reasons. First, they may be on national radio anyway. Secondly, whatever they say will probably be reported in the printed media. So there is no evading what one has said. There will be no greater scrutiny by this; it will simply allow movement on the television as opposed to a still picture. Thirdly, people who believe that they would modify their behaviour, to an extent where they would take a weaker position because of the televising of Parliament, really should not be here. </PARA>
<PARA> The main reason that the Government does not want to move this way now is basically a twofold reason. First, many members opposite do not approve of this chamber; they would like a unicameral system. They have never liked the Senate, and the further they can degrade the Senate the better. That is the first part. What flows from that is that they know that if the Senate does this, there is a full expectation that the House of Representatives will follow-as it should. That is where the rub comes. </PARA>
<PARA> If the House of Representatives follows, out comes the `Let's Protect Paul Society'. It is well known that Government members do not want the behaviour of their Ministers in the lower House televised live nationally, at Question Time. The only way to avoid that is to stop the Senate proceeding with this course of action. That is one of the fundamental reasons that the Government is against this; it does not want the people of Australia to see live the sort of behaviour indulged in in the House of Representatives, particularly by its Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that flows from the House of Representatives following the Senate is that the behaviour of Dr Hewson and his performance in the chamber will be able to be seen live. The Government does not want that either. One has only to have a quick look at the polls over the last couple of weeks to see why the Government would be apprehensive about televising Question Time in the House of Representatives. They are the real reasons that the Government does not want to proceed with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the fact that Government members have always had the view that we should have a unicameral system; that the Senate should not be here. I remind honourable senators that this is the chamber that really makes legislation that affects the daily lives of Australians. This chamber stopped the infamous identity card legislation going through. This chamber's activities stopped the Bill of Rights. Very often it is this chamber that cleans up very messy legislation, and improves it no end. That is the case with whoever is in government. On that basis, it is quite appropriate for the Senate to take this first step into televising all proceedings at some later stage. But the Government, bent on degrading the Senate, is determined that this chamber will not make the move that brings the public coverage of the Parliament into this century. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that this is an ambush and that there has not been time for people to think about it. Very briefly, I put an alternative view. This is not an ambush. The Minister talked about the new standing orders and matters relating to Estimates committees. We have had an opportunity to look at this again and again. All this motion is doing is giving us a chance to have a first look at the effect of televising the Parliament. We can then come back and have another debate about whether we think it has been effective. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the printed media have full access, radio has pretty good access, and I see no reason at all why television should continue to be unfairly and unwisely shut out of these proceedings. This motion will allow us to have a trial run of televising the Parliament and to make some assessments. A positive vote will result in a broadcast of the Senate, a Question Time in the Budget session, and excerpts by the other channels as they see fit. </PARA>
<PARA> If we get a positive vote tonight we will be at the go stage. The reason is that there have been negotiations with Harry Hall and Barbara Major of the ABC. I thank the Usher of the Black Rod for his contribution to those negotiations. We are now in a position to say that if this motion is passed tonight, the ABC will proceed exactly in accordance with its terms. That is a good thing. No further negotiation is required. We can simply say yes. We can give it a try; in the more colloquial terms, we can suck it and see. That is what we should do. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. This fits the typical pattern of being absorbed with the trivia of this chamber and the Senate's chauvinism. I do not think that it adds much to this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first argument adduced in favour of this proposal is that it would continue the process of the proper use of taxpayers' money. I am not opposed to the televising of proceedings of this chamber. My only point, as I made earlier today, is that I would have liked to have had the position formalised at a Party meeting. I am sure that any such formalisation would have come down in favour of televising. But the hypocritical argument that this is an extension of the use of taxpayers' money rings pretty hollow to me. What television will do is show taxpayers how much money they waste by lavishing it on honourable senators in this chamber, given the quality of debate, the inanity of many of the Senate's procedures and the absolutely excruciatingly slow pace at which this chamber goes about its work. At least I will give Senator Vanstone credit for the fact that she did not adduce the argument that we are not doing it for the little kiddiewinks. I am very pleased that that did not come forward tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I also welcome the televising of the Parliament because it will give exposure to the Opposition. That is a good thing. I will enjoy watching the camera pan across the back bench. Each time I will try to count up how many front benchers have been relegated there. It will be an interesting exercise. It is going to be an interesting exercise every time we do it. Or, just as likely, in one big sweep sometimes the coalition will be able to pick up five or six ex-members of the House of Representatives who threw the seats away for the Liberal Party in previous elections and were given the big promotion to the upper House as a reward for having lost coalition marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadcasting will have some entertainment value as the camera sweeps across the Opposition area, in particular when the camera lingers on the now narrowing base of the National Party of Australia. Nothing could be more constrained in boosting the Government's stocks. There the cameras will linger on Senator Boswell and the rest of the old age pensioners in the National Party and their younger acolytes. Maybe this is really why Senator Vanstone wants it. Of course, the Liberal Party is always trying to wipe out the National Party. There is the leading culprit sitting over there in Senator Parer, who used to hate the former Premier of Queensland-to his credit. He is probably part of the plot, saying `Television of Senate proceedings will be the end of the poor old Nats; they will never adapt'. </PARA>
<PARA> But televising the proceedings of this chamber will involve some problems. The empty seat problem is always a problem but certain constraints that the House of Commons and House of Lords have used will generally overcome that. The general view of the public and anyone in the galleries is that politicians only work while they are in this chamber. I have to say publicly that the only time I ever get any rest is when I am in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> But some of the other conditions worry me. What about satire and ridicule? The producers cannot use an excerpt to satirise and ridicule anyone. Half the clowns who jump up here ridicule and satirise themselves. Does that mean half the senators are never going to get any television exposure? I wonder. A very strange qualification has been put in there. I do, however, support strongly Senator Vanstone's mention of commercial sponsorship and commercial advertising because I shall not wear a T-shirt advertising a local meat pie or anything else. I think that is excellent. While I am on the subject, I only want head shots in the coverage-nothing below the halfway mark for Senator Collins and myself. I will not be cruel enough to nominate anyone else in the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made a few facetious remarks tonight, that is true; but the question on balance is a serious one as to how it is determined and who is satisfied with it. Unless we take a very robust attitude to this-that is, take our wins and our losses-we really are going to get into nightmare territory. If someone's particular question is cut off halfway or a senator is taken from a bad angle or something else, they are going to have to ride the bumps. I do not want Senator Vanstone coming in here squealing that this new system that she has asked for is not giving her a fair run or running conspiracy theories around it. I do not think that would add very much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone has said, `The Australian Labor Party has not progressed this'-first of all, because we believe in a unicameral system. If the conspiracy theory were true, we would televise this place straightaway. Nothing would destroy people's confidence in this place more than having it flashed into the dining rooms and kitchens of every house in the country. Come off the conspiracy theory. If those opposite want to destroy this place, they should show it as it is and not accuse us of that. </PARA>
<PARA> But the real coup de grace argument is, `Labor does not want televised proceedings because it does not want them televised in the House of Representatives' because we are afraid of Paul Keating every day at Question Time getting up and showing what a dope Peter Reith is! We are absolutely terrified that the Prime Minister is such a poor media performer that we are going to do badly out of this! The one thing I do agree with Senator Vanstone about, though, is that if we trigger it here, it will come to the House of Representatives very quickly. That is an incontrovertible fact, though not for the motives that Senator Vanstone ascribes. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have here is the argument that this chamber is just so important because it is men's legislation. I have gone back through the Hansards from 1975 to 1980 and I do not recall that point being made much. But, even more, the Australian Democrats actually achieved the balance of power from 1980 to 1983, and I have searched in vain for Senator Sir John Carrick, Senator Withers or the others getting up and extolling the virtues of amending legislation and what a wonderful chamber this is. This is just Opposition mentality. The moment those opposite are in government they will be the first to complain when their legislation is amended by this chamber. The first day those opposite are in government all these lofty and high principles that have been enunciated tonight will go out the window. Senator Vanstone should recognise that. At least we on this side have the honesty to recognise that. Those principles will go straight out the window and those opposite will be complaining about Senate obstructionism and saying that this chamber is working against the people's House, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that when this motion is carried today it is carried on its merits and not on the basis of crude Senate chauvinism. I hope it is carried with the consciousness that the preconditions here may not yet be perfect, that it is very hard to find a judge of what is satiric and what is in fact balanced, and that these conditions may not work. But it is good to see that there are conditions there. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on that point, I think seeing that we were given only a day's notice and that Senator Vanstone has written the conditions, in the meantime we should refer at least these conditions to a committee. But in no way should we stop them operating. I want to make that quite clear. The amendment I am about to move is not to send something off to a committee to stop and block an operation. What gets carried tonight is what comes into being. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the motion, add the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) That the conditions contained in paragraph (3) be referred to the Procedure Committee for inquiry and report by 21 August 1990, and that these orders have effect until altered by a further order of the Senate in relation to the report of the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of that amendment is that the Procedure Committee can review the conditions, see if they are adequate, add any or subtract any. It would have to then report to the Senate and its report be carried before any of the conditions that Senator Vanstone has put down are invalidated. I cannot see any real problem with that. At least we can all have a say in it and some of my complaints about the rushed nature of this can be obviated. </PARA>
<PARA> I just say in conclusion that the Government will not seek to divide on this. Indeed, we do not have any other view than a conscience vote on it because we have not made a collective decision on it. As we have not made a collective decision on it, members of the Labor Party can vote whichever way they like on this particular issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be speaking for very long on this motion. However, I will probably speak for longer than the one-eighth of the time that we would have if everything was fair and averaged out in this chamber. I will not speak for long because, as I said earlier, it does not seem to the Australian Democrats that this is the most gripping issue ever raised in the Senate. I am absolutely staggered yet again to hear that Government senators will have a conscience vote on this. There always seems to be a conscience vote by the Government when we are dealing with procedures in this place, but not when we are dealing with the future of the East Timorese, just as one example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Democrats have had a position for a long time on the question of the televising of parliament. We believe that the people of Australia have a right to see as well as to hear parliamentary proceedings. Since we moved into this new House of Parliament where all the facilities exist for that to be possible for the people of Australia, we have said that should happen. We are delighted that the Opposition has now a position on this. As I also said earlier, we are very happy to move this through today with some speed because we would not want the Opposition to change its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Senator Vanstone for the role that she has played in putting forward this motion. I am not absolutely sure why that position has been finally arrived at by the Opposition. Senator Vanstone seemed to allude to the fact that the Opposition seemed to believe first, as we all do, that this will soon move to the House of Representatives and that there the Opposition appears to believe that it can actually join the charisma stakes with its new leader, Dr Hewson. That, of course, remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not rehearse all of the substantive issues, but Senator Ray raised the question of how we might be seen and what the media often does about what goes on in this place. It seems to me that, in fact, the direct televising, albeit of excerpts and of Question Time, in some ways might lead to a better representation of what goes on in this place in the media generally. Sometimes one can go home late at night and switch on the television or radio and hear reports which do not seem to bear a great deal of resemblance to what actually went on here during the day. This may very well be an excellent exercise in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> While we support Senator Vanstone's motion, we do have some fairly serious reservations. The first part of the proposal is that there be a direct broadcast of Question Time. We have not previously come out publicly on this matter. We believe that Question Time is not a direct, clear and honest representation of the daily and nightly work of this place. Indeed, Question Time in the Senate can sometimes be a deadly boring exercise. But it is seen in general parliamentary terms as a time for demonstrating all sorts of talents which do not necessarily go to the substantive work of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I have some hope that with the passage of this motion both the Opposition and the Government might lift their game here in this place. It has been a bit somnolent at Question Time these last couple of weeks. It will be a challenge to Opposition senators to do better than their counterparts in the House of Representatives in putting Ministers on the spot, something which I think has been lacking, particularly in this four weeks of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a trial period, so we are prepared to accept the first part of the motion, the direct broadcast of Question Time, particularly as, as Senator Vanstone has told us, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is keen to take it on. That goes very much to what we have said about the right of Australians to have at least a better look than they have had before at what goes on in parliament. In saying that we do not think Question Time represents the essence of what goes on here, we will be looking at the results of that trial period very much in terms of the balance of what is used to show what does go on in the parliament. We are particularly concerned that the committee stage of legislation, for instance, should be shown because that is a very significant part of the work that is done here. It is not the least of the work that is done by this chamber in contrast to the other, a point which Senator Robert Ray alluded to. In this chamber things do happen; legislation is changed; debate sometimes, although too rarely, affects the final vote. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that in his contribution Senator Ray seemed to feel it necessary to indulge in a bit of character assassination of Senator Vanstone. I would not for one minute imagine that she wanted me to get up here and stand up for her, but I think this is a much more important issue than that. So we will not engage in character assassination nor mention the fact that perhaps one of the reasons for supporting this motion and supporting television broadcast of parliament is that perhaps no longer will the gentlemen on the front bench put their feet on the seats-Oh, everybody's frowning at me! It is a very common practice for the Ministers and people on the other side to stand in the way that men do and put their feet up on the furniture. I find it appalling. The furniture belongs to the Australian people and the Australian people will see those feet put on the furniture, if parliament is televised. Perhaps honourable senators will then not do it any more. I do not want the seat ruined by the time I get on the front bench. It is a common practice; I invite Senator McMullan to watch for it. Maybe he does not do it, but the taller men among us do quite often. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just wondering about Senator McKiernan's ties and what will happen to them when we start televising parliament. His tie is very dull tonight. He might find it necessary to pick up some new ones to match the one he had on last week. </PARA>

For us that will provide quite a positive part of the exercise. The Australian people I think will see the difference, as I have said, between the House of Representatives and the Senate if there is fair reporting. They will see that in the other place the gag is applied and the debate means nothing, but that in this chamber, as Senator Ray alluded to, since 1980 and the balance of power being held by the Australian Democrats, there has been a different chamber from the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

It may well be that there is no cost whatsoever, as Senator Vanstone seemed to indicate. If that is the case, there is not much point in my continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention, though, my future fears about what might happen to broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings, whether that be by radio or by television. We have seen what has happened to radio. The broadcasts have been isolated to unknown bands and very few people listen to parliamentary broadcasts. Maybe it was 3 or 4 per cent previously but that has probably dropped now to 0.5 per cent because people cannot find it. It is difficult to get the bands. People are not used to them. It seems to me that they are difficult to tune into. Am I correct in this? The other thing which is quite possibly coming down the track is the demand by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the parliamentary broadcasts stations should be paid for by the Parliament rather than by the ABC. Now one of the very important functions of the ABC was to broadcast proceedings of parliament. I think that has been its responsibility and it still remains its responsibility. I just make that indication here, during the discussions, so that honourable senators will think about that and not accept that the responsibility for paying for the broadcasting of parliament should be a matter for parliamentary appropriations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal-National Party coalition does not oppose the amendments currently before the Senate. The changed date-now 9 May-from the House of Representatives is the day the matter was introduced into Parliament and that fits the criteria outlined during the original Senate second reading debate on luxury cars. The Opposition's stand on this issue highlights its concern about the Government's tendency to legislate by press release-a concern which is clearly shared by the Australian Democrats and has been commented on by organisations such as the Australian Law Council. We believe that the coalition's stand has been vindicated by a recent report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills which welcomed our amendment. The changed date fits the criteria that we previously set down. We do not oppose the changed date.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills have the effect of increasing the maximum rate of wool tax to 20 per cent. The coalition's decision to support the 20 per cent tax is based on a number of factors. I also draw to the Senate's attention that we have been alerted to the fact that tomorrow we will be considering further amendments with regard to the Wool Marketing Act which deal with guarantees relating to loans. This legislation will probably be brought in and made cognate with the debate on these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is so typical of the last minute haste with which the Hawke Labor Government deals with legislation on very important issues. Of course, there are administrative and commercial complications. I refer all honourable senators to the debate in the House of Representatives, where the Wool Tax Amendment Bills were debated on 17 May. They were guillotined through with very little debate. There was just no time allowed for any significant debate to take place. By comparison, I refer honourable senators to the speakers list that I have seen floating around which implies that there will be many speakers in this place taking an interest. It is a pity that this Government will not allow substantive, proper and good debate in the House of Representatives, where these matters should be under proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Many important historical considerations should be taken into account. The wool industry extends back to the early part of the nineteenth century, and Australia has never had extremely high prices for wool for more than a season and a half. I refer particularly to the speeches of the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, the honourable member for Barker, Mr Ian McLachlan, and the honourable member for Parkes, Mr Michael Cobb, in the House of Representatives. They were three of about four or five Opposition spokesmen that were able to speak on this issue. Of course, they all have portfolio, electorate and personal interests that are very close to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the honourable senator that the floor price was put in place for stability, for predictability, and for a smoothing of the price mechanisms which, it was hoped, would advantage buyers and flow on to growers. As Ian McLachlan said in the House of Representatives when he was referring to the 1970s:</PARA>
<PARA>Initially, provision was made in the early 1970s for only a flexible reserve-one that followed the market up and down on a daily or weekly basis. The early legislation did not make provision for what we now call the reserve price or the floor price until 1974. The basis of the floor price was a price below which we would not sell our commodity to the world . . . it was a price which was to give predictability to the growers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It was also to provide predictability for the buyer from other nations. He then outlined a number of reasons for our current wool surplus:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . first, . . . we have never had a disappearance, as the term goes, of wool in any one year that is the equivalent of this year's wool clip . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the age-old move from wheat to an alternative product has been around during the 1980s when the wheat industry found international prices totally unsatisfactory. Thirdly, we have had a run of extremely good seasons in Australia . . . Fourthly, . . . we have had a reserve price which, as it turns out . . . has been too high; it has been above the long term trend line.</PARA>
<PARA>He also pointed out that China, Russia and eastern Europe have been in a doubtful state in the commercial arena. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is our greatest industry. It is our most efficient industry and our largest industry. On a net basis, wool is still our most significant export. As an industry, it is significant for Australia for research and promotion. Only a year or two ago it was bringing $500m a month into this country from sales. That has now fallen on average to less than $300m a month, impacting greatly on our balance of payments. Of course, the issue is complex and we often need to trace why and where things have happened in the legislative sense. The Wool Tax Acts are part of the greater wool legislation which was passed in 1987, of which the Wool Marketing Act was the major piece, setting the structure for the Bill. I quote from the second reading speech of the then Minister for Science, Mr Barry Jones, in the other House:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate in this regard for the Australian Wool Corporation to be hampered in its ability to operate commercially. It cannot be expected to seek frequently ministerial or government approvals for corporate financial decisions. It is also fundamentally wrong for major decisions on the finances and market operations of the Australian Wool Corporation, such as decisions on the minimum reserve price, to be taken in a political environment. If the Australian Wool Corporation is to act as an autonomous commercial body it must have financial arrangements established, as far as possible, on a commercial basis like any other business organisation. The Bill introduces a number of changes to ensure this. It also establishes a proper relationship on financial matters between the Australian Wool Corporation, the Government and the Wool Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>With the progress of time, it is interesting to note how the Government's statements are now either inconsistent or rather hypocritical. In the reply by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, to the second reading debate in the House of Representatives on 17 May 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government too has to make sure that decisions we take guarantee this industry's viability. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Cabinet Ministers have a prime responsibility to stand back from some of the industry politics in these issues and try to take a decision in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Kerin went to the Wool Council of Australia conference in Roma on 23 May 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 I gave the power to set the MRP to the Australian Wool Corporation after consultation with the Australian Wool Council. I made a mistake in believing the Corporation was strong enough to take purely commercial decisions about fundamental commercial issues such as the level of the MRP. I did not forsee the industry political pressure put on grower members of the Board to push up the price. </PARA>
<PARA>He posed the question: Why will the Government not let the wool industry do what it wants? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the core of the government's concern is that without a full analysis of the facts and options, the industry may take a decision that sends it bankrupt and ends the MRP scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to base my judgments about your future on wild optimism. From your perspective, the cost of servicing a debt of up to $4 billion along with declining equity in wool stocks, must be very worrying. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us remember Senator Button's second reading speech, which was incorporated in Hansard on 11 May 1990. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendations of the Wool Council of Australia are taken into account in setting the actual limits. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>In setting the maximum wool tax rate at 20 per cent, the Government is of the view that this rate is consistent with an appropriate mix of policy measures designed to ensure the continued viability of the wool industry and the reserve price system itself. </PARA>
<PARA>It is about time the Federal Government took responsibility for the difficulties facing the wool industry and accepted that its economic policies have caused the current difficult and complicated situation to arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that because of an inflated dollar Australian products are too expensive for overseas buyers. In the wool industry the situation is exacerbated by a high interest component in the cost of storage. The Wool Corporation claims that until the Government intervened, 70 per cent of wool on offer was sold. It also predicts that buyers will return once the rumours and uncertainty are taken out of our market-uncertainty created by the speculative comments of John Kerin and Paul Keating in the past month. If we had an affordable interest rate regime and if the Australian dollar reflected its own worth, Australia would have more overseas sales, fewer bales in store and less debt, and the floor price would not be an issue. While Minister Kerin has been claiming for days prior to this week's Cabinet decision that he had the power to intervene in setting the floor price, he would do better to turn his efforts to obtaining a more affordable interest rate and establishing a better dollar value. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has effectively created a situation where uncertainty and speculation prevails. If it were not for the Kerin intervention which has destabilised wool sales, sales of wool would still be proceeding normally. The speculation which has been associated with the recent debate on the floor price has resulted in extreme uncertainty and massive cost to the Corporation and to growers. It is the industry's right and responsibility to determine the floor price. The Wool Council recommended the lifting of the 10 per cent maximum to 25 per cent to give greater flexibility and greater grower equity in the fund. The Wool Corporation also recommended 25 per cent, but made the further point that it can borrow better with that level and that there may be a need to increase the promotion levy to move more of the coarser wools which are not selling as well. Both made the point about having a good safe buffer between the operating level and the maximum levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's press releases of the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation are still trenchant with criticism of the Labor Government. The Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, Mr Hugh Beggs, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I shall not endeavour to explain the Minister's rationale, that is his job, but I will say that the Board of the Corporation does take and always has taken very seriously its charter under the Wool Marketing Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The major parts of this are twofold:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to increase the commercial returns to the Australian woolgrower; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the performance of its function and the exercise of its powers do not conflict with major Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I refuse to accept that in the Corporation's submission either of these factors was neglected. The result is that of the Minister's judgment overriding that of the AWC, and on his own head be it. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Mac Drysdale of the Wool Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA>General mismanagement of the Australian economy is obviously not enough for this Government. Its political intervention in the wool industry shows that it is unaware that it is destroying Australia's economy, industry by industry. Until today, the wool industry was one of the remaining few export industries this country could be truly proud of. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the Labor Government has become the destroyer of industries. Last year the Government destroyed the $5 billion tourism industry through its intervention in the pilots dispute. This year it is the wool industry's turn for the political and economic guillotine. We need to ask again why there is this legislative rush. I refer honourable senators to the debate in the House of Representatives on 17 May when debate was gagged. It became so very evident that it was this interventionist role that Ministers Keating and Kerin wished to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stated the issues related to the interest rate policy, the overvalued dollar, the fact that the value of a bale of wool dissipated totally within four years at these interest rates. Ian McLachlan said in the debate in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA>When interest rates are held up, one is paying out much higher interest rates, than would otherwise be the case, because our dollar is higher, buyers from the other end of the world are not able to buy our wool at the same price. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we look at the costs associated with the stockpile. The current cost of storing a bale of wool is approximately $220. Interest payments amount to about $180, while storage costs $40. When it gets to the stage of stockpiling 2.8 billion bales by the end of this season, there is an unacceptable amount of dead interest going out to lenders. This consequently forces up prices and leads to higher costs of production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government should give woolgrowers a break and get on with the job of restructuring the labour market, cleaning up the waterfront, injecting competition into coastal shipping and obtaining substantial improvements in road and rail transport. Continued absence of progress in these areas will keep costs high, not only for woolgrowers but for all Australians. Substantial benefits are to be had from such reforms which the coalition has adopted as firm policies and accorded the highest priority. Unfortunately, the Government's past record indicates that it lacks the willpower to implement these urgently needed reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many things that we could say about this issue, but I am mindful of the fact that there are many other speakers to be heard in this debate. Although the Opposition believes that as a general rule the wool industry should be allowed to set its own floor price, it accepts the Government's decision to reduce the floor price for wool to 700c so that confidence once again can return to the market. While the industry's floor price recommendation was not accepted by the Government, there will now be a firm floor price which will allow the industry and buyers to plan for the future with confidence. There are many buyers just waiting for a firm price to recommence their purchasing. The industry must move on to the positive task of marketing our wool and putting this industry back in shape. The Opposition has made a decision which I believe is strong and sensible, a decision to support the wool tax amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating, perhaps before I had expected, the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990. I assure the Senate that I speak as an active and long-experienced woolgrower. I acknowledge the importance of the wool industry, and my colleague Senator Tambling has already pointed that out. The wool industry has been Australia's biggest income earner for most of the past 30-odd years, and probably beyond that. It is only in the past 18 months that coal has surpassed wool as an export earner. However, once the marketing system has been sorted out and more confidence is brought back into that system among world buyers, I believe that the industry will approach the $5 billion of export earnings mark again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wool is an industry that covers all of Australia. Whereas industries such as the gold industry or the iron ore industry are isolated mostly in Western Australia, the wool industry has its operations everywhere. It goes from the biggest station in the Kimberleys to the wheat belts of Western Australia and the wheat belts and traditional sheep areas of the eastern States, down to the small 10-acre lot owned by the weekend farmer; and indeed right down to the hobby farm. Therefore, what happens to the wool industry is felt throughout Australia. The wool industry is a great employer of people, and has potentially vast downstream benefits, provided that technology is introduced into Australia and there is the will in this country to provide such benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> I am a great believer in and defender of the reserve price scheme operated by the Australian Wool Commission, in the first instance in the early 1970s, and later under the Australian Wool Corporation. I can remember the disastrous prices that existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. If one traces back the history of wool in Australia, since World War II when prices took off and when there was the old cry of `a pound for a pound' in about 1951, we see that the industry operated through a vast number of ups and downs for some 20 years. It was forced from the high prices of 1951 to virtually a bottom price during the Cold War period of 1954-55. There was a resurgency in the industry in 1956, which persisted until around the early 1960s. It was a total disaster in the early 1970s and credit must be given to those from our side of politics who brought in a reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> That reserve price scheme worked slightly differently from the way in which it works now, but at that stage it was the beginning of what I believe to be a pretty good scheme. In 1970 wool was around 30c a kilo on average. Within two years the price had gone up to 100c and then a year after that it was back to 28c on average. That was when the scheme came in-around 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid to say that the management of the industry by the Corporation leaves a little to be desired. Let us look at the reasons for setting up the scheme in the first place. I have already mentioned the wild fluctuations. The reserve price scheme was meant to iron out the potholes; it was not intended to put up the price of wool to beyond the natural line, what the industry would pay on a long-term basis. Since the beginning of that reserve price scheme in 1972, it has worked very well except for a couple of worrying stockpiles on the way. However, the Corporation was able to clear them-and at a profit, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 there was a steep climb in wool prices due to world conditions. The zenith was reached in January 1988. Between 1986-87 and 1988-89, the reserve price increased from 508c a kilo to 870c a kilo. This was where the Corporation went wrong. The market had peaked in January 1988 at about 1300c a kilo on average. On 1 July 1988 the Corporation, with the advice of the Wool Commission, decided to increase the reserve price. As a woolgrower at the time, running my family corporation, I reckoned that that was not a very wise move. There was a great deal of contention around Australia as to whether that price should go up. Anyhow, the increase went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> From the peak time of January 1988 to July of that year when the Corporation put the reserve price up to 870c, the indicator-that is the average floor price-had already dropped from 1300c to 1000c per kilo. Except for an upward trend in May 1988, the decline had been quite gradual and consistent. However, it remained consistent until the market indicator and the floor price actually met in November 1989. It has been nothing short of disaster ever since. The Corporation has been forced to buy too much wool. I have a chart here to illustrate what I said about the indicator peaking in January 1988 or thereabouts and then declining steeply. By October 1988 it had declined so much that it was almost meeting the reserve price. The reserve price and the indicator met in November 1989. I seek leave to have this chart incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The chart read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>[CHART NOT INCLUDED ON DATABASE, SEE HARD COPY PAGE 1639]</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When those two lines met, the Corporation had to start buying. The stockpile climbed quickly to 2.5 million bales and is now in the vicinity of three million bales and still rising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point let me say without qualification that the only decision that this Senate has to make is to set the ceiling of the wool tax. The reserve price is definitely and entirely a matter for the Corporation to determine, except in certain circumstances relating to the powers vested in the Minister. We all know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) acted on those powers today. However, in arriving at the decision to set the maximum tax level, one must examine the reasons for doing so. In other words, in agreeing to the 20 per cent, the line that we have taken, we must look at how we came to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that the actions of the Corporation can be questioned. I have also pointed out that I support the reserve price scheme, even though I do not support every aspect of that scheme. The floor price of the scheme is inflexible at present, except in cases where there is an upward trend. The floor price, as set now within the present scheme, does not allow for certain things-mainly fluctuations in the value of the Australian dollar. Most importantly, it does not allow for consideration of the level of production. Production is mentioned very little in this debate. The floor price does not allow for political considerations or for production in other countries. We know that South Africa and New Zealand are good producers of wool. But now there are producers in Uruguay and Chile, and even some in China. Therefore, world wool production is rising. Also, the present floor price does not allow for overseas trends such as the use of synthetics and the fashions that predominated last year or will predominate this year and next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest single factor is that the reserve price does not follow the value of the Australian dollar. When the present reserve price was set in 1988, the Australian dollar was worth US69.8c. I will come back to that later, but probably the fact that the Australian dollar was so low was the major factor is stimulating demand for wool overseas which caused the high prices. When the wool chaos set in earlier this year the Australian dollar was almost US80c. It is all very well for us in Australia to receive a fluctuating income but we have to look at the manufacturer's side of the story-the wool that they are buying to turn into garments. They will keep using any commodity that has a reasonably static price, with a certain built-in allowance for inflation and those sorts of things. However, when the price moves wildly, the manufacturers get into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian dollar reached almost US80c, in order to keep the price of wool stable at the factory door, the Australian reserve price should have been reduced to 746c a kilo. To keep the price stable that is what the base price should have gone down to. The yen, and my colleague Senator Archer gave me this figure today, has appreciated over that time by 14.7 per cent; my quick calculation on the American dollar, is around 14 per cent. There was a sudden rise that threw them and made their wool that much dearer. It then had to be reflected in their buying. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that this scheme will be around for a long time but it will have to be refined. The scheme started off reasonably well in 1971-72, and we have had a certain amount of refinement. In the last five or six years when wool prices have been pretty good we have not had enough refinement. Perhaps the scheme should be altered to set the reserve price in United States currency. I believe that the United States currency is the one to use, for various reasons. Firstly, it is a currency that is commonly used; and, secondly, because of America's low imports of wool from Australia, any change would not tend to distort the market as much. My suggestion is that it be linked to a currency that would keep the wool price reasonably static at the factory door. I know that at the time this would have meant a lower price to wool growers. I fully admit that. But a higher dollar can be reflected in the cost of other imports such as farm materials, for example, and machinery, and that would also make the figures decline. That is something for the Corporation to look at in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the level of production. There were high prices in 1987, 1988 and 1989. In 1986 we had a glut of wheat and the price of wheat dropped away. We had a few problems then, and Senator Walsh kept reminding us that the minimum price was triggered and the Government paid out some $184m on it. That is a small figure compared with our problems in the wool industry now. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of wheat growers, not all but a good majority, have turned to wool. Australia's wheat plantings have gone down by 22 per cent since 1986 so they have turned over to wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the figures: in 1987-88 Australia had 157 million sheep. In 1988-89 we had 166 million. In 1989-90 it is projected that there will be 172 million, and the projection for 1990-91 is 174 million. I have a chart which shows that just after the War, in 1945-46, Australia had 89.4 million sheep. The figures show that we have had a gradual climb in sheep numbers. At this stage I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a chart which shows the number of sheep in Australia. I do so subject to the Minister giving the okay.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for not having shown it to the Minister, but I was told that this Bill would be debated tomorrow. I thank the Senate. We have had an increase in production per head of sheep of 10 per cent in the last five years. A fair amount of that rise since 1945 has been in the last seven or eight years. Production since 1950 has been up 30 per cent. In the last six years alone there has been an increase in the cut of 0.2 of a kilogram.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had no consideration of political circumstances. China has had its Tiananmen Square problem, and for reasons of its own stopped buying wool. Russia has had economical problems and it cut down on purchases. Eastern Europe has been going through a restructuring, and we welcome that restructuring. Those countries will prove to be good buyers of wool in the days to come. But at the present moment they have their own problems so they are not buying wool. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already canvassed the production of wool overseas. In Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand the production of wool is rising. One has to look at the overseas trend line. The pricing of overseas wool is below Australia's price and is biting into our markets. The demand of fashion for lighter and lighter materials has to be taken into consideration. In the past 18 months alone the use of wool has dropped from 500 grams per linear metre to 360 grams per linear metre in high quality woollen garments for men and women's wear. This has reduced demand by 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The climate in the Northern Hemisphere has also affected the industry. The last three winters in the Northern Hemisphere have been unusually warm. I will not go into any debate on this, as there are no Australian Democrats here to suggest why that might be. This could be a temporary phase and I certainly hope so, but it has cut down the use of wool. The climate in the Northern Hemisphere has resulted in a marked increase in the installation of internal heating in houses. This means lesser clothing for internal use. Electric blankets, believe it or not, have become popular in the Northern Hemisphere in the last four or five years. All of these things have had an effect on wool sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of synthetics during the high price period has dramatically increased. I will refer later to what the New South Wales farmers have had to say about that. Synthetic diameter sizes range between six and 15 microns so they are very handy to use in fine materials. They have a great advantage for the manufacturer. The best one can get out of wool is 15 microns. Hopefully there is a new chemical treatment around the corner which will reduce the micron in wool to reduce the diameter of the fibre. I hope that that will rescue wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the options that the Corporation has, or had, available. It had three options. Option A was its own preferred option, to keep the levy at 870c per kilo and 25 per cent tax. With this option, at the end of five years, in 1994-95, we would have outside borrowings of $2.74 billion, maximum borrowings of $3.5 billion and a stockpile of 5.184 million bales. Option B was for 870c per kilo and a levy of 20 per cent. After five years the Corporation would have had outside borrowings of $3.292 billion, a stockpile of 5.4 million bales and maximum borrowings of $3.987 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Option C involved a 700c per kilo floor price and a 20 per cent levy. In five years the Corporation would have no outside borrowings, a stockpile of 1.9 million bales and maximum borrowings of $2.103 billion. Let us ponder those maximum borrowings of $3.4 billion or $3.9 billion under option A or B. It is more than the entire Australian wheat crop. It equals the Australian beef production. It is twice the production of gold. It is two-thirds the export of coal. Nearly $1 billion alone would have to be sent overseas to pay for interest alone. At this rate, as Senator Tambling pointed out, a bale of wool would cost $220 per bale to store and so consume itself in four years. If demand drops any further the stockpile could blow out to seven million bales. If the Corporation goes bankrupt, who will pick up the bill? I understand that tonight a new Bill is coming through to underwrite $2.5 billion of corporate borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the example of the International Tin Council and see what happened when it interfered with the world prices. If we look at this year's appropriations, which we dealt with not so long ago, we will see that the Government has allocated over $1m to cover the tin losses. One also has to look at the strain on our overseas debt, which under this Government is already crippling. Our overseas debt is approaching $150 billion. That is because of the way this Government has handled the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the industry must take stock of itself, get the stockpile moving and do its share to turn the economy around. Otherwise, in 12 months time the problem will be greater or it will be too late and a total disaster. Growers, including me, must look beyond the farm gate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's performance in the last 12 months has been lacking. In the past 12 months it has bought 43 per cent of the clip and exhausted $1.8 billion of the money it had in the bank. It made a further mistake last year when it repaid two revolving fund payments to growers in high wool years that the growers did not really want. That sort of money would have been very handy at present. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to hear what different people around Australia have to say. I spoke to one wool handling firm which was strictly in favour of the levy going to 25 per cent. I spoke to another firm equally as big and it was just as interested as we are in setting the levy at 20 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume that the firm that said that it favoured a 25 per cent levy had a lot of money loaned out on wool in the store and a lot of money out on farms. I think the other firm had better foresight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have also been other distortions, such as transferred income from the fine wool growers-I am not a fine wool grower; we are medium woolgrowers-to the 21- to 24-micron growers. Income has also been transferred from Australian wool growers to overseas woolgrowers; those growers have been able to get a better price. Our price has been artificially too high. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously they are. Let us look at a few of the Wool Corporation's statements over the last few months:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is no evidence to show that the 870c per kilo has caused a fall in demand and a consequent build-up of stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not have to tell you what has happened, Mr President; you know. Another statement was `The floor price has been accepted by the textile trade'. So why then has the trade bought less than half of our clip and the balance of its requirements overseas? Then there was the story about losses on the stockpile held. I did not hear any wool buyer or the Corporation complaining when wool prices were rising and they had a stockpile. If one is prepared to accept the gains on the way up one should accept the losses on the way down. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote a question asked at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference held in February 1990. The question was directed by Neil Inall, the Conference Chairman, to Hugh Beggs, Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Is a 15 per cent tax to growers too tough a medicine?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>No. 15 per cent is about right. It gives us the credibility to maintain the policy we have and it sends a solid message to growers. If it turns out to be too much we can return it to growers. </PARA>
<PARA>The following question was asked by a concerned woolgrower in the last week:</PARA>
<PARA>If the wool tax has jumped within three months from 15 per cent to 25 per cent due to a downturn in the market, in the event of a further downturn in the market, what will be the increase of tax to the woolgrower?</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in January the Corporation was happy with 15 per cent and was going to return some money. But now it is looking for 25 per cent. The Government has taken the line that it will allow a maximum of 20 per cent. The coalition has decided to support that move. I believe that it is a good position to take. It is the only position that we can take so this great industry of ours can sort itself out and go forward. For the reasons I have outlined I believe that anything else would be a great disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a couple of other things I would have liked to have mentioned. If honourable senators have a chance to read it, I direct their attention to an advertisement by the New South Wales Farmers Association which appeared in the Australian this week. I was going to discuss it in detail. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Wool is not a necessity and comprises only four per cent of the textile market. If the government makes the wrong decision, wool processors will be financially burnt . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If wool comprises only 4 per cent of the textile market, let us find a way to increase that market share-not a way to drive ourselves out of business. </PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="The PRESIDENT" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to formally advise the Senate of the retirement on 14 March this year of Mr John Martin Campbell, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter since February 1985, and to extend to him publicly the deep appreciation of the Parliament for his service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Campbell, who was born in Brisbane, began his reporting career with the Queensland State Reporting Bureau in 1953. In August 1960 he joined the Parliamentary Reporting Staff in Canberra as a reporter and was promoted to senior reporter in May 1971, supervisor in May 1974, Leader of Staff in January 1979 and Assistant Principal Parliamentary Reporter in May 1981. As I have mentioned, he became Principal Parliamentary Reporter, the head of the Hansard department, in February 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout his long career with the Commonwealth Parliament, Mr Campbell earned the friendship and respect of very many members and senators who served in both Houses over that period. Had the Parliament sat earlier this year prior to Mr Campbell's retirement, the only member of either House who was in the Parliament when John Campbell came to Canberra would have been Tom Uren, the honourable member for Reid.</PARA>
<PARA> Hansard reporters are frequently the chroniclers of history, and during his service with Hansard Mr Campbell reported many momentous events in the Parliament, both in this building and in the provisional House. He observed seven Prime Ministers-Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon, Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke-and recorded the historic joint sittings of the Parliament following the 1974 double dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Campbell also witnessed the growth in the number and scope of committees of this Parliament. Early in his career he travelled throughout northern Australia on an inquiry into Aboriginal matters and subsequently travelled throughout Australia and Papua New Guinea with a diverse range of committees.</PARA>
<PARA> As head of Hansard, Mr Campbell represented the Commonwealth Parliament at the annual conferences of the Australasian Hansard Association and the Commonwealth Hansard Editors Association.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout his dedicated service to the Parliament Mr Campbell ensured that the other aspects of human endeavour were not neglected. He has always been active in his church and committed to his family. Not surprisingly, given his Queensland origins, he is a keen football follower, but `converted', so to speak, to Australian Rules football during his period in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of all honourable senators I wish Mr Campbell a long, enjoyable and productive retirement and sincerely thank him for his untiring efforts for this Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! As this Senate term of the Thirty-fifth Parliament draws to a close, I wish to make some brief remarks about what has been a momentus three years both for me and, I am sure, all honourable senators. I would also like to take this opportunity again to pay tribute to the honourable senators who will not be returning when the new Senate takes its place in August, and note the departure of some other well-known faces during this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been many highlights in the last three years that can never be duplicated. I include amongst those the opening of the New Parliament House on 9 May 1988 by the Queen, the emotional farewell to the provisional Parliament House on 2 June 1988, and the first sitting in the new building. The move up the hill was one fraught with difficulties as daily more and more problems emerged that had to be dealt with. The actual achievement of that move was a milestone in removalist history and the officers of the Senate responsible did a great job.</PARA>
<PARA> In September 1988, the facilities of the New Parliament House were tested to their limits when we hosted the annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) Conference, which was an unqualified success. There were 43 Commonwealth countries in attendance with 400 delegates. As President of the CPA, I was proud to be a part of such a memorable event, and of all the staff involved in making it possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the bicentennial year, Canberra and this building played host to a constant stream of royal visitors, heads of state and other foreign dignitaries representing many nations and parliaments. This continued throughout 1989 until today.</PARA>
<PARA> The building and its occupants are, I believe, feeling quite settled now, although it has been a time of great change for all of us. The administration throughout this period has not been easy as there is always a large amount of resistance to change. Yet change has been a recurring and dominant theme in the past three years, both in our small context and in the world at large. It has been a personal highlight for me that I have been in this position of President of the Senate in these times. Leading the parliamentary delegation to eastern Europe in 1989 at an historic time of social upheaval and representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in southern Africa earlier this year at the same time as historical change was occurring there were fascinating experiences for me.</PARA>
<PARA> In turning now to our honourable senators who are departing, it must be said that they too were part of history. Senators Hamer, Black, Devlin, Morris, Puplick, Sheil, McGauran, Macklin, Jenkins and Dunn will not be returning in August and they shall all be missed. Keeping in mind that there are different reasons for their departure, I think, and hope, there are some we will see back in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past Senator Chris Puplick and I have played Senate musical chairs. Three times I was on the Senate ticket in what I call the death spot. Twice I won, once I lost. But I returned, as I am sure Chris Puplick will. I will miss your contributions in the Senate chamber, Chris. Your departure means that the Senate will be deprived of one of its most erudite speakers and spirited debaters. I also greatly appreciated your bipartisan support on the bicentennial visit to the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> I think Senators Black and Jenkins will be back also. Senator Dunn, your career as a senator began in unusual and colourful circumstances. In your relatively brief time here, you have been an industrious worker for your constituency. I know I will miss your interpreting skills when delegations from the Soviet Union arrive.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Glen Sheil will be sorely missed, particularly by the Senate tennis team, and me-by the Senate tennis team, because without him they face the prospect of losing to the members of the House of Representatives, and by me, because as the Senate Presiding Officer it will be my shout if we lose again.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran, you will leave this place knowing you have a major claim to fame in your achievement of having had your private senator's Bill, the End of War List Bill, passed by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray Devlin has been a great friend to the workers in this building as a dedicated shop steward. His farewell presentation from the Senate staff yesterday was a touching one and a measure of the high esteem in which he is regarded.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin, I will miss your expertise on the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, particularly with regard to the Parliamentary Information Systems Office services. Such a weighty contribution will be hard to duplicate.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to Senator David Hamer, my Deputy President and Chairman of Committees for the past 3 3/4 years, you have been a tremendous source of support and assistance at all times to me. Your service with Senate committees over 12 years has been prodigious and in your own right you have been a great reformer within the Standing Committee on Standing Orders and its successor, the Standing Committee on Procedure. You will be sorely missed.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish all honourable senators the very best in whatever their respective futures hold.</PARA>
<PARA> During this Thirty-fifth Parliament, we have also farewelled a number of other distinguished honourable senators, in particular, a number of Senate leaders. Earlier on, we saw the departures of Senator Susan Ryan, a well-respected Minister of this Government and great friend, and Senator Arthur Gietzelt, who had served the Senate for 18 3/4 years. More recently, Senator Fred Chaney left us for the other House. Senator Janine Haines, Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator John Stone, Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, Senator Messner and Senator Sanders all retired.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed that 1990 is not remarkable historically for the turnover in senators. But the number of resignations at the time of the election was unprecedented.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of officers of the Senate and the Parliament were also farewelled during the life of this Parliament. The previous Clerk of the Senate, Alan Cumming Thom, retired in 1988 after 33 years in service for the Department. Tom Wharton, Clerk Assistant, Bert Cooper, the Principal Parliamentary Attendant, who joined the staff of the Parliament 40 years previously and was given the membership of the Order of Australia on Australia Day 1990, and John Campbell, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, who retired in March this year, were also farewelled.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as is customary and deserved at the end of a session, I would like to express my appreciation and best wishes to all those who play a role, no matter how big or small, in the day-to-day functioning of this building and my office. In particular, I would like to thank all the senior Senate staff who have given me so much guidance and assistance over the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA> As President of this Senate, the past three years have been hectic, exciting, often frustrating but overall extremely rewarding ones. I have greatly appreciated all your support and look forward to seeing you back in August.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would like to join you in paying the Government's respects and good wishes to John Campbell and Bert Cooper, whom you mentioned. Apart from that, I would like very briefly to say a few words about, generically, the 15 honourable senators who are retiring either voluntarily or involuntarily. I have the advantage of a reasonable education-if I am wrong, Senator Puplick can correct me for the last time-and there is a line in Tennyson which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>And may there be no moaning of the bar. </PARA>
<PARA>When I put out to sea. </PARA>
<PARA> What about:</PARA>
<PARA>Break, break, break,</PARA>
<PARA>On thy cold grey stones, O sea!</PARA>
<PARA> These are called the valedictories. Valedictions mean bidding farewell. At other times we have condolences which express sympathy. Some of us have a different view of it altogether and think, `You who are leaving shall not grow old as we who are left grow old'. But it depends very much on one's subjective point of view whether this should be a valediction or a condolence. For some people, this provides the first opportunity for an interface between the public and the private sector. I do not think it is as bad out there as some people say at Question Time and at other times in Senate debates. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose in the Senate there is a strange sort of fellowship. We have very different points of view. Sometimes I think that the Senate is one of those places where social and cultural life could only be improved by nuclear war or something of that kind. I think we all feel that from day to day. On the other hand, because we are sort of potential recipients of an isolation allowance or something because we are here in Canberra, we do, I think, develop some fellowship and respect for each other as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to say a few words in that light about some of the honourable senators who are retiring. First of all, I would like to mention Senator Hamer. He has been Deputy President and Chairman of Committees under this Government for the past eight years and I think he has carried out those tasks with fairness and distinction. He has helped greatly with the smooth running of the chamber and made many speeches about deficiencies in coastal shipping and the waterfront which I almost know by heart now but I am not sure that we all know the answers. Generally, in terms of his fairness and the distinction with which he has behaved here, he has introduced a note of what I might call wardroom mahogany into the Senate over a number of years, and I personally appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner, of course, is not here at the moment but I mention him second because he represented South Australia for 14 years, was a Minister in the Fraser Government and served for a long time on the Opposition front bench. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil represented Queensland from 1974 to 1981 and again from 1984 to 1990. If I am noted for being one of the shortest Ministers in the Hawke Government, I must say Senator Sheil was one of the shortest Ministers in the Fraser Government, having served a term of only a few days. I will miss him particularly because I think in recent times he has exerted a great deal of intellectual discipline on Senator Boswell, and I worry about the National Party of Australia without that guiding hand, which has had a lot of experience in this place. We will have to see what happens in the Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick, whom I mentioned at Question Time yesterday in appreciation of his understanding and use of the English language, has, if I can put it this way, always added colour to this chamber. It is sad in a sense-although the Australian Labor Party is not deeply distressed about the fact-to see somebody who has been a bright flower here cut down before the flower fully came to bloom. I hope he will be back-not at the expense of the Labor Party, of course, but at the expense of one of the people up the end of the chamber. Of course, if Senator Puplick does come back, I shall not be here so he will have the last say. I am reminded of a funeral a few years ago which I attended compulsorily, representing the Government. John Gorton was there and I said to him afterwards, `When you die I will come to your funeral because I want to, not because I was sent'. He was then 73. He said, `On the country, John, when you die I will come to your funeral because I want to'. Senator Puplick, in that sense, will probably have the last say. I hope it it is not in a condolence motion, however. </PARA>
<PARA> The President has referred to Senator McGauran and his distinction in having a private member's Bill passed. He has also been important in seeing that Ron Boswell does his job, and I hope he will not be missed too much either. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say a special word about Senator Macklin. I do not like using dirty words in the Senate but Senator Macklin, I suspect, is a genuine moderate. Over many years he has contributed sensible, genuinely moderate and informed views to debate in the Senate, and I think he has done that with integrity and in a very forthright way. Even though he is a Democrat, I think he has been been quite influential in the Senate, and I must say that I personally will miss him. I thought he was one of those who added discipline to an otherwise undisciplined group, and I think that is important in any party and any organisation such as the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders, I must say, I have always regarded as a sort of amiable boy scout who for a few years stirred the possum here on environmental matters and is now doing it elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins, who I have not had the privilege of knowing well personally, I think has been a diligent spokesperson for her Party. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Mr President, referred to Senator Irina Dunn's unusual entry into the Senate. I do not think she will be remembered for that so much as for the fact that while she has been here she has been the resident threat expert on all issues. There is some expression that if there is a mess-up or a conspiracy, it is sure to be a mess-up. Senator Dunn has always subscribed to both theories, I think: it is either a mess-up or a conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention three of my own colleagues. Senator Black will be very much remembered for his chairing of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and the recent drugs in sport inquiry. Senator Ray Devlin, who has already been referred to, I think has been a great committee man in the Senate, especially on the Select Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I think he performed the sorts of functions you, Mr President, referred to, in a very decent and sensible way, and will be missed. I have not had the opportunity of knowing Senator John Morris well-indeed, none of us have! He was elected in 1984 from the New South Wales Legislative Council and will be remembered, I suppose, for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I want to refer to three others who left the Senate voluntarily to try to become members of the House of Representatives. These are the last three senators to whom I wish to refer. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines was the first woman leader of a national political party. She began her career here in 1977, filling a casual vacancy, and was then elected to the Senate in 1980. I put her in the same bracket as Senator Macklin but in a different way. I think she gave some rigour to the Australian Democrats party. It was my great pleasure-also difficulty-to have to negotiate with her on numerous occasions about government legislation, and in all my dealings with her I found her a very sensible, reasonable and honourable person to deal with. I am glad she did not succeed in Kingston because I had a bet with her that she would not, but I wish her well in any career she is now following. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Walsh has, I think, publicly praised Senator Stone. That is something I would not dare to do but Senator Walsh has always been more courageous than I have on those matters. Senator Stone is one of the few public servants who have had a career in politics. He brought with him a refreshing vigour in this chamber, and he took it with him when he contested the seat of Fairfax. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but not least, I would like to pay tribute to Fred Chaney. I said of Margaret Guilfoyle when she left in 1987 that we had enjoyed a mild flirtation across the chamber over many years. I cannot say that about Fred. One of the greatest political enigmas of this period of politics will be the question why Fred left. He said it was because of me, that he just got bored being opposite me for seven years. But once again, although we both probably got bored, we developed some mutual respect and friendship. Of course, he is the only person to leave this place and succeed in winning a House of Representatives seat, and I personally wish him well in that career. </PARA>
<PARA> A distinguished or, depending on your point of view, undistinguished Prime Minister of Great Britain, Harold Wilson, once said that politics is like a game of musical daggers: it is disastrous to get caught holding the last dagger when the music stops. For some of our colleagues the music has stopped and I wish them well as I do others who will be continuing in politics. As I said at the beginning, I think in spite of all our differences and the perverse environment in which we live and work-I am not referring to the building, although I could be-there is an atmosphere of fellowship here which is seen on occasions like this. So on behalf of my colleagues I wish all those retiring the best future that is possible for them, whether it be in another career or in retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also briefly on behalf of those on this side of the chamber wish to use this opportunity in a formal way to say farewell and good luck to a number of colleagues who are leaving us at the end of this parliamentary session. Before doing so, I also wish to join with you, Mr President, and with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in thanking all of those who serve the Parliament and who serve us and who do their best to try to make our lives a little easier in this somewhat difficult and frustrating environment. I particular join with you in wishing well Mr Campbell and Mr Cooper after their very long service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Government said, some 15 senators are leaving us on this occasion. It was interesting to have heard tonight that it is not out of the ordinary. It seemed a great number to me. But on our side of the chamber there are some seven and they will be sorely missed. I also wish to take a few moments, if I may, just to make particular reference to a number of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not chosen any particular order, but I would also like to start with our good friend, Senator David Hamer, particularly for the enormous contribution that he has put in over a considerable period of time but particularly in recent times in his role as Deputy President and the reforms that he has brought upon us that some are looking forward to with enthusiasm and some with less enthusiasm, after our very recent experience. David Hamer, during his time in the Senate, has been committed to the institution and to improving it and enhancing it in the public eye. That is something for which I believe we should be grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Liberal, I am also grateful for the contribution that he has made to politics on my side generally, both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. His well-crafted speeches on coastal shipping have been referred to, but he has made a contribution in so many other areas; I think particularly of defence-as a former distinguished naval officer that is not surprising-foreign affairs generally, and a number of different areas. He has a right to be very proud of his contribution as an Australian parliamentarian. Certainly we on this side of the chamber, and I am sure all senators, are proud of the contribution that he has made. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, still in no particular order, I refer to my very good friend, Chris Puplick, who was twice elected to this chamber. David Hamer was once in another chamber and came back here. Like the Leader of the Government, I have little doubt that Chris will return. No-one doubts his skills as an orator. No-one doubts his contribution as a parliamentarian and certainly no-one on this side of the chamber doubts his contribution as a Liberal. We will miss you, Chris, as you are going to depart the Senate for a while, but we do thank you for your efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we might have found the environment debate somewhat difficult in the last election campaign, when I think of Chris Puplick and the environment or the arts or any of the other areas to which he has been particularly devoted, I must say he has done his bit to enhance those particular areas of interest for the benefit of all Australians. That is something of which he can be proud and for which we should be grateful. So we wish you well, Chris, and look forward to your early return. </PARA>
<PARA> Glen Sheil has been mentioned. You may not know, Mr President, that Glen and I shared breakfast for a long time in this place. After his morning tennis Glen would order his breakfast before he left his room and expected it to be on the table as he arrived. He struck up a special relationship with the staff and they made marmalade for him to his particular recipe. It was all part of a rather friendly routine by which one could start what sometimes did not end up as a friendly day. I will miss Glen and his fine and wise counsel. I think many others in this place will probably miss his medical skills as well. But he has made his contribution. Glen, we wish you well in your retirement from this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Julian McGauran has been mentioned. It is hardly worth mentioning Julian as there is no doubt he will be back because we have given him a guarantee. Chris Puplick might say that some get special advantages. If it is not unkind to say so, I can tell the whole chamber that Julian is in fact learning because he is here tonight, and that is without the bells ringing! So, Julian, we look forward to your return and to your making a contribution to your party and our side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Tony Messner, of course, left a little while ago. I came after Tony into the Senate from my State. Tony possessed fine political skills. I guess he was a little unlucky in some ways in that the time in which he was high in the pecking order in our shadow ministries were the years in which we were losing elections. That is part of the luck of this business, it seems. </PARA>

He is going to be down in Melbourne, I gather, and perhaps if Peter retires, as some suspect, he will go back to the tractor and they will engage in their intellectual economic tussles through the media with their respective columns. John Stone we similarly wish well in his future, whatever that might be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fred Chaney was referred to and, of course, in succeeding him in this job I want to make particular mention of our appreciation of the leadership he gave on this side of the chamber. He showed a determination to get to the other place and he ultimately succeeded in that ambition. We trust that when he looks back in years to come he finds that the decision to move was a good one because in many ways his qualities seem to us to be the qualities of a senator. Certainly his contribution as a Minister and as leader of our side in opposition are appreciated and recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Australian Labor Party side, Senator Morris is leaving. I have to agree with the Leader of the Government, I do not know Senator Morris well either, but I read in the papers that apparently he has other interests, so he will probably not be struggling in his retirement. I also read that he has been in ill health, so I hope that he recovers his health quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Devlin, again, I did not know well. It is interesting to learn upon his retirement the role which he played as shop steward for the staff in this place. You may have heard the interjection from someone on our side of the chamber that you might have played the same role for senators. I suspect later tonight they might be calling for some assistance to help them in their remuneration packages and other benefits. We wish you well in your retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Black, I understand, is another one who has some sort of understanding that guarantees his return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not in the Labor Party? We recognise his contribution. As someone else said, the drugs in sport inquiry, for better or for worse, will probably be his contribution that is remembered most in years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin, I guess, is someone to whom I was really quite close because of the similar sort of work we have done here over the last seven, eight or nine years. I will miss his dedication to the task and, I think, his intellectual contribution as well. I hope he takes this in good spirit. Like all Australian Democrats, he has taken himself very seriously, I might say. Nevertheless, I think he can look back on his contribution to the Senate with pride also. He is interesting in that he is one of those rare occurrences of a senator who seems to be retiring in his prime. It is probably a good lesson to all of us to remember that there is another life out there that is worth while, with new challenges, and not to become fixed in this place or to believe that it cannot exist without us, as seems to be the belief of so many.</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose my closest contact with Senator Jenkins was when I was shadow Minister for the Australian Capital Territory. We locked horns on such issues as the casino and self-government. If I have to make a concession at the moment I will. I now agree that the d'Hondt system has not worked particularly well, not that I think her proportional representation would have worked any better. We wish the honourable senator well in her retirement from the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines, of course, being a South Australian, I knew well. She brought a certain flair to this chamber. I still find it difficult to believe that she is not going to seek political office again. Nevertheless, that will be interesting to follow. She took the plunge to take the Australian Democrats into the big league and was unsuccessful in doing that. But, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate said, she will certainly be remembered, particularly for the fact that she was the first female leader of a major political party. We send to her our best wishes. </PARA>

Nevertheless, she believed that she had a message that was important to put down. The Parliament is a forum that gives all honourable senators the opportunity to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate the National Party of Australia with the remarks given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill). There have been a lot of comparisons made about the Parliament. Senator Button compared it with a boarding school. Other people compared it with different things. I always think of it as a bit of a battlefield; some lose, some win, some fall, but within that environment of a battlefield we all share a common interest, and some of the most unlikely friendships are struck up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we leave the Thirty-fifth Parliament, I would like to make a few remarks about some of the honourable senators here whose company I have enjoyed, particularly the senators of the National Party. Senator Glen Sheil leaves the Parliament after a second go. He was elected in 1974 and then returned in 1984. He has been the family physician around the Parliament, and he has been a great doctor. I know that some of the things he has prescribed for me have had instant success, and not only that, but his costs and charges are very reasonable. He does not bulk bill. He has given his services free and gratis to all. He has been a great member of the tennis team. He struck up various friendships around the Parliament. But he is now leaving the Parliament. I understand that he is going into research. It has not been a good year for Glen. He has lost his wife. I know how fond of and dedicated to each other they both were. That is terribly sad for him. He is a strong man when you need some support and he has given me support in the short time that I have been Leader of the National Party. I wish him very well in his retirement. I hope that in his research he comes up with some answers that will benefit the whole of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators-Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone is not with us any longer. I suppose a lot of people would say that there would not be two more unlikely people in this Parliament. I must admit that when Senator Stone got his scholarship to Canberra and to the National Party I stood back and said, `What is happening?' Then I found that we did share a lot in common. We shared a great friendship. I can honestly say that as people from two most diverse backgrounds we gradually came to respect each other. I certainly look upon him now not only as a colleague but as a very dear friend. I am sad that he has left. I am sad that he left in the circumstances that he did. I did warn him. I said, `Don't go down to that other place. You will be looking after potholes and little old ladies' lost dogs. That is not your game'. He did not take any notice of me. He has left and I think he will be a great loss to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think his shoes will be well filled by Senator O'Chee, who has also got a great depth of knowledge. I know Senator Stone welcomed his own replacement by Senator O'Chee who is also going to be a great asset to this Parliament. I know that he also appreciates the help that Senator Stone has given him. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to my good friend Senator Julian McGauran. He will be known for his passionate defence of the wheat industry and the wool industry. He fought like a Kilkenny cat. He never let go. He has been here only a short time but he has left his mark on the Parliament. He will be back in three years. I can hardly wait for him to come back because he is a fighter, he knows what he stands for, he goes out and attacks and says what he believes. His loss will be felt not only in this Parliament but also throughout the rural industries of Australia. They all know Julian and how he stands up for them. When he comes back, he will have learnt a lot. One of the things will have been not to muffle the bells with a couple of pieces of foam rubber. Those things have passed now and he has not missed a division in two years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of other people I wish to say goodbye to-for example, Senator Puplick. I do not know how I am going to explain the coalition's position on the environment if I do not have Senator Puplick to blame. He was very handy to have for branch meetings. We are two people that one would never think would have a lot in common. I have grown to respect Chris's judgment. In fact, he has been one of my advisers. In those great debates we had with Senator Richardson on the Ravenshoe issue, Chris and I had to `tic, tac, and, delicately, toe' the party line on the environment issue. He was a great help to me. Chris, I will miss you. You have been a good friend to me and I hope you come back because you give a great depth to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner has gone to better fields. I know that he has now gone into business. I wish him all the best. Senator Hamer has given great service to this Parliament as Chairman of Committees. We will miss him also. Senator Chaney has gone, but not very far. He will be around. He is only across the corridor and we still have his friendship in this Parliament. Senator Black, one of my Queensland colleagues, entered Parliament with me. We ran for the Senate together in 1984. He has served Parliament well with his committee work on drugs in sport. I think that has opened up the debate and made a very worthwhile contribution to sport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Devlin and I shared a lot of committee work as we belted around all over Queensland and the northern part of Australia on our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission committee work. He is a great guy too. In my speeches I often said that Senator Devlin was the only worker in Parliament, the only one on the Government side who had ever picked up a tool in anger. He is a good representative of the working people. He, too, will be missed because he is so friendly with the people that work around this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin and I have pulled off a few coups in our time on the fishing and sugar industries. If he would just lift his game on the environment a bit and not go over the top, we would have a lot more in common. I have enjoyed sitting next to Senator Macklin, not only this time around but also in a previous Parliament. We have also become very good friends. Senator Sanders has gone. That is a relief in some ways because he used to scream down my microphone. Senator Jenkins is also leaving us. Senator Haines has gone. I do not know that she will stay out of Parliament. She will probably have only a short sabbatical and come back again, too. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish these people all the best as they go into a new era of their lives. Some will go into business and some will come back into politics, but in whichever direction they head we wish them the best on their retirement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking for the Australian Democrats tonight to associate myself with these valedictory remarks because, in fact, our present Leader is also a leaver tonight. No doubt Senator Macklin will have his time a little later tonight, but it falls to me to associate myself with these remarks on behalf of the Party. It seems interesting that the number of senators who are leaving or who have left in the course of this Parliament is not considered a particularly large number. I will go home tonight and reflect on the fact that we seem to have a high turnover of people in this chamber during the life of the Parliament. Those people are all people that we get to know in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention Senator Hamer initially because I was for a time a member of the panel which helped keep your seat warm, Mr President, when you were off on matters of importance which keep this place running. As Chairman of Committees, Senator Hamer looked after the panel of Acting Deputy Presidents and Temporary Chairmen of Committees. I just want to say that Senator Hamer has great Christmas parties, and I thank him for inviting me to the one which occurred after I had retired from that position. Having a long and distinguished career in politics, he will be missed in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first came into this place I remember being absolutely fascinated with wondering what colour Senator Puplick's matching tie and rosebud would be. I think that, in moving up here from down there, one of the greatest losses we have all suffered is that Senator Puplick has not been able to carry on that fine and very colourful tradition. If I were Senator Puplick, I would not come back until they get up here a rose garden like the one at the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone was quite a sparring partner for many of us in this particular spot in the chamber, but I recall with some pleasure a dinner at Mr President's table at which Senator Stone and I swapped some really interesting stories and quotations from A. A. Milne, of whom we both appear to be aficionados. I also remember Senator Stone particularly for the long hours of detailed work poring over the language in committee reports. I served on a number of committees with Senator Stone. Of course, he was one of the many leaders in this place who went during this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to mention Senator McGauran because-this is official-he and I, according to his words, marched arm in arm to Warracknabeal to defend the wheat growers of this country. Senator McGauran has a chance to prove something to all of us-that there is such a thing as an iron-clad guarantee in politics. Good luck, Julian. I perhaps knew Senator Messner best as shadow Minister for communications, a position he held for a very brief period. I would like to thank him because during that period, for some reason or other, the Democrats were able to achieve some fairly significant amendments to communications legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney was a distinguished leader in this chamber. I must say that I was always fascinated by the story about where Senator Chaney finally would end up. He has made a slight move and, I must say, I was quite taken with Senator Boswell's interpretation of that move. As I said, in this chamber it is interesting how many of our leaders seem to have moved on during the life of this Parliament. One of the things that is really odd is to hear Senator Chaney referred to so often in the media as Mr Chaney. I always get the feeling that somebody has got it wrong. Then I say to myself, `No, that's right. He is across the other side now'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Black, as others have said, has made his mark recently with his committee work. In fact, I first met Senator Black before I was a senator on a briefing for a political exchange program when both of us were intending to go the United States. I did not go on that trip. The two-day briefing was fun; I am sure that the trip would have been also. It was not that I did not want to go on a delegation that Senator Black was on. It was simply that there was a by-election in my State which caused me to stay home. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first came here, for many weeks I actually thought that Senator Devlin was a member of the transport office operation. It is clear that he has a great rapport with the genuine workers around this place. I have worked out that he is not a member of the transport office. My stint in the chair helped me to learn who everybody was around here. I must say that, even then, I always had to look Senator Morris up on the little list that they put inside the President's seat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are farewelling tonight more than our fair share of senators and very many more than our fair share of leaders. Norm Sanders is gone, but not to be forgotten. I have mentioned Senator Puplick's colourful contribution. Norm Sanders's contribution was colourful in both a physical and verbal sense. I am sure that he will never be forgotten in this place. He will certainly not be forgotten by the Australian Democrats. He made a major contribution to bringing grassroots politics into a chamber that has found that very difficult to cope with. He never made an apology for that. I think he earns our respect for that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also already farewelled our first female parliamentary leader in this country, Janine Haines. It was difficult at the end of the last year for us, and also for others who were known to be planning to move into the House of Representatives. We were never sure whether we would come back here, and the end of the last Budget session was difficult for that reason. We did not want to say goodbye from the Senate, we did not want to say that there was a danger that we might be saying goodbye from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Janine has made a major contribution to the Senate, and many people in this place have indicated their view on that score to me. She was engaged in significant negotiations and discussions on a regular basis with people from both sides. That is not an easy task for anybody, and Janine handled the task with distinction. Whether Janine chooses to make her future mark in our community through politics or through some other method, I am quite sure that she will continue to be what she has been in the past-a major contributor and a significant role model for young women. </PARA>
<PARA> We are farewelling another leader tonight in Senator Jenkins, who has been our Deputy Leader in this session of Parliament. Jean has already been acknowledged as a great grassroots politician, as a person who has battled for her constituency and the people in it who can find no-one else to fight their battles for them. She will be sadly missed as a Western Australian parliamentarian for that reason. In the short time that she served us as Deputy Leader, her skills as a human, kind, fair and just person have shone through. I was very pleased when Jean came into the Senate. It brought to this place three women, all of us whose names begin with the letter J. In the Party, it began to seep in that if you wanted to win preselection, you almost had to be a woman whose name began with J. </PARA>
<PARA> Jean and I have shared a friendship. I respect Jean as much as I have respected anyone in my life. She served as ombudsman for our Party in Western Australia for a time before she came to this place. In the Western Australian Democrats at that time, that was not an easy task. She has a great sense of justice and finely tuned antennae for injustice where it occurs in the community. Jean has been a strong parliamentary performer. We will miss her, but we are entirely persuaded that this is merely a temporary absence and that Jean will be back here sitting with us in this chamber again in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also losing our leader. It is very careless of us to lose three leaders in one parliamentary session, but never mind. It has already been said that Michael Macklin is one of those rare creatures who leaves politics and Parliament on a voluntary basis. And he is so young, too! He is younger than I am, which is fairly disgusting. He has contributed in a substantive way to the work of this Parliament. When Michael began in this chamber, he said he would serve only two terms of office. Mind you, he has faced four elections. It is rough trying to get two Senate terms without going backwards and forwards to the electorate. Michael has been successful against all odds in Queensland at those elections that he has contested. Michael is showing us that there is a life beyond politics, and we wish him extraordinarily well. </PARA>
<PARA> Michael is one of those people-there are one or two others around here, too-who actually believe that the Senate is the centre of the universe and that the whole universe should be run from here. That is why he has made so many significant contributions. We should all realise that he has also laid a fair number of landmines around the place during his term here. Those of us who remain in this place will either have to dodge those landmines or get in and disarm them. We will all be pondering about some of those contributions which Michael and his colleagues from both sides of the chamber have made out of their belief that this is an important place. I have no doubt that his contributions will long be remembered. </PARA>
<PARA> Michael has done a great deal of committee work. Because some of that committee work, particularly in regard to the committees dealing with the National Crime Authority and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Michael has become our resident expert on crims and spooks, and he has a nice line in colloquialisms. The other day I heard him talking about people `grassing' and getting `iced on the pavement'. Senators are used to Michael Macklin's erudite contributions in this place, but it can get fairly rough in the Party room. </PARA>
<PARA> Michael has a couple of other humorous characteristics as well. One is his legendary monetary meanness and the fact that he is a one-and-a-quarter pot screamer. The Queensland division of our Party understands the former very well. At a fundraising party in the then president's house some years ago, entry donations were listed at the door; members $5, guests $10 and Senator Macklin $325. His latter difficulty with handling too much alcoholic beverage has been familiar to his senatorial colleagues, especially if they have been in this place after dinner on occasions. It has always been accepted that he has never been allowed to move amendments after dinner; that has been a Party room decision. Unfortunately, he has sometimes been tempted to do that of his own volition. Sometimes the two characteristics have been defined. His ability to suss out freebie meals is quite extraordinary. On most nights in the dinner break he has been off to one embassy or another to be fed and watered. Likewise, even Senator Hill as shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has not been able to clock up as many overseas trips in such a short time. I counted the number of trips in the curriculum vitae supplied to me by Senator Macklin's office, and found that he had 16 trips in 10 years. I think that is quite good!</PARA>
<PARA> Our Michael is also inclined to a little sexism. One might think that that is not possible in a party like ours, but he had a habit of walking into the staff room of our former leader's office, seeing all the women sitting at their desks and saying, `Oh, there's no-one here'. We forgive him. He is a living example of the fact that you can be a tiny bit sexist and still survive in the Australian Democrats, and indeed move to the great heights of parliamentary leadership of our Party. Michael was a foundation member of our Party in 1977, president in Queensland in those first few years; then deputy national president; and he served on the National Executive of our Party even after his election to the Senate. No other senator who has been elected has been able to match that. He was an able and very loyal deputy to Janine Haines. He was our Party Whip, at the same time, until Senator McLean came in; and he is now our leader, and leaves us as our leader. Indeed, I would remind everybody that he is our leader until 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> We will all miss him in this chamber-not just the Australian Democrats and our colleagues to come on 1 July, who deeply regret the fact that they will not be able to serve here with Michael. We certainly wish Michael, Jenny and their family well. We thank the family for lending Michael to us for all those years. I am sure that my sentiments are shared by many people in this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always very interesting, Mr President, and perhaps a little sad to hear your own obituary, but I must warn those who are giving me an obituary that there is still the rest of tonight and tomorrow in which I can make a couple more speeches and ask a couple more questions. I also warn you of another thing: although my term expires on 30 June, I will remain here as Deputy President until you get around to electing another one. During that time as Deputy President, as far as I can gather, I will be responsible to no-one! That might be quite interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On these occasions it is important to give thanks to everyone who has made it possible for me to perform as a politician. I want very quickly to go through the list of those who have helped me so much. First of all, there is my staff-as Deputy President and as a senator. What you are as a politician is very much dependent on your staff, and I thank them. My colleagues have already said farewell, but they know how I feel about them and how much I will miss them. The parliamentary staff are an enormous support to all of us. I particularly wish to mention the transport staff. I live about 12 miles from here and in order to get to my home I have to cross one river, the Murrumbidgee, and a creek. The Commonwealth car drivers nobly battle there. This morning-I think I was the only member of parliament to experience this-I arrived after crossing the Murrumbidgee, which is in flood, hanging on to the side of a front end loader to be met on the far side by a rather surprised Commonwealth car driver. I do not think many other members of parliament could duplicate that experience! The parliamentary staff have been wonderful to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay a particular tribute to you, Mr President. Our system of having a President and Deputy President from opposite parties is not any easy one. I like to think that we worked well together. I can recall no occasion on which we differed on matters of handling the Senate. I think that has been due very largely to your support and understanding, for which I am very grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also like to point out that you, Mr President, are presiding over what is potentially the most important chamber in the Westminster system. We often talk about the Westminster system as if it were the same as it was in the 1850s, forgetting what has happened and what party discipline has done to the system. Whatever its admirable qualities, the House of Representatives is no longer and cannot be a legislature. It is an electoral college for the Government-a place where the Executive and the alternative Executive fight it out. It cannot be a legislature. If you do not want to have what Lord Hailsham described as `an elective dictatorship', you have to realise that this chamber is the only legislature. That is why I attach so much importance to it. If it is to be a responsible legislature, not controlled by the Government-as it will not be-we cannot do deals on the floor of the chamber. That is no way to legislate. We must use extensively the public hearings of our committee system. That is why I have been so insistent on them and why I have attached such great importance to them. The future of this great chamber lies there. </PARA>
<PARA> People are constantly asking me what I feel about leaving the Senate. That is difficult to answer. I feel a bit like the man who was injured in a road crash and who made claims for very extensive damages. At the inquiry the lawyer put to him that his claims were either grossly exaggerated or totally fraudulent. He said: `I have evidence from the policeman who interviewed you after the accident and you told him that you had never felt better in your life. That is quite incompatible with these very extensive injuries for which you are claiming'. The man replied: `Well, yes, I did tell the policeman that I had never felt better in my life, but you must understand the circumstances. I was in this road accident, my car was a write-off, I was injured and an injured dog and an injured horse were also there. This policeman of yours arrived and examined the dog. He shook his head, took out his revolver and shot it. Then he went over to the horse, examined it, shook his head, pulled out his revolver and shot it. He then came over to me and asked me how I felt. I said, ``I never felt better in my life!''.' So when people ask me how I feel about leaving the Senate and I reply that I have never felt better in my life, they will know that I will really miss you all and this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since Federation, in a nation which has seen many millions of Australians make their individual contributions to our nationhood, a mere 420 men and women have been chosen by their fellows to be senators. I have been honoured to be one of these. When I was first elected in 1978 I was aged 30, the second youngest senator in history. That was a matter of some curiosity. Since then, numerous younger colleagues have come in to this chamber, all of them I think on this side of the Senate. I wish them in particular long, distinguished and, above all, useful careers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In making this, my last speech in the Senate, I am minded to do three things briefly. First, to pay my thanks; secondly, to say something of my own score sheet of public life, like a good professional historian, to write my own version of history before someone else does it; and, thirdly, to look to the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of paying thanks I should not dwell for too long upon these personal tributes and personal thanks, for fear that the heartfelt may become maudlin and that the inability to express my thanks adequately may be all too apparent. First and foremost to my family: to my mother, Barbara; my sister, Deirdre, and her family. I say no more for they know all that there is to be known. Secondly, to my colleagues in this chamber: my friendship spans the entire range of my colleagues, from Peter Baume to Noel Crichton-Browne. And that says something about the meaning of friendship. </PARA>
<PARA> To the ladies among the Liberal senators, in particular, to Margaret, who has whipped me in the nicest possible way, and to Jocelyn and Shirley, who have challenged me on many occasions and then stood shoulder to shoulder with me in all of the fights that we have had for the common cause on our side of the chamber. To Amanda, Kay and Sue whose friendship, hospitality and, in the best sense of the term, familiarity have meant so much. </PARA>
<PARA> I make special mention of two of my colleagues. To Robert Hill, my friend, my parliamentary Leader, and I believe, a person who will be one of the great Foreign Ministers of Australia. To Peter Baume, a friend, a friend and then again a friend. </PARA>
<PARA> I extend particular thanks to my friends and colleagues in the Liberal Party in the House of Representatives. To Andrew Peacock, Don Dobie, Peter Shack, Philip Ruddock and, in particular, Warwick Smith. To both Warwick and his wife, Kathryn, his daughter, Sabrina, whose little picture I treasure very greatly-she drew it for me when I was a guest at their home in Launceston-and to Isaac, his son, whom I had occasion to remark to Warwick bears a very distinguished historical name. Isaac Smith was the name of the first person from the First Fleet to set foot on Australia. He was the able seaman who carried Captain Phillip ashore. </PARA>
<PARA> To my closest personal friend, Greg Hamilton, who in the last couple of weeks has been a great rock and supporter. Finally, and inexpressibly to my staff over the years, Jose Garcia, Jim Malins, Andrew Kirk, Rosemary Yeo, Paul Vieira and Hazel Elliott. Above all, to Hazel, my electorate secretary, who has served with me in the rough times and the smooth, the good times and the bad, the days of celebrations and despair, of sorrow and anger, of triumph and more latterly of defeat. I say to all of them, in the words of the twenty-fifth chapter of St Matthews Gospel, `Well done good and faithful servants'. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the political scoresheet, I came into the Parliament, frankly, because I do give a damn. I care about Australian democracy and the system which allows a pommie migrant, such as I-whose father was thrown out of school at the age of 11, whose mother was never allowed to complete the education which she would have been able to complete, given her talents and abilities-from that migrant background to be able to represent my State, my people and my philosophy in the Parliament of Australia. I care about Australian society, to see it fairer, to see it freer, to see it more just, to see the rights of individuals respected and enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I care about the Australian nation. It is a nation of unique and wonderful character. I think that we, in general, and in particular members of the Liberal Party of Australia, tend to devalue Australia a little by looking too much overseas for our models when the best models are in fact here at home in terms of our art, our intellectual culture and our democratic political ethos. Australia led the world in fair and free elections, the extension of the franchise, and the establishment of a good system of government. Ours is the model for others to follow. We do not need overseas models. We have the best home grown ones. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that I am here because I regard myself as a classical Liberal with liberal ideals to identify, to write about, to preach, to provide and to put into practice. I will give a brief statement, not my own words but the words of Jose Ortega y Gasset, a Spanish philosopher, about liberalism and what it is I have tried to represent. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Liberalism is that principle of political rights, according to which the public authority, in spite of being all-powerful, limits itself and attempts, even at its own expense, to leave room in the State over which it rules for those to live who neither think nor feel as it does, that is to say as do the stronger majority. Liberalism-it is well to recall this today-is the supreme form of generosity; it is the right which the majority concedes to minorities and hence it is the noblest cry that has ever resounded on this planet. It announces the determination to share existence with the enemy; more than that, with an enemy which is weak. It was incredible that the human species should have arrived at so noble an attitude, so paradoxical, so refined, so anti-natural. Hence it is not to be wondered at that this same humanity should soon appear anxious to get rid of it. It is a discipline too difficult and complex to take firm root on earth. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that my personal support of causes in favour of human rights, the legitimate role of gay people and their life styles in our community, the welfare of the Muslim community, my hostility to the regulators, the censors, the philistines and the corporatists have been used against me throughout the whole of my parliamentary life, I have never waivered, never retreated, never resiled and never regretted standing for them. As Martin Luther said, `Here I stand, I can do no other'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that my achievements have not been as great as those of many other senators in the terms of their parliamentary careers. I do look to a few things. I look to the enactment of the Whale Protection Act in 1980. I look to the improvement of the Freedom of Information Act which my friend Peter Durack pioneered and brought into the Parliament. I look to the role that I played and enjoyed playing in defeating the Australia Card and I look very much to the establishment and fostering of the Amnesty International group within the Parliament. I look with pleasure on the steps in which I have been involved in helping to make the Senate work better, to pay attention to some of the technical sides of how legislation is treated and having been kept up to the mark by Harry and Anne whenever it appeared that somebody had to get in there and do it. I look in particular to the bipartisan development of our policy on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and on the parliamentary liaison committee which we established to try to make sure that our system worked. There have been notable failures, and I regret, in many cases, the things that I was unable to achieve. I was unable to achieve justice for individuals, and justice for people like Alex Watson in his campaign to have his name cleared. I regret not having had the opportunity to do more in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Internationally, I make one comment. I hope that in my life time I will see the creation of an independent state of Palestine, living in peace, harmony and security alongside the free and secure state of Israel, so that, in the words of the holy Koran, `kit-e-kitab'-all the people of the book can live together. This is not an impossible dream. In my life time so many of the impossible have become commonplace. So much has moved from science fiction to empirical fact that this too can be achieved. I would like to be able to work to achieve some progress in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow, the last day that I will be here during a Senate sitting, is the anniversary of the death 379 years ago of the Elizabethan poet, Christopher Marlowe. In his wonderful play, Tamburlaine the Great, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not passing brave to be a King,</PARA>
<PARA> And ride in triumph through Persepolis. </PARA>
<PARA>I have had the opportunity to ride through Persepolis and, indeed, the travel which I have undertaken as a member of the Senate has been one of the really great experiences of my life. </PARA>
<PARA> I have travelled to broaden the mind, to deepen the understanding, not as an alleged delegate to some conference or to be photographed in all the right places in all the right company, but essentially in order to expand and to develop that sense of what it is that I can do, that I can understand, and that I can contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, I had hoped to achieve more but this has been denied by our failure in New South Wales to win three Senate seats. Unfortunately, we were the only State to fail to elect three coalition senators. Our vote was substantially below the votes in all other States. We in the Liberal Party will have to do something about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn in conclusion, as I often do in times when I am looking for reference points, to works of poetry. Poetry means a great deal to me, whether it is the poetry of Shakespeare or the King James version of The Bible, or the poetry of Emily Bronte or Pablo Neruda or the Persian greats, like Sa'di, Hafiz, Rumi, Sana'i, and Khayyam. I express what I hope to do in the next few years by turning to Tennyson's poem, Ulysses. Tennyson writes:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot rest from travel: I will drink</PARA>
<PARA>Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed</PARA>
<PARA>Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those</PARA>
<PARA>That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when</PARA>
<PARA>Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades</PARA>
<PARA>Vexed the dim sea. I am become a name;</PARA>
<PARA>For always roaming with a hungry heart;</PARA>
<PARA>Much have I seen and known-cities of men</PARA>
<PARA>And manners, climates, councils, governments,</PARA>
<PARA>Myself not least, but honoured of them all;</PARA>
<PARA>And drunk delight of battle with my peers,</PARA>
<PARA>Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. </PARA>
<PARA>I am part of all that I have met;</PARA>
<PARA>Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough</PARA>
<PARA>Gleams that untravelled world, whose margin fades</PARA>
<PARA>For ever and for ever when I move</PARA>
<PARA>How dull it is to pause, to make an end,</PARA>
<PARA>To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I do not intend to rust. I intend to pursue other interests. When Margaret Mitchell first submitted her famous novel to a publisher they had reservations and, like all good editors, they eventually made changes for the better. One thing they changed was the book's title. Mitchell had originally given it the title of its own equally famous last line-`Tomorrow is another day'. Perhaps it is fitting that I could refer to that novel, one of the world's most loved, published as Gone with the Wind, for, as one of the great talkers of my beloved Senate, so am I. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow is indeed another day and I know not where the wind will blow me, but I do know that I will set my sails to seek advantage. That wind blows in the way which my Tennyson poem describes so that I can say, ` `Tis not too late to seek a newer world', and to do it with the heart of Ulysses-proudly, defiantly and confidently asserting:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not now that strength which in old days,</PARA>
<PARA>Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;</PARA>
<PARA>One equal temper of heroic hearts,</PARA>
<PARA>Made weak by time and fact, but strong in will</PARA>
<PARA>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to thank honourable senators and others who have over the last few weeks spoken to me about my departure from this place, and wished me well. I suppose I was an accidental parliamentarian. It was very much an accidental exercise that I became involved in politics. I was driving to a school to observe some trainee teachers when I turned on the parliamentary broadcast. I and one other person in Australia at the time undoubtedly were listening. I heard Don Chipp's speech on his resignation from the Liberal Party broadcast from the House of Representatives. I found it very moving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Being rather silly, I went home and wrote a letter in which I said, `Good on you' and many other things. Because one always finds it difficult to finish these things, I signed it by saying that if I could help at any time I would. That was the fatal error. About two days later I got a phone call from Don Chipp, who was slightly like Gough Whitlam-one of those mythical figures whom one hears about out in the provinces but whom one does not think are real. </PARA>
<PARA> He was real enough because he landed on my doorstep shortly afterwards and asked me to organise a meeting in Brisbane. Having never been involved in politics, I thought, `Well, I will have a run at this' and so I booked the Brisbane City Hall. I arrived at 6.30, found the keys, stood around and got all the lights on. It was a very large and empty hall with me holding these keys. I thought, `This is a pretty stupid exercise to get involved in', but by half past seven, as some people in here know, the City Hall was filled to overflowing and, in fact, a system had to be set up to broadcast outside into the King George Square. </PARA>
<PARA> I found myself on the stage having to chair the meeting and they said, `You have done such a good job at chairing the meeting you can chair the next one' and get the party going. I did that, and then they said, `You have done such a good job at that you might as well be the first president. Here is all the material we have'. And they all left. </PARA>
<PARA> Within 12 weeks we were fighting both a State and the Federal campaign. We were not successful that time around and so they said, `We are never going to win a seat in Queensland. You can run next time as our Senate leader', at which I said, `Thank you very much'. They said, `You have got some time on your hands. Away you go'. In 1980, after 6 weeks of counting, I was elected to this place. So I came to this place by way of a series of errors which undoubtedly a lot of people have regretted ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time that I have spent here I have tried to follow through the values that were given to me as a result of my Irish Catholic upbringing. Those honourable senators who have had one of those know what I mean. Two of those values are, firstly, a very strong regard for friends and, secondly, an integrity in making sure that what one does one actually believes in. I have tried to follow through both of those principles in this place and I have made some very good friends. I remember Senator Tate interjecting on what must have been my second speech here, saying, `Don't be so pompous'. It was very good advice and I have tried to take it. One of my colleagues showed me a piece of paper the other day which talked about a Chinese herbal medicine which was a cure for importance. I thought it might be a useful thing to give to a lot of new senators. At that stage we probably do think we are pretty important. </PARA>
<PARA> In a way it is a very privileged existence, as honourable senators know. It is a privilege as a migrant to this country to be selected by the people of my State to represent them, not only at one but at two, three and four elections. I will always treasure the memory that the people of my adopted country were willing to place their trust in me to represent them. In the coming years we need to think very carefully about where we are going in that debate. It is something very close to my heart. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made some very good friends in all parties and I shall miss them. I had the unique experience of being able to serve here with Don Chipp. When I got to know him I realised that he was what he actually appears to be. I got used every morning to 20 minutes in the party room hearing Don's latest problem. It was described to us with great verve. There were only five of us sitting around a small table and we were preached at for 20 minutes each morning. It was a rare experience. Don really felt it. He has become a great friend of mine and a person whom I hold very dear. </PARA>
<PARA> Janine Haines, who took over from Don, was a totally different type of person. She was also a person to whom I grew very close, a person whom I count as a very close friend. Norm Sanders, also. It goes on. There are so many people whom one would want to refer to, but there is no time for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank those people here who have assisted me. I have tried to put in. When I was teaching at the university I would say to my students who were going into teaching that there were two things that they had to do: their first task was to be good teachers, they had to do their job properly as professionals; their second task was to be professional people who would contribute to the profession of teaching. They had a task outside the classroom as well as in the classroom. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to follow that through here. I have tried to put into the task that we have in this chamber, which I believe is legislation. That is the central role of this chamber, and a role that this chamber does excellently. Certainly, there are not too many other chambers that can lay a finger on what is done in this chamber during its committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also tried to look at the institution that I was in and contribute to that. Quite a number of motions that I have moved are now embedded in the Standing Orders. I hope that they will be seen as improvements. I have attempted to do other things in politics. Somebody knowing my previous existence said that as I had been a preacher all my life, I probably would not stop. Indeed, after this I will carry on preaching about those things that I hold very dear in this great country. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience there are unfortunately too few people who put in and an awful lot of people who take out. I must admit to having changed my view of politicians entirely. Having been an academic, which was a pretty low form of life, I suddenly got elected as a politician, which was even lower! I have changed my view of politicians; I was wrong. I have met people here who have had the utmost dedication to their country. Although I have not always shared their views I never doubted that they were attempting to put into the country. It is a pity that people outside of politics do not stop and think about that once in a while. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people make sacrifices for us to be able to do this task, a tax necessitated by democracy. As my wife said in an exasperated way to somebody who was probably the 112th person who rang on the day of the last election, politicians are the price of democracy. We cannot have an operating democracy without having people elected to a parliament. When we do that, other people make sacrifices. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my family, which I do not think is any different from the families that most people here have. My family is still young. My eldest daughter was six when I came here. She is now sixteen. Because of the pressures of work here and the pressures of work in the electorate, being the only Australian Democrat elected in the entire State, I spent an enormous amount of time away from home. Many honourable senators in this place relate to that. Only the other day I was looking at my daughter, who is now sixteen, and wondering what happened to those ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the media and others will pause possibly for a moment or two and think about that; think about the spouses. Last year my daughter had appendicitis. I was here and my wife was at home with the other two children. This attack began in the middle of the night. What happens? They are forced to live as single parent families, and we are able to contribute. We do not really appreciate enough what other people put in. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the denigration of political life is such that it hurts not only the individual-most of us who work in this place have fairly tough skins-but also others. My children have come home from school crying because of some thoughtless remark of the teacher. They have read things in the paper about all politicians being better dead. This may be funny; I suppose there is always a good joke to be had. One should not get too serious about it. But somebody does suffer from those types of comments. It would be nice if people once in a while took pause to consider the damage and the hurt that they were causing to the families of members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, I would like to thank all those who have assisted me. I hope I have been able to contribute. I ask forgiveness from any of those people whom I may have hurt during the time that I have been here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, thank you very much for your kind valedictory words. I can remember a time when you were fearful that you would be the shortest serving President of the Senate. Circumstances treated you a lot more gently than they did me. I thank the leaders of all the political parties for their kind words tonight. It is nice to hear them but when you gotta go, you gotta go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill mentioned the members' services staff, who provide the breakfasts and other things. I thank them for the marvellous time they have given me since I have been in the Parliament. They have always looked after me like a prince. I am the world's champion at being looked after. I can take any amount of it. They have done a wonderful job with me. I also thank them for the champagne breakfast they gave me. They have appreciated the coaching I have given them over the years. They finally got breakfast right. I thank them for the lovely present they gave me. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth car drivers were also mentioned tonight. They have provided marvellous service over years and years. I thank them for the present they gave me. Although it is perishable I can assure them that I will appreciate it as long as it lasts. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be forever grateful to the Office of the Clerk of the Senate, particularly Harry and Anne, going right back to the orientation course for honourable senators where we had to learn how to operate in this place. I thank them for all the advice they have given us on procedures, Bills and other things over the years. I thank them for their sentiments and their invitations for the future. I assure them that I will take them up on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the attendants are on strike today but a few are helping here. I thank them for their servility and the help that they have given us over the years. I have always appreciated them. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Whips. I seem to have been whipping around here for years and years. I go right back to Georgie Georges. Margaret Reid and Sue Knowles are a most congenial pair to work with. Gerry Jones, Jim McKiernan and Dom Foreman have made up a very easy group to work with. When we think about it, it is actually the Whips that run the Senate. We should have more trouble than anybody, but we do not. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I can recall, my coalition colleagues and I have had nothing but fun since I have been here. I appreciate them. I have learnt a lot. I have had so many different sorts of colleagues. As mentioned earlier tonight, when I first got here we had some elderly-type senators. The numbers were equal on both sides then. But I had the rattiest group-not mentally, just physically. Quite often it was an effort to get us all in for divisions. Lionel Murphy once threatened that if sometime I could not get them in here he would bang through all the Bills he wanted. So I became an expert at getting into the Senate elderly senators suffering all sorts of illnesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Government senators for all they have done over the years. Early in my life I was advised not to have all of my friends on one side of the House, and so it has turned out. I have some very good friends on the other side. I visit them and enjoy their company. That was a thing which I would never have expected because I thought socialism was akin to some dreadful disease that was catching, and I did not want it to get near me-and it certainly has not done that! But I did learn that not all the good politicians are on one side of this House and not all good policies are on one side either. If you try to consider everything you will probably never decide anything. It has been a rewarding experience to learn those few facts or have them confirmed to me. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I know I have not got any enemies here, except perhaps in the media, but it is not I who is the enemy. If they are my enemy, it is all on their side. They seem to have taken the freedom of the press to the extent of licence without any responsibility. That might make them an enemy but, as far as I know, there may be a lot of people in this place who will be quite pleased never to see me again but I would not classify them as enemies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very sobering moment when you come to consider any achievements you have made since you have been here. Some people come and achieve greatness or have it thrust upon them. Others make a much more modest contribution. I remember talking to the late Bob Katter once and I asked what he felt was the best thing he had done. He said, `It is not easy to get anything done down there but I noticed they could not handle iced water; they never had any iced water in the dining room. So I had to get on the House Committee. After two years I got a resolution through and now you can thank me for all the jugs of iced water on the dining room tables'. </PARA>
<PARA> Georgie Georges, who was mentioned here, was a politician of a little greater stature than he was ever given credit for, I think, but at the end of his career his political fortunes went into decline and he ended up getting expelled from his party and ostracised by them. Somebody said to him one day, `Georgie, you must be terribly disappointed to be leaving the Parliament with such disillusionment after all this trouble'. He said, `Oh, no, not at all; I have had two great achievements'. `What are they?' He said, `Well I was walking across King's Hall one day and I slipped and fell and broke a rib. They thought I had had a heart attack, and they jumped on me and massaged my chest. It nearly killed me; I could not breathe'. He said, `I passed out; they thought I had had another heart attack. I had a dreadful time. So I had to get on the House Committee'. And after quite a while he got a resolution through and there was a notice placed in King's Hall that said, `Watch out-Slippery floor'. </PARA>
<PARA> We can thank Georgie Georges for another thing. One time he was taken short and he was in the senators' toilet and the bells went. Of course, Georgie was at a stage where he could not be really interrupted so he took a punt that it was the House of Representatives bells ringing-and it was not. So he had to come in, and he made an impassioned speech afterwards, apologising, and asked whether House lights could be put in the toilets. Now when you look at the House lights in the toilet you can thank Georgie Georges for that. </PARA>
<PARA> They were the great achievements of Bob Katter and Georgie Georges. When it came to thinking of my great achievements I really could not think of much at all except that the first vote I ever got in the place was to vote against a salary increase, and that is an act--</PARA>

<PARA> I did start the inter-House tennis competition, and I hope that continues up here. It is a little bit more difficult to get to the courts, but if you can have a tournament every session I think it will do the Parliament good. We have seen some funny times during that tournament. In one we got down to needing a decision in the final rubber. It was Bob Hawke and Ian Viner, like a panther and a cobra playing together. It all depended on that. They had to knuckle down and get to work, and they did, and they won, and the Senate lost. I would love that to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned that I was the shortest-serving Minister. That is quite right. When that happened I was rather pleased that beheading had got out of style! I was the only guy who had been to Africa to have a look at it and I got back here and I said, `Look, we had better have another look at this South African bit; they seem to be changing, however slowly. It would be better to encourage them and not obstruct them'. This was not received very well at all and it was not the general view, but I notice it is coming around that way now. </PARA>
<PARA> Also I am relieved that the wool Bill has not got very far at this stage because I did not want to be leaving this Senate with a smoking gun in my hand and a wounded corpse of a coalition behind me. We will see how it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> I have enjoyed the committee work. I have done and seen a lot of things and many places that I would not have seen otherwise, and I have enjoyed that sort of thing. I thank all the committee staff. Rob Alison was actually the Secretary of the first committee I was ever chairman of, trade and commerce. We knew how to give ourselves references in those days. I remember the wine inquiry. Now there is an inquiry! Every Senator should do a wine inquiry. And, I must say, while the Government implemented the recommendations of that committee the wine industry prospered. It was the same with forestry. We actually built up the forests to such an extent that now they are trying to conserve them all. Through the Public Works Committee I have seen places that I would never have seen-and I hope in the meantime been instrumental in saving the country some millions of dollars. I found it was a very rewarding experience and I hope the country did too. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also been on many health and community relations type committees. Health was the reason I got into Parliament. I wanted to see if I could help with the administration of health. But health is in a bigger mess now than it ever was. Perhaps it is time I went out! You cannot even get insurance for your medical expenses now, which staggers me. Anyway, I can leave that to the new ones. </PARA>
<PARA> I had some committee experience in the very early days when Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister of the country and Lionel Murphy was running the Senate. Of course, Lionel Murphy was putting through, from my point of view, a whole deluge of revolutionary legislation on things like trade practices, family law and particularly anti-discrimination type legislation. I was on an Opposition Attorney-General's committee with a whole lot of luminaries like the late Sir Reg Wright, the late Ivor Greenwood and the late Allan Missen. I seem to be talking on too many condolence motions too these days so perhaps it is time to go! Fred Chaney was on the committee, and I think I must have been the nearest thing that the Country Party of those days had to a lawyer so it put me on it.</PARA>
<PARA> The big issue of the day was clubs. Apparently there was a lot of discrimination going on in clubs. They would not let these people into that club and those people into that club, and women did not seem to be able to get into any club. These lawyers discussed this on a high level for about an hour and a half. I had to listen to all that. Then they suddenly looked around and said, `Glen, you have not said anything yet. Have you got a contribution to make?'. I said, `Well, as far as I can see, the only reason you have a club is to discriminate'. They did not seem to think I really understood the issue at all. </PARA>
<PARA> So on we went, and that was all good fun. I just concentrated on keeping them all healthy to get them into the divisions. I was here in perhaps the most dramatic days of this Parliament, and that was when we had to block Supply in the Gough Whitlam days in 1975. I did not ever see that as the rape of democracy. I know that millions of words have been written about it, and it created consternation here and anger there. But I can remember at the time the Senate, I felt, was just reacting to the feelings in the electorate. We had a Prime Minister who was trying to run the country on borrowed money, we were trying to run the country on borrowed money, we were trying to force an election and we were quite prepared to go to the people so we kept blocking Supply. I do not see how it can be said that it is the rape of democracy when an election is called. Anyway, it is in the past now. It is part of history. There are very few of us left here in the Senate who were here in those days. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the new senators on their election and on their maiden speeches. I think we are turning the Senate over to a new lot of safe hands. I wish it well because, as Senator Hamer said, the Senate is approaching a new era. It is the only legislative chamber, but the committee work has developed and expanded to such an extent now that I think the Senate is making a major contribution to Australian legislation such as no other chamber in the world does. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention at this stage our newest committee, the Senate Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills for their referral to committees. That could be the best or the worst thing we have ever done. If we like to work at it, I think we can make it the best thing we have ever done. I wish the Committee and the Senate well. When the founding fathers gave us this Senate they gave us a robust institution. I see it as our responsibility, and now your responsibility, to see that it grows and develops and serves the nation well. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a delight to sit next to Senator Flo for so long. She is a lady with great perspicacity and a wealth of political knowledge and nous, married to an Australian legend. She has a big family and I know all about the grandchildren. I am very pleased to know about those sorts of things; it has been a pleasure to sit beside her. For myself, as was mentioned, I think I will have a holiday for a couple of weeks. Then I want to go on a veterans' tour of tennis. When I get back I will get stuck into medical research. Thank you very much for mentioning Dr Marjorie tonight. The medical research unit is going to be named after her. I wish you all well and thank you very much for a very pleasant valedictory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would very briefly like to make some remarks by way of farewell to this chamber. I depart with some regret, but it is a regret tempered by an appreciation of the heavy toll that parliamentary representation imposes on its practitioners, an observation that I can confirm by merely looking around this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an independent senator I have enjoyed the luxury of voting according to my conscience and judgment, something which it could be argued should be the duty of all senators. But I will admit that at times I would have appreciated the support of a well-oiled and well-funded party machine and the support of colleagues with whom I could have divided the labour involved in following complex legislation in its passage through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Discerning the likely effect of legislation, as opposed to the honourable intent, has sometimes proved too difficult for governments, with all their resources. I would like to thank senators of all three parties in this chamber for their assistance in clarifying for me issues relating to many of the Bills brought before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to congratulate Senator Jo Vallentine on her re-election and express my hope that three successive elections have demonstrated to even the most obtuse senator her legitimacy as a representative of strong community views in her home State. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to congratulate the Australian Democrats on their election success. Honourable senators will remember that several commentators had written them off as a party in decline a few months before the election. I am not sure that I should refer to them as a party, unless as a Clayton's party-I mean this in the nicest possible way-the party you have when you do not have a party, as in this Parliament they seem to have achieved the best of both worlds with a large degree of individual freedom as well as mutual support. I should like to commiserate with the Democrats over the near miss in Kingston, which entailed the retirement of their leader, Senator Janine Haines. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate Ted Mack on his election. I do not envy him his difficult role as groundbreaker in the relatively nasty and brutal other place. The primary vote against the major parties in the last election was about 17 per cent, which is roughly reflected in the Senate result but which resulted in 0.7 per cent representation in the other place. That 0.7 per cent is, of course, Mr Ted Mack. This anomaly could be rectified by adopting the amendment to the Electoral Act that I put before this chamber recently. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the distinction between the chambers of this Parliament because quite often I have been gratified by the spirit in which honourable senators with different political allegiances have worked together in this chamber and in committees on matters of genuine importance. The fact that there are more women here may have something to do with this relative civility. The role of the House of review and the lack of a single party majority may also be relevant. Whatever the case, I am grateful for the fellowship and even friendship I have enjoyed with honourable senators from all sides of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The adversarial format of our Parliament is designed to ensure that all points of view are represented. It is not only a mechanism for sucking the maximum electoral advantage out of every issue. At times I have resented the amount of time spent repetitiously hammering away at particular issues, like the umpteenth matter of public importance on the pilots dispute, while other important issues were ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that opinions differ on what is important and I am well aware of the pressure of business in the Senate, but I would like to thank you, Mr President, and your deputies for your patience and forbearance during my first frequent use of the adjournment debate to raise matters that I believed were important. </PARA>
<PARA> It only remains to thank the many people who have assisted and supported me during my time here-far too many to list in anything but the most cursory manner. Firstly, I would like to thank my running mates in the uphill race during the last election-Peter Prineas and Dr Harry Recher; my staff, past and present; the volunteers who gave selflessly of their time for the often boring tasks they had to perform; and all the supporters of our ticket. I should especially like to thank the staff of the Senate. First among them, the prodigiously informative Mr Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate. Also, the legislative drafting staff, the library staff, the printers, the attendants, the drivers and all the support staff without whom this institution could not operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention here and comment on the professionalism of Mr Munro, the parliamentary draftsman, who, when I asked him to draft the amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act nearly had apoplexy when he thought that, with the introduction of the Hare-Clark system at a federal level, there would be the possibility of many more Independents and Australian Democrats getting into the lower house and anarchy would be loosed upon Australia, yet he still carried out his task with great professionalism, and for that I am very appreciative. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that I have missed something. Perhaps there are deep currents of dissatisfaction or disaffection simmering in the bowels of this vast building. Perhaps at this moment the mob approaches the door of this sacrosanct chamber with sweaty nightcaps and meat cleavers, but if this is the case I have not noticed. My experience has been of unfailing courtesy, efficiency and good humour with a distinctively Australian flavour. </PARA>
<PARA> Having barely recovered from my surprise at being here and having, if not greatness some notoriety, thrust upon me, I am now about to leave. Finally, through you, Mr President, I would like to convey my thanks to all the honourable senators for their various contributions to making the last month a hectic but very rewarding time for me in this place. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with very mixed feelings that I rise to make these remarks in my valedictory speech. I feel in one respect like a condemned prisoner offered one last meal to savour and enjoy with an unexpected choice of menu. I feel also like a person at prayer asking for mercy for deeds done that ought not to have been done and for deeds not done that should have been done. I suppose for `deeds' I could substitute speeches, press releases, press conferences, amendments, notices of motion and questions with and without notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel privileged to have sat in the Senate for these last nearly three years. This experience must be one of the most fast track learning experiences possible. As an Australian Democrat there can be no other way. Today, one makes one's first speech and tomorrow it is one's responsibility to see through a piece of legislation which falls within one's own portfolio area. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of backbenchers in the bigger parties here have said how much they envy our constant and real activity. Apart from the fact that we are obliged, as Australian Democrat parliamentarians, to have a conscience vote every time, we all are members of our own shadow cabinet and involved in all decision making. I feel especially privileged to have sat in the Senate for the last three years and to have played a part in the historical move from the provisional Parliament House to this present one. </PARA>
<PARA> It was expected when I was elected in 1987 that I would work miracles-and on some occasions I may have come close. My main portfolio for the Democrats has been that of immigration and multicultural affairs. In this, I have made what seems like herculean efforts to get both the Government and the Opposition to subscribe to simpler, more understandable legislation than the present mess of pottage. I have sought to argue for humanitarian values appropriate to the area of law that deals with people. </PARA>
<PARA> For some of the time, I also held the territories portfolio, as Senator Hill recently reminded us. Like immigration, this brought me into contact with a passing parade of fascinating Ministers and shadow Ministers-and some, I must say, were more shadowy than others. None more so than the Labor and Liberal spokespersons to whom I spoke about the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) system of self-government. My efforts to help the people of Canberra achieve democracy were not only frustrated by the desire of the big parties to take voting power away from individual voters by party lists but I was even lumbered with the blame for the mess which was created because my amendments were defeated. But then, as they say, that is politics and it is not compulsory to enter the heat of the kitchen. </PARA>
<PARA> As it happened, the people of the ACT showed themselves to be the most alert and cynical in Australia. They were the first to go to the polls and reject the bigger parties. However, the rest of Australia is now catching up. We are already in a situation where there is virtually no such thing as a safe Federal seat and no party which can achieve an absolute majority of the primary vote. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of environmental and animal welfare issues, which I have raised during my three years in the Senate, I must express my disappointment at the lack of progress in several areas. These include: the cruelty involved in the export of live sheep to the Middle East and the failure of this Government to act to protect areas on the register of the National Estate. But on a more positive note, I feel some satisfaction that at last the Hawke Government has agreed to nominate Shark Bay in Western Australia for the World Heritage List. Like Shark Bay, the wetlands of Western Australia are also under threat. Nevertheless, the agreement in September 1989 to nominate 11 Western Australian wetlands in the inclusion on the list of wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention is an important step in this particular direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the House of Representatives who fail to be re-elected simply do not return to sit in the Parliament. Senators who fail to be re-elected are more fortunate with their fixed terms. Thus, I and the others mentioned here this evening who are retiring on an involuntary basis have at least had the advantage of a few weeks in which to attempt to complete our work and to tie up a few ends. I must say that when reviewing the workload that I have undertaken I am truly amazed at how great a workload every Australian Democrat senator carries. We have our own heavy portfolio areas of responsibility. In my case, as in Senator Macklin's, I have also had the responsibility of being the sole Australian Democrat parliamentary representative in my State. I have, therefore, taken on a number of State environmental and social justice issues. I could go through a long shopping list but I think it will probably take too long, so I will not do that. But I note that I have issued some 400 media statements on a wide variety of subjects ranging from Australian Rules Football to the ethics and standards of the football they play in the Western Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that Michael Macklin stole my thunder here because I was also going to talk about the incredible notice that came out from Australian Associated Press headed, `Chinese Herbal Medicine Cures Importance'. I must admit that when I saw that on the screen in my office I immediately asked one of my staff members to push all the relevant buttons and have a look at what it actually said. We found that it was not `importance' at all, but something that I do not know whether it would be useful to people in this place. It was disappointing because I thought medicine for `importance' could be quite useful. </PARA>
<PARA> There are senators here who have seen senators come and go, and indeed there are some senators who have already had the experience of going and making a comeback. In my going I find myself in very good company. We have heard a lot about the others who are leaving at the same time, and all the parties are well represented. It is multi-partisan company-Labor, Liberal and National parties, as well as independent representation. So I leave this Senate chamber in very good company indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also leave the ranks of the Australian Democrats in very good company. Two of my senator colleagues did not return to sit in this new Parliament; that is, former Senator Janine Haines, the first woman to lead a political party in Australia-she dazzled this place and left in a blaze of courage-and former Senator Norm Sanders, one of the most committed conservationists I have ever met, and certainly one of the most colourful ones, too. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but not least, I am proud to be in the company as I leave of Senator Michael Macklin, our present leader. Michael is one of the most respected members of this chamber. I know so because I have been told so by people from all sides of the chamber. Michael's intellectual and oratory skills are an inspiration, as is his wit, although, as has already been signalled to the Senate tonight, we have seen perhaps more of that in our party room that we have seen in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget session people here can look forward to having not seven Democrat senators, as they presently have, but eight. Three senators-elect from New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria will join their colleagues on the cross-benches, and 50 per cent of that number will be women. I confess to a feeling of disappointment that I shall not have the privilege and experience of sitting with those eight people. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have been surprised by some of the bitter, offensive and very personal abuse that has been hurled across this chamber, nonetheless I have found helpfulness, courtesy and good company not only from my Australian Democrats colleagues, but also from members of the Labor, Liberal and National parties and all the four independents. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also publicly to state my respect and gratitude to you, Mr President, for your courtesy and consideration at all times, to all the Clerks that sit in the Senate, and especially to Mr Harry Evans. I found all of you ever ready with knowledgeable advice, as I have all the Senate staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to express my thanks, too, to the Hansard staff, who work miracles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament could not function without our support systems and so I also wish to express my gratitude for all the courteous assistance I have received from the researchers in the Parliamentary Library, the attendants, the transport officers and the Commonwealth car drivers. </PARA>
<PARA> I also publicly express my gratitude to the hardworking, long-suffering and totally brilliant staff members that I have had over the past three years, some full time, some part time. So to Madeleine, Richard, Nick, Barbara and Janine, I say, `Thank you'-and that is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to thank members of the Western Australian division of the Australian Democrats and the many volunteer workers who also work the most incredible hours in my office in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, I must also publicly express my thanks to my husband Brian, who, when my chief researcher requested not to leave Perth for a year while he nursed a family member through a terminal illness, came here and performed that task as a researcher. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone here has to make sacrifices, but so do all of our families, as Michael said. I actually look forward to being able to spend more time with my children and my grandchildren, and I know that they look forward to having a mother and a grandmother who is not dashing off all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not like to depart this place without urging senators, especially those with an interest in the land, to acquaint themselves with the writings of my family forebear, Joseph Jenkins, who arrived at Port Melbourne on 22 March 1869 as a free man at the age of 51. </PARA>
<PARA> Painstakingly, Joseph kept a daily diary for 58 years, including 25 years in Australia. A small part of his work was published by Macmillan in 1975 under the title Diary of a Welsh Swagman. The historian Professor Geoffrey Blainey, in an article in the Melbourne Age in 1984, said that this ranks as one of the 10 greatest books written by an Australian. I commend to honourable senators the pleasure of learning about the adventures of the Welsh swagman and his comments on everything from soil degradation to the Kelly gang to the touring Marylebone Cricket Club team led by W. G. Grace. </PARA>
<PARA> Joseph Jenkins, who made his way as a labourer in this country, was the best farmer of his generation in his native Cardiganshire in Wales. Those modern Australians who take an interest in the natural environment will be quite stunned when they read Joseph's prophetic words about the destructive nature of early Australian clearing and farming practices in the last century. He designed the first combined dung cart and distributor at least 60 years before such an implement appeared on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a famous bard, or poet, in his native Welsh language. At Ballarat, which had a large Welsh mining and farming population, an eisteddfod was held each St David's Day on 1 March. While in the neighbourhood he competed at these meetings on 13 consecutive occasions, capturing the premier prize for poetry in the highly disciplined englyn form on each occasion. While hewing Australian timber, he composed the englyn which has become a motto for the Jenkins family. In translation in the newer language of English, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Tear not crosswise nor hack in twain--</PARA>
<PARA> Glide smoothly along the given grain. </PARA>
<PARA>In its true form in poetic Welsh it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Dellto nid hollti allan</PARA>
<PARA> Dal yn groes, nid dilyn gran</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the spirit of these lines to honourable senators who look for harmony in the affairs of their respective parties and to those who now will embark on a new life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that we are all taking such a long time to retire. I also wish to add some parting comments thanking you, Mr President, and colleagues from both sides of the chamber for their friendship and tolerance throughout my term. There is no doubt that I am fortunate in that, due to the Liberal Party and National Party Victorian joint Senate ticket arrangement, I will be returning. In the ebbs and flows of politics, that is very fortunate. I also particularly thank Glen Sheil for his comradeship over my three years as a senator. He is a very good bloke. The Senate knows that he is also a very humorous man. No-one should underestimate the task he is now taking on-the establishment of a research centre named after his good wife, Marjorie. I think it is a very challenging task and I wish him well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I never like to single out people, but I will single out one more, and that is Chris Puplick. I suppose Chris would not remember, but in the first weeks of my term in Parliament he was very friendly and obliging to me. In the ebbs and flows of politics, I have not forgotten that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also very thankful to have served in the old House. I treasure that very closely. As anyone knows, there have been subtle changes in politics through the change from the old House to the new House, some of them good and some of them bad. I hope to return in 1993. To that end, I should put it on record that my Party some 12 months ago preselected me for that position. So I was no mug, Senator Powell. As far as that goes, I am as close as can be to a stitched up position. But, still, I am not holding my breath. Who knows what the spell will do. I suspect that it is a blessing in disguise.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been quite surprised at what and how much I have learned in my three years. I can hardly believe how much I have learned. Politics gives one great access to knowledge, opens one to experiences and really draws on every human emotion. I have felt that over the past three years. All terms of parliament present challenges to one's ideals. There would not be a senator come through here who has not thought that he has gone through the most important period of the nation's history. Those challenges to ideals usually come under the guise of raw political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not a believer in the adage that you come in with ideals which are eventually knocked out of you by the time you have served a term or two. I think you ultimately hold onto those ideals. If it is good enough for Senator Jenkins to quote some Welsh and, goodness knows, Senator Puplick to quote Tennyson, I would like to draw on my little quote for the evening as a guide to a politician holding his ideals. It is simply a letter published in Time magazine by a citizen, Arthur Goward, which caught my attention. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>We elect a parliament to balance wisdom with the budget and a politician without wisdom is as useless as the language he uses. Fortunately, there is no substitute for spiritual leadership. I wonder if Lech Walesa considers an understanding of fiscal holes and micro-economic reforms of greater value than courage, caring and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>To that end I would like to name two particular Bills that affected my core beliefs. They were the war crimes Bill, relating to the holocaust of World War II and my own private member's Bill relating to the establishment of the end of war list. Those speeches are in Hansard and they capture my feelings at the time. In those times, advice from both sides of the House as a new senator is quite valuable, as Bill O'Chee should find out. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes honourable senators might think that we do not listen as new senators, but it is true that we do. I have had advice from both sides of the House. I particularly highlighted those two Bills because I remember getting advice from both sides of the House on them. I have learnt in this chamber what many honourable senators will already know in the fullness of politics, and that is that a week is a long time in politics. So when you have your own great personal victories they are soon superseded. When you have your great personal failures or mistakes, the fullness of time places them in perspective. Believe me, I have learnt that lesson. It seems to be a very small lesson, but it really is a big step in perfecting the art of politics. I suspect there is no-one today who has perfected that art. Mr President, to state the obvious, I shall return-a little older, but a great deal wiser. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, while we are filling in some time, it is appropriate that I follow Senator McGauran in this debate. Senator McGauran's ancestors came from a place from Cavan in Ireland. In this sense, it is a shame that somebody with such good blood is leaving this place. It is a sad night for us, but there is always a silver lining on a night like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have noticed in the valedictories tonight that a couple of people who are leaving are actually holders of British passports. I will say no more about that. It is a shame that Senator Puplick is leaving at this particular point in time. Earlier this evening the Senate carried a motion about broadcasting the proceedings of this place on television. Obviously, Senator Puplick would have been one of the stars of this place-not only because of the eloquence of his speech but for, as Senator Button says, the butterflies that he wears under his chin. We shall indeed miss them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin was one of the other people who hold British passports. Senator Macklin leaves and I have got some personal regrets about his departure. He was responsible for my not being the subject of a censure motion in this chamber. He actually amended a censure motion against me to include not only the Whips of all relevant parties, but all senators. We do not live with the notoriety like Senator Walsh does on things like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn has only been with us for a relatively short time. In that time she has made quite a name for herself, not only for the issues that she has brought into this place and the consciences that she has pricked in the process of bringing those to our attention; but also she became the parliamentary advocate for another great poetic figure, Bloomsday. </PARA>
<PARA> The last person I want to mention is my old mate Senator Devlin. He has the unique experience of having been the recipient of a gift from the staff of this Parliament.

My departing Australian Democrats colleagues will be deeply missed by those of us who remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To arrive in this place as a Democrats Senator is a unique experience, particularly under the leadership of Janine Haines and Michael Macklin. They are both former educators. Honourable senators are probably aware of the fact that Michael Macklin has a doctorate in educational philosphy. He passed on his educational philosphy to Janine Haines, and they applied it to newly arriving Democrats. It was a fairly simple philosophy: let the bastards sink or swim. In fact, that was the experience that we had as new Democrats senators. I am proud to say that it is by their example that we have managed to swim, and to swim very strongly, we believe. I know that my other colleagues will miss Michael Macklin very much indeed. I have watched him with awe and unbounded respect. I know that that respect is shared by honourable senators on all sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Being a Democrats Whip is different from being a Whip of the other parties. When one goes to count a division, one has a few spare minutes. During that spare time, it has been my custom to talk with the President and Chairman. Honourable senators might have noticed that David Hamer and I often exchange jokes; that is how we fill in the spare time. I was pleased and honoured that David used one of my favourite jokes here this evening. He just borrowed it from me. It was one I was going to use myself. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it did bring to mind another story. It is the story of the lady who overheard a conversation between a rabbi and a priest in a coffee shop. They were discussing at what point life begins. The rabbi insisted that life begins at the moment of birth. The priest rejected that proposition and said that life begins at the moment of conception. They had been engaged in this dialogue for quite some time, and the lady got up to leave the coffee shop and to pay her account. As she walked by the table where the rabbi and the priest had been having this dialogue, she said, `Excuse me, gentlemen. I could not help overhearing your conversation. I can assure you that you are both wrong. Life begins when the children leave home and the dog dies'. It is significant that Michael Macklin has always rejected that proposition. He believes that life begins on 1 July 1990, when he returns to his wife and family. </PARA>
<PARA> Jean Jenkins has been a gentle and tenacious colleague, for whom I have very genuine affection. Those who know Jean know her to be a person of extraordinary persistence. There is no doubt that she will return to this place. </PARA>
<PARA> We already miss Janine and Norm very much. The crossbenches can be lonely and demanding in a special sort of way. Irina Dunn has weathered unique storms with courage and style. I admire her and wish her well, as I wish all others well. </PARA>

<PARA> In listening to some of the speeches and looking around the room, it really came home to me what an interesting and curious place the Senate is. It is a far more interesting place than the A grade, as members call the House of Representatives. If one looks along the conservative and Australian Labor Party ranks of this place, one will see retired farmers that have planted their last seed, retired lawyers who have seen their last briefs, and retired academics-such as Senator Macklin-who have been on extended sabbaticals for the last 10 years. On our side of the Parliament there is an entire raft of union and Labor Party officials for whom the party is now over, defeated House of Representatives members, failed House of Representatives candidates and assassinated party leaders. It is the flotsam and jetsam of Australian politics, lapping gently like a thick red tide on the welcoming shores of the Senate and disturbed-I must say only rarely-by an intrusive swell from the deep green depths of the House of Representatives. It is a very interesting chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess one of the most interesting things about the chamber-and it was mentioned by a number of people here tonight-is that there is a collegiate atmosphere. I say this in a most positive sense about the Senate, despite our political differences. I think this is emphasised by the attidues that honourable senators have towards the people that are leaving the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Of my own colleagues, there is John Black, an assiduous and very hard-working committee chairman, and Senator John Morris, whom I did not sit next to for the last three years, as has already been mentioned by my Leader. I must mention, with some degree of real affection, Senator Ray Devlin, who is an all-round good bloke whom it has been a pleasure to know. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say there are a number of honourable senators not on my side of politics whom I am genuinely sorry to see leaving the Senate. Chris Puplick certainly ranks amongst those. I go back a long way with Chris and knew him before I came to this place. In fact, we were reminiscing about that just the other day. I will not dwell too long on it but Chris Puplick is, I believe, a liberal and, without dwelling too long on it, I think he has paid a very high price for that. Michael Macklin is a fellow `Apple Macophile'-it is not the only thing we share in common-and a person who, like Chris Puplick, has made a lot of meaningful and useful contribution to the debates of this chamber, the committee stage of Bills, and the many Senate committees. </PARA>

I had the impression that Senate committees were largely a waste of time, their recommendations were largely ignored, and they did not accomplish very much. But that has not been my experience in the committees that I have had the privilege to work on. There will be some indelible memories taken out of this chamber by those who are leaving us. Senator Jean Jenkins will no doubt take with her the indelible memory of serving on the Senate X-rated video committee-which is one of the more indelible memories I will take with me from this place, no matter how long I serve here. John Stone was a most conscientious and assiduous committee member who always did his homework and made a very strong contribution to the committee work of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> David Hamer has done a job that all of us have appreciated in the scrupulous way he has conducted the affairs of the chamber while he has been in the chair. I greatly appreciate the many conversations I have had with David about the Senate and the procedures of the Senate in which I know he has had such a deep interest and to which he has made such a lasting contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Glen Sheil is a real gentleman and one of the really nice people in this Parliament that I am very sorry to see leave. Norm Sanders is an amiable eccentric. One of the nice things about the Senate is that we do in fact have people like Norm in here. Again, despite being an amiable eccentric, he was a person who made a real contribution to the Senate committees on which I had the privilege to serve with him. </PARA>

The effect of the Bill, by comparison with the provisions of the disallowed determinations, is to alter the commencement of several of the increases from 1 January 1990 to 1 July 1990 (in other words, there will be no retrospectivity as the Tribunal proposes), to decrease some of the recommended rises, and phase in most increases in two or three stages six months apart. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for linking the basic salary for Parliamentarians to a salary level in the Senior Executive Service of the Public Service-the top of SES Band 1. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, at present there is a linkage between the salaries of Judges of the Federal Court and members of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is proposed that this link be broken and that members of the Industrial Relations Commission have their salaries fixed in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA> Salaries for Judges of the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court and ACT Supreme Court, are increased 6% from 1 July 1990 and 6% from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Salaries of the President, Deputy Presidents and Commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are increased by 6% from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Those for other judicial related offices are also adjusted. Salaries for Secretaries of Departments and Senior Statutory Holders are increased by 19% from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as I have indicated, basic salaries for Members of Parliament are linked by this legislation to the top of the SES Band 1. These consequent increases are phased in three instalments-6% from 1 July 1990 and 1 January 1991, and with the balance of approximately 5% from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of entitlements for Members of Parliament. This includes the option of a private plated car offset by a $6,000 per annum contribution from salary or electorate allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> For Parliamentary Office-holders, Expenses of Office Allowances are incorporated in additional salaries and this total amount adjusted in the same way as salaries of other Members and Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the necessary appropriations. Mr President, the Government recognises that over the past few years there have been substantial changes in the nature and extent of the responsibilities of Judges, senior officials and Members of Parliament, including Ministers. The Government considers, however, that some greater measure of restraint is necessary, reflecting the restraint shown by other groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for these reasons that the Government has decided not to adopt the full range of increases determined by the Tribunal in order that the clearest possible consistency be maintained with wage and salary movements in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, it is emphasised that the National Wage guidelines are completely met by the provisions now included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Remuneration Tribunal reported to Government on increases for Ministers. As with other Parliamentary Office-holders, the Government will incorporate Expenses of Office Allowances for Ministers into their additional salaries and has decided that an ongoing link be established on the same basis as for Parliamentary Office-holders. That is, Ministers are to receive the same percentage increase in additional salaries as Members of Parliament, and phased in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The direct costs of the adjustments proposed (excluding indirect effects on costs of superannuation, etc) are estimated to be approximately $7 million in a full year. These costs are significantly less than would have been incurred had the Tribunal's determination been implemented in full. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Opposition has had only a brief opportunity to read the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1990 and, indeed, a copy of the second reading speech was kindly made available to me by Senator Cook only a few moments ago, I think it would be the desire of all senators to dispose of this legislation as expeditiously as possible. Therefore, I do not propose to move the adjournment of this matter as we would normally do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has been advised by the Government about its proposals to change the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal which has been tabled during the course of this afternoon's proceedings. Although the details of that determination were also made available to the Opposition yesterday, we would normally like to have a little more time to consider these matters than the Government has permitted. However, in view of the imminent rising of Parliament for the winter recess, there is no time to consider this matter any further. Despite this, I would like to register our protest that this matter is being dealt with in this rushed way. This is particularly so as the Government has yet again seen fit to alter the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. These determinations are being altered not only in relation to members of parliament but also in relation to judges, Secretaries to departments, a large number of senior statutory office-holders and parliamentary office-holders. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation extensively changes the Remuneration Tribunal's own determination. It is being changed by the Government for the reason that is referred to in the second reading speech. The reason is that the Government has been consulting its masters in the Australian Council of Trade Unions and it wishes to emphasise, as set out in the second reading speech, that it will not adopt the full range of increases determined by the Tribunal in order that the clearest possible consistency be maintained with the wage and salary movements in the community at large. It is emphasised that the national wage guidelines are completely met by the provisions now included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> That proposal may be well in conformity with the attitudes of the Government and in accordance with its accord. But it is totally contrary to the principles under which the Remuneration Tribunal was set up to determine the salaries of a whole range of public servants, judges and members of parliament. The changes in the case of some of its recommendations are perhaps not all that great. In fact, the differences in the case of the High Court of Australia judges, for instance, are minimal. There have been some fairly substantial cutbacks in the proposed salaries for Secretaries to departments, perhaps even more so than in the case of members of parliament. However, the Opposition is clearly of the view that the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal should not be tampered with in this way by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a recent experience in this Parliament where decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to postage allowances for members of parliament was grossly interfered with in the other direction, vastly increased for naked political election purposes by the Government a few months ago. The ultimate result, as a result of High Court decisions and subsequent debates in this parliament, has been to restore the authority of the Remuneration Tribunal on that matter. The Opposition takes the view that the same approach should be taken in relation to these determinations that we have before us today, namely, that they should be left with the decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal. That is a principle upon which the Opposition feels very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> For many reasons the Opposition has decided that it will not oppose this legislation. It simply wishes to reiterate the firm view that it takes in relation to the proper course of action for governments to take. When all is said and done the ultimate decision in matters of this sort has to be made by the Government. It has to take the ultimate responsibility and it is not for oppositions to seek by some means or other to change that. Therefore, we are going to accept, albeit reluctantly, the decisions that have been made by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two other matters that I think I should mention. The Opposition does not agree with the linking of a parliamentarian's salary with a public service salary, namely, Senior Executive Service band 1. We believe that the Tribunal gave very convincing reasons why the salaries of members of parliament should not be determined in that way. Certainly some people believe that that is a suitable way of dealing with the salaries of members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill certainly seeks to put parliamentary salaries on a permanent linkage. I presume that the Government hopes thereby to avoid further debate about these matters. However, the Tribunal has clearly indicated its opposition to that view. It seems unlikely that this question will be resolved finally by this legislation this evening. Situations may well arise in the future where further recommendations of the Tribunal will not be in accordance with the Government's preferred solution to the question of parliamentary salaries implemented by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter which I would like to have clarified by the Minister and which I have mentioned to him. There is a reduction of several thousand dollars in the salaries of all parliamentary office holders, led by the salary of the Leader of the Opposition, from that recommended by the Tribunal. We appreciate that the recommended salaries for Ministers under the Remuneration Tribunal do not take effect under this legislation but by an adjustment to the Ministers of State Act. That has not been brought in contemporaneously with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I have taken this up with the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, who is at the table, and I hope that he will confirm that there will be a similarly proportioned reduction in the salaries of Ministers of State, that is, that Ministers' salaries will increase in the same way that parliamentary salaries and the salaries of parliamentary office holders increase-namely, by 6 per cent from 1 January until 1 July 1991, when they then become equal to Senator Executive Service salaries. I would like to make sure that that is the intention of the Government, even though it is not included in this package. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I do not want to detain the Senate any longer than necessary this evening. It is a matter of regret that this matter is being dealt with at this hour and in this way. It is particularly regrettable that the Government has seen fit to alter this determination, but the Opposition will not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation we have before us has come about in a most unfortunate manner. The Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 was a brave attempt to get an independent outside body to deliberate on and to make recommendations and finally determinations on salaries not only of members of parliament but also of senior office holders in the Commonwealth. I say `a brave attempt' because from the very start it was sabotaged by various people, mainly Prime Ministers, seeking political kudos for themselves-not only the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) but also previous Prime Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The exercise we are now going through is just another one of those long, sorry sagas. I share Senator Durack's belief that this will not be the end. It will not end until the Prime Minister and the Cabinet take note of the spirit of the Act and finally allow to operate what everybody believes should be operating, that is, an independent outside body making a deliberation and bringing down a determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case there is an extremely long and well-argued introduction by the Tribunal, which earlier this evening suffered an historic rebuff from the Government when its report was disallowed by the House of Representatives. It is a pity that honourable senators and honourable members probably have not had a chance to read through the 32 pages of introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite sure that honourable senators have probably turned to page 32, where the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who is sitting at the table, starts his submission to the Tribunal. It was a submission that was well argued, a submission which has the support of all parties in this place. It was a submission upon which the Tribunal felt it was entitled to rely. The Tribunal thought that this submission was the Government's submission. It had the Minister's signature attached. The Tribunal thought, in terms of talking to other parties in this place, that the Government supported this submission. It thought then that, for the first time in many a long year, it would be able to get this right-it would bring in a determination that was acceptable to the Parliament. So it went ahead. The Tribunal must now be feeling extraordinarily bruised because the Government has again reneged on its submission and because a government yet again has spurned its determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill we have before us has a number of changes. It is a pity that these have occurred. The exercise is not necessarily whether a particular level is one that one would want to argue for. It is the principle that the determination should not be made by this Parliament. The determination that was made is not the one contained in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now back into a situation that the Bill in 1972 was passed to avoid: that is, we are now determining our own remuneration yet again. I think that the principle that applies to all other members of the community whereby they do not determine their own remuneration is one that the community wishes to see espoused. Members of the community do not want us to say that this is what we will get. They want it done by somebody else. They want it done as we have here, by a judge sitting with a group of other people, eminent citizens, making a clear and deliberative determination based on the presentation of facts before them that have been argued. The Democrats do not resile from the position we have taken for a very long time, that is, that this Parliament should agree to the determinations made independently of this and the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some substantive changes outside the changes to the amounts. I do not intend to debate those amounts. As I say, they are amounts which have gone down. We are not upset by the fact the they have gone down. The exercise over time is such that one gives up on that particular worry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a significant change with regard to the linkage. The Democrats have argued strongly in support of this linkage over many years. There are problems with it. The problems were set out quite comprehensively by the Remuneration Tribunal in this report tabled earlier today. Nevertheless, on balance, it would seem that, unless we are willing to go down the track of a fresh determination from scratch which tries to work out precisely what a member of parliament is worth by relating each and every part of his or her operations to the market outside-I think quite frankly, if one did that one would probably arrive at a figure which no-one in the community would wear-the second best option is this one: we seek an appropriate level within the Public Service, which has been the rate of the SES band 1 annual salary, to be the rate that is appropriate for members of parliament. I hope that this is the start of a stable regime. </PARA>

Whatever it is, it is not an edifying exercise; but the worst thing about it is that it is an unprincipled exercise. It is in opposition to what the community is seeking, which is an independent, non-pressured estimation of what these various people are worth and a determination brought down in an independent way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The exercise is relatively clear. Most of the Government members whom I have spoken to do not relish what is going on here tonight. They have been forced into it, as we all have. Senator Durack, who spoke on behalf of the Opposition, and I on behalf of the Australian Democrats wish that we were not talking about this. We have been forced into this situation because there is nothing else before us. The determination was disallowed and this is all we now have. We have not had the opportunity of being able to support the determination of the Tribunal, which we should have been able to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a sorry and unfortunate situation and one which will probably mean that come 1 July parliamentarians will seek to flagellate themselves in public, come 1 January they will do it again, and come 1 July next year they will do it again. We seemingly enjoy this exercise. It is an absurd proposition. It is not a proposition in anybody's interest or of the making of anybody here. That in itself is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting at least one point about the various levels that have been indicated here. If one turns to the Remuneration Tribunal's report one sees that the lowest salaries are for members of parliament. The market dictates every other salary. I take honourable senators back to the time when parliamentarians were not paid and the place was for the rich and the privileged. At the moment it is not like that. Obviously with these salaries, it will not be like that for a number of years. I believe we cannot allow to continue indefinitely an exercise where the elected members of parliament, the people who have to make the decisions and wear the brunt of it, are paid the least. All their advisers and all their staff are paid way above that. Ultimately, it is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very interesting statistics on the movement of the salaries of members of parliament over time. From June 1974 to May 1990, average male weekly earnings in Australia rose by 350 per cent; the consumer price index rose by 315.7 per cent; the standard surgery visit rose by 346.8 per cent; the age pension rose by 443 per cent; and the salary for a senator and members rose by 175 per cent. If everybody else in the community had been linked to us we would have had the best wage restraint policy that Australia could ever have hoped for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I get terribly annoyed about this whole process. Earlier in the day we had to go through the ignominy of having the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who is in the chamber, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Mr Kelty in a telephone hook-up to decide what will happen to our salaries. That is no way to determine parliamentarians' salaries. It would not even happen in Venezuela, Colombia and those sorts of places, but here we have to grovel on the telephone seeking the permission of some total stranger as to what is a reasonable remuneration for members of parliament and how they should get it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This farce has been going on for 15 years now, to my certain knowledge, and I do not appreciate it one little bit. I support the Remuneration Tribunal. It was set up to do a job. There is not one body in Australia that is likely to do that job as well. Why do we not use it? If we are going to keep the Tribunal, for goodness sake, let us support it. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have had this procession of Government members either ringing us up or beating tracks to our doors complaining about their problems with their own people.

<PARA> I agree with Senator Macklin-I suppose this is one of the things that happens at a time when someone will not be with us for long-to a point. When he said, `I would like to think', I think that was a fond hope more than a genuine expectation. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole method of approach on this occasion has been totally unprincipled. We have already been judged by the media. The 9 o'clock news tonight made it clear that parliamentarians had achieved a $65,000 pay level. Are they likely to come out on the 1 o'clock news and say, `We are sorry, we made a little mistake. They didn't get the $65,000 we said they did'? This was only done for publicity and now, as usual, we cop the acrimony and do not achieve the sort of remuneration that the system lays down is reasonable under the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know one member here who is seeking anything more than the Tribunal believes is reasonable. That is all we are asking. That is all we believe it should be.

Senator Macklin was wrong in relation to Doug Anthony. Doug Anthony had the courage to do what Senator Macklin wanted him to do. He arranged with Bill Hayden to accept the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal while Malcolm Fraser was overseas. A week after they had arrange it and we had suffered the barbs of the journalists, Malcolm came back from overseas and rolled the whole Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what has happened here today. I do not think any member of parliament except the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is opposed to this determination. I do not think there would be one. I think that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), also probably supports the determination. The Prime Minister has spoken to Mr Kelty, Mr Kelty has pointed out to him the difficulties of the accord and the Prime Minister has rolled the Executive of Cabinet. Then it rolled Cabinet. Then Cabinet rolled the Caucus this morning. Now it has rolled us and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision tonight is absolutely shameful. I do not believe that anyone will call for a vote on it because I do not think anyone wants to be actually counted in relation to the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1990. This Bill undermines the Remuneration Tribunal totally, and that is the crucial thing. What we are doing here tonight is shameful because we are undermining this independent body. We have asked it to do a job. We have given it the responsibility of doing a job. It has done the job. As Senator Macklin said, it even had a Government submission where it thought, `At last we have got a Government that has got the guts to accept that politicians are entitled to a reasonable salary'. No-one is asking for politicians to be highly paid but they are entitled at least to a reasonable salary. At last the Tribunal thought it had a Government that had the guts to pay a reasonable salary. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Government and the Government backbenchers: `I think you had the Opposition that had the guts to accept it too. Do not listen to your leaders because I have known, both in government and opposition, my leaders saying to me, ``You cannot trust the other side; at the last moment they will let you down'' '. Believe me, we would have stood by those on the Government side. What has happened? One member of Parliament, the Prime Minister, has rolled it. He has undermined this determination by reasonable people given a job to do. Frankly, I have not even looked at the determination. I have not had a chance to do so and I do not care whether it is good, bad or indifferent. I wanted to accept it. I say to the Government: `I would rather not have your filthy money in this Bill. I would rather go for another year with my current salary than have something changed by an Act of Parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the time, 1990. We have just had an election. This was the time to stand up for the Remuneration Tribunal, let it have its say and then implement it and say, `Right, that is it in 1990. Now, whatever you do in 1991 we are going to accept it again. For 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995-for the rest of this decade and beyond-we will accept whatever you say'. Here we are down the drain less than a couple of months after the last election. Next year, 1991, members of parliament will be starting to look at their marginal electorates and what people will be thinking there, whether they will vote against them. The politics of the matter will come into play. Why are we confronted with this Bill? I say again I would rather go without whatever salary rises are set out in this Bill than do what we are doing here tonight. I think it is an absolutely shameful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are we doing what we are doing tonight? The public out there believe already that we have been given a salary rise up to $65,000-and, I gather, it is not true. The news tonight is that we have been given a 17 3/4 per cent rise. It is not true, but that is what everyone believes, and there is no way that belief can be turned around. I cannot find anyone who has yet said to me that we should not be supporting the Tribunal's finding, and yet what has happened today is that, because of the Prime Minister and Mr Kelty getting together for some crazy political reason to do with salaries being paid under the accord, the House of Representatives has disallowed the determination and we are stuck with this Bill, which I believe to be a quite shameful Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never spoken on any of these remuneration Bills in the time I have been in the Parliament, but I am making a breach from practice on the Remuneration and Allowances Bill tonight because I am very annoyed about at least three elements in this Bill. The first one is, as the previous speakers have said, the breach of a principle. We set up an independent tribunal, and in all the time I have been here, Senator Archer advises me, in only one year has the Remuneration Tribunal's findings with respect to parliamentary salaries been accepted. We set up the Remuneration Tribunal, as all the speakers on this side have said, to come to an independent determination. I believe that the Tribunals over the years have done that conscientiously and well, and yet in every case we have spurned their determination. The breach of that principle is my first objection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second objection to the legislation is that my salary is set by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Last year we had precisely the same situation. We had some union thugs in the ACTU deciding what we, the members of the Parliament of this country, should be paid. I object to that very much, particularly when we are asked to support a failed accord, a failed economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> My third objection to this is that we are linked with the lowest grade of the Public Service Senior Executive Service. I do not want to be linked with anyone. I want to be valued as a parliamentarian and paid whatever some independent tribunal thinks. I do not want parity with anyone in the Public Service at all. I say that for a very important reason. I believe that we are here in the position of governing this country. It is for us to make decisions and to accept the reponsibility for those decisions. That is what we are paid for. We are not paper shufflers in any branch of the Public Service. Having made those points clear, I rest my case. </PARA>

I will give him some time so that he may respond in his second reading reply. I refer to the Remuneration Tribunal determination which is before us and point out, in prefacing what I want to know from the Minister, that in framing its recommendations the Tribunal was itself basing that determination on a submission from the Government. The Tribunal's own words in relation to the accord and the various considerations which it had to take into account were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is the firm conclusion of the Tribunal that a salary of-</PARA>
<PARA>so much-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . would be within the Wage Guidelines as applicable to Members and would be within the spirit and intent of them. In addition, experience since 1983 has shown that when Government or the Members have, in an endeavour to achieve worthy collateral purposes, reduced the salaries which Members otherwise would receive, the result has been confusion and injustice to ordinary Members. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the Tribunal itself. At page 23, speaking specifically of the salary, it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to salary, the Government submissions suggested three things-</PARA>
<PARA>and it goes on and actually outlines those things. The rest of the Tribunal's report indicates quite clearly that the Tribunal was not only acting at arm's length but was basing its determination, its consideration, and its final recommendations, substantially on information which had been put before it by the Government, and yet the Government then turns around at the end of that whole process and rejects that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the linking, this report points out that the Tribunal even considered the situation in the American Senate where linkage has been tried and found not to work; in other words, involving the Tribunal in considerable expense in undergoing this investigation and coming down with this determination. I ask the Minister: What has it cost the Remuneration Tribunal to go through this lengthy process of coming to a determination simply to have that determination rejected and thrown out completely?

We are told by the Government that it would like us to be linked to the Senior Executive Service (SES) Band 1 of the Australian Public Service. That was the submission that the Government put to the Tribunal. I think it is important that we understand what the Government is doing. The Tribunal made the following comment:</PARA></TALK.START>

To fix a member's salary, or to award an increase of it, because the work assessment of someone else has warranted an increase in salary for that person, would be wrong. And so would a rise in Members' salary. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear that the Tribunal has told the Government that it believes its submission is wrong in principle. The Government has set up a tribunal and asked this independent tribunal to give a decision on the wages and benefits of members of the Parliament. The Government has put forward a submission to the Tribunal and the Tribunal has said that its suggestion of linkage is wrong in principle. It said very clearly that it is not only wrong in principle, but it would be unfair to members and it would be unfair to the Senior Executive Service officers concerned. Yet the Government has said, `Blast the Tribunal'. The independent Tribunal has been appointed for a particular job and the Government does not care what the Tribunal has said and is going to insist upon setting its own standard for the salaries of those in government and in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is the basic problem that the Government is now facing. It has put forward a submission which the Remuneration Tribunal says is wrong in principle and unfair to all concerned. Yet the Government has made a decision, in its usual way, to override all that. In the past Prime Ministers have not accepted the full benefit to be awarded by the Tribunal to members, senators and Ministers in this place. Many Prime Ministers of all persuasions have changed the award. But on this occasion it has nothing to do with not accepting the recommended salary. It has to do with the Prime Minister of this country saying that the Government will override the Tribunal, which is a totally different kettle of fish. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just been told that we now have to adjourn this debate after the second reading speeches because of mistakes in this document made by the Government at a quarter to one in the morning. The Government is trying to push through legislation which is wrong and which the Tribunal says is wrong in principle, is wrong to the public servants and is wrong to members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Government trying to push the Bill through in the small hours of the morning? As usual, when the Government tries this shoddy sort of stuff, it falls flat on its face because it tries to do little deals which do not come off. The Government's big act of hanging around and filling in time while Government members wait for a Bill to come from another place has not worked. The Government will not get its Bill tonight after all. We shall have to sit tomorrow because of the Government's bumbling and fumbling. The Government's rotten little deals have not come off. So we will be going home later after this debate, when all of my colleagues have finished speaking. We will have to come back to debate this matter in the morning because the Government could not organise itself sufficiently to get the matter right. </PARA>

<PARA> At present, any rise for an SES officer would ordinarily be justified for one of two reasons: because of National Wage increases; and because a change in the duties of office and the assessment of its work value make it appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the latter kind of rise which is in question. National wage increases are readily passed on. But to pass increases of the latter kind in SES salaries on to members would be wrong in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> A ``simple'' linkage would attract criticism: criticism of a rise given for the wrong reason would properly be raised. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal then says:</PARA>
<PARA> A `simple' linkage would be unfair to Members: it would result in their receiving less-and perhaps increasingly less, than they should receive. There are two reasons for this:</PARA>
<PARA> First, on the present work assessment of Members and the SES at band 1, Members should receive more than such officers. In 1975, the Tribunal assessed the work then carried out by members. The assessment placed their salary at a level which happened to be between Level 1 and Level 2 of the Second Division of the APS (now the SES). But the nature of the work of Members, and their workload, has increased since 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> And it is likely to increase. This became evident in the 1987-88 work assessment of Members: they were put significantly above Level 1/Level 2 in the APS. Members were then assessed at $67,000. Level 1 and Level 2 officers were then $52,720 and $57,775. Members' salary and the increase of them, should not be reduced because of the position of SES officers. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the fact that this Government put in a submission to the Tribunal. The Tribunal said it was wrong in principle, it was wrong to public servants and it was wrong to the members. But despite it all, the Government has gone along and introduced a system that is wrong in principle. </PARA>

<PARA> Since the decision of 1980 to suspend the integrity of the Tribunal, the process has degenerated and deteriorated. As we all remember, the purpose of setting up the Tribunal in the first place was to take from the hands of government and Parliament the decision to pay ourselves what we judged ourselves to be worth because it was seen to be politically tainted and inappropriate for us so to do. The Tribunal was set up to ensure that decisions and judgments were made on value, virtue and merit and not on self-interest. The tragedy is that since that day we have had nothing but self-interest. We have had no value, virtue or merit and no consideration of the relevant factors. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion we have again seen the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) struggling to cope with political expediency at a time-as someone else said earlier-when the Tribunal for once thought that it could bring down a resolution or a finding that would receive support from all political parties. If I were a member of that Tribunal I would resign in disgust; I would resign on the basis that I had not yet brought down a determination that was judged by the Government to be competent. </PARA>

<PARA> I shall read this document ever so briefly. The arguments now being put to us in the second reading speech are dismissed as irrelevant. The speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides for linking the basic salary for Parliamentarians to a salary level in the Senior Executive Service of the Public Service-the top of SES Band 1. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a total abrogation of the responsibility for making discrete decisions about the worth and merit of members of parliament. Somewhere in the Tribunal's contemplations it says:</PARA>
<PARA>A simple linkage is wrong in principle. The salary of Members, like the salary of other employees whose wages are fixed by tribunals, should be fixed according to the proper assessment of what Members have to do. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Tribunal is pleading for once for members of parliament to be paid what they are worth. Perhaps in many respects that is subjective, depending on where one stands, but at the end of the day somebody has to make that assessment. The reason we have a Tribunal is to allow it to attempt in an objective form to draw a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look at the salaries of members of parliament-$58,000 or something ever so modest-and I compare that with every other salary range in this document, I see that almost without exception it is half the salary. Is there one person in this chamber who will put up his or her hand and say that he or she is not worth at least in terms of contribution, ability, time, endurance vaguely more than half anybody else whose salary is determined by the Tribunal?</PARA>
<PARA> For far too long the salaries of members of parliament have been political footballs. The Government knows that it can get away with it because, like shrinking violets, we modestly blush and step back from standing up and being counted and saying, `We believe we are worth more'. I think on this occasion the Tribunal thought it had common approval. I suspect that from now on the Tribunal will throw up its hands and give it away. </PARA>

They find as they remain in political life that that is eaten away or eroded to the point where continuously, in the pursuit of serving their electorate and their State, they have to accept a lower standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very few of us that much mind that; but for many of us being in Parliament can be considered in some ways a hobby-a full-time hobby and a full-time commitment. But it is an awful price that we cast upon our families and our children to allow us to pursue that which is of interest to us in areas where we believe we can make a contribution. It is the wives and the children who have to suffer the reduced standard of living simply because this Government has not the guts, has not the courage, has not the fortitude and, least of all, has not the integrity to pay parliamentarians what they are worth. Yet, with respect, I have to say that I do not think there is a damn vote in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a threshold matter to raise before we get to the Committee stage of the Remuneration and Allowances Bill that has been circulated in the Senate. Unlike the Bill that I was working on, which was introduced in the House of Representatives apparently earlier, this Bill has had some changes made in schedule 4 relating to office holders. It seems to stem from the change that has been made for Whips in the Senate. It is quite clear that those changes have resulted in some extraordinary discrepancies. We have been having some discussions to see whether those discrepancies can be ironed out. But they really cannot be done on the run here in view of the fact that our colleagues in the House of Representatives have gone home. We cannot have discussions with people there who may be able to throw more light on it. Generally speaking, the Opposition feels it would be better to report progress to see whether this matter can be sorted out overnight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>TRANSCRIPT OF THE 7:30 REPORT MONDAY 28 MAY 1990</PARA>
<PARA> ABC Journalist Jim Coutts, shown at typewriter says: What is remarkable, is that after hundreds of property deals and borrowings of millions of dollars, Donald Brownlie Fleming, according to his bankruptcy statements has accumulated no personal assets. So where does all the money go? Perhaps the proceedings from Fleming's bankruptcy hearing which revealed the existence of a discretionary trust may provide some of the answers. </PARA>
<PARA>VISUAL: FILM OF TRANSCRIPT OF FLEMING'S BANKRUPTCY HEARING</PARA>
<PARA>VISUAL-RE-ENACTMENT OF BANKRUPTCY HEARING</PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (Actor): Now you've told us that one of the purposes was to ensure that if you did go bankrupt, any assets you may have acquired in your name would be in the name of the trust and thus prevent the official receiver or trustees from obtaining those assets for the benefit of the creditors. Right?</PARA>
<PARA> Don Fleming (Actor): No. </PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (Actor): You agree, you've told us that one of the purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Fleming (Actor): No. I said it was a result. But I . . . but it . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (Actor): Look, I don't want to go back on the transcript. You started to say it was a result. I then put it to you-and let's not mess around with words-it was one of the purposes, and you said yes, did you not?</PARA>
<PARA> Fleming (Actor): I said yes, it wasn't the prime purpose . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (Actor): But it was one of the purposes, was it not?</PARA>
<PARA> Fleming (actor): Certainly wasn't the prime purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (actor): But it was a purpose was it not?</PARA>
<PARA>Fleming (actor): It was a purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (actor): Well, you say you didn't believe it was the prime purpose. You tell me then what you believe was the prime purpose for establishing the trust. </PARA>
<PARA>Fleming (actor): That's correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (actor): No, no. You tell me what it was. </PARA>
<PARA>Fleming (actor): I just mentioned to you then that I was approached by my friends that said in order for my family to be looked after, and . . . er . . . I'd proven in the past to be not good in relation to handling my personal finances and they wanted to remove me from the scene. And several of my friends established this trust on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Coutts voice over: Strange for a business consultant to admit he's a bit of a duffer with family finances. Nevertheless, he's certainly not short of influential friends. </PARA>
<PARA> Interrogator (actor): Which friends approached you?</PARA>
<PARA> Fleming (actor): There were three of them at the time. Grant Chapman, Robin Chisholm, er our lawyer and Milton Richards. </PARA>
<PARA> Coutts voice over visual of film close-up of Grant Chapman chatting to someone at a Liberal function, then Robin Chisholm speaking from a rostrum, Coutts says: Grant Chapman, Federal Liberal Member of Parliament, Robin Chisholm, a director of the State Government Insurance Commission and pastor, Milton Richards. </PARA>
<PARA> Coutts, outside Plympton Park Supercentre; then visual of business course film showing Fleming and Mackey: And when it comes to influential friends, Kevin Mackey seems to be the rising star. He's a director of a company aiming to buy South Australia's largest sport and leisure complex,the Plympton Park Supercentre, now in receivership. It's also one of the venues for the courses. The consultant helping Mackey put the 5 million dollar deal together, is none other than Donald Brownlie Fleming and getting wealthy and influential businesspeople into the courses is the first step. </PARA>
<PARA> Stephen Bradley: The next step then is investing money. To becoming a shareholder in the organisation. I fear for these people's investments. Not only the financial situation, but also the emotional trauma which may follow after, you know, no matter what happens. I've got a strong fear for these people and some of them are my closest friends. </PARA>
<PARA> Ian Altswager, compere: Jim Coutts the reporter there. Graeme Archer the producer. And we invited Donald Fleming and Sharon Mackey to appear on the program, but both declined to be interviewed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my adjournment speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT TO THE SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> The portion incorporated deals with the financial circumstances of Mr Donald Brownlie Fleming and his bankruptcy proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The portion of the segment I have not incorporated deals with the involvement of Fleming and several partners in running business and motivational courses. That portion is not relevant to the matter I raise tonight, nor in fact do I have any knowledge of the matters raised in that portion of the program which concerns the courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter I wish to raise relates to the portion of the segment presented as a re-enactment of Fleming's bankruptcy hearing. Reference to the transcript will show that two assertions made by the actor playing Don Fleming in bankruptcy hearings re-enacted may be summarised as:</PARA>
<PARA> Grant Chapman was one of the friends who approached Fleming about setting up a discretionary trust for his family</PARA>
<PARA> Grant Chapman was one of those who established the trust</PARA>
<PARA> The inferences are made by the program that I assisted Fleming, through this trust, to avoid meeting his obligations to creditors-and did this while a Federal Liberal member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the assertions and the inferences are false. </PARA>
<PARA> My association with Donald Fleming was as part of a Christian fellowship group of about 6 people of which he was also part, which was initiated by an ordained Baptist pastor, Milt Richards. The fellowship met approximately weekly between mid-1983 and early 1988. My own involvement tapered off from early 1987, due to absences overseas on business and then, after election to the Senate, absences in Canberra. A particular purpose of this group was to encourage each other to practise christianity day-by-day in our personal, family and business lives. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with that, this group raised with Fleming on a number of occasions his apparent continuing failure to properly manage his personal finances and therefore his failure to provide financially for the day-to-day needs of his wife and children. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, several members of the group proposed to Fleming that his financial affairs be operated by a trust, so that he would not have control of his business chequebook to indulge his spendthrift ways at the expense of his wife and children. </PARA>
<PARA> But I was not one of those who put this proposal to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Fleming acquiesced, but reluctantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of Fleming's personal motives in accepting this proposal and his final acceptance of the proposition put by the interrogator in his bankruptcy proceedings that a purpose of the trust was: (in the interrogator's words) ``That if you did go bankrupt, any assets you may have acquired in your own name would be in the name of the trust and thus prevent the official receiver or trustees from obtaining these assets for the benefit of the creditors'', I believe that purpose was not in the minds of those who proposed the trust. It was certainly not a purpose of the trust during any of the time that I was subsequently a director of the trustee company. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the trust was simply to remove from Fleming the capacity to spend willy nilly, and to ensure any income or assets earnt by his new business activities were primarily spent on his wife and children, not frittered away. Indeed, to ensure that he did not amass debts beyond his capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not establish the trust, as asserted. </PARA>
<PARA> A solicitor, who was a member of the fellowship group, was the settlor who established the trust, known as the Hamilton settlement, on 25th August 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in the year, on 26th February 1986, the fellowship group had acquired a shelf company, Clearnew Pty Ltd, which it had planned to use for possible commercial activities with a charitable intent. </PARA>
<PARA> Three members of the fellowship group, including me, took directorships of this company, while another became company secretary. Don Fleming had no position in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The commercial/charitable plans for the company did not develop and it lay dormant. </PARA>
<PARA> When the trust was settled, the directors of Clearnew Pty Ltd therefore agreed for this company to be given over for the purpose of being the trustee company for the Hamilton settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time, I resigned as a director of Clearnew. To be more precise, I did so, 1 3/4 hours before it accepted responsibility as the trustee company for the trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The company secretary also resigned. The other two directors remained in office, with one of them also becoming company secretary and public officer. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I played no role in the establishment or the early activities of the trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, there was a proposal for the trust to acquire an interest in a second board listed company, of which two of the directors, were the directors of the trustee company, Clearnew Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid any possible conflict of interest, they resigned as directors of the trustee company, Clearnew Pty Ltd., on 26th November 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the purpose which the fellowship group had for the trust at the outset-to assist Fleming to be responsible in his financial affairs to the benefit of his wife and children-it was regarded as appropriate that the directors of the trustee company continue to be drawn from the group. </PARA>
<PARA> Pastor Milt Richards and I, as two members of the group with no vested interest in the transaction, accepted the directorships, driven by a christian compassion for Mrs Fleming and her children. </PARA>
<PARA> I also became company secretary, public officer and, with Richards, a bank account signatory for the trustee company. </PARA>
<PARA> The motivation and subsequent behaviour of us both in relation to the trust was entirely altruistic and directed towards the welfare of Mrs Fleming and her children. </PARA>
<PARA> The only activity of the trustee company during the period that I was a director was to authorise it being a guarantor for a loan relating to the transaction for which a memorandum of heads of agreement had been approved on 3rd October 1986, before I was a director. The loan guarantee was approved on 27 February 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I resigned as a director on 26th June 1987, following pre-selection for a position on the S.A. Liberal Senate Team, as I regarded it as inappropriate to retain a directorship not relevant to my direct commercial interests once becoming a senator. </PARA>
<PARA> During my time as a director, the trust did not receive income or assets, nor incur any liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the proposed transaction or the loan proceeded during my time as a director. </PARA>
<PARA> This reinforces that the purpose asserted by the interrogator in the Fleming bankruptcy case was not a purpose, either by intent or practice, during the time that I was a director of the trustee company. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of the activities or purpose of the trust after my involvement ceased. </PARA>
<PARA> But my concern for Mrs Fleming and her children was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> She was a competent secretary, so I employed her as my full-time electorate secretary when first elected as a senator, giving her and the children an income independent of Don Fleming. She subsequently worked for me on a relieving and part-time basis and again full-time from July 1989 until March 1990, when she moved from Adelaide to Sydney, having separated from her husband some months earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarize: my involvement with the hamilton settlement as a director, for a short period, of its trustee company, Clearview Pty Ltd., was neither intended, nor did it allow, Don Fleming to avoid responsibilities to creditors, as has been inferred in the 7.30 Report. It was at all times conducted in the interests of his wife and children. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the fellowship group activities, my only other involvement with Don Fleming was, firstly to undertake in the latter part of 1983, as a consultant, a market research project relating to export opportunities for a company with which he was associated. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a company in which I had a beneficial interest bought shares in a caravan and tourist accommodation complex and also provided a shareholders' loan to the project. He and several other people also held shares in this complex. These shares were sold at their purchase price and the loan repaid to my company more than a year later. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in 1987, I introduced Don Fleming to a potential investor from Asia. I understand this investor subsequently purchased land south of Adelaide from one of the company associated with Don Fleming, and that investor is successfully proceeding with a subdivision and development project on that land. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only had discussions with Don Fleming once in the past 18 months and that was in relation to his family and marital situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As can be seen my association with Don Fleming has been overwhelmingly for altruistic reasons rather than commercial. </PARA>
<PARA> My limited commercial association occurred when I was not a member or senator in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the assertions and the inferences presented in relation to me in the 7:30 Report are false and without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> And lest the reference in the program to Kevin Mackey also having influential friends be inferred as relating to me, may I say that I have never met Kevin Mackey and indeed the only knowledge I have of him is what was presented on the 7.30 Report. </PARA>
<PARA> I have instructed my solicitor to write to the A.B.C. enclosing a copy of the statement I have made tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say in conclusion, that the ethics of the 7.30 report disappoint me, in their failure to approach me with assertions and inferences before going to air, especially when they claimed in the segment that they had approached a number of people to comment on the issues raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
