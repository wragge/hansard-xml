<TITLE>Austudy: Family Allowance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain electors of Queensland points out to the Senate that the 1990-91 Federal Budget stipulates that from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. Family Allowance will be withdrawn if net assets excluding the family home and debt exceed $300,000. Furthermore the parental assets test threshold for Family Allowance Supplement, Austudy and Assistance for Isolated Children has been severely slashed in the 1990-91 Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the economic crisis facing rural communities in Australia, assets tests of such a nature are not viable because the assets are incapable of generating enough income to sustain families and send children away for schooling.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate to exempt the family farm from the assets test for Austudy, Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA> To the honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Chronic renal failure patients must already endure exhaustive dialysis to just survive. Anaemia, or lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells that leaves one weak and lethargic, is another symptom some renal patients must also endure. The inability of the kidneys to produce a hormone known as erythropoietin makes transfusions the only viable option for these patients and the transfusion destroys all chances of a transplant due to the increased levels of antibodies.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Government to make available through an Authority Listing with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the recombinant human erythropoietin to those chronic renal failure patients suffering from anaemia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I was making it clear last night that one of the great concerns we have in this whole debate is that, once again, the Government is locked in a time warp. While the rest of the world acknowledges the benefits of foreign ownership, certainly at relatively modest levels and below absolute control, there are very significant advantages that derive from access to foreign capital, foreign technology and foreign expertise. With the shrinking global village, there is clearly evidence that every other country in the world is taking advantage of these opportunities, yet this Government, for its own cynical, political reasons, seems to think that a 20 per cent limit on foreign ownership in both holding and licensee companies will somehow protect Australian culture. Quite clearly, that is a nonsense. It is hypocrisy in many respects. It is failed economic nationalism under the guise of wrapping oneself in the flag-which quite often, of course, is the last resort of a political scoundrel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a tragedy that what we have here is vividly portrayed in the Australian Financial Review this morning as a clear case of advantage receiver in the world of the media. The article points out that restrictions placed on foreign parties taking equity in Australian print media could make the task of selling the Fairfax organisation a difficult one. A separate article goes on to say that a softer line is emerging on foreign ownership. It is quite extraordinary to look at the contortions within the Australian Labor Party and to understand that in almost every instance they have virtually nothing to do with principle. They are all matters of judgment on individuals. In other words, does Mr Keating like Maxwell? No, he does not. He probably resents him because he is a former Labor member of parliament who actually jumped and made a quid in the real world. Mr Keating cannot decide whether he ought to jump or not-once again leading from behind, of course. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I acknowledge what you say. Mr Keating has said that he does not like Mr Maxwell; therefore he will not let him in. The Labor Party has made a great play of not liking Rupert Murdoch but, then again, of course it is stuck with him having very high levels of foreign ownership in the print media. According to the article, it is now saying, in an extraordinary contortion, that foreign ownership may not be that bad-after all, it is better than having Packer or Murdoch running the show. It is a convenient argument. It has nothing to do with principle. Foreign ownership becomes the lesser of two evils in Labor's demonology. But it certainly has nothing to do with the advantages that might derive from limited levels of foreign ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had in this country from 1981 until these amendments were put forward a regime that had worked pretty well. No-one had really complained about the level of foreign ownership in Channel 10 and, indeed, no-one had ever suggested that there was a need to cut back on that. All that we had had was an awareness in the media and, indeed, through the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, that it was perfectly possible to have levels of foreign ownership of up to 50 per cent in a holding company not causing any difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best article that demonstrated the hypocrisy of the Government's manoeuvres in this area was one by Tom Burton on 13 January this year in the Sydney Morning Herald, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Ralph Willis, was meant to be relaxing on a well-earned holiday . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Willis then put out a press release which could only be construed as disingenuous in the extreme. Tom Burton continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The best that can be said of these statements is that whoever wrote the press release obviously was trying to sneak one through while no-one was watching. The whole statement appeared designed to suggest unequivocally that the Government suddenly had become aware of a loophole and was moving to close it. This was just plain nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knew that the Ten network already had a similar arrangement in place for more than 18 months whereby nearly 30 per cent of Northern Star Holdings, the company which controls-</PARA>
<PARA>then-</PARA>
<PARA>the Ten licensee companies, was controlled by foreign investors, mostly UK media groups. It knew because the Broadcasting Tribunal in February last year had spent hours and hours and written pages and pages examining whether the foreign investors' interests in the holding company meant Ten was in breach of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The tribunal concluded in the negative, as it did when it considered similar arrangements for the Newcastle station NBN3. It concluded in the negative because, contrary to what Willis's press release said, the up to 50 per cent foreign ownership via a holding company arrangement had been clearly intended when the provision was introduced in 1981 as part of the notorious `Murdoch amendments', designed to allow the US resident Rupert Murdoch to continue operating the Ten network which he then owned. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause allowing the arrangement was explicitly referred to in the second reading speech of the then Communication's Minister, Ian Sinclair, and was opposed by several ALP members and senators.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who opposed the clause included Senator Button and Mr Dawkins on the then Opposition side and Senator Puplick on the then Government side. It was quite clear that all of the political participants knew precisely what the intention was. Yet that regime lay dormant, uncriticised and uncontroversial until, for politically opportunistic reasons in the lead-up to the last election, Mr Willis thought it was about time he pandered to the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> That is really where the whole thing has gone completely off the rails because we then had Mr Willis backtracking on a decision to close the loophole. He then said a few days later that the whole thing was still under consideration, that discussions would be held with the Department and that he would not be seeking to impose anything on the industry without consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> He then said that he had been fully aware of the Northern Star case. He actually wrote a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald pointing out that he had been aware but he made no mention of that in his press release, of course. Then, a couple of days later, he refused to stand by the general 20 per cent ceiling on foreign ownership, despite having given a positive commitment to it in the 4 January press release. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we had Mr Hawke hinting that the level might be increased, and on 27 January the Sydney Morning Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government is set to double the maximum level of foreign ownership of commercial television networks from 20 to 40 per cent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Crichton-Browne" NAMEID="XF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course; they all did. This was originally a decision of Mr Willis's to pull the plug on what he thought were delicate negotiations being undertaken by the receiver of Channel 7 to bring in some foreign involvement in that network. We know that CBS and Paramount had been negotiating for some time to take a stake in one of the networks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet what we had by 27 January was the Government being so contortionist as to propose that the 20 per cent limit in the licensee company-where it is much more sensitive and where there are good, valid policy reasons for wanting to keep strict control over the degree of influence that might be exercised at that very close level-be raised from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. We quite rightly opposed that as unnecessary, as simply an hysterical attempt to try to curry favour with television owners. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke allowed that sort of position to run for several days. Finally, Mr Keating raised the spectre of foreign owners holding up to 100 per cent, clearly saying that because he was pandering to those in the Labor Party who did not like any levels of foreign ownership. He was showing the sort of leadership from behind that we have seen in recent days. Eventually it became quite clear that the Government had no position and was determined not to have a position prior to the last election. Margo Kingston said:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor is now set to do nothing and hope the issue gets lost in an election campaign . . . After weeks of dithering, Mr Willis now says his submission is still `not ready'. The policy paralysis of Labor on the issue, the chaos this has caused in the industry, and the anger of its backbench and union supporters have combined to make doing nothing attractive, in the hope that an election will wash away the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>By late February it was clear that the Government had had five different policy positions, prior to having no position at all going into the election, and Mr Willis had the cheek to suggest that the Government was even prepared to backdate legislation if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Beazley ascended to the job, what did he do? He dithered for quite some time but then took the extraordinary decision to reduce the level to 20 per cent across the board. That is the legislation with which we are stuck at present and which I think has been well described in the media as simply a very cynical and opportunistic attempt to curry favour with the Australian Labor Party. However, it is a decision which goes completely against the national interest and the interests of media proprietors and ultimately the beneficiaries of the media, the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all understand that what will drive product in this country is quality, not these artificial barriers. People will continue to make programs like Neighbours and to have them as international successes if they can determine what is likely to be a winner here and overseas. That has nothing to do with whether there is an artificial restriction or requirement on how much one is entitled to own in terms of any particular arm of the media. It is all to do with decision making and judgment, and that is something exercised by the industry and not by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we would all agree that foreign ownership of the media can have potentially deleterious consequences if one is talking about the media being run by foreigners-in other words, more than 50 per cent foreign ownership-in a situation where they make the real decisions. While it is easy to identify the potential for harm when it comes to editorial influence in the print media, it is very much more difficult to do that in the electronic media. Yet that is what this Bill is about-radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> Can anyone suggest seriously that Laurie Oakes would be replaced by a foreign agent of influence? Yet Oakes and his ilk are about the only examples of editorial content that one gets in the electronic media. By and large the electronic media are about ratings and trying to turn a dollar. Irrespective of their political allegiances, the media are interested in the bottom line. Foreign ownership can do nothing to boost that bottom line. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal retains the power at all times to make judgments about control. It can intervene whenever it sees a need to do so; it does not need to be constrained by artificial ceilings or floors. It can scrutinise the issues at any stage. Yet what we have, and continue to have, is this pathetic attempt to pander to those who somehow think that foreign ownership at any level above 20 per cent is inimical to the national interest. That is a tragedy for the Australian media, which almost in bulk is in receivership at the present time, when so many more useful and creative things ought to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The great putative leader, Mr Keating, who now has had to engage in abject and slavish capitulation and apology and who claims that leadership is so important in this area, has not at any time stood up for what others have regarded as very important in this area, that is, a much more deregulatory Broadcasting Act. We are told that at some stage in the future we will get a rewrite of the Act; it has been on the drawing board for years and nothing has emerged to date. If Mr Keating wanted to get out up front on this issue, he would be calling for that. It is supposed to be consistent with his wonderful dream for freeing up Australia and making it a world competitor, and yet we have had absolute silence from him on this critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what the Government is presiding over domestically-for example, in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)-one finds that the ABC announced staff cuts of 350 in July last year and a budget shortfall of $32.5m for 1990-91, with most of those cuts to be made in program production, operations and ancillary departments. The ABC is now making commercials in its own studios, even to the extent, as Channel 9's Sunday program pointed out recently, that it is producing commercials at a cheaper rate than the established industry, sometimes as much as 50 per cent cheaper. When it came to the crunch, it put a Daihatsu commercial ahead of ABC television sport. That is a tragedy and a squandering of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has no right at all to be in the business of trying to compete, undercut and cross-subsidise commercial activities. It ought to be out there promoting excellence in Australian sport and trying to ensure that it at least is some sort of cultural leader and is not simply pandering to the lowest common denominator. The ABC is rapidly heading down the track of being yet another clone of the commercial stations. It is very likely to be an example of one media arm that costs almost 10 times as much as the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) and yet delivers very little more in terms of quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the sorts of problems the Government ought to address. We know that the ABC is looking at backdoor sponsorship. The Home Show is sponsored by the Housing Industry Association to the tune of about $320,000. While the ABC is undertaking all these high risk activities, it is also very keen on pay television, in marked contradistinction to this Government, which has run a million miles from pay television. It wants to see a cocooned media industry and wants to keep the present restrictions on the number of players, which puts pay television in the never-never category and which denies freedom of choice to consumers and access to quality programming. </PARA>
<PARA> While all that is happening, the Government has stood by and watched as the ABC has got something like $150m to $200m in debt, with something in excess of $50m being invested offshore in Japanese loans. It now wants to get into the potentially higher risk area of pay television. The ABC is profligate in the extreme in terms of its real estate policies. It has asked the Government for something like $200m to complete the South Bank project. It is estimated that Ultimo has already cost around $150m, and yet in the face of all these sorts of problems Mr Beazley has been absolutely silent and has wasted his time on these sorts of mickey mouse initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that this proposal to artificially lower the level of foreign ownership in Australia is completely contrary to the national interest and will do nothing to encourage diversity, promote excellence, or entice to these shores the sorts of capital, technology and expertise which are desperately needed at present. This is all about turning one's back on technology and international developments and somehow pretending that the rest of the world ought to go away and that we can go on fostering a national media industry that is artificially restricted and does not have to compete with the rest of the world. I would have thought that that was a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, therefore, takes the view that the media industry will go from bad to worse. The shuffling of the pack going on at the moment in terms of ownership bids is a product of the Government's neglect in this area. An overhaul of the Broadcasting Act is desperately needed so that we can get some genuine competition back into the area and can have incentives in place to encourage the industry to stimulate the production of local products. </PARA>
<PARA> Local content is clearly what is demanded by many consumers, for natural enough reasons. One does not have to be too smart to recognise that and play to it accordingly. One does not need artificial restrictions; it does not follow that any restriction on foreign ownership will involve a limit on local content or a requirement for an increased level of local content. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal can control that at any time; any foreign owner or equity holder clearly must comply with local content restrictions. To confuse the two in the way the Government seems to be doing is simply once again to ignore the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great shame that this cultural cringe and xenophobic reaction that manifests itself in this Bill is being put forward at the expense of all those other desperately needed initiatives that the Government is acutely aware of but, once again, not prepared to do anything about. </PARA>

<PARA> All of us will be aware-and in fact we have all been reminded-that it was the infamous Murdoch amendments, introduced by the Fraser Government in 1981, which opened up the loophole allowing foreign companies to hold well over the 20 per cent limit of our media companies through holding companies; in fact, foreign investors are now able to purchase up to 50 per cent of a holding company, which has 100 per cent control of a television subsidiary. Through this, foreign companies are effectively able to control Australian television broadcasting companies. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Murdoch amendments were introduced, the Australian Labor Party opposed them. Despite this, however, three successive Labor Ministers have failed to act on this in the whole time the Australian Labor Party has been in government. It was not until all three of our financially strapped networks began to look overseas for their capital that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) finally decided to bite the bullet, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased foreign investment, I believe, is not the solution to the sorry financial state of Australia's media. It is not the place of government to cover for poor commercial decisions made by those who purchased the stations for greatly inflated prices and then paid exorbitant prices for programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation in this area should always be in the public interest and not in the interests of a number of media barons or failed entrepreneurs. I fully support Mr Beazley's comment on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program Lateline that if licensees find that they are unable to provide an adequate and comprehensive service they should hand in their licences, as others certainly can provide this service. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted with interest, too, the comments of Senator Chris Schacht in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 November and again today in the Australian Financial Review that if it were to come to a choice between cross-ownership and foreign investment he would prefer increased foreign investment. I would have thought that these were equally undesirable and, more importantly, both avoidable. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reaffirms that aggregate foreign investment in our broadcast licences is strictly limited to the 20 per cent limit that was the original intention of the legislation. Further, the Bill provides that the proportion of foreign directors in a licensee company will be limited to 20 per cent of the total number of directors. Licensee companies which are in breach of the aggregate ownership limit will be given three years to come into line with the provisions of this Bill. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be given the discretion to extend this time if it believes an extension is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, a rally involving some of Australia's leading journalists and writers was held at the Sydney Opera House. The rally showed the level of concern within the industry itself at the ownership of Australia's media. This concern is only going to grow and, as public awareness of the current state of media ownership in this country grows, the movement will gain momentum. When people in the industry itself are concerned enough to organise such a meeting, then I think we as political representatives have a responsibility to examine the outcomes of that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the rally passed a motion calling on the Federal Government to prevent any further concentration in ownership of Australia's media. The Australian Democrats would go further than this and suggest that we should be looking at ways to reduce the already high levels of foreign media ownership in Australia. We would do this through placing a 43 per cent audience reach limit on our commercial television networks and through measures to create greater diversity of ownership in our print media. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the rally called on the Government to establish an independent inquiry to look at the present state of the broadcast industry and what needs to be done to rectify this. The Democrats believe that this is essential. The problems in this industry are many and complex and will need to be considered in conjunction. Finally, the rally passed a motion calling for the Trade Practices Commission to be given increased powers to enable it to adequately oversee the industry. These are all issues which the Democrats support and have pushed for in the past, and I believe that they all need to be addressed by this Government to ensure Australia's broadcast industry returns to a healthy and viable condition. </PARA>
<PARA> At that rally, Mr Neil Brown presented the coalition's proposal to deal with the current state of the industry. The solution, as the Opposition sees it, is to open the media up to an even greater level of foreign ownership and to lift the current embargo on pay television; in other words, even more of what Labor governments have dished up to the media over the past eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am yet to meet anyone in the industry who believes that introducing pay television is going to cure the television or radio industries of their financial woes. With two television stations in receivership, radio stations facing their toughest period for four years and advertising dollars becoming increasingly scarce, the introduction of pay television would be a recipe for even greater trauma for the industry. I do not agree with Senator Alston. There is never any guarantee that pay television, by its mere existence, will provide greater quality; in fact, I would argue that it would probably militate against a higher level of Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Bills before us, Mr Brown has stated in the other place that the Opposition will not be supporting them for a number of reasons. I think that is what Senator Alston said, although he did not say it quite as clearly. Firstly, the Opposition believes that foreign ownership of Australia's media outlets is not an important issue. I think that Opposition members, together with a number of the Murdoch editors, must be the only people in this country who are not concerned at the prospect of our broadcasters falling into foreign hands. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston said that it was impossible to show that editorial influence existed in the electronic media. I do not agree with that; I do not accept that. Editorial influence and interference can begin in the newsroom with the very selectivity of what items are broadcast as part of the news. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Opposition believes that this legislation is a heavy-handed solution. Quite obviously, given the elaborate means that have been used in the past to circumvent this legislation, a fairly heavy-handed approach needs to be taken. Finally, the Opposition believes that since it removed the tracing requirements back in 1981 these requirements should not be reintroduced. It is now history that the Opposition's 1981 Murdoch amendments are perhaps the most notorious changes ever made to this legislation. I think it is outrageous that they have not been rectified before now. </PARA>
<PARA> Quentin Dempster, presenter of the ABC's 7.30 Report, said at the broadcasting rally:</PARA>
<PARA>In its eight years of being in power, the ALP has done nothing but sell out Australian journalism. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with him and point out that the Opposition is quite prepared to continue, and even encourage, this abysmal sell out. Labor governments of this decade have allowed an American citizen to gain control of around 70 per cent of our print media. This is clearly the next issue this Government must address if it is to regain credibility in the area of broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not often that I would agree with sentiments expressed by Bond Media Ltd Chairman, Mr Warren Jones, but, when he accused the Government of hypocrisy for allowing an American citizen to own 70 per cent of our print media while it tightened up the foreign ownership of other media outlets, I think he was fairly close to the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at media regulation in overseas countries, honourable senators might be surprised to know that most have very strict controls on the level of foreign ownership of their media. In the United States, commercial broadcasting licences are not available to corporations which have foreign directors or which have more than 20 per cent of capital stock or votes controlled by foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canada, corporations eligible to hold broadcasting licences must be incorporated in Canada, must have Canadian directors and must be at least 80 per cent Canadian owned. Section 3 of the Canadian Broadcasting Act states that these measures are designed to, `safeguard, enrich and strengthen the cultural, political, social and economic fabric of Canada'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we ensure national security and we should always seek to enhance our society. I have always said, and I believe, that broadcasting outlets, including television, provide their owners with enormous social, commercial and political power and it is vital that this power not be given over to foreign interests. I do not believe that the ultimate answer is simply to encourage capital technology and expertise from overseas. We can look at what foreign ownership of land in this country is doing. We cannot assume that technology transfer will take place. It is too high a price to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadcasting is an industry in which we must guarantee Australian ownership, control and content. As such, the Democrats fully support a 20 per cent limit on foreign investment. We do not support the 50 per cent limit that the Opposition appears to be advocating. As such, the Democrats support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak until just a few moments ago, and I will keep my remarks very brief. I start off by saying that the Broadcasting (Foreign Ownership) Amendment Bill is in keeping with the Government's contemptuous attitude towards the Parliament-that is, government by press release. I think it was on 22 May last year that the Government unilaterally announced the limits on ownership at 20 per cent. While we have a Government that has the contempt for the systems and processes of parliament which this Government has, we will have a less than satisfactory system in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In due course this contempt for the Parliament will manifest itself in a way which will cause this Government to be dumped ignominiously at the next election. I was struck by Mr Keating's comments last Friday-not so much because they were criticisms of the Prime Minister but because of his intellectual arrogance in saying that this country has never had a great Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Kernot holds her breath, I will get to it. What took my breath away was the Treasurer's intellectual arrogance that this country has not had a George Washington or a Lincoln. But right on the edge we have a Federal Treasurer about to fill the shoes and take on the mantle of greatness which, as he recited, has been bestowed on four Presidents of the United States. I was struck not by Mr Keating's comparison of himself with George Washington, but rather the arrogance that is manifesting itself in this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When are we going to find out about a crucial matter such as television ownership in this country? The matter is not brought into the Parliament; it is not a parliamentary statement; it is a press statement. If Senator Kernot wants to know what I am arriving at, the legislation is a press statement, lacking in detail or finesse-simply a one-pager telling us how the course of broadcasting in this country is going to change. </PARA>
<PARA> If I might now go past that to the crux of this debate, nobody has offered a philosophic argument in favour of 20 per cent ownership. We have this jingoistic objection to foreign ownership, as if all foreign ownership is evil, wrong, treacherous and dangerous; we are such intellectual pygmies that we are terrified of foreign ownership.

I have my own views, but I wait for the Democrats and the Government to put a proposition to me. In fact, I wait for the Government to tell me why 20 per cent is better than 15 per cent, 25 per cent or 40 per cent. There is no cogent, logical and articulated argument; it is simply an arbitrary figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Putting aside a figure, what is the fundamental objection that the Government has to ownership of the media as distinct from something else? It saddens me in some respects, if I can be altruistic for a moment, that we have this debate about foreign ownership or ownership generally in the media in this country and nobody has the intellectual capacity to seek to persuade anybody else in the community of the rights and wrongs of ownership, except for this jingoistic obsession and this fear we have about ownership.-If the Democrats are saying that the Japanese cannot be trusted with our television stations, why do they not say so?

I do not know why they always run the Australian Labor Party's arguments for them. I was talking about the Labor Party's legislation. It is its proposition, its legislation, that I am debating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Collins is sitting over there, looking quite relaxed with his feet up on the table, and allowing the Democrats to do his arguing for him. I am interested in the Democrats telling me whether foreign ownership or a concentration of power of media ownership by two or three heavies who happen to have Australian citizenship is the greatest evil. Which is the worst, and why is one worse than the other? Again, there is a deafening silence when it comes to logical arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies in this country is that we have the monopoly that exists at present. Nobody has put a cogent argument for having limits on television ownership and licences for television and radio that do not apply to the print media. Do we take it that foreign ownership or concentration of power in the print media is not bad but that it is in the electronic media? No cogent argument is put by the Government. We have here a situation where a foreigner, in the form of Rupert Murdoch, controls-Senator Kernot said 70 per cent; I thought it was 60 per cent-an inordinate amount of control of the print media. By any measure, that is undue influence on community opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon reflection, if I had my way I would not allow anyone to have more than one television or radio station. Everything else has been tried and has failed. But no argument has been put which draws a distinction between the print media and the electronic media. I now turn to the matter that concerns me most, and that is that, in my view, this 20 per cent limit is really all about Kerry Packer and Alan Bond. I will tell Senator Kernot the story if she does not know it. </PARA>

I do not burble away every secret that is whispered in my ear by the conspirators on the other side who are tearing each other apart and trying to destroy themselves. So Mr Bond, Mr Jones and the Channel 9 executives went to America and stitched up a package with the major players over there which was going to save Channel 9 from falling into the hands of Mr Packer, because of course Mr Packer was owed $200m by Channel 9. At that time, prior to and during the election, it was very helpful to have Channel 9 on side. This was an election that the Government was never going to win-it was like the recession that we were never going to have. This process ran prior to and during the election, and after the election Channel 9 was in what one might describe as a fair amount of financial trouble-and not the least of the people in that situation was its principal shareholder, Mr Alan Bond. Then in strode Kerry on the back of his polo pony. He of course had the money; he was going to make sure that Channel 9 survived. So Mr Packer did a deal with the Government and it reduced ownership to 20 per cent. What was the net result of that?

That is what the 20 per cent limit was all about-nothing else. That is what saddens me. There is nothing philosophically pure about this; this is not a question of policy. This is fundamentally legislation to suit one man. It might suit others and it might suit other people's views about media ownership, but it was essentially driven by an arrangement between the Prime Minister and the now proprietor of Channel 9. That is what I object to-having to come into this chamber and vote on legislation for the convenience of one person. When we in this country get to the point of legislating for the convenience of one citizen and not for all citizens equally, we have really arrived at the depth of corruption and decay.</PARA></TALK.START>

Seriously, I find the whole debate about media ownership in this country very sad. It has a sorry, sad, and in some parts sordid history. I am not suggesting for a moment that when we were in government we made all of the right decisions; I would have to say that they were all altruistic, but not necessarily right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that were in fact the case, perhaps I would agree with Senator Crichton-Browne, but of course it is not the case-and demonstrably not the case. Senator Kernot in her contribution gave just one specific example of the levels of foreign ownership permitted in this very sensitive area of broadcasting around the world, and that was Canada. Is Senator Crichton-Browne suggesting that the proprietor of Channel 9 in fact engineered the foreign ownership levels in Canada, or in the United States of America or in Great Britain, or indeed in any other comparable developed country around the world where the levels that are being struck by this legislation are of the same order? In fact, upon investigating broadcasting practice around the world I am informed that the only country which has the kind of policy Senator Alston would like to advocate is Saudi Arabia. I am not suggesting for a minute that the Government is prepared to go along that road. The fact is, as Senator Kernot quite correctly said, that this is not a question of sensitivity and controversy that is unique to this country. In fact, it exists in every comparable country around the world where the levels of ownership are set at roughly the same levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of what Senator Crichton-Browne said in that part of his speech which related to the legislation, his desire to see a situation where one television channel would be owned by one individual operator is one that we would all like to see in the perfect world. The difficulty is that it is a utopian dream that is never likely to be realised for the simple reason that, like so many other things in this country, where natural monopolies do exist despite the best efforts of legislators, it is an expensive business to start and run newspapers and to start and run national broadcasting channels. For example, what would Senator Crichton-Browne suggest that the proprietor of a little television channel run for the benefit of the viewers in his area?</PARA>

Presumably, we should allow this unlimited access to this sort of money to improve programming. But a situation in which one owner of a television channel, tapping the same advertising market that pays for all this, is not able to put on sufficient quality programming, is a matter of no moment to Senator Alston. He said, `So what? Let that be the situ- ation'. That is just not living in the real world. This is an expensive business to get into these days and it is becoming increasingly more expensive in terms of the access that these television channels must have to the final product that they broadcast. Of course, it is the quality of that product that finally determines how financially successful these organisations will be and whether they remain financially viable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In terms of debating philosophically the difference between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, legislation that provides limits to anything has to provide benchmarks. Precisely the same argument can be applied to the benchmarks that we set here on a routine basis with everything else-social security legislation, for example. It may be argued that a person is on the right side of qualifying for a particular grant or benefit but on the wrong side when he or she is on the other side of the benchmark. The fact is that at the end of the day it is a matter for judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental philosophy in this country is that which is shared by every other developed country in the world; that is, that both the ownership and control of Australian broadcasting should be substantially in the hands of Australians. That is a fundamental desire which, as I say, only brief reference to the literature will reveal is constant and common in developed countries around the world. Whatever decision any government takes on this issue, it will be loudly and strongly declared to be wrong by someone on either side of the debate. It has been demonstrated in this short debate here this morning that that is the case. It would not matter what benchmark was set, whether it was restricted, open slather or any point in between; somebody would determine that it would be the wrong figure. We could canvass that debate for hours this morning. Indeed, it is a debate--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is not a question of high moral principle at all; it is simply a question for the judgment of the government of the day as to the appro- priate level to set. As Senator Alston and everyone else knows, this issue has been canvassed ad nauseam in this chamber on many previous occasions. Particularly in light of a very long and protracted debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill last night in the Senate, I do not intend to prolong the agony of this debate by simply going over the same ground that has been gone over this morning by previous speakers. It is a philosophical debate in regard to which two views have been expressed this morning by both the Australian Democrats and the Opposition, both disagreeing fundamentally with the level of ownership that the Government has struck. That will always be a problem, no matter what level is struck.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this level is comparable to the levels imposed by other governments of comparable nations around the world. I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA> `(5a) A licensee shall not broadcast:</PARA>

<PARA> `smoking' means inhaling or puffing the smoke of cigarettes or cigars of any composition or tobacco in any form;</PARA>
<PARA> `tobacco products' means cigarettes or cigars of any tobacco composition or tobacco in any form, and includes snuff, cigarette paper, cigarettes, rollers and pipes.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments were circulated in the chamber some weeks ago and have been foreshadowed for many months. They deal with the aspects of the Broadcasting Act relating to tobacco advertising. In the 1970s, the Broadcasting Act was amended to eliminate the advertising of tobacco products in the electronic media. However, at that time an exception was made for what was termed `incidental advertising'; that is, advertising which was not taken out directly with the broadcasting company but which was seen in the case of television, or heard in the case of radio, as a result of indirect sponsorship largely through sponsorship of sporting and cultural events. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976, when the final implementation of the so-called electronic ban came into place, this loophole has been used to provide the tobacco industry with almost saturation advertising. Senators have had information from the Australian Medical Association (AMA) which has shown that during the Adelaide Grand Prix the Marlboro name or logo appeared on the television screen for up to 35.7 per cent of the time of the screening of that particular event. This is common throughout major sporting events in this country- there is available a proportion of advertising time which would not be available under normal advertising circumstances and which the Broadcasting Act purports to have eliminated by its amendments in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> I argued for these amendments during the second reading debate some weeks ago. In regard to these amendments here today, other people will argue for me. I will begin in fact with the Sydney Federal Electorate Council of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), which wrote to Ms Mary Crawford, MP, Secretary of the Federal Labor Caucus, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>This Federal Electorate Council calls on the federal parliamentary caucus to support amendments, to be moved by Democrat Senator Janet Powell, to broadcasting bills currently before Parliament, which will prevent the televising of incidental tobacco advertisements and promotional material during the broadcasting of sporting and other events. </PARA>
<PARA>I will also quote from a press release issued yesterday by a Government Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peter Staples, Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, called on all Australians-and especially parents-to help push tobacco sponsorship out of sport. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments that I am moving call on the Government, whose responsibility it clearly is under this Act, to do just what Minister Staples is asking parents to do, to help push tobacco sponsorship out of sport. The press release goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Staples said sporting organisations should resist the tobacco industry's strategies to promote its products through sport. </PARA>
<PARA>And a direct quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Tobacco sponsorship has helped some sports directly with funds and, indirectly, by increasing exposure of sports,</PARA>
<PARA>But up to 75 per cent of the funding that is allocated to a sporting organisation by a tobacco company is for tobacco promotion. </PARA>
<PARA>And that leads to an increase in the uptake of smoking by young people. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from the Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, who was announcing a sponsorship deal yesterday under the national campaign against drug abuse in association with the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, who joined the national buy-out of tobacco sponsorship of Australian soccer. </PARA>
<PARA> To be able to quote an ALP electorate council and a Government Minister gives considerable weight to these amendments that I am putting before the Committee today. If that does not give sufficient weight, I will go on to the Australian Medical Association, which supports moves by the Australian Democrats to reduce the incidence of smoking in our community and thereby to make a major economic and social advance in this country-economic to the extent of over $2 billion per year, which is the cost to our economy of smoking related absenteeism, illness, disease and death. The AMA wrote in these terms to all parliamentarians in October:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act to ban the incidental advertising of tobacco products proposed by the Leader of the Australian Democrats . . . were unanimously endorsed by the Federal Executive of the Australian Medical Association in Canberra on October 5/6, 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The AMA went on to urge members of parliament to support these amendments. Its letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The scientific literature and the daily evidence in our surgeries and consulting rooms is testimony to the harmful effects of smoking. Tobacco kills more than 19,000 Australians yearly and adds many millions of dollars to health costs. Tobacco companies support sport to forge a spurious link between the use of tobacco and the health, youth and vigour associated with sport. Thousands of young Australians are beguiled by the false glamour so created to become addicted to a fatal drug. Sporting activities now funded by tobacco companies are worthy of support but that can be provided in better ways than through sponsorship by companies selling products causing death. </PARA>
<PARA>The AMA, as I said, has written to all members of parliament. In this particular instance it was written by Bruce Shepherd, its new Federal President, and I want to acknowledge the support of Bryce Phillips, the former President, on these issues as well. The letter to parliamentarians concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Hence the need for Senator Powell's amendments to restore the integrity of the legislation and to enforce the original purpose of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose, I remind the Committee, is to ban the electronic advertising of tobacco products, which is all that these amendments are attempting to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, which has been a strong advocate of my previous legislation banning the print advertising of tobacco products and of closing this loophole, has also written in strong terms to parliamentarians and to Minister Beazley, who, in response to an earlier letter in May from Dr Nigel Gray, the Director of the Anti-Cancer Council, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Any proposal to remove the accidental or incidental exemption would require, among other things, a prior evaluation of its likely effect on sport and cultural activities currently sponsored by tobacco companies, and seek to identify possible alternative sources of funding for those activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Gray responded to Minister Beazley with a range of helpful suggestions, and indeed countered some of his arguments or some of the thoughts in his letter about the difficulties of the process. It is clearly within the province of the Federal Government, as has occurred in States, to provide the opportunity for alternative sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to report to those members of the Committee who are not aware that the Western Australia Parliament, which seems to have trouble passing some legislation at the moment, has in fact passed the relevant legislation in that State to establish a health promotion foundation equivalent, following the example of Victoria and South Australia. Legislation is in the Tasmanian Parliament and the issue is also on the agenda of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we will see, in the event of this Government refusing these amendments, is the Hawke Government isolating itself, along with the Greiner Government- although, to his credit, not Mr Greiner's Minister of Health, Mr Collins-taking the same attitude as the former Bjelke-Petersen Government in Queensland and refusing to act on behalf of the health of its citizens and, indeed, in the economic interests of the country. Nigel Gray's letter to the Minister concludes in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>I would conclude by emphasising that there is really no excuse for the Government to prevaricate any longer, and thereby to facilitate the quite disgraceful advertising of tobacco through sporting events-basically centred in New South Wales-which ought to be entirely unacceptable in the year 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Other organisations in the health area, of course, are also in strong support. The Public Health Association of Australia Inc. wrote to me to let me know of a recent policy resolution at the 1990 annual general meeting of the Public Health Association. That resolution runs through some of the aspects of the issue: the addictive nature of the product; its hazard to human health; its cause of an estimated three million deaths world-wide each year and more than 20,000 deaths each year in this country; the cost to the economy, which I have already outlined; and its concern about the loophole, which we are attempting to close by these amendments. It calls on the Federal Government to review the operation of the Act and notes that these amendments moved today would achieve the intention of the earlier legislation to ban all television advertising of tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Cancer Fund, whose representative I met recently in Queensland, has also been a strong advocate for this, as have cancer and asthma organisations and a full range of medical organisations all around the country. I think the question for the Government at this point is: if not, why not? It is a question which the Government really needs to address very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not a set of amendments which have been dropped on the table at the last minute as so many often are at this time of the year. These amendments have been foreshadowed for more than a year. It is 12 months almost to the day since the Government supported my private member's initiative, which has resulted in the implementation of a ban on tobacco advertising in the print media and which comes into effect at the beginning of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be inconsistent for the Government, and for the Opposition, which also supported that initiative in the dying days of the last Parliament, not to support this initiative. We could be forgiven for being cynical in believing-and last December we were, quite clearly, coming up to a Federal election-that the exhortations of major health organisations, such as the AMA and the wide range of groups in the community, meant more then than they do now. Both the Government and the Opposition believe that there is more time for them to hope that the community will forget if they wimp out on this occasion and fail to act in the best interests of the Australian community, particularly young people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Bill coming before us some time in the next 1 1/2 weeks remaining before Christmas which deals with drugs in sport. We have had hours of debate on the question of drugs in sport in this particular sitting period. Tobacco is a drug which could not be more closely associated with sport; it is a drug which is deliberately using sport. As Minister Staples, the President of the AMA and many other authoritative voices have said, these purveyors of a drug are using sport for their own purposes to hook new smokers onto a new habit-and it is working. Minister Staples has demonstrated the way it works in today's Age. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia the most popular brand of cigarettes among young smokers is Escort, the sponsor of the State's football competition; in New South Wales it is Winfield, the sponsor of the Rugby League competition. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a drug for which there is no safe dose whatsoever. It is being given up more and more by adults in the community. Through this sporting link, via the loophole which these amendments strive to close, it is hooking more and more young people so that the tobacco industry is able to continue to sell its product of death in the community. </PARA>

<PARA> The effect of the Australian Democrats' amendments would be that they would give all parties concerned about a year in which to prepare for the removal of the incidental exemption. It is the view of the Government that it is not sufficient simply to provide time alone, because time alone would not address the need for the full consideration of the implication that removal of the incidental exemption would have on sponsored sport or the arts, nor would time alone necessarily result in new arrangements for alternative sponsorship and funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been gone over in the Committee before. This all relates to the history of how incidental advertising became so dominant and influential. The proscription of direct advertising for tobacco products has also arisen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not. I have said this in debate before and am happy to say it again in response to that interjection that I find the connection-not surprisingly in what is, I hope, an ever increasingly unpopular product with sporting bodies-to be something that does not sit comfortably with me either. I also recognise, rightly or wrongly-the people affected in the various areas will put their views far more strenuously than I will-that the reality is, to use an expression much favoured by Andrew Peacock, that very substantial sponsorship is currently provided by tobacco companies. It will leave organisations very much in the lurch if it is removed without proper consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are matters the Government is considering. Until they have been considered in full, the Government is not in a position at this time to support the amendments. As a matter of fact, I understand that meetings are taking place today with representatives of sporting groups who have very serious concerns about the imminent removal of substantial funding for their organisations which will, in effect, render those organisations largely defunct in terms of their financial base. No doubt those consultations and discussions will continue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely correct. As I said, it is hardly surprising that tobacco companies would seek to associate their products-I would have thought that they have nothing to do with the pursuit of good health-with sporting pursuits. That is simply acknowledging the reality of the situation. They moved very heavily towards this area in, I think, 1976 when the proscriptions were first introduced to prevent them from direct advertising of these products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said before, the Government is supportive of the intent of these amendments. However, the Government will not take a piecemeal approach to the issue of tobacco sponsorship of either sport or the arts. The Government believes that should incidental tobacco advertising be banned, the question of alternative sponsorship has to be addressed at the same time. Furthermore, certain provisions in the existing contracts between sporting bodies and tobacco companies are understood to contain let out clauses upon any regulatory or legislative change occurring. Again, that is hardly surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> If these amendments were implemented now, in some cases sporting bodies would suffer the removal of this sponsorship in the short term rather than in the long term. The Government is approaching this issue as a package so that alternative sponsorship is identified at the same time as any consideration for the legislative change that is being proposed by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that although the Opposition's position, as I understand it, would not be a unanimous one, we take the view that it would be very helpful to have the benefits of the Government's current assessment of the position. That will certainly play a part in any future deliberations on this issue. We also make it clear that we do share the view, as does the overwhelming proportion of the community, that cigarette smoking is intrinsically unhealthy and undesirable and, therefore, ought not to be encouraged. As the party which introduced the partial ban on the advertising of tobacco products-it has operated in this country since 1976 by virtue of section 100, which the Democrats now want to amend further-we have substantially succeeded in eliminating advertising of cigarette products on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the ongoing conundrum about cause and effect needs to be raised in this debate, and I know that arouses passionate voices, particularly from those in the medical profession. There can be no doubt that cigarette smoking not only is harmful to health but, in many instances, can terminate life. I do not think anyone these days, other than perhaps the vested interests, would try to gainsay that proposition.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator wants to suggest that the Surgeon-General and those who drive the medical profession are captured, and that somehow this is the voice of the tobacco lobby, then she can go ahead and say that. It strikes me as an affront to commonsense to run that argument when one does not at the same time adduce the evidence, apart from wonderful intrinsic a priori statements. It is necessary to come up with evidence to demonstrate the link between cause and effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is one thing to argue-and I concede the argument-that cigarette smoking has a whole range of highly harmful consequences to the health of society, but it is another thing to say that that comes about because of incidental or accidental advertising. There is a world of difference, for example, between promoting nubile young maidens in idyllic circumstances smoking Alpine and simply pointing to the name of a tobacco product in a sporting arena. It might be a brand reminder and might be something that prompts people to buy that product rather than another, but it does not persuade me, as a matter of logic, that that is what induces people to take up smoking. </PARA>
<PARA> People take up smoking for a variety of reasons. I suspect that advertising plays a very small part in their decision. It is really saying that someone was not intending to smoke until that person saw the name of a cigarette product at a sporting event. That is drawing a very long bow, I would have thought. The reasons why people smoke have been documented by the medical profession. They include peer group pressure; some feelings of insecurity; wanting to boost one's self-image; and generally feeling that smoking will contribute to one's sense of purpose. To suggest that, somehow, the mention of a name of a product is what is actually going to induce a person to take up the product strikes me as something that certainly has not been established on the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The one case that I have always found interesting, and I have not heard refuted by the experts in the field, is that of Norway which banned all forms of cigarette advertising in 1975. Yet the fact is that the decrease in teenage smoking has been dramatically greater in New South Wales-and I suspect most other Australian States-than it has been in Norway. Over the last decade in Norway tobacco consumption has dropped by about 7 per cent, whereas over the last decade in Australia we have seen a massive decrease of some 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we can have a total ban on all forms of cigarette advertising, yet there will still be mugs who smoke. They are obviously not smoking because of advertising; they are smoking for other reasons. Those other reasons might have a lot to do with poor self-image, peer group pressure, parental influences and a whole range of things. One has to say that it has nothing to do with advertising. If the greatest incidence of the uptake of cigarette smoking is amongst the young, then those people, by and large, were not even born when cigarette advertising was banned in that country. So I regard it as a simplistic link to suggest that advertising induces people to smoke. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the right of the passionate advocates to say that anything that might conceivably contribute to the reduction of incentives to smoke ought to be embraced by the legislators. That is a separate argument and I am sure we will hear it shortly. But I would also like to hear some evidence rather than simple emotion on the subject. Anyone can get up and argue that smoking is bad and that we ought to discourage it. One of the most effective methods of reducing the incentive to smoke that has been devised in recent years is the highly effective negative advertising campaigns that have been run, in some instances by State governments. That is the way to go about doing it. Also, making people aware of the virtues of a healthy lifestyle has, in many respects, been remarkably successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue has very little to do, I would have thought, with whether Benson and Hedges sponsor cricket. At the end of the day, we will probably reach the stage where Benson and Hedges will not sponsor cricket and alternative arguments can be made. Hopefully, we will hear from the Government in the not too distant future about what those alternative arrangements might be. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us address what will bring about a positive incentive to reduce smoking. Many other ways will achieve that other than what I think in many ways is symbolism. If we can have evidence from eminent people such as the Surgeon-General saying that the jury is still out, then I would like to know what establishes this very important cause and effect relationship. That is the crux of the debate and that is what is missing at the present time. I understand the Democrats' desire to move this amendment. </PARA>

The Minister, Senator Collins, already this morning has acknowledged that that sponsorship activity is going to be quite difficult to overcome, and measures are going to have to be undertaken to compensate for the losses. But we are talking about the opportunity of saving some lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember recently in the Senate when we were considering the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and related Bills that Senator Watson, speaking for the Opposition, asked a rhetorical question: `What price do you put on a life?' That comment from Senator Watson can be found in the Hansard, and that is really the question being asked today. What price will we put on a life? Given that we cannot establish a new principle-through you, Mr Chairman, I say to my colleague Senator Alston-if we can make the principle which we together established in 1976 and 1989 more effective, we should do so. That is really the issue and to argue it back in terms of what it is not does not help the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do the commercial interests-the tobacco retailers, these bad corporate citizens, as bad as anyone in Australia, these people guilty of disgraceful commercial behaviour whenever they try to recruit new smokers, and that is what they are-promote actions which they know will kill people? They are no different in quality to the purveyors of illegal drugs in that sense, except that what they do is legal. Why do they spend so much money on sponsorship? I think Senator Powell has already said that they do not do it out of the goodness of their hearts; they do it because they see some commercial benefit in doing it. </PARA>

They have made a judgment on many occasions that undertaking sponsorship activity is commercially advantageous. That is why they do it, and I am not questioning that. They put up billboards because they think billboards are commercially advantageous. But the evaluations which are made by tobacco companies do not include, and have never included, the public interest, whereas our duty in this chamber should include and does include the public interest-even if it cannot be factored into the equation for profit. Even if it is not a cost factored in, it is proper to look at where the public interest lies.

<PARA> We have a duty, I believe, to act on this matter in accordance once with the principles established in 1976. I would say to those who might wish to bring up that old argument that if it is legal to sell, it is legal to advertise--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would remind the honourable senator that long before she came to this place that matter was decided here. We voted for a ban on cigarette advertising in the electronic media, and that ban was introduced by Mr Eric Robinson from the Liberal Party of Australia, in the House of Representatives on 20 May 1976. It was then introduced in this place on 24 August 1976 by Senator Sir John Carrick, then Senator Carrick, and it passed through this Parliament with our support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principle was established in 1976. Then in 1989-when I believe Senator Bishop was here-we voted to extend that ban to the print media and I do not remember any Liberals voting against that. The principle has been established, but not only that, it is illegal to sell cigarettes to people under the age of 16 in many States. It is therefore illegal to advertise to those people, or to direct advertising to those people. One cannot argue that selling cigarettes is legal; it is partly legal. It is legal to sell to some people but illegal to sell to the young. Those that put up the simple argument-legal to sell, legal to advertise-conveniently forget that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate on this matter is not new. I was concerned with a Senate social welfare committee which reported in 1977. I am one of only two senators still here who were on that committee. I can recall some of the recommendations of that committee in relation to tobacco. Recommendation 45 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>That State Governments and local government authorities be encouraged to ban the advertising of tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA>That had support from all members of the committee-Liberal, National Party and Labor. Recommendation 46 then stated:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Federal Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development-</PARA>
<PARA>as he then was-</PARA>
<PARA>and the State Ministers responsible for youth, sport and recreation, appeal to sportsmen and sportswomen throughout Australia not to lend their names and prestige to the promotion of tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA>Then recommendation 47 read:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Government make any grants to sporting and cultural bodies conditional on their not accepting money from manufacturers and retailers of tobacco products, and investigate the possibility of indemnifying such bodies for loss of revenue, at least in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to recommendation 47, because in the Minister's response he says that is what the Government is going to think about doing. Recommendation 48 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Government consider refusing tax deductibility for expenses incurred in the promotion of tobacco products</PARA>
<PARA>As chairman of that committee, I supported those recommendations then and I support them now. I supported the 1976 decision of this Parliament to ban the advertising of tobacco products in the electronic media; I support it now. I supported the decision of this Parliament to extend that ban to the print media in 1989 and I continue to support that. What this amendment to section 100 is seeking to do, as Senator Alston has said, is to close a loophole in that ban. We know that the tobacco companies are continuing to advertise their corporate names, and the very large amounts spent were set out by Senator Powell, showing the extent of the advertising. We know that even that incidental advertising has a big effect on sales. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, and I think someone has already mentioned this, let us look at the three major winter sports in Australia. In New South Wales, the major sport is rugby league, which is sponsored by Winfield-and the major brand smoked by 12- to 14-year-olds is, of course, Winfield. That is also the case in Queensland, where the Winfield company also supports the rugby league. In Victoria, where the Australian Football League is supported by Peter Jackson, the preferred brand smoked by 12- to 14-year-olds-to whom it is illegal to sell cigarettes, by the way-is Peter Jackson. In South Australia, where the South Australian Football League is sponsored by Escort, that is the brand most chosen by 12- to 14-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that even the incidental advertising is reflected in the choice of young smokers. We know also that in up to 40 other countries advertising, and incidental advertising, is totally forbidden. We know that sport continues to flourish in those countries; we know that there are other sponsors besides tobacco companies. I can remember the Cornhill cricket tests in England; that is not a tobacco company. Also, there was the Gillette Cup, and Gillette is not a tobacco company. Of course there are other sponsors around. </PARA>
<PARA> The cigarette companies, in a very cynical move, have purchased the support of culture and sport in this country and are now threatening to withdraw that money and leave the sports high and dry. I suppose it is worth saying a couple of words about someone who is not of my political persuasion, Mr David Hill, the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He is also president of the football club I support. There are not many North Sydney supporters around--</PARA>

Mr Hill has actually condemned the New South Wales Rugby League for its willingness to continue to accept sponsorship from the Winfield company and has said it is immoral and improper. The Rugby League has had the effrontery to threaten to take his team out of the competition, or something like that. Those who read the Sun-Herald last Sunday would have seen a very distasteful article with a couple of quite inappropriate comments, one of them by the President of the Cronulla Sutherland Rugby League Club. Mr Hill is right in what he says. He is expressing a responsible community point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the minute or two remaining to me I wish to respond to some of the things Senator Collins said on behalf of the Government. I am pleased that the Government is considering a package to try to close this loophole. I put it to the Minister that his response does not hold much water. I do not think the existence of sponsorship on its own is sufficient to justify inaction by the Government or to justify resistance by the Opposition. To support the amendments now would in no way prevent action later on if one wished to take different action to make that package more coherent and consistent. To agree to these amendments now would put the tobacco companies on notice. What is more, they expect this battle to be lost. All that is in doubt is the timing. </PARA>
<PARA> If the commencement date proposed by Senator Powell is a problem, just tell us and we will propose an amendment now, on the floor of the Committee, that is suitable for the Government. I have it drafted and ready, if that is the problem. However, to refuse to take action now is to prevent or to delay the taking of effective action at any time. This amendment establishes no new principle whatsoever. The principle in question has been confirmed by the Senate twice. All that Senator Powell is trying to do is to close a notorious loophole in the legislation. She is quite right to propose the amendment she has moved. It will be my pleasure to support it and to continue to support the cause on which it is based for as long as I can. </PARA>

The fact that today 88 per cent of those it affects are male homosexuals, 4 per cent are drug addicts and another 8 per cent comprise haemophiliacs and people who have contracted the disease from other causes, and the fact that it is a disease called AIDS, resulted in the Government spending $100m a year trying to prevent it. The other interesting thing about the disease is that there is a long lag period between the development of the infection and death. What do we get in regard to that disease? We get television advertisements advising males to wear condoms. That advertising has occurred and permeates our community. One cannot watch television on any night without seeing it. Fifty years ago another disease was recognised as being due to cigarette smoking. In the last eight years, 152,000 people have died as a result of that disease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite interesting. What has been the effect in the community? If one looks at our taxation Bills, one finds that we actually devote money to the development of the tobacco industry in Australia. Taxation money is allocated to assist research and development in the tobacco industry. This disease kills 19,000 people a year in Australia and affects both sexes equally. However, females in the past were a little backward in taking up cigarette smoking to the same degree, so that their death rate lagged about 20 years behind that of males. The fascinating thing is that this year-1990-the death rate in Australia from lung cancer in young females is exceeding the death rate from breast cancer. That has never before occurred in the history of Australia, and it is also occurring in the rest of the Western world. What are we doing? We are spending money on mammography units to detect breast cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tobacco companies spend about $100m a year on advertising. It is spurious to say they are doing that for the good of the community. To quote the American Surgeon-General's report is merely to quote the fact that there is insufficient scientific evidence to draw the conclusion. One does not have to be a scientist; one needs only to have a bit of common sense. The tobacco companies are not giving away that $100m just to be pleasant to the community; they are spending $40 for every dollar spent on the communication of the health problems caused by smoking. </PARA>
<PARA> Tobacco smoking is an addiction. It is a toxic and ultimately a lethal substance. More importantly, passive smoking affects non-smokers; 17 per cent of lung cancers in non-smokers are attributable to passive smoking. It is thought to cause about 150 such deaths each year. The interesting aspect of that is that compensation actions for lung cancer due to asbestosis have been successful. Lawyers are increasingly confident of success in seeking compensation for illnesses caused by passive smoking in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 132 children who start smoking in Australia every day, 32 will die from tobacco caused disease. What would Senator Collins say to the parents of those children about the delay in dealing with the matter? Does he say, `Let's wait a year; let's wait a bit longer'? Action is needed now; the time has passed. This disease has been recognised for 50 years. We can correct it, or attempt to correct it now, put it in the too hard basket, or put it off because there are significant forces acting against it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most serious aspects of the disease is that one-third-and if I can influence anybody here today, I will do so by citing this statistic-of people diagnosed with lung cancer die within three months of that diagnosis. We do not have the time, nor do we have the luxury that time might allow, to help those people. </PARA>
<PARA> Smoking causes not only cancer of the lung, but also cancers of the pharynx and of the larynx. When my hospital surveyed 240 people with cancer of the back of the pharynx and back of the larynx-a dreadful cancer which is almost impossible to cure-it found that there were no non-smokers in the group; they were all cigarette smokers. </PARA>

We all get worried about global warming and the greenhouse effect. These matters have received a lot of attention and there are conferences on them. Yet tobacco smoking is the largest killer in the world today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop mentioned to me before the effects of pollution in relation to motor vehicle emissions. The reality is that cigarette smoking is a self-induced condition. The Fraser Government banned direct cigarette advertising on radio and television in 1976. The Hawke Government will ban all print advertising from 28 December. This amendment is to remove the phrase that permits incidental advertising of cigarettes, which has been exploited by cigarette companies. Tobacco is the only legal consumer product linked to death when used as the manufacturer intended. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also argued that it has not been proved that advertising has an influence on young people. A review of a national survey of smoking in 12- to 14-year-olds shows that their smoking habit is strongly related to cigarette sponsorship of sporting events. For example, in Queensland and New South Wales, where Winfield achieved enormous advertising exposure by sponsoring Rugby League, nearly half the 12- to 14-year-old smokers smoked Winfield cigarettes. The argument is put that all this survey shows is brand differentiation. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, in South Australia hardly any 12- to 14year-old smokers smoked Winfield. Instead, they smoked Escort-the high profile sponsor of South Australia's popular football code, Aussie Rules. Again, by way of contrast, Escort did not even rate in the other States where it lacked a sport sponsorship profile. Similarly, at the time of the survey, Peter Jackson and Winfield were involved in sports sponsorship in Victoria, and this is reflected in the cigarette choice of children smoking in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Cigarette companies are spending millions of dollars promoting smoking by their advertising and sports sponsorship. This clever marketing technique ensures that when our children look up to their sporting heroes they see them associated with cigarettes-all part of creating a climate of social acceptance of smoking. Children's peer group pressure to smoke, of course, thrives in that climate. </PARA>
<PARA> The link between kids' smoking and sports sponsorship is also why it is so important that parliamentarians close the loophole currently allowing cigarette companies to advertise on television under the guise of sports sponsorship. I applaud the Australian Soccer League's decision to ban tobacco company sponsorship. It has found alternative sponsorship, and so can Rugby League. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian, South Australian and Australian Capital Territory governments are already returning a proportion of their tobacco levy through health promotion funds to help the people in those States. In my own State, unfortunately, the tobacco levy is only 30 per cent while in each of the other States it has risen to 50 per cent, except in New South Wales where it is 35 per cent. This is despite strong evidence showing that an increase in the price of cigarettes helps discourage children from smoking. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is urgent because, of the 15,000 children taking up smoking this year, one-quarter will die prematurely from smoking-related diseases. Meanwhile, the funding gap of sport will be filled from the tobacco levy, so that sport not only regains its healthy image but also retains its financial viability. </PARA>
<PARA> I too applaud David Hill for the stand that he has taken. I commend the amendment. It will not be the answer to all the problems I have outlined. It is one small step in that direction. As Mao Tse-Tung said, the beginning of a thousand miles begins with the first step. That first step was taken in 1976. The appalling aspect of the situation is that it is 14 years later that we are taking another step in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA> I would like to say something about a matter that Senator Herron referred to. Trying to define the effect of advertising is something that Senator Alston alluded to. I have to say that I thought his position was very effectively and totally demolished by Senator Peter Baume. Senator Alston would probably concede that too. Senator Herron put the rhetorical question: what can be said to parents who allow their children to continue smoking? I think it has an appallingly direct influence. I personally would be appalled if my children took up the habit because I have no doubt that it kills us. Even if there is an argument about whether or not it kills us, I do not think that anyone could seriously put forward the view that smoking cigarettes enhances our sporting prowess. I do not think that even tobacco companies would be cheeky enough to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I constantly say to parents that one of the best things we as parents who do not want to see our children smoking cigarettes can do is to stop smoking cigarettes ourselves. I know many people who consistently say to their children, `I smoke and I will continue to smoke, but that is only because I cannot stop it, and it is not something I want you to do'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I want to enter this debate in my role as shadow Minister for sport. I am a non-smoker and an anti-smoker and certainly find nothing particularly attractive about the linking of sport with cigarette smoking, which is clearly an unhealthy habit. However, I am concerned about the method of approaching this problem that is evident in this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point has been made, and I want to stress it, that this amendment bans television, not cigarette advertising. The simple problem exists that sporting people-and they have made it very clear-are locked into contractual arrangements in terms of advertising, in many cases for many years ahead. Those contractual arrangements presumably would stand in the event of such an amendment being passed. </PARA>

<PARA> If society is concerned about cigarette advertising and wants either to ban the product or to ban the advertising, it has a task of banning the advertising. If we ban the televising of that advertising, then the contractual arrangements, which have nothing to do with broadcasting, which exist between the sporting bodies and the advertisers to have these signs around ovals stand. Unless they are broken, unless the contracts change, or unless the sponsorships change-unless changes are made by law-then those contractual arrangements stand. The simple consequence is that the televising is illegal and the televising cannot take place. While those contracts exist the people of Australia will be deprived of getting the televised sports which are sponsored--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Archer said, they can die instead. If he wants to make that interjection that is fine. If we want to fix this problem there is a better, more sensible, more rational and more effective way of doing so. All we will do if we pass this amendment is make it illegal to have those television programs, not to have the signs around the playing fields, on the playing fields or on people's jerseys or shirts. That is the essence of this debate. If we are opposed to cigarette advertising, as I am, if we are opposed to the smoking of cigarettes, as I am, do we approach the matter in this muddle-headed way or in a more effective way?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has said about adopting a serious approach to try to find the best way to handle this matter is far better than doing what is proposed at the moment. I want to stress that. It will still be the Winfield Cup, whether this amendment is passed or not. All that will happen is that the Winfield Cup will not be capable of being televised. If the Australian Democrats or anyone else have some good way to find out how we can pay out those contracts, how we can get rid of them legally, then I think it would be useful to have that sort of arrangement prepared before we just knock off the advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final point I want to make, which relates to alternative funding. Soccer football has been funded very successfully by QUIT. That is an example of a useful way in which alternative funding can take place. However, there are limitations in this regard. I picked that as a good example. However, there are bad examples of the way in which governmental bodies hand out other peoples' money. I have some difficulty in establishing the merit of some of the payments made by the Victorian and South Australian bodies that have been collecting this money. I am not saying that the lack of merit in some of those payments is enough to damage the whole concept; all I want to say is that problems arise when we get governmental bodies with a capacity for patronage with other people's money, often based on criteria which I have difficulty finding particularly interesting, attractive or rational. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, I do not want to enter the debate on the case of whether or not the advertisers are seeking to get new smokers or convert existing smokers. That is a problem on which I cannot pretend to be an expert. Probably on balance they are getting new smokers. I guess they would not be doing it if they were not, although, on the other hand, many of the sponsorships have come from cigarette companies whose share of the market has been continually falling. To that extent a lot of the sponsorships may be very defensive `advertising' in terms of holding their market share. So there is some argument in either case. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, I conclude by saying that, if we want to ban advertising, let us do so, but I am not in favour of banning televised sport, and that is what this amendment does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find this issue one of principle which simply comes down to a question of whether or not we are using censorship to try to enforce a point of view that a particular group within the society holds. I speak as one who gave up smoking some 16 years ago, but I am also one who will defend the right of another to have a cigarette. I believe that those people who want to convince others that they should either stop smoking or not ever take it up ought to rely on the strength and merit of their own argument, not try to enforce their point of view through the curtailment of the right to advertise what is a legal product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I listened to Senator Herron's speech, it occurred to me that he was making a plea to ban the sale and use of tobacco, rather than directing his attention to the question of whether or not one is entitled to advertise what is a legal product. Senator Peter Baume had a word or two to say about what constitutes a legal product. I think he was talking about what limitations are placed upon the sale of a product-be it cigarettes, alcohol or a range of other products. It concerns me that there are always within our society some people who think they are better able to tell other people how they ought to live their lives rather than letting them make up their own minds for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> This also applies to credit. Some people might say that they are entitled to make a judgment about how somebody ought to be able to use credit. I have heard that argument put forward on the same basis and with the same passion as the argument adopted by people who wish to curtail the advertising of cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways, one can look at the question of tobacco advertising as being the thin edge of the wedge. That same group of people who want to say what one can or cannot advertise in respect of tobacco also would very often like to introduce similar restrictions on alcohol advertising or, indeed, on confectionery advertising-and we have already seen a move from the consumer groups to put limitations upon the times when the makers of confectionery such as Lifesavers or Mars Bars are able to advertise their products. </PARA>

<PARA> I do not wish to take the time of the Committee unduly. I wish to respond particularly to one aspect of the Minister's statements, and that is that the Government is not ready because the financial details have not yet been sorted out. There is no alternative. He is actually saying that 12 months is not enough for this Government to set up, for instance, a health promotion foundation of the kind that was set up in Victoria, Western Australian, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. I point out to the Minister that in Victoria alone this year, $20m is being provided for health promotion activities and for sports sponsorship in lieu of tobacco sponsorship. Yet, the Minister is telling us that the Government cannot do it in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that negotiations are proceeding at this very moment. Perhaps we can give him a chance and delay consideration of the legislation for a day or two. Perhaps he can make some unheard of progress and can get this legislation through after all. But there are other ways of dealing with this matter as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Some two weeks ago we were provided with statistical evidence which shows quite clearly that in real terms cigarettes now, in 1990, cost less than they cost in the 1940s. In our alternative Budget, when I suggested that the excise on tobacco and alcohol should be raised by 40 per cent to yield $1.1 billion, the thought was expressed that this was excessive. Yet we are prepared to accept a lower price in real terms than we had in the 1940s. </PARA>

He talked about the restrictions on the advertising of certain products. What he did not say was that those products in themselves are restricted in their sale. In particular, the pharmaceutical goods Senator Baume was referring to are obtained primarily by prescriptions and guns can be obtained only by citizens achieving an appropriate and proper licence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to condoms in a minute because that is something else that was raised earlier on. I am an ex-smoker. Whenever one argues a position on cigarette advertising these days, one finds oneself saying `I am an ex-smoker' in the same way that when one debates South Africa one must start off by saying, `I am opposed to apartheid'. It is absurd, but that is really where we are because there are so many intellectually arrogant people in the world who know what is right and what is wrong. I do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently I have spent more time in the oncology section of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital than I ever want to for the rest of my life. I have seen young mothers dying of lung cancer, leaving behind a young husband and father with little children. I have seen the despair on their faces as they go to visit their mothers. I have seen young men in there for no other reason than that they insisted on smoking cigarettes, no doubt beginning because of peer pressure and no doubt because of advertising. One sees in such places not only the social cost but the personal cost, the individual cost, as a result of people choosing the right that society allows them to smoke cigarettes. This matter of society's tolerance of the consumption of some products which inevitably and inexorably lead to death goes to the heart of the debate, but time will not allow me now to pursue that now. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Bishop, I find myself confronted in part with a question which many others have resolved. It is this: is it morally and intellectually sustainable to argue that there is intrinsic merit in the concept that society may judge something suitable and appropriate, and therefore legal for consumption, but which is sufficiently contrary to the public good that we judge it ought not therefore be allowed to be publicised or, to put it another way, to be advertised? That is something that I have some difficulty with. Senator Peter Baume gave some examples. What is the role of government in making judgments about the public good? What determinations do we make when we legalise alcohol or cigarettes but make it illegal for marijuana or other hard drugs or for other products? What is the threshold merit point where government decides one is acceptable and one is not acceptable?</PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard a proper sensible argument, except that other countries do it, as to why we should not have foreign ownership in television; in the same way, I have never heard anybody stand up in this chamber and argue a proposition as to how we determine the threshold. People can argue certain subjective moral propositions or can argue the general social cost to the community or the economic cost to the community, which is distributed across innocent people who are in no way involved in decision making. They can argue ethical standards or argue that governments have a responsibility to reflect the wider social mores and norms of community. But there are those, such as Senator Peter Baume and others, who will argue the intrinsic libertarian rights of individuals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, I feel as though I am in a bird cage; every time I turn around I hear, `Cheep, cheep, cheep' behind me. Senator Herron made a very compelling point. He put it to us that cigarettes are the one product that will lead to death if they are consumed in the prescribed form and manner which is set out by the manufacturer. That does not necessarily carry the whole argument, but it is an important crutch in the view that is put by Senator Herron.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume talked about seat belts. In Western Australia when seat belts were first made compulsory, putting aside the social and economic cost, I looked for an argument that could persuade me that any individual should be compelled to belt up. When we get to the heart of that argument, we cannot find one except that the government is telling us what is in our best interests. That is quite different from the case of a child or somebody else who does not have a capacity to make a judgment. When society tells us we have to wear a seat belt, it is making decisions about what is in the individual good. </PARA>
<PARA> Cigarette smoking does not cause lung cancer for everybody and does not inexorably lead to death by cancer for everybody. If it could be demonstrated that anal sex inevitably led to AIDS or had a high risk of leading to AIDS, would we take ourselves back into the trees and into the caves and argue that anal sex ought be illegal? It is essentially the same argument, though not one that is politically acceptable to some, because the comparisons are in some respects unpleasant for some people. But essentially the same argument might well be put. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I read and from those I listen to, there is no question, in my view, that smoking can cause lung cancer and can cause death. Yet just some months ago in the Charles Gairdner Hospital I was talking to a lady from the little city of Bunbury in Western Australia; she was dying of lung cancer and she had her young family around her. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is it expected that Japan will allow increased imports of foreign beef next year?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Japan is already Australia's second largest market for our beef exports, taking around $900m worth in 1989. The liberalisation of the Japanese beef market that was agreed to in 1988 does offer considerable long term benefits for the Australian beef industry. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) believes that Australian beef exports to Japan could double by 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia and Japan negotiated a beef access agreement in June 1988 which provides for the abolition of Japan's global beef import quota from 1 April 1991. Part of the agreement was its replacement by an ad valorem tariff which will phase down from 70 to 50 per cent over the succeeding three years. The agreement also provided for increases in Japan's beef import quotas between 1988 and 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> The more generous transitional arrangements now in force have permitted a significant increase in Australian exports of beef to Japan. There were over 176,000 tonnes in 1989, which was an increase of 30 per cent over the previous year. This represents 17 per cent of total Australian production and 30 per cent of total exports for that year. Exports for 1990 are expected to be 200,000 tonnes. There is some uncertainty currently in the Jap- anese beef market, although this is to be expected in the lead-up to April next year and until the market settles down after liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA> The opening up of the Japanese market provides the Australian beef industry with enormous opportunities, but the market will be very competitive and success will be as a result of our capacity to provide Japanese consumers with the right product at the right price. It is encouraging to see that efforts are being made to develop the type of beef products desired by the Japanese market, including the significant expansion of the feedlot industry which produces grain fed beef.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also a matter of effective promotion. In this respect, I make the final point that the AMLC is involved in a comprehensive program of promotional activities which are designed to increase Japan's awareness and consumption of Australian beef. In fact, around $20m will be spent on promoting Australian beef in Japan this financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would mind my own business if I were Senator Hill. I will answer the question put to me; I will not be drawn into answering interjections by Senator Hill. Last Friday, in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission court room No. 1 in Sydney, the heads of the State industrial relations tribunals were elevated to the level of Deputy President in the Federal Industrial Relations Commission. Two commissioners, in this case from the Western Australian State Industrial Relations Commission, were made commissioners of the Federal Industrial Relations Commission. Bryan Noakes of the Confederation of Australian Industry, appearing on behalf of the employers, in the ceremony described the occasion as the `most important reform of the Commission since the introduction of a Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1904'. Martin Ferguson, representing the Australian Council of Trade Unions, described the ceremony as historic. The heads of the tribunals who have been elevated to the Federal bench echoed the remarks of both Noakes and Ferguson when they presented their formal views to the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is another occasion when the Government has advanced by further micro-economic reform. Australia now has seven industrial relations authorities-one in each of the six States and, of course, the Federal Commission. We have taken the heads of each of the State tribunals and appointed them to the Federal Commission. The State governments have undertaken to amend the State Acts to appoint deputy presidents of the Federal Commission to their own benches, thus merging the six States with the Commonwealth structure to create, in a constitutional Federation, a national arbitration system. That is a significant reform. It was a reform first pointed to by the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems conducted under the auspices of this Government early in its term. It is a reform supported by legislation introduced by Ralph Willis when he was Minister for Industrial Relations. It is also a reform supported by the industrial relations Ministers of each of the six States and myself when, at a meeting in April this year, we resolved on this course of action.</PARA>
<PARA> It is now intended that we locate the courts and the chambers of the Federal commissions with the State commissions in each of the States; that we form joint registries; that we join their libraries and electronic information retrieval systems; and that we put together the inspectorates of both the Commonwealth and the State.</PARA>
<PARA> The names of those elevated in the ceremony were: in the case of New South Wales, Mr Justice William Fisher, President of the New South Wales Industrial Commission; in the case of Queensland, Senior Commissioner Lionel Ledlie, of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission; in the case of South Australia, Mr Justice Brian Stanley, President of the Industrial Court and Commission of South Australia; in the case of Tasmania, Mr Fred Westwood, President of the Industrial Relations Commission of Tasmania; in the case of Western Australia, Mr Bill Coleman, Chief Commissioner, Mr Gary Halliwell, Commissioner, and Mr Jack Gregor, Commissioner, all of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission; in the case of Victoria, Mr Justice Alan Boulton, who serves concurrently as a Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, having previously been appointed President of the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that Senator Loosley made a speech in the adjournment debate last week in which he said that, on that day 100 years ago, the New South Wales Labor Council carried a resolution which led to the formation of the Australian Labor Party. In the same resolution, they called for the establishment of arbitration as `a better way of settling industrial conflict in Australia than by strike action'. That resolution is the historic foundation of the Australian innovation in industrial relations of an arbitration system and of a conciliation commission. This reform continues as part of the same vision that the original founders of the system sought.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell's question has no doubt been prompted by another press release on the subject from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) in the last day or so which once again seeks to distort the truth about aid funding in recent years. I do not mind, indeed I welcome, robust public lobbying from the Agency for International Development (AID) and other groups on this subject, but petulant whingeing based on a deliberate distortion of known facts is not calculated to win hearts and minds, and it has not won my heart or my mind on this occasion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I would request that you ask the Minister not to mumble. He is the Minister for mumbles. I am afraid it is impossible to hear what he has to say or know whether it is relevant. Would you ask him to speak up, please?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been accused of a lot of things in my life, but mumbling has not been one of them. Let me repeat for the benefit of the Senate the facts on the level of aid funding. Over the last four years the level of aid has stayed reasonably constant in real terms. The only exception to that was in 1988-89, when there was a significant increase in the level of aid funding when some payments to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank were brought forward, as Senator Powell says, from 1989-90; that is, the $100m she was talking about as payments to those international financial institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important thing to appreciate about that bringing forward is that the $100m in question was not part of the Forward Estimates for 1989-90; it was a one-off payment about which there was anticipated to be very great difficulty in the expected budgetary circumstances of that year, and there was a very real risk that that money would not be able to be found in 1989-90 at all, whereas it was able in the last months of 1988-89 to be incorporated in the outgoings for that year because of a shortfall that had occurred elsewhere in government expenditure. That fact was very well known and appreciated by the aid lobby, including ACFOA, with which I discussed the matter at the time. In constant 1988-1989 prices, the real levels of Australian overseas development assistance (ODA) have been, for 1987-88, $1,111.3m; for 1988-89, $1,194.6m; for 1989-90, $1,102.4m, and for 1990-91, $1,119.5m.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1990-91 Budget provided for an aid budget increase of 1.6 per cent in real terms, and that was in fact greater than the average increase in Commonwealth outlays. Might I also say that the Prime Minister made a commitment to maintain the level of aid funding in real terms in the 1990-91 Budget. That commitment has been met, and to suggest, as ACFOA does and as Senator Powell repeats, that the 1989-90 figure should have been artificially inflated is to extend some kind of statistical theory simply beyond reason. Because those arguments are both logically and statistically flawed, Senator Powell's question as to whether the 1989-90 budget might have been considered to be higher than it was is simply irrelevant to the question of whether the Government's commitment has been met.</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that there is any truth at all in ACFOA's claims, it is that some program elements have had to be curtailed this financial year to accommodate yet another unanticipated-at least in the Forward Estimates-drawdown of moneys due to the international financial institutions, again of the order this year of some $100m. We have had to find an extra $100m this year-we did not get a supplementation to make that possible, other than as to about $30m of that. That has meant a $70m problem elsewhere in the aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Those effects have not been as dire, nonetheless, as has been claimed by ACFOA and the aid lobby, and, certainly, claims that poverty alleviation and the environment have borne the brunt of cuts are quite untrue. In fact, expenditure on the environment in particular is actually increasing.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, ACFOA's assertion-and the last part of Senator Powell's question-that emergency assistance to Ethiopia will be cut by 24 per cent is really quite dangerously misleading. It is incorrectly based on a comparison of allocations to Ethiopia so far this year with a total allocation for last year. Emergency assistance to Ethiopia or anywhere else is allocated throughout the year as needs arise, and at this stage last year $6.3m had been allocated to Ethiopia, compared with $9.3m so far this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been pressures on the aid budget this year as a result of these unforeseen, unanticipated-at least as to timing-drawdowns from the international financial institutions, and that has created problems for us. But they are nothing like the pressures that would have been there for the aid program had the Opposition been in government. What needs to be appreciated is that in addition to all the matters that we are talking about here, the Opposition went into the last election with a clear-cut commitment to slash an additional $100m off the aid budget, on top of all the commitments, on top of all the obligations to the international institutions. So instead of talking about a $100m problem this year for the aid budget as a result of those additional drawdowns, there would have been a $200m problem.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish Senator Powell, the aid lobby and everyone else around the place who whinges about this particular problem would direct just a little of their enthusiasm when it comes to such whingeing to the people who really deserve it, those on the other side, who have no understanding of, no commitment to and no compassion for those people to whom this whole aid budget is directed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to confirm to the Senate, as has been widely reported in the media over the last two or three days, that at their meeting in Chile, the Antarctic Treaty parties last week all accepted a commitment to negotiate a prohibition on mining activities and a new legal instrument setting out a comprehensive environmental protection regime for the Antarctic. The Treaty parties adopted as a basis of negotiation a text which states that-and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Any activities relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That text was slightly unusual to the extent that that language was then followed by three dots, which rather conveys the notion that at least some nations do not necessarily accept that as being the last word on the subject, but we know that; it is a negotiating text. The important thing is that the starting language of that text is couched in terms of the absolute prohibition, as I have just described it.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously we will need to guard against continuing moves to qualify those clear words, but the important point again is that acceptance of them, even in this form, represents a very real move in our direction by countries such as the United Kingdom which, as I mentioned in my answer as recently as last week, were opposing us. All told, the outcome is really quite a remarkable advance since the Government took its decision last year to seek a ban on mining and a new instrument to preserve forever Antarctica as a nature reserve, a land of science.</PARA>
<PARA> The resolution adopted a few days ago at the general assembly in Perth of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) supporting our initiative is one more piece of evidence, if one were necessary, of the ground swell of world opinion in favour of protection of the Antarctic environment.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision in Chile is a very important achievement for Australia, France and our supporters. I also say that it is a tribute to the Australian negotiating team at that meeting led by our chief Antarctic negotiator, now the High Commissioner to Singapore, Alan Brown. A further session will be held in Madrid next April which will provide the opportunity to consolidate the process that we and our partners have made by developing effective compliance provisions in the new instrument. Much difficult negotiation does remain ahead of us to build an effective final instrument. However, there is now an agreement for this to be done and one that starts from the working assumption that mining and oil drilling will be prohibited.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is such an important matter that the earliest it gets on record, it may have some influence and impact, even in Western Australia. I think every hour is useful in this particular situation. The Australian Securities Commission has made clear to the Western Australian Government, the Opposition, and the business community that it will ensure that the Western Australian regional office has all powers with respect to corporate regulation and enforcement that the ASC itself has. That office will be expected to exercise those powers in a coordinated way, consistent with ASC national operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is also worth while noting that a regional office and business centre will be established in each State capital and there are undertakings as to the current level of services being maintained. In order to ensure that is the case, we know that State Ministers are given particular rights of access to the Australian Securities Commission. They are entitled to raise complaints at ministerial meetings about the levels of service and to receive Commonwealth responses within one month. These are not complaints that will be allowed to sit on the shelf. There will be a response from the Commonwealth within one month if in fact a complaint is made by a State Minister. The role of State Ministers is a very fundamental one which complements the way in which the ASC and the companies and securities legislation have been constructed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also undertaken to ensure appointment of a member from each State to the advisory committee and legal subcommittee. I believe that will be crucial too.

I am glad the question has been asked because at the root of the question is one of the difficulties with operating on the waterfront, not just in Australia but anywhere around the world. That is in respect of idle time and the fluctuating nature of that particular industry, because there is not a single port in the world that does not have an element of idle time. The industry in fact operates that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time the in-principle agreement was negotiated, interestingly enough-despite the many widely exaggerated claims about what occurs on the waterfront-there was a national shortage of labour; a desperate shortage of labour on the waterfront. Even now, when there is a national surplus of labour on the waterfront as a direct result of the Government's deliberate policies in terms of cooling down the economy and trying to restrict imports, there are ports around Australia where a demand for labour still exists.</PARA>

I drew the attention of the Senate to this matter months ago; that is, that the waterfront was the front-line industry which noticed the downturn in the economy first. That is old news; that is hardly new news. At the moment there is a serious problem with idle time on the waterfront. Again, this is not a new problem. There are a number of redundancy schemes in existence, which I am sure Senator Parer is fully across, that have dealt with this matter in the past: a voluntary redundancy scheme which provides 57 per cent redundancies and a voluntary compulsory redundancy scheme, known as the Robinson formula, provides for 70 per cent redundancies which have been used consistently over the last 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

The AEWL, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and other interested parties, including WIRA, have held a series of meetings over the last two to three weeks which have addressed this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I have made it fundamentally clear on behalf of the Government in respect of all of these negotiations that no consideration will be given to providing for redundancies, unless enterprise agreements are negotiated which deliver the level of reform that the Government is looking for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Sherry for his question. Having a question asked by a Tasmanian senator of a Tasmanian Federal Minister is very apt because today the Tasmanian Parliament finished the process of putting into place fair trading legislation, thus concluding the Australia-wide protection of consumers in relation to matters of great concern to them. The legislation at both Federal and State levels covers such issues as misleading or deceptive conduct, false or misleading representations, product safety and information, conditions and warranties, bait advertising, pyramid selling and disclosure of the cash price. I believe the Tasmanian Parliament is to be commended for coming to this situation, albeit lately, because it puts in place Australia-wide the sort of protection which so many Australians, particularly on the mainland, have been able to take for granted for so long. I pay particular tribute to Mrs Fran Bladel, the Minister for Administrative Services and Consumer Affairs in Tasmania, who eventually got the support of the Legislative Council, the upper House in Tasmania, to pass this important legislation on behalf of Tasmanian consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government does strongly support uniform consumer protection legislation. It is quite clear that differences and conflicts between legislation in various jurisdictions can pose real problems for business and result in confusion for consumers. I believe that costs can be reduced for business and the community if we have uniform laws and regulations in this regard. It has taken some two decades to get to this point, but I believe that consumer affairs is one area where, given the integration of the Australian economy and the great mobility of the Australian population, it is important that people moving from State to State understand that there is available to them the same regime of protections when they engage in making their purchases of goods and services in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is only the beginning of the process. Tasmania, along with all other States, will shortly be putting in place uniform legislation to protect consumers in their role as consumers of credit services. I believe that this also will be extremely important, particularly as to the disclosure of the real costs to those seeking the benefit of credit of entering into arrangements whereby they have that particular facility extended to them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport. Does the Minister agree that the proposal of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) for a pay-as-you-go road use charging scheme for private vehicles, under which standing registration fees would be replaced by a revenue neutral increase in petrol excise, would send price signals which would encourage energy conservation without increasing inflation? Can the Minister inform the Senate whether this proposal on private vehicles was discussed at the recent Special Premiers Conference? Does the fact that only the Commission's proposal for new road use charges for heavy vehicles was endorsed in the final conference communique indicate that its proposed charging scheme for private vehicles has been dropped by the Federal Government? If not, what is the status of the proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt that the adoption of such a scheme would give those signals. That would be a by-product of the process by which they were negotiated because the particular matter that the honourable senator raises-and I think it is a very relevant one-was not actually part of the deliberations of the ISC. It related more particularly to rationalising the current fragmented nature of registration to bring about what the ISC report identified as being potential savings of up to $2 billion a year for the national economy. No doubt, fortuitously, it probably would have that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premiers Conference initiative of the Prime Minister has to some extent overtaken, as I am sure the honourable senator is aware, the process that was already in place through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the conference of State and Federal transport Ministers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A report by Dr Garry Egger into sports injuries, which was carried out under the national better health program, suggests that the costs of sports injuries, which include indirect costs such as absenteeism from work, et cetera, are now running at around $1 billion per year. That figure includes activities which go beyond organised competitive sport and needs to be considered in context. For example, the annual health costs associated with the effects of smoking and physical inactivity are $3 billion a year and $3 1/2 billion a year respectively. Major causes of sports injuries are deficient training and preparation, overtraining, and playing on inadequate surfaces. Clearly, those sports involving body contact or strain on particular parts of the body such as ankles and knees have a higher incidence of injury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years the Sports Commission has contributed about $20,000, through the Australian Sports Medicine Federation, for the production of booklets and other material to educate coaches and players. Sixteen thousand coaches have been put through the national sports trainers scheme, which includes showing them ways to minimise sports injury. Sixteen thousand coaches is not a bad figure.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission, through the national sports research program, has funded specific studies into injuries in netball, rugby, gymnastics, softball and cricket. The Australian Institute of Sport sports medicine centre of the Sports Commission has undertaken specific prevention programs which have contributed to a reduction of injuries in netball, basketball, athletics, swimming, tennis and rowing. Prevention of injuries is an essential component in all Institute programs and for all of the 55 sports covered by the national sports program.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is currently examining the Egger report in consultation with the Confederation of Australian Sport Inc. and the Australian Sports Medicine Federation to determine future action and funding requirements. Ideas are being developed for more extensive education programs. Discussions with those sports particularly prone to injuries regarding rule changes are being conducted. The Government regards this as a serious issue and, through the Sports Commission and the Department of Community Services and Health, will build on the work already done and develop a program to minimise sport injuries in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday Senator Calvert asked whether I had concerns about a recent report in the Australian that councils are selling up people's homes to recover bad debts and whether the Commonwealth Department intended to do anything about it. I have now seen the article to which Senator Calvert referred.</PARA>
<PARA>I am of course concerned about the possibility of people losing their homes because of their inability to pay local rates.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of rates collections however is not a matter for the Commonwealth-it is a matter for the councils and State governments. There is no data available on numbers of ratepayers against which councils have taken action, and the situation is further complicated by the need to distinguish between residential, investment and commercial properties. I would urge those councils which have not yet done so to view any inability to meet rates sympathetically and to introduce more flexible arrangements for their payment. Many councils have, of course, already implemented such arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>We recognise that current economic circumstances are proving difficult for many Australians and are causing significant pain. However the lowering of interest rates over the last few months and the forthcoming tax cuts will go some way to easing this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>Local government, like the Commonwealth and the States, has had to shoulder its part of the burden of economic restraint.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite this, the Commonwealth has continued to provide significant financial assistance to local government. An estimated $1.2 billion will be provided this financial year, which comprises nearly one fifth of ordinary council revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>In some cases local government may need to put its own house in order. I note a weekend media report that a spokesman for the Premier of New South Wales has said that a State inquiry into local government spending had uncovered poor management practices and that councils in financial difficulty would be encouraged to improve their performance instead of asking the Government to throw money at the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me also take this opportunity to clarify what I said yesterday about financial assistance for local government.</PARA>
<PARA>Financial assistance grants are provided under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act-this Act allows the Minister to review the legislation after 30 June 1992, in consultation with the States and local government.</PARA>
<PARA>A decision on whether any such formal review will take place will be made closer to the event.</PARA>
<PARA>The current operation of the Act is presently being monitored by a group of Commonwealth, State and local government officials, at the request of Commonwealth and State Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>These officials are focussing on a number of issues, including the scope for allocating some financial assistance on the basis of a council's efficiency-a move which would be consistent with the principles of microeconomic reform.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman's question in the Senate on 5 December 1990 noted that the contract for the surgical and diagnostic redevelopment project at Concord Hospital involved a settlement of approximately $5 million in December 1989. She has tried to relate this to inadequate management practices within the department and in particular in the costing of the project, cash flow management and in not providing appropriate architectural advice or ensuring adequate supervision during construction.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that the settlement arose from claims which occurred during the progress of the contract for changes to the scope of works and disruptions to the contractor's program for construction of the project. The work had gone to tender in late 1985 with documents which had aimed to tightly control the scope and cost of the project. The documents for this project were prepared by private sector consultants.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, changes were required to maintain hospital functions and by variations to accommodate developments in medical technology and practice in regard to control of AIDS and hepatitis ``B''. I am advised that these changes were compounded by some deficiencies in the documents, variations arising from existing building conditions unknown until the building structure was progressively exposed and on site industrial disputes relating to asbestos removal and a perceived safety hazard from Legionnaire's Disease.</PARA>
<PARA>Under a lump sum price contract, all these issues became matters of dispute and claim under the contract which can only be settled by negotiation or arbitration. To the extent that ACS was responsible for managing the works and administering the contract, it was party to the eventual level of claims received.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I am advised that the AC on-site team managing the project throughout its duration, made every effort to tightly control the works in the interests of the client and the Commonwealth. There was no culpable failure in management practices relating to cost control, cash flow management, architectural advice or supervision during construction.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the financial consequences of all the problems relating to such a project only emerge when the contract is being finalised. The level of claims on this project reflected the complexity of the project and the problems occurring during construction.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Office of Australian War Graves (OAWG) is currently constructing a garden of remembrance at Rookwood Cemetery NSW. The new garden is estimated to cost $6.0M and is scheduled for completion by Christmas 1990 and will provide for 100,000 plaques.</PARA>
<PARA>The contract, with a total commitment of 3.8 million dollars was let to Girvan (NSW) Proprietary Limited in August 1988 with an anticipated completion date of 17 July 1989. Progress in the first half of 1989 was extremely slow due to a combination of abnormally wet weather, brick supply problems, low productivity and severe industrial disputation.</PARA>
<PARA>The works were temporarily suspended on 4 July 1989 to allow the work to be redesigned to permit the incorporation of different bricks.</PARA>
<PARA>The suspension was lifted on 25 October 1989 and the resumed work proceeded well until Girvan went into receivership on 30 January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>R. N. Cooper Constructions Proprietary Limited were subsequently engaged to provide a temporary construction management service to enable work to continue and avoid further industrial problems. Coopers commenced work on site on 16 February 1990 and work proceeded well until wet weather in April 1990 hampered progress.</PARA>
<PARA>After the Department of Finance approved an increase in authorisation to 6.0 million dollars in order to complete the project, a lump sum contract was signed with Cooper on 6 July 1990 and a contract completion date set for 25 September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Coopers have subsequently experienced delays resulting from wet weather combined with safety, industrial and sub-contractors problems. This has resulted in progress being slower than anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA>Coopers current program schedules completion by Christmas 1990 provided no problems are encountered. Based on current known claims and variations the project will be completed within the current authorisation figure of $6.0m.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the contractor has intimated that he may pursue claims for delay costs but at this time no submission has been received. The impact if any, can not be assessed until such claims have been received and admissibility or otherwise has been established.</PARA>
<PARA>SA-Garden of Remembrance</PARA>
<PARA>The project comprised the demolition of an existing garden of remembrance and the construction of a new larger facility for the Office of Australian War Graves (OAWG) in an adjacent location within the grounds of the Centennial Park Cemetery covering an area of some 4,000 square metres.</PARA>
<PARA>The work included the provision of an entrance building containing office and amenities through which access is obtained to a walled garden area. The garden area was provided with a number of internal walls for the mounting of commemorative plaques for eligible veterans from all arms of the defence forces and included landscaped areas, a central water feature, contemplation pools and a workshop/storage area at the rear for maintenance purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Separate contracts were arranged for the demolition of the existing gardens and the construction of the new facility on 24 June 1986 and 6 January 1986 respectively, with completion anticipated in August 1986.</PARA>
<PARA>Work commenced in January 1986 on the new gardens and they were accepted into use by the OAWG on 4 November 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>Shortly after work commenced several major changes to the project were proposed by the Centennial Park Trust which were agreed by the OAWG and incorporated into the project. These changes affected progress of the project and required additional funding to be provided by OAWG together with an extension to the completion date.</PARA>
<PARA>During the course of construction and despite close supervision it became evident that the contractor's rate of progress and performance generally were falling below a satisfactory level. The project was also experiencing industrial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>After close consultation with the OAWG, AC initiated termination of the contract in July 1987 and took over and completed the works utilising a series of direct contracts.</PARA>
<PARA>Landscaping and plaque erection were undertaken by OAWG staff and overlapped the final stages of construction.</PARA>
<PARA>The original funding for the project was 1.078 million dollars however due to the above mentioned problems the completed cost rose to 1.328 million dollars.</PARA>

<PARA> Small business and personal bankruptcies total 8,636; that is an increase of 32 per cent on the previous three months and an increase of 17.6 per cent over the last financial year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government should heed Nobby Clark's message; it could not sell shoelaces and make a profit. Secondly, prime interest rates in Australia have fluctuated between a low of 15 per cent and a high of 19.42 per cent. Over the last three or four years small businesses, farmers and manufacturers have had to face interest rates of up to 23 per cent. How can they be competitive against overseas manufacturers who are paying interest rates as low as 8 per cent? In Japan interest rates are as low as 6 per cent. It is an impossibility. Small businesses have not been able to pay these high interest rates and that is why bankruptcies have escalated to 16,030, which is a record for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is another reason why we are seeing business failures, and that is the accord-an instrument that also has the support of the Treasurer. Senator Walsh has made the statement that the accord has not delivered any productivity. The accord may have kept wages in line with inflation, but it certainly has not kept oncosts in line with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other night a Queensland businessman told me that he attended a lunch, I think it was, with Mr Keating and that Mr Keating got up and said that the business community was not pulling its weight in Australia. Mr Keating said to the business community that he had given a policy that had kept inflation in line with wages and that the business community had not responded. One person got up and told Mr Keating that the oncosts of his particular business had escalated to around 20 per cent and, for his trouble, Mr Keating roundly abused him in front of the whole meeting. If one cannot get agreement from someone, then abuse is the next best thing, according to Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Australian Industry has said that there has been a 22 per cent movement in labour costs during 1990.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am trying to get through Senator McMullan's thick head, or the thick heads of the people over there, is that, whilst the Government may wish to give benefits to the workers, it cannot do so without getting productivity gains, and no productivity gains have been coming through. The corollary to that is a massive increase in bankruptcies caused by two policies: first, heavy interest rates have forced Australian businesses to pay up to 23 per cent; and, secondly, the oncosts of small businesses have been increased by the Government to a stage where small businesses have no capacity to pay them and, therefore, are going broke. We have seen a record number of bankruptcies in the last year-an increase of 17.6 per cent to 16,030 bankruptcies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen superannuation increases, a 38-hour week, a training levy and also redundancy packages. The oncosts are the reason for the bankruptcies.

Yet they are impotent, incapable of doing anything about it, because the Australian Council of Trade Unions will not allow any movement in the accord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen, in the three months to May last year, 60,000 workers in the manufacturing sector alone lose their jobs. This 25 per cent increase in costs is not the end of the road. There is still additional superannuation and mark 6 wage increases. Minimum rate adjustment is expected to add another 15 per cent to labour costs for many industries over the next 12 months. This is why I say it is a matter of urgency to bring this to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening to Australia as small businesses close down?  As we are closing our small business sector down, we are replacing its manufactured products with imports. So the Government's high interest rates policy has failed once again. It was designed to get imports down, but what it has effectively done is close down factories that manufactured Australian products, and those products that they manufactured are being replaced by imports. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that our current account deficit last year rose by $21.6 billion, which is up 19 per cent on the previous year. So that policy has failed. It has failed the workers. The high interest rate policy to dampen the economy down and cut imports has failed. It has driven imports up because it has closed our manufacturing sector down. That is why 60,000 workers were replaced in the manufacturing sector in the three months before last May. The Treasurer is reigning over a country that is going broke to the tune of $20 billion a year. Our net foreign debt has risen from $23 billion, when Labor came to office, to $124 billion. </PARA>

<PARA> It is now taking 30 per cent of our total external receipts to service our external debt, and that is the highest figure since the Depression. Senator Button has blamed the banks and small business for being uneducated and unqualified. Keating has blamed the banks. I hope Senator McMullan recognises the true problem and is man enough to admit where the problem lies. Unemployment has rocketed. In November, the unemployment rate was at 7.6 per cent-650,000 people unemployed. There were 455,300 people on the dole and youth unemployment was running at 20.3 per cent, the worst level for three years. I know Senator Harradine has taken a particular interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other economic indicators that clearly illustrate that the Government is well off its economic course. Dwelling approvals fell by 25 per cent in 1989-90 and they are still falling; they are about 12 per cent less than they were at this time last year. Registrations have fallen for three consecutive months. In August, September and October registrations fell by 2.8, 2.9 and 2.4 per cent. There are no indications of any recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the stewardship of the Treasurer, we have been embarrassed in the eyes of the world. Our economic rating has been reduced from AAA to AA1 and then further reduced to AA2. Australia's rating has been downgraded and that has never happened to this nation before. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer denied that we were in a recession and then he told us that it was a recession that we had to have. He said there has been short term pain, but there will be gain. I tell the Treasurer that 16,030 businesses have died painfully. Thousands and thousands of people have lost their jobs. There is plenty of pain out there, but there is no sign of any gain. I have never seen a worse situation. I was in business for 20 years before I came into this place and have kept in contact with business people. I have never seen it worse in the business sector. Companies that I have been associated with for years have laid off half their staff. Some companies are considering whether it would be worthwhile opening for trade after Christmas. I never saw that situation in the 1983 downturn or in the 1960s. I have never seen the economy worse than it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The promise of plenty of pain has been fulfilled, but I do not believe there is going to be much gain. If his past record has anything to do with it, the Treasurer, who offers himself for the leadership of this nation, should resign from the Parliament. He has made an apology to the Prime Minister. He has said he is sorry for what he said last Friday night. But he should go down on his hands and knees and beg forgiveness from all those people he has put out of business, the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs, and the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their homes because of his policies that have driven this nation into the ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is necessary to acknowledge that there are a couple of redeeming features of this otherwise inadequate and unsatisfactory Opposition matter of public importance that Senator Boswell has put forward today. One is that it quite properly raises the significant question of the current state of the Australian economy, and that is an important matter to debate. The other feature, which is unique, coming from the other side of the chamber, is that it does at last make some recognition of the human consequences of changing economic circumstances. I think that is important and it must be acknowledged that it is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the matter of public importance and the speech which supported it failed totally as a constructive contribution to any debate about Australia's current economic circumstances. Firstly, it failed to meet the basic test of analysis of cause and effect. It reflected no understanding of the factors which have led to the current economic situation in Australia. Secondly, it failed totally to bridge that yawning chasm between talking about something important and saying something important. Senator Boswell spoke about a very important subject, but he said nothing of significance about it whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Underpinning all this-although to his credit Senator Boswell could not bring himself to advocate them, and made no mention of them-are the economic proposals expounded by the Opposition and the relevant shadow Ministers, which fail totally to take into account the human and social consequences of the policies the Opposition is putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Boswell did not have any constructive contribution to make, why did he bring on this matter of public importance? I think this was summarised by Senator Button so eloquently in Question Time a few days ago when the question of the recession was finally confirmed by the statistics when they emerged. He described the Opposition as `buoyant with gloom'. That is exactly what we are confronted with again today-people delighting in the fact that they hope to get some political gain out of the economic adversity that Australians are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that we find no proper and constructive contributions? It is not so much a question of why there are none from Senator Boswell-people might have their own private theories about that-but why are there no constructive contributions from the Opposition overall? One of the fundamental reasons is that it fails to acknowledge-some members of the Opposition would understand this, although I do not know of any Opposition senators in this chamber who would-that the economy is much more complex than the simplistic solutions it likes to put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy is influenced by a very complex array of international and local factors and there are many players in there influencing the outcome. It does not suit people who want to attribute all the blame to the Government to acknowledge that there are a large number of players and that internationally Australia is itself only a small player in the economic game. Within Australia even, the Federal Government is just one of the players in determining the economic consequences of decisions made. It is, of course, arguably the most important of those players, and I accept that. It has the capacity to create the climate in which investment decisions, savings decisions and consumption decisions are made; the totality of which determine the rate and direction of Australia's economic growth. But, in the main, the Government does not make those decisions itself; it merely creates the climate. That is in fact the point which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would have been making at the meeting in Brisbane, and which Senator Boswell failed to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Having put those background things behind us, let us look at how we came to be in the situation we are in now. Nobody would try to pretend that the economic situation in Australia on this date is in and of itself a desirable thing, because it is causing pain to individuals and everybody would prefer not to have that. I do not pretend that the Opposition would revel in the fact that individuals might be hurt. The Government does not; nor would any of the other parties here, if they understood it. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at the background. Australia has had six years of continuing record economic growth-much greater than the rate of growth of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries as a whole, particularly in the area of jobs where the rate of growth was twice that of the OECD as a whole. While it is true that unemployment is getting worse, and the social consequences of that are a cause of significant concern, if the participation rate of the work force were the same today as it was when this Government came to office in 1983, unemployment would be 3 per cent. It would have fallen from double digits to 3 per cent, and would have been less than 3 per cent last year. Due to six years of continuous growth, a lot more people have been attracted into the work force, and socially and economically it is very desirable that they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it shows up in the statistics as a rate of unemployment somewhere comparable to that in the worst years of the conservatives, although nowhere near as bad, even without taking into account the participation rate. Even 18 months ago Australia was in a record boom situation with a high level of investment. That took place in the context of an economy still trying to come to grips with 30 years of structural deficiency, which structural deficiency has always meant that every post-war boom has caused a balance of payments crisis in Australia. Notwithstanding my point about some of the micro-economic reform changes already made, that took place again last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor, which is too complex for me to go into much today but which needs to be taken into account, is that the consequences of the 1987 crash are still working their way through the economy. That has led to significant distortions in investment patterns and in the money supply. Those factors together led to the balance of payments problem with which Australia had to deal and because the supply side of that equation cannot be resolved immediately-increases in supply are slow and there are long leads-to get supply and demand in balance requires demand to be slowed down. The Opposition was not saying that the Government did not need to slow demand; it was saying that we probably were not slowing it enough. The Opposition may think there is a magic wand by which it can slow demand and nobody will be hurt. There is no such mechanism and everyone but Senator Boswell knows that lead times in increasing supply are very long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not mind Senator Boswell interjecting from there when he is wrong. I acknowledge that economic management is an imprecise art. Economists have a lovely throwaway phrase, `All other things being equal, X will be the outcome', but all other things are never equal. There were some factors that nobody could have put into the equation at the time of a slowdown and they are causing real hurt to individuals. There is no doubt about that. There have been dramatic falls in wool and wheat prices, regional problems in Australia-I refer particularly to Victoria-with a consequent decline in confidence, and uncertainty generated because of the Middle East conflict. Uncertainty is an immeasurable factor in economics which slows down people's preparedness to make investment decisions and to spend their money. It has the desirable effect of increasing savings, which is necessary, but the corollary of that is a slowdown of demand, which has economic conse- quences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That slowdown has been greater than anyone would have wished. If there is a recession, it is causing pain. If this debate is designed to prove that, it is fruitless because everyone has acknowledged that. Nobody would pretend that pain is desirable, and it may be that people are in pain. I acknowledge that was inevitable, and the Opposition should acknowledge that there is no way to slow the economy without causing pain. The Opposition proposed to slow it; we proposed to slow it. The questions are: how far, how, and who bears the burden?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What year is that? Senator Olsen is an ignoramus. The necessary policy decisions are there. Monetary policy has eased five times in 1990. As the tightening of monetary policy in 1989 has caused a slowing in 1990, so the easing of monetary policy in 1990 will cause a pick-up in 1991. There is no doubt about that; nobody argues about that. Evidence is starting to emerge that the first sign of activity will be a pick-up in dwelling investment. Financial institutions, the Housing Industry Association and others are starting to note that the first signs of that are emerging, but all too slowly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all wish that the process would be quicker, but it will not be quicker because of two factors: firstly, people are apprehensive because of those matters to do with uncertainty, which I mentioned; and, secondly, they are optimistic that there might be a further fall in interest rates so that they can make their investment decision under a lower interest rate regime. Two key preconditions for a further fall in interest rates are apparent-the key precondition being a lower rate of inflation, which means that we can keep the same real interest rate with lower absolute interest rates and deliver benefits to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, other obvious factors will lead to an economic upturn next year: firstly, increased consumption flowing from very substantial tax cuts implemented on 1 January; secondly, increased consumption flowing from the increase in wages that will follow later in the year in May; and, thirdly, increased consumption flowing from the reduction in interest rates and mortgages that people have to pay and the benefits flowing from that. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, any analysis will show that the stock cycle is getting to a point where stocks are being run down. During 1991 the need to accumulate stocks will inevitably create a pick-up in demand for manufactured goods. </PARA>

<PARA>As I do not have time to quote all of it, inter alia, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very Australian attitude-</PARA>
<PARA>and, if I might interpolate, reflected by Senator Boswell today-</PARA>
<PARA>to extrapolate the low point of a business cycle and to miss the prospect of the next economic upswing. What the Government should do is maintain some of its existing policies unchanged, particularly the budget surplus, the tremendous boost to Australian savings through changes in superannuation, the ceiling on wage increases and the greater priorities within government spending on social security. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Most of the big decisions on macro-economic reform have now been taken and Australia is further down the path of micro-economic reform than has been realised. What has to be done in the next couple of years-</PARA>
<PARA>and I agree with this-</PARA>
<PARA>is a further freeing up of the labour market. We are in a very frustrating gap between impact and results. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a correct and independent analysis, and one that people opposite do not like because it does not suit their prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend the couple of minutes that I have left speaking about the Opposition's prescription. One thing about conservatives around the world is that they can be relied upon for three things, and they come together as one element of their economic policies: first, they always propose to deal with unemployment by reducing jobs; secondly, they propose to deal with inflation by putting up prices; and the third factor in their traditional equation-which came out today from Senator Boswell-is that it is always the fault of the workers because they get too much. Those are the three factors that come together. </PARA>
<PARA> The way that the Opposition will solve unemployment is to tighten fiscal policy. What is the human cost of that policy? The Opposition will increase unemployment, reduce services and have less equity and social justice in our society. The Opposition will deal with inflation by introducing a consumption tax so that prices go up. However, the Opposition has no wages policy to cope with the consequences of those increasing prices. Australia will get back into the old cycle of boom and bust. The Opposition has absolutely no strategy for non-inflationary growth. All the international experience, which my colleague Senator Maguire will be able to expand upon, confirms the fact that the policies that conservatives everywhere are expounding have failed. There is more pain and less gain in what the Opposition is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> An absolute responsibility of governments and parties that aspire to government is to acknowledge that sometimes there is a need to take hard decisions; that it is not simply a question of populist assertions, of putting together a loose collection of wish lists or outlining problems, and not taking the responsibility of proposing solutions. Public life imposes obligations on all of us to endeavour to be positive, constructive and analytical in dealing with the great public policy issues which we confront. We all at all times confront those policy issues; they change from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> When inflation was a problem but the job situation was booming, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said how terrible inflation was and that the jobs we were creating were being created at too high a price. He said that anybody could create a lot of jobs but that we were paying too high a price for them. The biggest issue now is jobs, because suddenly the Opposition finds a different problem on which to batten its political hopes. We all have a responsibility to be positive, constructive and analytical in dealing with the great public policy issues. This matter of public importance and the speech which supported it totally fails that basic test of the public obligation of members of this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before making my contribution, I want to respond to some of the comments made by Senator McMullan. I say at the outset that I-and I am sure my colleagues-am not buoyant that this country is in a recession. Like many of my colleagues, I have friends who have businesses and have family who have had businesses but who now no longer have them as a result of this Government's economic policies. So Senator McMullan should not stand up in this chamber or any other chamber and preach to the Opposition about the rights and wrongs of and what its attitude might be to the recession. We are seeing out in the community first-hand the impact of this Government's economic policies on individuals and people within this community. It would do him well to get out of Canberra, out of this fixed secure income town, into the cities of Australia and experience first-hand what most Australians are experiencing at the moment-desperation and no light at the end of the tunnel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was rather pedantic of Senator McMullan to say that he had misinterpreted Westpac; the upturn is coming next year. It might be December next year but that is still next year. We have gone from using financial years, 1 July to 30 June, to working on calendar years, 1 January to 31 December. The movable feast of this Government when it has difficulties is indicated by its moving the figures and criteria around to suit its case and its argument. We have a clear position in the community of quite serious consequences as a result of this Government's single monetary policy direction. The Government has certainly had its hands on the lever, but it has been only one lever-the high interest rate policy lever-over the course of the last three to four years. That is what has wrought havoc on the business community out there, particularly the small business community, which has not been able to insulate itself, protect itself, against those high interest rates policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not been prepared to put in place a series of policy directions-monetary policy, fiscal policy, privatisation and reform of the waterfront, to name but a few. Instead of having its hand on one lever which has brought about these consequences, over the last three to four years the Government should have been making a number of policy adjustments affecting a number of the levers so that the situation we have in Australia at the moment was not brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are discussing here today is the plight of the forgotten people. There is plenty of talk of recession, redundancies, failing companies and poverty-all the result of this Government's lethal cocktail of high interest rates, tight fiscal policy and deliberate government policy. It is a recession that was engineered, that we had to have, and a pain that we have to go through. The newspapers, posters and headlines over the past few weeks have told of such recession stories as, `11,000 more to go by Christmas'; `A public service freeze'; `No jobs for school leavers'; `The unemployment we have to have'-and the list goes on. But what of the thousands of small businesses across Australia which have collapsed completely or have had to retrench most of their staff in the last couple of years? For them there are no glaring headlines of outrage and few stories of sympathy. It is the big companies and their problems which make the headlines, yet small business is this country's largest employer-a fact obviously forgotten by the Government and media. </PARA>
<PARA> There are an estimated 800,000 small businesses in this country. Small business accounts for some 96 per cent of all firms. It accounts for half of private sector employment. It accounts for approximately 30 per cent of gross domestic product. Most importantly, far more people from the small business sector than from any other sector have already been affected by this economic crisis. While the economic commentators have been discussing soft landings and hard landings, the small business community has already experienced a crash landing. But its trauma has been greeted with deafening silence. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated couple of hundred small businesses which have been retrenching their two, three or four employees over recent months-a number which adds up to many more than big company retrenchments-just do not seem to rate. It seems as though the small business crisis, which has been ignored by government, has also been largely ignored by the media. It seems to me that there is an ingrained perception that the small business community cries poor but lives rich. There appears to be a media view that being poor for small business means trading down from a Mercedes to a Volvo. That perception is wrong, damaging and unfair. But that perception is so entrenched in media circles that the Government has been able to get away, somewhat successfully, with the attempted murder of an exceptionally vital component of the Australian economy. It is about time that the extent of that damage caused by the Keating policies to the small business community was given the coverage it deserves by the media and the concern it deserves from the Government. That way, the public of Australia may at least be able to see the full extent of Labor's attack on a group which earns its description as the engine-room of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The damage is not even hard to find; it is glaringly evident. In a walk along any suburban strip or through any shopping centre in our major cities we see empty shops and closing down sales. A stroll down the main street of any country town shows the same result. Some country areas of my State, South Australia, are so badly affected that even the local chemists have closed their doors. </PARA>
<PARA> The small business community in Australia today is in desperate shape. Bankruptcies have reached an all-time high of 2,767 for the September quarter, up almost 700 on the same quarter last year. That is the tip of the iceberg. The next quarter will be the quarter in which we will see bankruptcies simply skyrocket. Many people are seeking to last until Christmas and then will be making a judgment over Christmas as to whether, in January, they even open their doors or what staff will continue after the Christmas holiday period. The effect of that, of course, is escalating unemployment within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Government's tired old line is that this crisis is a point in the economic cycle. Senator Button referred to it today. It is almost the inevitable. You have to go through this every couple of years. What is so unusual about it? That is the perception this Government is trying to paint at the moment: we are having a recession, but should we not be having a recession as part of the economic cycle?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DU4">Senator OLSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can well remember Senator Crowley's Government opposing privatisation forcefully and vigorously but five years ago. Had the Government five years ago put in place a privatisation policy as well as its tight monetary policy, had another look at its fiscal policy, started reform on the waterfront and investigated oncosts for shipping our products overseas and around the States of Australia, it might not be in the position it is today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Had the Government backed Paul Keating, put in a broad based consumption tax, which he wanted to do four or five years ago, and reformed the taxation system of this country and got rid of the wholesale sales tax system, which is a nightmare for small business and a nightmare for manufacturers trying to compete against imports from overseas when we do not have the basis to compete fairly and objectively and cannot enable those small business manufacturers to compete in the international marketplace, we might just have spared the small business community the havoc it is going through today, the pain it is going through today and the bankruptcies that are being inflicted upon it. We might have spared the families that are suffering enormously today, not to mention the thousands who are going to join the unemployment queue through no fault of their own but through the fault of Mr Keating and Labor's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all the Government's own work. It cannot, as Senator McMullan said today, blame international influences for this downturn in the Australian economy. The Government has been in power for nearly eight years now; this is all its own work. It is the economic policies that the Government has put in place that have had this impact on the Australian community. What concerns me is that members of the Government seem to have no comprehension of what that impact is. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to say that this is part of the cycle, that we are going through a little pain, we will get the gain later. When we pose the question `When is the gain going to come?', that is like asking how long a piece of string is? It will depend upon the circumstances at the time; maybe next year or the year after. I have news for the Government. There are many businesses out there that cannot wait until next year, let alone the number of people who are depending on those small businesses for their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are seeing is clearly a position where the Government, disturbingly so, continues to peddle a line which ridicules and denigrates the thousands of small business people whose businesses have failed through no fault of their own. It is typical that this Government has the gall to try to get away with the inference that small business has caused its own problems. It has not. Small business is the unfortunate meat in the sandwich and it has ended up being minced. It is caught between the damaging policies of both State and Federal governments. State charges such as power and land tax have increasingly crippled the small business sector in recent years. Senator Crowley would have seen that clearly in South Australia, with a massive hike of 18 per cent in taxes and charges in that State alone this year. This Government's economic policies and changes to the company tax system have been nails in the small business coffin. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent small business survey, 40 per cent of small businesses indicated that they had experienced a downturn in sales of 15 per cent or more compared with 1988-89 levels. Not their fault; no, it is Mr Keating's fault. It does not take an economic genius to realise that this downturn could be sufficient, subject to their level of borrowings and profit margins, to cause financial failure. In the same survey, almost 50 per cent of small businesses reported an increase in bad debts and 11 per cent are experiencing an increase of 100 per cent or more in bad debts. Not their fault, not the fault of small business; no, it is Mr Keating's fault. </PARA>
<PARA> Business is well down; bad debts are well up. Some 75 per cent of small businesses also indicated they would be using borrowed funds, with the average interest rate at 18.75 per cent. Many more were paying some 24 or 25 per cent on their business loans. Not their fault; no, Mr Keating's fault-a direct impact of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses report that they are being bled dry, with a vastly decreased cash flow, and the high interest rates on the borrowings necessary to stay afloat in the short term are destroying them in the long term. To make matters worse, over 50 per cent of small businesses report they will have to borrow more funds to meet the 15 December deadline to pay company tax. Seventy-five per cent of small businesses report that the Government's insistence on their paying 85 per cent of the due tax by this month will cause them critical cash flow problems. That is why they are waiting to get through to Christmas and will then make a judgment as to whether their liquidity will allow them even to reopen their doors in January next year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does not seem to care about that plight and that problem. It also appears little understood that, far from the popular myth of driving home in a Mercedes to a mansion, most small business proprietors go home on a Friday-if they are lucky-with less money in their pocket than their workers because they are chasing an increasingly scarce consumer dollar. There is little left for them to take home when, added to the high interest rates, there are obligatory wage rises for staff, superannuation increases and changes to working hours, not to mention the problems for the 64 per cent who reported increasing costs in Workcare and Workcover. In other words, small business is being squeezed at every turn. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Beddall report, the Government said it would proceed to implement a range of recommendations. What did we see this year in the Budget implementing the Beddall report? There was only one recommendation picked up in the Budget. The Government's response to the Beddall report is peppered with comments to the effect that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) will have continuing discussions on this important point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this matter of public importance brought into the chamber by Senator Boswell and the Opposition today. I find it interesting that my remarks follow those of Senator Olsen who, when asked by me across the chamber, actually ran out a litany of things that might have been better done if the Opposition had been in power. I presume that if the Opposition had been in power it would have done these things. It would be very interesting to see whether or not Senator Olsen speaks for the Opposition when he lists a number of those things, because already we have had from Senator McMullan a clear indication that the Opposition would not do those things when it had the chance to tackle some of them, for example, undertake a small amount of fiscal restraint. Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, was unable to hold his troops to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How is the Opposition going to manage its fiscal policy when it is in government if it cannot manage it when it is in opposition? I would not like to see the Opposition's chances when it is in government. I presume that when the honourable senator talks about fiscal policy he means to tighten it. He has, as a member of the Opposition, claimed on a number of occasions that the Opposition will cut $3 billion-sometimes the bid is only $2 billion-off expenditure, but he has never said where he will cut and he has never given any evidence that he means it seriously. When the Opposition had its first chance to do it in the recent case of the assets test, Dr Hewson was unable to hold the Opposition to its policy. The Opposition went to water on the one chance that it had. How is it planning to do it? Does the Opposition mean it seriously and when, if ever, will the Opposition come in here and tell us what it means by fiscal policy and, indeed, where it will make its cuts?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has talked about one example-that is, that after nine months people who are unemployed will get no further dole assistance. That will go down very well with people who are going onto unemployment benefit! Is Senator Olsen really serious about fiscal policy? He comes in here and says that, if the Government changed fiscal policy in the way that the Opposition would like to change it, it would make a difference. The Opposition could not do it in the example of the assets test. But in an area where the Opposition has said it would do anything-one of the few examples it has given us-it has said that it would cut the unemployment benefit after nine months. That is a very persuasive policy indeed; I am sure that will go down very well with those people out there who the Opposition is saying are in pain. What is the Opposition going to say? Will it say, `The pain under us will be worse because you won't even get unemployment benefits'? I say to Senator Olsen that that is a very persuasive policy. It should go down very well with the people out there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Olsen asks, `What about privatisation?'. I am prepared to say to him, `What about it, indeed?'. He is from the Party that wants to privatise welfare-what little bit it is going to leave, it is apparently going to give out to charitable organisations around this country and ask them to do the Government's work. There is not one welfare organisation in the community-according to any of the quotes, which I do not have with me today, of spokespeople representing the welfare organisations-which would support that privatisation. They say that it would allow for piecemeal application of benefits, it would allow for inequities, they would not have sufficient infrastructure to provide anything like a reasonable assessment and, of course, it carries the implication that those organisations would then become assessors of a person's worth-precisely the sort of problem that none of those organisations wants to get into. They do not have the capacity to address that problem; they do not want to address it. It is being addressed better and better by this Government which, over seven years, has actually lowered expenditure through the Department of Social Security while increasing every payment because of its targeting, its fiscal responsibility and its restraint. Because it has actually required tougher justifications for people making claims this Government has been able to lower expenditure under social security and at the same time increase payments to those people who are deserving of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Opposition says that we should be aware of the pain we are going to cause people out there. But this Opposition says, `Give them to us; we'd make the pain worse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly think that is an improvement on getting none, and Senator Olsen was not getting much at all. The Government's position has been spelt out. As Senator McMullan said, the Government has actually had to deal with this difficult, tough decision at this time and, yes, there is pain. Of course, nobody wants it and we wish that it did not have to happen; but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If Senator Olsen wants to argue about the December 1991 date instead of the June 1991 date, that is undoubtedly up to him. But, for the record, it is the year 1991 and people do understand it. Even Westpac Banking Corporation assesses that there will be an improvement in conditions, and the figures already show some encouraging signs of turnabout.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should also note that while this Government has been in office it has appreciated the importance of looking after our young people. In this place last week I highlighted the record of this Government and its alternative policies, which were called gimmicks by the Opposition. Can I presume from that that the Opposition is intending to do away with all of those policies when, if ever, it gets into office? We have put in place things that we do not call gimmicks, such as an increased education encouragement for people to stay at school until year 12, turning those figures around from about a 37 per cent retention rate to well over a 60 per cent retention rate. The Opposition said that that was just one way of reducing unemployment. You betcha, Mr Deputy President, and what better way of doing it than having young people not unemployed, not looking for insufficient jobs, but staying at school right through to year 12, with the prospects of tertiary training-whether that is by way of apprenticeships, in colleges or universities? Of course that is an improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not afraid or ashamed of saying that one of the things we did-not as an unemployment policy, but as a direct policy to tap the talents of our young people-was to encourage them to stay at school. We have done that. We have presided over two dramatic increases in the number of places and facilities in universities and colleges so that, having completed year 12, young people can then proceed into tertiary education of their preferred choice. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also implemented traineeship programs. Bridging courses have been put in place to assist those people who are without the benefit of year 12 education or those people who have made a choice not to take that path and who then find themselves struggling to get into employment or to get back into the work force if they have been out of it for any length of time-either by choice, to raise families, or by lack of choice, because of unemployment. Those facilities remain. That commitment by government is still there and that will certainly soften the blow for those people who have to endure a period of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> We also must appreciate that we have had a massive period of growth with a very high participation rate in the years that this Government has been in office. As Senator McMullan said, if that participation rate was the same now as it was in 1982-83, unemployment would be at 3 per cent. So, yes, we recognise that those figures are higher but we also acknowledge why they are higher. They are at that level because of this Government's commitment to employment creation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen, who is leaving the chamber, would not want me to acknowledge that the Government does appreciate where the jobs are. The jobs are created in the private sector. Its policies have been designed to encourage that. It got out of the community employment program creation scheme, which was put in place as a buffer once it came into office, and allowed the private sector to take up those jobs. The private sector has done that. There are bankruptcies-no-one can deny that-but, as Senator Button said, they are part of an ongoing pattern of bankruptcies. We regret that, but we also appreciate that the private sector is where the jobs are. Some 90 per cent of jobs are in the private sector; the Government knows that, recognises that and supports that. Its policies to this point have been designed to encourage the creation of those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a small point of caution for the Opposition in all of this is that, in referring to the number of bankruptcies, it makes no distinction between one sort of bankruptcy and another. Any number of senators, if they were honest, could stand up in this place and talk about the way people now exercise their right to go bankrupt as a way out of debt. I urge Opposition senators, if they are not prepared to accept those figures through the bankruptcy courts, to check out what is happening in the Family Court. On a number of occasions people have chosen the path of bankruptcy rather than staying in there and fighting. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that all the people going bankrupt are in that situation, but there are a number of stories of that sort. I think we have to urge caution about the nature of the bankruptcies and the number of people who are out of employment because of it. I use none of that as an excuse for denying those figures. Yes, we have those figures, but I urge a caution about their size and the unemployment that is associated with them. As far as I know, we do not have a sufficient breakdown of the types of bankruptcies, the number of dollars involved per bankruptcy or the number of people who are unemployed per bankruptcy. They will differ from place to place. </PARA>
<PARA> To actually find that we are talking about bankruptcies and then hear Senator Boswell say that we should also consider the Fairfaxes, for example, in that kind of category, I think is laughable. As Senator McMullan said, who is responsible? At what stage are the decisions of business people their own responsibility? As Senator McMullan said, the Government sets the economic climate in which business takes the decisions; it is going to make those decisions. Certainly the climate is one of interest rates that have been high to this point but they are now clearly falling and have been falling for the last six to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not deny that those conditions do create an unfavourable climate for business. In fact, the Treasurer has made it quite clear that some of the decisions which needed to be taken have caused short term pain but in the long term they will lead to falling interest rates and inflation. Hopefully, those things will set in place an opportunity to reduce the swings-or the cycles, which seems to be the word in vogue at the moment. But there is no way we can take all the responsibility away from business and put it on government. Some of those decisions are made by business people; they are making them not only in this climate but also in terms of their own personal preferment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Opposition, in lumping all bankruptcies together, is giving us a proper understanding of the decisions that people are making in this area. What we have to choose between is a government which set in place a commitment to its young people, a commitment to people who have been unemployed, and a commitment to assist unemployed people back into the work force through structured career counselling, particular job training and traineeships, against an opposition that, as much as we can understand of its fiscal policies, would cut out those things altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a government that has put in place a commitment to helping people who are unemployed by urging them and assisting them, through those job creation schemes associated with welfare, through social security, to get back into the work force. We have it from the Opposition that, first, it would cut out unemployment benefit after nine months and, secondly, that it would privatise welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen made a number of suggestions concerning monetary policy, fiscal policy, oncosts and waterfront arrangements, none of which he spelt out because the Opposition cannot. He also suggested that a consumption tax would be the way to go-if only Mr Keating had done that years ago. But, as Senator McMullan argued, the consumption tax way is a very interesting and direct way of increasing inflation-precisely what the Opposition says is causing trouble for small business at the moment. Does it want inflation going up or does it want it coming down?</PARA>
<PARA> Our policies which are in place at the moment are seeing a fall in inflation, with predictions that the rate will continue to fall slowly over the next 12 months. The Opposition argues for a consumption tax, which has a direct inflationary effect. How does the Opposition get these two things together in the back of its head? I do not see anything from the Opposition that would encourage those people who are hurting to appreciate that the Opposition has anything better to offer. The Government has put its programs in place. It will continue to provide support to help those people who do, from time to time, have to suffer some pain, but I would not chance my arm with the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that we are debating a matter of public importance which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Treasurer's inept engineering of the Australian economy that has resulted in business and personal bankruptcies soaring to 16,030 an increase over the last financial year of 17.6%. </PARA>
<PARA>So far Senator Crowley and others have suggested that we ought to look carefully at those figures because they may not be real. Of course, people are either bankrupt or they are not bankrupt. The truth of the matter is that Australia is looking starkly at the reality of seven years of Labor Government. No longer do we have the rhetoric, the promises, the broken promises or the false dawns; we have the reality of a recession which is perhaps the worst since that of the 1930s. Certainly it is worse than the 1982-83 recession and as bad as we have had since the Second World War. This is all the result of the deliberate and conscious decisions made by the Treasurer, Paul Keating; the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke; and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), led by Kelty. This nation is now plunged into recession as a result of their endeavours. This is the recession that the Treasurer promised we would never have. He said that we would not have a recession. On 22 March of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We won't let there be a recession.</PARA>
<PARA>He did not say that some years ago; he said it earlier this year. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . high interest rates are behind us. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We don't have high interest rates now. </PARA>
<PARA>Time after time he promised that we would be in for the good life. In 1987, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you look at Australia in a few year's time . . . you're going to see the Australian economy emerge as one of the most successful and balanced economies in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>Again in 1987, in May, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not sat idly by and watched the nation's living standards decline. Instead we have acted decisively to turn the situation around. Tonight I can report that Australia is winning. </PARA>
<PARA>In the May 1988 economic statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The measures I have just outlined represent another milestone in the transformation of the Australian economy and another chapter in the proud economic history of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Budget of 23 August 1988, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the one which brings home the bacon. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same Budget Speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's policies will secure for Australia an inflation rate of 3 to 4 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 24 August 1988, the night after the Budget Speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are now well on our way back to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>In his economic statement of April 1989, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>That is why . . . Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance-it has proved it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the history of the promises of this Government. We all know that with this Treasurer we have seen style and no substance. We have seen the world's greatest Treasurer with plenty of panache, plenty of front, plenty of brass, plenty of cheek, plenty of rhetoric, and plenty of self-congratulations. But when it comes to the hard reality of the results of his endeavour, what do we see? The recession we are now having visited upon us. He was always good at making excuses. I am reminded of the occasions when we had that continuing deficit-the monthly deficit-where, month after month in Australia, we went into further debt, and Paul Keating would say:</PARA>
<PARA>These numbers today, large as they are, are still reflecting conditions which were obtaining in January and February when the whole fever of demand was running at its highest.</PARA>
<PARA>The month before, when asked to explain the figures, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but there is a pipeline, obviously, quite a long pipeline from imports ordered six and nine months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Treasurer was asked to explain the previous month's balance of trade deficit, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This month's current account figure reflects conditions in the economy six to nine months ago. Policy has already been adjusted to deal with that condition.</PARA>
<PARA>In January, again trying to explain away another disastrous figure-what the Treasurer describes, of course, as a beautiful number-for another month when Australia went $1.5 billion into debt, his comment was:</PARA>
<PARA>This January number again reflects some substantial history; that is, a lot of the decisions which would have been taken in ordering equipment, which is now appearing on our docks and did appear in the month of January, would have been taken a year, nine months, perhaps 15 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Every single month we are living with the history of previous decisions, according to Mr Keating. Of course, the reality is that it has now all caught up with him. Everybody else in Australia has known for six, eight or nine months that we have been in recession. The only person who did not know was the man in the pinstripe Italian suits who travels to the football in a VIP aircraft. Everybody else knew the reality of the economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, we had the J-curve and then we had lag, the effervescence effect, the pipeline effect-it is all effects with this man. What is the reality? A recession-and all of his own doing, all his own work. If it were not for the fact that we have had very favourable terms of trade, the annual deficit would be running at around $27.5 billion. Instead of us going into debt by about $17.5 billion, we would be going in at about $27 billion, if it were not for the fact that up until this point the value of our export commodities has risen most significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we are in recession, what is the solution of this Government? It is screw the workers, screw small business, screw the economy; hurt everybody who ought to be a productive citizen in this community. The Government has one solution, one macro-economic lever to hang on to, that is, high interest rates, a tight monetary policy-which has had what effect? It has had the effect of driving this country into recession. It has barely constrained imports in relation to exports, nor has it helped to stimulate local production. It certainly has not made us competitive with our exports-and that is for a very good reason: the moment interest rates go up, the exchange rate is driven up; and the moment the exchange rate is driven up, imports are made cheaper and exports are made more expensive. So the perverse effect of Mr Keating's high interest rate policy is not to throttle off imports but simply to encourage them by making them more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not sin enough, it has had the final effect of throttling off any capacity of local manufacturers, local producers, to invest in new plant and equipment to make themselves more effective, more efficient and more competitive because they have not been able to afford 22 per cent or, if they are buying second-hand equipment, as many are, because they cannot afford to borrow money at 24 per cent. That is the one instrument he has had, which has had the effect of driving us into a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that the one great virtue of all this hot money rushing into this country, jacking up the exchange rate and destroying our farmers and our exporters is that it has gone into capital equipment; that we are restocking; and the capital base has developed in aggregate terms so that we are now on the verge of an export explosion. That is absolute rubbish. The Treasurer says:</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, the historically high rate of business investment of the past two years is finally providing us with the capacity to trade our way out of our troubles. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from the Budget Speech of 21 August 1990, just a few months ago. What he is telling us is that all this hot money coming in is setting us on the edge for an explosion in exports. It is fundamentally untrue, like most other things that drop from his lips. The truth of the matter is that private investment in this country has not increased. It has increased perhaps slightly since the early 1980s but there has been no significant increase whatsoever in capital equipment investment. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that, we are not on the edge of anything. We are not in any way likely to have a capacity to improve our exports in terms of our competition. In 1985-86, the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in buildings and structures, plant and equipment was 3.5 per cent and it went up to 4.4 per cent in 1988-89. Unfortunately, time prevents me from going through all the figures, but very clearly we are not on the edge of an export boom at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The one person who knows all about that, if I can find his beautiful quotes, is Senator Walsh, the ex-Minister for Finance. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>For three quarters, plant and equipment investment has been falling. High investment in CBD-</PARA>
<PARA>central business district-</PARA>
<PARA>office blocks et al will not service foreign debts . . . Australia has resorted to inducing a domestic recession to deal (temporarily) with a balance of payments problem . . . We are living on Japanese savings and we are sending the bill for that to the next generation of Australians . . . We are, in my view, in a fundamentally worse economic position than we were in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Whose words of wisdom were they? They were the words of Senator Peter Walsh. The only thing is that Senator Walsh waited until he was scampering out of the Cabinet to say that, when he could no longer, even with his shred of integrity, live with the lack of integrity of this Government. They are his contributions to this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are we now in terms of our bankruptcies? As Senator Boswell demonstrated in a very articulate way, they have risen dramatically over the last quarter. Unemployment has risen dramatically. Unemployment now numbers 650,000 people-650,000 Australians cannot, for the life of them, find a job because of this Government-not because of a downturn in terms of trade, not because of a world recession, not because of external factors, but simply because this Government has thrown them on the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the levels of company profits, which are always an excellent indicator and which are one of the things that Keating used to be so proud of in the early 1980s, when he let the money supply run crazy and when profits were up. What are they now? For quarter on quarter they have gone from $4.9 billion to $3.3 billion. The largest declines in profitability are in manufacturing and retail-they are both down about 36 per cent-manufacturing being the area that the Treasurer claims is attracting the investment which will give us an export explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only 15 minutes to speak in these circumstances. Therefore, one is unable to detail with any care the full litany of disasters this Government has visited upon us. The truth of the matter is that in the near future interest rates will come down again because this Government will drive them down and, as a result of that, one will see an expansion in demand. As a result of the expansion in demand, we will see inflation again, and we will go through this whole inflated cycle that we are presently experiencing because there is no structural adjustment and there are no fundamental changes in the economy that are going to make anything different next time-not a thing-because of the rigidity and the fixed, straightjacketed approach of the trade union movement, which controls and manipulates the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government has deregulated the financial sector, it has not deregulated the labour sector. There are no consequential reforms in coastal shipping, waterfront, communications or transportation-any of the fundamental areas. So we can expect much of the same, and next year is going to be a great deal worse than this year. Anybody who says otherwise would be telling lies, and I will regret it if I hear the Prime Minister or the Treasurer again tell the people of Australia that they can look forward to a happy new year, because the truth of the matter is that they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have Keating having the outrage and the gall to call upon Australians to dare to be great. He very much reminds me of an Italian chocolata: he is superficially attractive but he quickly makes one unwell; he melts under the slightest heat, goes sticky-drippy and goes to water. That is what he did last night when the Prime Minister called him in and had words with him about his outrageous comments to the press, when he thought that he could get away with it and he would have the media running out there and selling him as the next Prime Minister. It is absolutely outrageous. History will show that this Government, of all governments, has been the greatest failure since Federation. The sooner it is ignominiously dumped out and a capable and responsible government of the Liberal Party and the National Party is elected, the sooner we will see a recovery in the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take only a few minutes of the Senate's time this afternoon. In fact, the Australian Democrats were rather staggered that the Opposition brought this debate on today because we have probably something like 50 Bills yet to deal with in seven more days of sitting and we have been treated in the past couple of weeks in particular to longwinded Opposition talkfests, mainly dealing with head kicking and obstructionism and delaying the progress of legislation. We see this as a further mischief. Nevertheless, we will take a few minutes to outline our response on behalf of the Democrats to the matter brought forward by Senator Boswell today, which is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Treasurer's inept engineering of the Australian economy that has resulted in business and personal bankruptcies soaring to 16,030 an increase over the last financial year of 17.6%. </PARA>
<PARA>From our point of view the strategy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is based on two aspects: firstly, an ideological commitment to deregulation and privatisation leading to the private sector irresponsibility which we have seen; and, secondly, unrestrained borrowing overseas, which has been a major factor in blowing out our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ian Campbell, the Chief Economist of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, in the economic notes for the September quarter in 1990, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . deregulation and exposure to market competition, which have been confidently put forward as the answers to economic mismanagement, don't seem to be leading us to utopia either. </PARA>
<PARA>A master understatement, I would suggest. The second plank of the Treasurer's strategy is, of course, high interest rates to choke off demand for imports-a single strand strategy using a blunt instrument, which is counterproductive. In part, high interest rates are responsible for the high exchange rate, making it more difficult for Australian primary producers and manufacturers to compete against the rest of the world. The Treasurer has been only too successful in one way-we are in a recession. That is admitted. We are harvesting the cost in human terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Smith Family has reported that in the last four months there has been a 40 per cent increase in emergency relief requests. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has documented that currently we still have 310,000 children living in absolute poverty. In the past few days many of our daily newspapers have outlined that our relief agencies in the community are distressed that they are unable to meet the requirements of the growing numbers of poor families for the Christmas season. Nevertheless, foreign debt, which this is all supposed to tackle, is continuing to rise. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 November, the Melbourne Age reported that the current net outflow of interest is $11.9 billion per annum-in other words, $700 per head of population for every woman, man and child. There is another measure for that. It is 20 per cent of export income, and at the level of 25 per cent international bankers start cutting off credit. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1989 unemployment figures reached 457,400. That figure rose to 569,300 in July and to 607,700 in October. We are staring down the barrel at one million Australians unemployed. The Government should tell us its predictions for unemployment, given that the Budget estimate has already been exceeded. There is no doubt that the Budget estimate of 2 per cent growth in gross domestic product for 1990-91 has been discredited already. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an alternative to the Treasurer's disastrous economic policy. It has been identified in the Australian Democrats alternative Budget. I will list just a few major points from that alternative Budget: an increase in revenue by plugging tax avoidance loopholes-we have identified 22 measures totalling $2.6 billion in lost revenue; higher indirect taxes on luxury goods, including tobacco and alcohol, would be another important measure; support for export industries-for example, accelerated depreciation allowance for export projects; increased withholding tax and removal of exemptions on interest paid to overseas lenders to discourage overseas borrowing and to bring the dollar down; and higher expenditure on research and development. These are just some examples of the way a more interventionist approach would work-accepting responsibility for the economy and making it serve the people instead of the people having to serve the ideological market forces economy put forward by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no comfort on the other side of politics in bringing forward this matter of public importance today. The conservative Opposition offers only more and faster deregulation, full privatisation and even-as Senator Crowley has said-welfare. It offers a consumption tax to hit the poor and low income families, simply because they are not prepared to chase the real tax cheats and avoiders and offers at least $2 billion more in cuts to government spending on social infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to put down the bare bones of our response to the matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition. We have no brief for the Government's economic policy or for the alternative put forward by the Opposition. We commend to the chamber and to the community the alternative Budget of the Australian Democrats, which we are prepared to send to anybody who wants it. Our view has been outlined in more detail several times in this chamber by our economic spokesperson, Senator Spindler. I refer to the appropriations debate on 8 November and a debate on a matter of public importance on 29 November. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I will not delay the Senate further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon Senator Boswell, as Leader of the National Party of Australia, has brought forward a matter of public importance in the Senate condemning the Government on the handling of the economy. I say, on behalf of those on this side of the House, that we are concerned by the position in the economy; we are concerned by the rise in the number of people out of work; we are concerned by the difficulties some small businesses are facing in our community; and we certainly are concerned about the problems faced by our agricultural sectors as a result of the trade practices of overseas blocs, such as the European Community, by subsidising exports in our traditional markets.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we look at their record in office we see that they cannot preach to us. In 1982 and 1983 they drove the Australian economy through the floor; they drove it into the ground. I will cite one figure this afternoon-that of price rises, the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I came into this Parliament in March 1983 the annual inflation rate under Mr Howard and the Liberals was 11 1/2 per cent. We had double digit price rises under the conservative government, which was thrown out in March 1983. I remember that well. Today we do not have 11 1/2 per cent inflation; we do not have 10 per cent inflation; we certainly do not have 9 per cent inflation; and we do not have 7 per cent or 8 per cent inflation. Under this Administration the price rises are going up at only 6 per cent per annum. In effect, price increases have almost been halved under this Government. The consumer price index is well down on what it was under the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the underlying rates of inflation, the broader based measures of inflation that relate to overall activity in the community, we see that they are growing at 5.2 per cent, effectively halving the inflation rate under the Liberals. The rise in the consumer price index for the September quarter-July, August and September-is 0.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party leaders were going around the community, talking up the inflation rate, saying it was going to be 1.5, 1.7 or 1.9 per cent, and it came in at 0.7 of a per cent-the lowest quarterly inflation rate for about two decades. We have a tremendous reduction in the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to interest rates. There have been five rounds of cuts in official cash rates this year. There has been a five percentage points reduction in interest rates this year in the Australian community. Interest rates are not at their peak; they are now 5 per cent below what they were in January. When we look at the prime lending rates, the indicator rates, charged by the Australian trading banks on their large overdrafts, we see that in January this year they were 20.5 per cent. In October, they had fallen to 17 per cent. So in that space of 10 months, there had been a 3.5 percentage point reduction in the prime lending rates of the Australian trading banks. Those rates helped lower the cost of finance; they reduced the cost of interest to borrowers; and in the future they will certainly help finance extra investment spending. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the exchange rate, the rate between the Australian dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the rate between the Australian dollar and the American dollar. Earlier this year, $A1 was the equivalent of US83c. That was too high; it was hurting our exporters and making imports cheap. Yesterday we were able to have the dollar reduced in value to US77c-it has come down by about US6c-which is making imports more expensive in Australia and helping to close the import gap. It means that people in the export sectors are getting more Australian dollar proceeds from their sales overseas. Exchange rates are helping Australia get a competitive edge, and that is being fuelled by the continued fall in inflation in the Australian community. The three fundamental variables in the Australian economy-prices, interest rates and the exchange rate, the value of the Australian dollar-are all trending in the right direction. These three fundamental variables are all moving to correct the situation in the Australian economy. All of them will help Australian firms to be more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in the last 12 months imports have fallen in real terms. After allowing for changes in value, the actual quantities of imports have fallen by 2.3 per cent in the last 12 months. Exports-Australian products sent overseas-despite this recession which those opposite are talking about--</PARA>

I think that this is where the Liberal and National parties want to go; these are the policies they want to copy. They have always sought her recipe for success, her so-called magic formula for winning government and how to run the economy. For a long time, the Liberals have been looking at Conservative policies in the United Kingdom-the policies of unlimited privatisation of public enterprises, the manic dependence on market forces, unfettered deregulation of the economy, slashing public sector investment, fire sales of public assets and, last of all, the policy of shifting more and more of the nation's tax burden, in the case of the United Kingdom, onto lower and middle income earners. That is what the Liberals want in Australia. They would copy those policies if they ever got into government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very relevant at the moment to look at what has been happening in Great Britain under the policies of total deregulation of privatisation and selling off public assets which the Liberals would like to copy in this country. The Confederation of British Industry, the peak organisation in Britain, is saying that Britain is on the brink of recession. That is a headline in the Guardian Weekly of 12 August. Another headline on 26 August is: `More Families Losing Their Homes'. A headline in the Australian Financial Review of 17 September 1990 is, `Britain's Inflation Rate Surging'. In fact, the inflation rate in Britain is 11 per cent and, as I pointed out, ours is 6 per cent. Under the policies that the Liberals and Nationals would like to pursue in Australia, if they ever got into government, we would be seeing double digit inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of British Industry on 30 September forecast an even deeper recession. I point out, and it is very relevant to this motion that was moved here this afternoon, that 10,000 jobs are being lost every month in British manufacturing under the Conservative's policies that the Liberals and Nationals want to pursue in this country. Most relevant to this motion today, in which Senator Boswell has made claims about bankruptcies, is that in the United Kingdom at the moment, under the right wing policies of the Conservatives, bankruptcies are at their highest level in 50 years. I have here on my desk a quote showing bankruptcy levels in the United Kingdom at 50 per cent. It is no wonder that Mrs Thatcher was thrown out. The Conservatives are in trouble; their economic policies have failed. Yet the Liberals in Australia want to copy these policies. They will introduce these policies at the earliest opportunity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I checked out some other policies this afternoon of the conservatives sitting opposite. Every time there is any suggestion that something might need to be adjusted in the Australian economy, the conservatives call for a mini-Budget. That is their tired old formula. Twice a year, we can be sure that the conservatives and Nationals will call for a mini-Budget in Australia. That happened even at the State level. Senator Olsen spoke earlier in this debate. When he was the Opposition leader in South Australia, at least twice a year he would call for a mini-Budget. It is a tired old Liberal and National formula. </PARA>
<PARA> Mini-Budgets are not deep and meaningful concepts for the Liberals. As Senator Walsh pointed out a couple of weeks ago in this place, their mini-Budget is really a wish list of expenditure cuts. That is what it really comes down to-expenditures that they would like to cut. They would like to axe and slash government spending. But, of course, those wish lists are very selective. In the very near future in this place we will be debating Labor's Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. That Bill aims to impose a tighter assets test on family allowances. In other words, if that Bill is passed, it will bring about cuts in government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals and Nationals say they want to have cuts in government spending. We know that they are proposing to vote against that legislation. They are proposing to block legislation moved by the Labor Government to reduce spending on family allowances going to very wealthy families. They are proposing to block that so that those families continue to get family allowances. Time and time again they call for expenditure cuts and mini-Budgets, yet here we have a case where they are going to vote in favour of higher levels of expenditure. The Opposition Treasury spokesman, Mr Reith, is clearly crippled. He is unable to deliver expenditure cuts, despite the rhetoric in the Liberal Party about small government and cutting Government spending. There is clearly a very big gap between the reality and the rhetoric in the conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA> We deserve to know what the Opposition would do about the capital gains tax if ever it got into government. As I pointed out yesterday, the Government is now collecting through that tax $543m every year. It is a significant tax, and it is vital to the Budget surplus of the Government. But what do the Liberals propose to do with the capital gains tax? In 1985 they said they would throw it out. Now apparently they are flirting with some kind of so-called speculative gains tax, and they are also flirting with the idea of dropping the 1985 starting point for the capital gains tax. If the Liberals were ever to implement that, it would cost billions of dollars of revenue. It would cost the Government substantial revenue and, of course, to replace that revenue it would have to increase taxes in other parts of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to find out how the Liberals propose to remedy our economic situation by bringing in a consumption tax. How on earth can the consumption tax-by reducing the price of luxury cars by $20,000; by reducing the price of a $97,000 car to $77,000-help the Australian balance of payments? How can the current account deficit in the Australian balance of payments be reduced by Dr Hewson's proposed consumption tax, which would stimulate the purchase of overseas produced luxury cars-and most of them are produced overseas--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I invite honourable senators, if they have not already done so, to have a look at this 1989-90 report and see some of the important work that is being carried on by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. ACIAR's goal is stated at page xiii:</PARA>
<PARA>ACIAR's goal is to build the capacity of developing countries through collaborative research in the agricultural sciences to improve the social, physical and economic well-being of the poor by increasing productivity, stability and sustainability in the agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA>It is accepted generally, and certainly accepted by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, that this organisation is by and large doing very good work. One would have thought that in that case, and given the objectives of the organisation, the Government would be supporting it. But what has happened in this year's Budget? Effectively, the Government has cut funding to this organisation. So far as 1990-91 is concerned, an allocation of $18.5m would have been required to maintain the real value of the 1989-90 allocation. Therefore, the allocation of $17m in the 1990-91 Budget for this organisation represents a cut to ACIAR funding of 8.1 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> If anything shows what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, is all about, this report does. Senator Gareth Evans increases funding for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) by 44 per cent, and cuts funding for this organisation-and agriculture research is vital-by 8.1 per cent. I might remind the Senate that the United States Government refuses to fund UNFPA on these grounds:</PARA>
<PARA>It contributes to the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation in the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is the Australian Government on the one hand using taxpayers' money to increase its contribution to that organisation and, on the other hand, decreasing in real terms the amount allocated to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research by 8.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should just have a look at what Senator Gareth Evans is doing in this area, because the end result will be that the poor in these countries will not have the chance that they should have. I refer to the study showing that Zaire, alone in Africa, could, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, feed the population of Africa several times over. Yet Zaire is not being given a go. There are all sorts of other elements such as corruption, inefficient economic systems and so forth that intervene, but we should not allow the Government to get away with cutting funds to this particular organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on this Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research annual report, particularly in light of the comments that have been made by Senator Harradine. I do not necessarily agree with him that cutting costs in certain areas of expenditure is a bad thing; I think it is more important that a balance be obtained between funds that are given to a particular corporation and the tasks or activities it undertakes. There are a number of very important things in this report, and I note that there is a potential for them to have some feedback and benefit to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would particularly refer to page 9 of the report, where there is reference to salinity. It has been long demonstrated in a number of areas-for example, western Europe, America and China-that there is quite a lot we can learn about salinity and salinity control. It is appropriate, as salinity is a major problem in Australia, particularly in parts of Western Australia and in the Murray River area, that as well as assisting other countries in terms of a salinity report there be a flow-on benefit back to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 9 of the annual report shows the break-up between the various research programs, and we see a very balanced approach, I would suggest, to the research being done. The break-up is as follows: 22 per cent is going to crop sciences; 7.6 per cent to plant nutrition; 9.2 per cent to soil and water management; and 13 per cent to forestry. I would suggest that this break-up has been handled in a very appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether I mentioned crop sciences, but the figure of 22 per cent will be of real benefit to these underprivileged countries and will have a medium or longer term flow-back to Australia by building up and helping to make viable their economies. That is in direct contrast to what has been done by the more developed countries, particularly those in Europe, which have dumped products into those underdeveloped countries, thereby undermining their economies and their chances of developing them. </PARA>
<PARA> My other point is dealt with on page 31 of the report and deals with the efforts being made in respect of biological control of pests that damage crops, stock pasture and so on. Once again I see this as an opportunity not only to assist these countries but also as something from which Australia can learn. In view of the problems we have had in the past with some chemicals, particularly organochemicals, it is important that in the future efforts be made to control pests and get a balance. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the area dealing with the corporate management and support services program. This area is headed by John Allwright, the current President of the National Farmers Federation. He has had a long involvement in scientific research. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment in respect of the corporate management and support services program. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report deals with a key aspect of what is arguably one of the most vital institutions in Australia, our education system. The purpose of the paper, as outlined in the letter of transmission to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), is `to stimulate debate and action on the complex matters that affect the quality of teaching'. </PARA>
<PARA> The report will certainly stimulate debate, as the authors expect, but whether it will stimulate action remains to be seen. The report raises some interesting issues. For example, it argues that the assumptions governing teaching have become less straightforward and more tied to political concerns than previously. As a Victorian I can see the accuracy of that statement almost on a day by day basis in the changes initiated by the Kirner Government. The report points out another important effect on the work of teachers:</PARA>
<PARA>A sense of professional control and the nature of relations with employing authorities (at school regional and central level) are enduring issues for teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>I assume that this statement refers among other things to teacher unions and their increasing activity and influence over secondary teaching during the last two decades. If the report is saying this-and it is hard to see how one could ignore the impact of teacher unions on the profession of teaching-it is a pity that the language in the report is not more straightforward and forthright. Indeed, the role of teacher unions in our schools, the impact they are having on the profession and their appropriate role as we try to reform our education system should have been important subjects for discussion in a report such as this. We have largely to content ourselves with comments along the following lines:</PARA>
<PARA>But it should be noted that teachers have also taken larger socio-political responsibilities on themselves over the past few decades, responsibilities which are not necessarily acceptable to all. A teachers' union without a range of policy concerning issues such as gender equity and sexism, multiculturalism, Aboriginality and racism, the environment and peace is a rarity. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It can always claim that these things directly relate to education, but they do presage a shift of concern from local, concrete, education issues, to more amorphous universal and mainstream issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Such problems are not amenable to simple resolution. In some cases teachers have been plainly encouraged to assume, or assumed on their own behalf an unreasonable burden of responsibility for intractable social and political problems. </PARA>
<PARA>To that I think we can all say, `Hear, hear!' Interestingly, the report argues that one of the lessons from the experience of the 1970s is that a massive increase in resource allocation will not of itself necessarily improve the quality of education. The report further argues that the growth in spending does not indicate a rapid rise in the salaries of individual teachers; instead it reflects a considerable increase in the total numbers employed and teacher-pupil ratios. It also argues that teachers' salaries have declined in real terms. It further argues:</PARA>
<PARA>The view that the standing of the profession and the morale of its members is at a low ebb is also widespread. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope to address these issues at a later stage. However, I would briefly like to discuss one other matter today. The report argues:</PARA>
<PARA>Teachers need have a thorough grasp of the content of what they are teaching. Their knowledge should be sufficient to have an understanding of the underlying structure of the subject matter, and its relationship to other areas of knowledge. They should appreciate and be able to convey its complexity and richness. </PARA>
<PARA> Teachers need to appreciate that process and content of learning are inextricably interwoven, and that an education, or view of education, which concentrates excessively on either one or the other is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>This raises the issue of teacher training. It was a pity the report did not deal with some of the issues raised very effectively by the Institute of Public Affairs-an organisation with which I have had a long association-through the work of its education policy unit, which is directed by Dame Leonie Kramer. For example, in a recent report prepared by Dr Susan Moore, a research fellow of the Institute, she argues:</PARA>
<PARA>Prospective primary teachers devote on average less than half their teacher training time to curriculum subjects-ie English, Maths, Science and so on-and if time on the curriculum is further divided between study of the content of these subjects and methods of teaching them, how can they possess enough substantive knowledge of what they are teaching to function well in the classroom?</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, Dr Susan Moore argues:</PARA>
<PARA>In a typical three-year dip. teach program of 100 credit hours, 10 of which are given to English, two hours go to the teaching of reading. A subject so fundamental gets no more than that!</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In the past decade, major work by psychologists, linguists, reading experts, and literature specialists has demonstrated that unless young children are given a broad background of knowledge of this country's history, values and customs-they will rapidly fall behind in reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust annual report 1989-90. The fund manages the Commonwealth superannuation funds. As from 1 July 1990, it will have its charter widened to enable it to invest moneys for a wider range of clients. We have no problems with that. Government business enterprises must be efficient and accountable and should be able to compete vigorously with the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill, which is currently before the Senate, proposes to further that process by formally separating the function of trustee and fund management. There is then the further possibility of the monopoly which the Commonwealth funds management will enjoy over Commonwealth superannuation moneys being terminated after five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The immediate reaction of the Opposition to the creation of a new government business enterprise seems to be, `Let's privatise it immediately'. It seems to the Australian Democrats that this is a purely ideological approach and does not look after the people that these funds are supposed to serve. Certainly, we will ensure that this privatisation program is not carried to the extent of privatising this Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The Left of the Australian Labor Party, probably because it felt guilty about the disgraceful pro-privatisation actions of the Government concerning the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, has apparently succeeded in forcing the insertion of an anti-privatisation clause in the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill. Unfortunately, it does not quite work. While there is a prohibition on the Commonwealth disposing of its shares, there is no prohibition on the issuing of new shares to private interests. Clearly, the Government has made a blunder on this occasion in its anti-privatisation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar problems exist in the anti-privatisation provisions in the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, which I have drawn attention to and which at this stage the Government apparently does not intend to amend, leaving significant loopholes which would allow the complete privatisation and sale of the Commonwealth Bank to foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA> But, returning to the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, the Democrats will ensure that this clause is amended when the Bill is before the Senate to ensure that the antiprivatisation clause, which the Government apparently intended to insert, will be made watertight. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In rising to speak to the Resource Assessment Commission annual report of 1989-90, I point out that the Resource Assessment Commission was a creation of the previous term of government supported, after very considerable amendment to its structure and charter, by the Australian Democrats and accepted by the Government. Since its creation, it has taken on a number of tasks. I wish to address one in particular which I hope the Resource Assessment Commission will take on and in respect of which several weeks ago I moved a motion in this place-that is, the matter of sandmining in Australia and the industries which relate to and are dependent upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> In years past, we have seen very extensive sandmining on the beaches of New South Wales and Western Australia and, to some extent, in other places. A lot of that mining has been carried out by multinational companies operating in Australia which, through a process of transfer pricing, have taken their profits and paid their tax substantially in other countries. That relates particularly to companies which have operated on the New South Wales coast. At the same time, there has been very extensive environmental damage. Despite claims to the contrary, it is a fact that in many instances it has been quite impossible to restructure the beaches as they were before those areas were mined and considerable long term damage has resulted. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, there have been a number of proposals to value add with the products of that sandmining. The Democrats certainly are not opposed to that. We understand that in the past only some one-sixtieth of the value of the products which result from the mining of beach sands has actually accrued in Australia; 59-sixtieths accrued elsewhere. We are not in any sense averse to value adding. </PARA>
<PARA> But many of the industries which are based on sand products are environmentally suspicious. They result in considerable hazards to those who work in the industries and, moreover, the end products in which those sandmined minerals are used have serious question marks put over them by the Democrats and by those who are concerned about the end uses to which resources are put. I refer particularly to the use of some of the metals in military hardware. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that comprehensive range of reasons that the Democrats would like to see the whole area of sandmining referred to the Resource Assessment Commission, including mining as such, its environmental impacts, the types of industrial processes through which those mined materials are put and the environmental and occupational health hazards associated with it. Here I refer particularly to the considerable concerns being expressed in Port Pirie in my own State over the products and the waste which will arise from that industry, particularly the radioactive products. Port Pirie has a very poor history with respect to exposure of its citizens to radioactive materials as a result of a previous exercise working through wastes in that city. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, as I have indicated, the overall economics of the industry should be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission to ensure that the maximum benefit flows to Australia from the maximum value adding which arises from the results of the mining and the processing of those minerals and, finally, the end products into which those materials are then manufactured. We urge upon the Government that that whole process be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission for a comprehensive report on the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole notion of making a database of the resources available in Australia is very important in the work that the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) has begun to do. What seems to be a large problem with the Government's actions of late is that it is coming in with resource security legislation before the Resource Assessment Commission has done its job. We have not seen a draft copy of that as yet, and there seems to be some doubt in various Ministers' minds about the timetable for that and exactly what shape it will take. However, what little we have heard about it as yet is very worrying. It does seem to cut right across the whole purpose of having this Resource Assessment Commission put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sustainable development committees have been put in place, again, to look at the issue of forestry. When forestry is one of the two major areas that the Resource Assessment Commission is looking at so far, it seems that the Government is undermining the RAC, which it set up with such great flourish. It must be a little difficult at times for people in the RAC, who are doing as good a job as they possibly can, to figure out exactly what is on the agenda of the Federal Government because they are not being given either enough resources or the unfettered run that they should be given so they can consult with the community as they work on these two inquiries. One inquiry is into forestry. It really makes one wonder why forestry is the reference for one of the nine environmentally sustainable development committees being set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> The other area is the Kakadu inquiry the RAC is conducting at the moment. Everything I have heard so far about the conduct of the inquiry has been highly commendable. The commissioners are certainly doing a very good job of listening to all parties in that matter. I know that when they bring down their report, which may or may not contain recommendations for the Government, they will have given everybody a good hearing. I hope that they will have the courage not only to put the information before the Government and say `Well, there you are; it is over to you to make the decision', but also to make some recommendations. It is my understanding that most of the information they have obtained in the Kakadu inquiry so far has been overwhelmingly in favour of leaving Coronation Hill as it is at the moment and not going ahead with the mining proposition which the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is so forcibly trying to put forward. The evidence so far has been that, on environmental grounds and taking Aboriginal considerations into account, there are two very good reasons indeed for not going ahead with mining at Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission has to be free to take all of the information and put that before the Government in a very open way. We only hope that when the Government looks at all the evidence it will come to the conclusion itself that Kakadu is too precious a resource to be trammelled, to be interfered with any further. As it is, huge sections of the whole area have been removed, have previously been excised for mining, and we in the conservation movement are very concerned about the whole of Kakadu and the parts that have already been declared for World Heritage. At the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources last week in Perth it was suggested that stage 3 should also be listed as a World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that the Government, when it comes to looking at the Resource Assessment Commission's findings on Kakadu, will be very critical and look favourably on the conservation values that are put forward rather than going down the path that it seems to be going down at the moment, the very worrying path of putting short term economic gains ahead of long term conservation interests which are in the best interests of all Australians and the ecology of our whole nation in the future. That is a very important part of the Resource Assessment Commission's job, and I hope that it will be able to continue with that job without being starved of funding and without the feeling that it is being undermined by legislation or committees which the Government sets up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is anybody in this chamber who really thinks that anti-smoking legislation will not continue to come in an effort to protect public health. Only today we have had notification of the passing of the Western Australian Tobacco Control Bill, which goes a long way towards looking at the question from a State point of view. I have been approached by many of the manufacturers over a period and they have put all sorts of outrageous propositions to me, as they have to most others. I have also been approached by the sports organisers, who are addicted to the product they get-the money-and would find it very difficult to change their habits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sort of thing I have had put to me is that the advertising is not for recruiting purposes; that it may be to get people to consider changing their brand but it is not intended to recruit. It is the old argument, `If it is legal, it should be advertisable'. It has been said that the sort of proposition we are discussing is censorship. We have had all sorts of propositions about the huge losses in the advertising industry. But when I come back to talk to the manufacturers again I find that sooner or later it gets down to the nitty-gritty. </PARA>
<PARA> If the manufacturers are genuine about the issues that they raise, a way will be found to overcome the problems of advertising on the fences, in the air or wherever it happens to be. That is not a problem if there is good will in the issue. The manufacturers need to develop their own code of practice to fit in with what is clearly the public wish and the way the public wish is developing still. If I or any of us in this chamber choose to kill ourselves by cigarette smoking that is one thing, but we have a responsibility to others. We have a responsibility to our young and to the young of others to see that they do not unnecessarily become involved in matters such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of long term contracts was raised. Of course there are long term contracts. If I were in the position where I might lose one of my best avenues of advertising, I would want to take a long term contract as well. This does not worry me. It is the gravy train of the advertising industry and of course it wants to retain it. But of course we must raise the issues to see that these sorts of things are dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one particular group that I have difficulty with, and that is motor sports. Motor sports are very heavily tied into cigarette advertising, and I do not know what the answer is, but at least I have been able to discuss it with those involved in motor sports on many occasions and I retain a very good and useful rapport with them so that we can continue to discuss it. I am also a member of the East Torrens Cricket Club. I am a member of that club for a number of reasons, but mainly because of the absolute magnificence of Dean Southwood and the work he has done for the good of sport in South Australia and Australia-wide. I think he has done a magnificent job. He has also been able to prove that it can be done. He has proved that one can still win when it is done as far as the sporting effort is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Herron this morning cited the number of AIDS deaths, and we are all well aware of the number of motor vehicle deaths, but what would happen if the number of motor vehicle accidents reached the stage where they were killing 10 per cent of the people that died every year? There would be an enormous hullabaloo, but the fact that we assist in 10- per cent of all deaths per year with cigarettes is acceptable. Well, it is not acceptable to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments in some States have made it law that kids on bikes must be provided with crash helmets-and providing a crash helmet for a kid on a bike is exactly the same as providing protection for people from the urge to smoke. If sport killed, it would be stopped or the rules would be changed. It is the same as the padding that goes with a game of football, and the helmets for a game of cricket. It is the discouragement of recruitment that we are debating. We just do not want more people to start. It is the community cost and the community loss that we have to be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> I just ask some of the people who would support the open slather business to please spare us the salesmanship because we all know, however we ultimately look at this, that there can be only one answer: we must endeavour to discourage non-smokers from going into the field of smoking. The question comes back: do we care about the death, the pain, the suffering and the cost or not? Do we or do we not? Of course we all do, but we are shielding our care in all sorts of ridiculous ways by saying that something else is involved that is greater, or whatever. But underneath there is not one person who would not concede that this question of death, pain, suffering and costs has to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Anti-Cancer Council and various other people have given me certain figures, and I have a desire to incorporate these in total in Hansard. Those figures show that, in 1988, a total of 9,228 people died from all forms of cancer. They also show that 17,960 died from cigarette smoking activities and other illnesses arising therefrom. That is a great many people. In fact, it represents 15.6 per cent of all the deaths in Australia-one in seven of all deaths. In men, it was one in five; in women, it was one in 12. </PARA>
<PARA> Going further, various analyses have been made in Western Australia by the Department of Health, which has attempted to put dollar values on this. It has finally come up with a figure representing the computed cost by 1990 of the loss to the Australian community arising from deaths by smoking. That figure is $4,122m for the year. Are we prepared to see that continue? Are we prepared to just keep on brushing that away and saying that really it is not terribly important? It is important. It is worth trying to cut that figure down. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about here is a very tiny step, but it is a worthwhile step until we take the next bigger one, such as the one that has now been taken in Western Australia. Please, no-one believe that it will not come. Please, no-one believe that legislation like this will not be passed, because we all know that it will. We will all want to know that we have been part of the passing of that legislation when the time comes. Finally, I seek leave to have the document from which I quoted certain figures incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previously, I was saying how persuasive were the arguments I had thus far heard from the anti-advertising senators. I think I was making the point that of course cigarettes do cause lung cancer-not for everybody, but for very many people. I remember that I was making the point that I was visiting the oncology section of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital recently where I talked to a young mother who had at least two or three young children and was dying of lung cancer. She said to me, `Noel, you know, I don't believe smoking causes lung cancer, but I think that once you have lung cancer it exacerbates the disease'. And I thought to myself then: with all the known medical science of society, a lady who is in hospital dying of cancer and clearly receiving very good treatment-notwithstanding it being a public hospital-still is not persuaded that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. It really shows the quantum leap yet to be made in persuading people of the ills of their habits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect, like all of us, that that lady was wishing not to be convinced of that fact because it would have denied her the pleasure that she had had in the previous years. One can still see cases of people on chemotherapy drips standing outside of hospitals smoking cigarettes with the drips actually inserted in their arms. It just goes to emphasise the point which I think was made by Senator Peter Baume this morning or perhaps by Senator Herron-it is an addictive drug. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When people smoke through a tracheostomy, it really does give one an idea of the grip that nicotine has upon people. I commenced my comments by saying that the dilemma for me in distilling down the arguments was still to some degree somewhat clouded. I wish for the divine determination that others have made, that is, whether or not it is acceptable in a modern, enlightened society to place no proscription or prohibition upon the use or consumption of a substance but, at the same time, provide a ban on the publication and the publicising or, in other words, the advertising of that substance. It seems to me that it does cause some sort of a conflict in the measures one applies to the intrinsic responsibilities of individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It can be boiled down, I suspect, not unreasonably, to the view that it is simply censorship-and censorship in many respects is the denial of freedom to publish information, whatever form it might be in. That is the purport of those who believe that cigarette smoking should not be advertised. For reasons that we have heard in a very articulate and persuasive way, that has some merit. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that it is not the issue before us now, but raised today was the issue of whether or not the kernel of the question is: is it proper for society to accept the social and the economic cost of allowing the manufacture, the sale and the distribution of a product which, as Senator Herron said this morning, applied in the form and manner prescribed by the manufacturer is capable of leading to death-not used in a capricious, improper way, but used precisely according to the terms under which it is sold?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a very significant body of opinion in the community, one for which we must have respect, that governments have a responsibility to say, `No, we do not accept that as a reasonable thing'. An interesting point was made this morning about cigarettes. To my knowledge it is not illegal for adolescents under the age of 16 to smoke cigarettes, but it is an offence to sell cigarettes to adolescents under the age of 16. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Somebody made the point about it being legal. I said that it is not illegal for cigarettes to be smoked by adolescents under 16. To my knowledge-I can be corrected-it is not an offence to provide cigarettes to adolescents under 16. Again, governments have gone only part of the way. Perhaps they have gone as far as they think is tolerable; perhaps they have gone as far as they think they can without costing themselves revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There seems to be a contradiction in principle that it is an offence for a shopkeeper to sell cigarettes, but it is not an offence for that shopkeeper to give away the cigarettes and it is not an offence for a youth-for whom it is an offence to be sold cigarettes-to smoke cigarettes. I do not understand the logic of that law. I suspect that in the same way that we address the consumption of alcohol, it is a case of what we think a significant part of the community will tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a debate in Western Australia recently about alcohol consumption levels of 0.08 and 0.05 before one is said to have committed an offence. It has been argued with some persuasion that the level of deaths through accidents in motor vehicles significantly declines if the legal alcohol level is reduced to 0.05. A more profound statistic is that, if the drinking age is increased from 18 to 21, the level of deaths caused by the use of alcohol amongst young people drops very significantly. Why do we not deal with that? Why does the Government not have the courage to increase the drinking age to 21? The reason it does not--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am only over 21 by 18 years. I am not that far removed from it. I did not drink until I was 21, but I made up for it with some sort of endeavour afterwards. I used to be a heavy smoker, but enlightenment comes to all who wait. Now I do not smoke and, as Senator Collins said this morning, I would be devastated if I thought my children were going to smoke. I would do everything in my power, and some things outside my power, to stop them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the same way that we do not address the fundamental questions of the use and abuse of alcohol, we do not address the fundamental question of cigarettes. For my part, if there were a law which could be enforceable-and that is always a measure of what laws are appropriate and what laws are not-I would ban the sale and distribution of tobacco. I am also opposed to marijuana and all other drugs which are damaging in that way. They are banned at present because that is politically acceptable to the majority. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason we do not ban cigarettes is that so many people are hooked on them that it would be politically untenable for any government. At least this Government has had some courage in respect of one thing-I always thought that there would be a riot when it banned the use of cigarettes in domestic aircraft. I am amazed that it was received so well and that it is widely accepted. I suspect that at the end of the day the one thing that will win this debate on the use and abuse of cigarettes is social pressure. If a person goes to a dinner party now and he is the only smoker, it is no longer sociably acceptable. The majority of people find it offensive and ask the person concerned to leave the dinner table and smoke his cigarette out on the veranda or wherever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Madam Temporary Chairman. If we are going to be serious about these matters, these are the questions we will to have to address. With regard to the amendments that we are addressing, I see no intrinsic fundamental difference between incidental advertising, accidental advertising and intentional advertising; they all have the same effect. If we were serious about it, we would ban the lot. There is no fundamental difference between advertising on television, on radio and in the print media, but certain forms of advertising are more penetrating and more influential than others. Other than that, it is the same argument and the same debate. Until such time as governments address that matter, they will not be facing up to their real responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply conclude by saying that at the end of the day the norms and the mores of society and community pressure will change this with the help and the persuasion of those senators who hold a strong view. I find it interesting that some of us have the impertinence to stand up and correct Senator Peter Baume and Senator Herron. If we were to see them in their private capacity with their white coats on and their stethoscopes, and we said, `What do you think is wrong with us?', and they said, `Give up smoking,' we would not be having a vote on it; we would throw our cigarettes in the bin straightaway because it would be self-preservation. However, that is not the issue before us. The issue is whether or not the legislation is thoroughly honest in its endeavours and whether the amendments are honourable in their endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not take an intellect greater than mine to understand that it does not matter whether the advertising is incidental, accidental or deliberate: it has the same penetrating effect. The question at the end of the day is whether we are prepared to accept the social and economic cost of allowing people to kill themselves; whether we believe governments, societies and the majority of the community have a greater interest and responsibility to impose legislation which restricts the rights of other people; whether we are prepared to allow substances to be consumed or used by society in a thoroughly legal way; and whether we are fulfilling a proper responsibility by saying that one can consume them but one is not allowed to learn anything about them which encourages one to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today when I spoke, Senator Collins said that I had almost convinced him. Then Senator Crichton-Browne said that if it were a matter of self-preservation there might be another attitude. It is a matter of self-preservation. Honourable senators will recall that earlier this year Senator Newman wrote to the President of the Senate and brought to his notice a problem which he thought was caused by the air-conditioning in Parliament House. They will also recall that the President of the Senate then wrote to all senators and asked whether we had any problems in relation to the air-conditioning of Parliament House. He also wrote to the engineer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A survey of members was then conducted, the result of which I have with me. It is quite interesting. One member complained of sore eyes and was unable to wear contact lenses; another complained of sinus problems; another had sinus problems; another complained of conjunctivitis; others complained of respiratory problems, sore eyes, sinus problems, bloodshot eyes, fatigue and headaches. I will not read what the honourable senator wrote himself; I am not identifying anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> There were no health problems, but attention was drawn to the temperature, itchy eyes, colds and so on. This was then attributed to the ageing of the building. When I left the debate this morning I walked out to the far area of the building and there were 10 staffers out there all smoking away to their heart's content. So I rang the chief engineer. It is interesting to note that there is 90 per cent recycling of air in this building in cool weather. The percentage of recycled air goes down for energy saving purposes at other times, so it can be less than that-actually, it can go down to 10 per cent in winter. Everyone in this chamber and in the public areas of this building, whether we like it or not, is inhaling cigarette smoke; so it is a matter of self-preservation. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the New England Journal of Medicine for 1990 showed that the odd ratio for people exposed to the baseline for 25 smoker years was found to be 2.07. What it all means in non-jargon terms is that there is twice the chance of a person getting a cigarette-related disease through passive smoking than there is if a person is not exposed to passive smoking. I mentioned earlier today that 32 children of every 132 who start smoking will die of a cigarette-related disease. The interesting aspect is that the children of parents who smoke have a 17 per cent incidence of lung cancer. So there is a passive smoking effect as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to refer Senator Collins to the Tobacco Control Bill 1990 which was passed in Western Australia a few days ago. A press release that has been put out states in relation to the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>- bring to an end the advertising of tobacco on billboards, awnings and everywhere except at the point-of-sale</PARA>
<PARA>- prohibit advertising by the use of tobacco brand names or trademarks on other products</PARA>
<PARA>- end competitions involving tobacco products and free samples of tobacco products</PARA>
<PARA>- end tobacco promotion through sponsorship of sport and the arts</PARA>
<PARA>- establish the Health Promotion Foundation to replace sponsorships, promote healthy lifestyles, with particular emphasis on young people, and support health research</PARA>
<PARA>- increase penalties on the sale of cigarettes to anyone under 18 years of age from the current $4 to $5000. </PARA>

As I understood it, he said that the Government was in the process of negotiating with a range of sporting organisations. Presumably that means that the Government is in a position to indicate, at least in aggregate terms, what sums of money are involved and over what periods of time we might be talking about agreements running. I think we would all find it helpful and at least understand the bona fides of the Government if we could have indicated to us just what is currently inhibiting the Government from moving on the issue. I ask for further and better particulars on those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I can use the opportunity that Senator Alston has provided to respond very briefly to some of the other questions that were raised to which, because of the time that is elapsing, I had not intended to respond. Some of the points raised earlier today by Senator Michael Baume were in fact absolutely correct. I know that there is probably not a lot of disagreement about what he said in relation to some of the short term difficulties associated with simply moving immediately to resolve this issue-for example, in respect of problems that were raised by long term contracts. Of course, there are long term contracts but, as I mentioned earlier in the debate, a number of contracts around do involve substantial sums of money, although they have let-out clauses in them to prepare for the day when this will happen. In other words, they provide for an opportunity to declare the contract to be effectively void almost immediately, so the effect will be short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the other issues that was raised-I think this has to be said in response to Senator Alston's question because I have asked the same question myself-is that it is difficult, for obvious reasons, to absolutely isolate that section of financial support which is perhaps directly related to the question of sponsorship and so on because there are grey areas involved. In broad terms, the figure I have been provided with in relation to replacement is around $20m. The Confederation of Australian Sport figure is around $20m, and that of course is recurrent. I have not actually confirmed whether meetings did take place today, but a brief I read yesterday said that meetings were due to take place today between representatives of certain organisations in receipt of this funding and the Government. Earlier in the debate, a question was raised about the action that has been taken by various State governments in replacing this money and how quickly it was done. The difficulty of course is for the Federal Government to do this on a national basis. For example, in Victoria I am told that only a few groups were involved that could be very easily identified and it was possible to take fairly quick action on it. But in terms of introducing this nationally, the number of organisations is very large and the requirements of all of those organisations are quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the heavy questions that has to be properly answered by government-I thought Senator Michael Baume, in his particular shadow portfolio responsibility, put it very well today-is that it is not the black and white simple solution that others have suggested. You cannot simply say, `Okay, we will establish a committee or form a group of people and provide some sort of overriding government grant that instantly replaces all of this money with taxpayers' money and they will dish out the money, by and large, across the board'. As I said earlier, I hope that the issue is handled expeditiously. I was told only as late as lunchtime today that it will be handled expeditiously by the Government. But to put a proposal together is a little more complex than that. As Senator Michael Baume quite rightly said, the arrangement will be fair and will be seen to be equitable, no matter what that arrangement might be. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of keeping these sporting and cultural organisations financially viable and able to operate is very high on the Government's current agenda of discussions as regards what mechanisms can be brought in, what potential budgetary impact they might have and where that impact will be felt, if it is felt. At the end of the day, it may well be appropriate for the Government to provide this replacement, at least partially, for the estimated $20m that is involved on a recurrent basis per year. It should not be thought that 12 months is not sufficient time. The Government is not indicating that it cannot be done by then. As a result of the very detailed negotiations that are currently taking place, the Government's position simply is that it is too early to know whether that is sufficient without harming financially the organisations that are currently in receipt of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it can be seen, in response to Senator Alston's question, that the Government has very firmly stated its position on the substance of the point of debate, that is, it is not opposed to the intent of the legislation. We are quite clear about that. We are also saying, and I repeat it, that we are not necessarily of the view, at this point in the negotiations, that it will take longer than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Michael Baume and other honourable senators have commented during this debate, when we spend hour after hour in tedious debate in the Senate on all sorts of subjects, it is refreshing to listen to a debate like this every now and again. Various points of view have been put. Senator Bishop and others have expressed their different views. But the question of sponsorship has been most adequately addressed in the debate by Senator Michael Baume. It is not as cut and dried an issue as many people think it is. We have to address the very real problem of providing an alternative mechanism for keeping financially viable all of these organisations that provide the services, and in some way that is going to fairly and equitably replace the current heavy dependence-that was a very good way of phrasing this-on tobacco, which has grown out of the proscriptions that were applied by the then Government in 1976 for the direct advertising of tobacco. </PARA>

If they cannot, then surely we ought to know whether $5m relates to contracts that are for five-year fixed periods with no escape clauses. It is surely of interest for the Senate to know whether some of them are 10-year contracts, fixed, with no escape clauses, or whether the vast majority of them are simply one-year renewable options, in which case we would take an entirely different position. We want to know what precisely it is that the Government believes might flow from any premature termination of those contracts because it would seem to me that we could certainly say there is an obligation on the networks to mitigate their losses. If they were to find alternative sponsors of programs then the organisations would not be out of pocket.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Let me finish-to provide the information that the honourable senator is seeking. What I am doing at the moment is trying to find out details of the number of organisations being consulted. Another senator has referred to this matter. I refer to Senator Archer, who is on the other side of this debate. Senator Archer is not alone, of course, in having received representations from sporting organisations that are concerned about the loss of financial support, which in the case of many of the ones I know in the Northern Territory, as distasteful as I find this form of sponsorship, currently face dissolution if this level of support is involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I make that point-and it is an important point-is that the Government simply cannot afford to take the position of brushing aside the problems of these organisations as being of no account. That is why the Government at this point is reluctant to set a time of 12 months. Hopefully, the negotiations will be concluded prior to that. But the number of people affected the other way, if you like, by the passage of this amendment is significant; it is not a small number of people. A very large number of people who belong to a very large number of organisations, rightly or wrongly-and I have made it quite clear, in my view, wrongly-are currently in receipt of very substantial amounts of sponsorship from tobacco companies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many arguments, and I have the same distaste as other senators have expressed for the salesmanship or attempted salesmanship involved. I said earlier that I have had the same experience as Senator Archer in receiving these representations from sporting bodies, and I am prepared to listen to them. But I do draw the line at getting lobbied by the tobacco companies. I have in fact declined because I know what they are going to say and I am not interested in the nonsense. It is specious to assert that they are interested only in getting people to change brands and not in recruiting. The joining of cigarette smoking with sport has the effect of recruiting new smokers and persuading people that it is the fine thing to do. Because I am not interested in hearing that kind of nonsense from the tobacco lobby-and I think it is an insult to anyone's intelligence-I have declined the approaches that have been made to me by lobbyists from the tobacco industry; I have declined even to talk to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, one cannot simply brush aside as a matter of no account the very large number of Australians who are in the position, unfortunately, at the moment, of placing so much reliance upon the very substantial sums of money that are currently provided by the tobacco industry. The Government is not brushing those concerns aside. It has indicated it is not opposed to the intent of this legislation but it does want carefully to consider, but not in a protracted fashion, the arrangements that can be put in place to ensure that these organisations remain viable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a few things that have been said in this committee debate. I endorse what Senator Collins said. This has been a debate-something which we do not see often enough in this chamber. I thank honourable senators for their contribution. I want to make it clear, though, that we are not, by these amendments, calling for a ban on smoking. However, these amendments are part of our preparedness -a preparedness that goes back before my time in this place -to take all necessary steps to reduce the incidence of tobacco use in the community because of the cost. Those costs have been articulated: costs in financial, social and personal terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to Senator Michael Baume specifically, we acknowledge that this is only one of the measures needed; there are many others. But we have this legislation before us, it needs amending and should be amended, and now is the time that it should be amended. There are other things we can do, for example, in regard to pricing, and I will have something to say about that in a minute. In regard to packaging, the latest edition of the Australian Medical Association journal talks about possible generic packaging, doing away with all the flashy colour and attractiveness in the packaging and just putting `cigarettes' on the front of it. That is an interesting issue for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Direct mail is another issue we have to address. I am pleased to see that the Western Australian legislation which has just been passed ends competitions involving tobacco products and free samples of tobacco products, which of course is the new ploy that the tobacco industry is getting into in order to replace its losses through the print ban which is to come into place at the beginning of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other States and Territories that do not yet have legislation. All of that has to be done and we have to support the lobby groups and the organisations and put pressure on our political colleagues in those States and Territories. We believe that education will eventually be part of the package that comes out because the point that Senator Archer made is absolutely true: this loophole will be closed. The tobacco industry knows that, and we should be closing it here today. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate in particular Senator Peter Baume, Senator Herron and Senator Archer for their contributions. I am not sure yet whether I ought to congratulate Senator Crichton-Browne; I think not-perhaps I could for obfuscation. Other Opposition senators, I think, have not distinguished themselves in this debate-the furphies, the non-arguments, have been quite undistinguished. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to congratulate some of the others out in the community who supported this and other moves that have been taken and that have been proposed. Other colleagues have mentioned Mr David Hill, the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), for his stand with regard to his rugby league team, North Sydney, and his preparedness to take on the League itself. Of the things that David Hill has said in the last couple of days, perhaps the thing we need to listen to most, as legislators, is his complaint that on the ABC, for which he is responsible, Allan Border, the hero of little boys-and little girls-all around this country, stands up during this cricket season in front of the Benson and Hedges logo time and time again during the week-probably again tonight, as there is a one-day match on, which my son is watching on television in my office at the moment. This is it: cult heroes, sporting heroes and tobacco logos. On the ABC it is inappropriate, as David Hill said. When asked whether he would stop telecasting that sport, his answer-if he was quoted correctly in the Age this morning-was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I think what's got to be done is the Federal Government has got to get rid of the legal loophole that allows that (sponsorship) to happen. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are attempting to do here today, and that is what we should be doing. I also want to mention motor sports, which were raised by Senator Archer. I want particularly to commend Bob Jane and the Calder Thunderdome in my own State of Victoria. They have steadfastly refused tobacco advertising and they are to be commended for that. If honourable senators ever try to get down the Calder Highway when there is an event on at the Thunderdome, they will know that that has not exactly diminished the popularity of that particular sporting event, and there are others that could be mentioned. But Mr Jane has been in touch with me and I particularly wanted to thank him for his support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says, `Not now. We cannot do this now'. Government spokespeople, I am told by the media, in the interim between this morning's debate and the debate this afternoon, have been talking to the media about Democrat grandstanding. This matter has been on notice, as I said earlier, for a year, and Senator Collins should note that the year I am talking about is not the year referred to in the amendment, which is the year until implementation. I am talking about the year since last December, when it was clearly on notice from me to the Government that the next move would be when the Broadcasting Act came back for amendment, and that these amendments would be moved. I had them drafted last year and they were probably in the Minister's office last year-as I recall, in December. The broadcasting Bills were before us in the last week in December last year. They were pulled off, I might add, because of a certain weak-kneed attitude to foreign ownership at the time, which has been rectified today, I am pleased to see. </PARA>
<PARA> That year is the year that has been wasted. My heart warms to the thought that these negotiations are going on today and that these hundreds of sporting bodies are finally being consulted. But what has been going on for this whole year? Yes, we have had an election; and the Government has forgotten and not cared about what the community thinks of this issue. So it is this year that has been lost; this 12 months just passed. There is yet another year ahead for implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, I gave the Government two years to get its act together on a $20m package. Victoria is running a $20m plus package for its Victorian Health Promotion Foundation and it is buying out sport nationally-such as national soccer. It is the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation that is part of that buy-out. I am proud of my State and I am disappointed and disgusted with the Federal Government and the Federal Opposition on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there are too many people here who accept the arrogance of the tobacco companies when they say that there are no other sponsors. That is absolute rubbish. It is also rubbish to say that we are actually stopping sponsorship, because we are not. We are only stopping the advertising in an incidental fashion on television, and on radio, by this measure. Sponsorship will still be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely these esoteric tobacco companies-which, as we know, fund media outlets out of the goodness of their heart because advertising does not work-might still be interested in doing some sponsoring even though they are not allowed to put up their signs and logos. Actually, they do that in Europe. It is called colour sponsorship. They just wear the colours of their tobacco company. I would not want to encourage that in Australia, but it is possible, and it would be possible under this legislation. So it is possible that not all the sponsorship would go. That is something that one would have to ask the tobacco companies. But I, like Senator Collins, do not engage in discussion with them. They came to me two years ago and I think they judged that I was serious. I also told them about the disclosure provisions in my Party's constitution when it comes to funding. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government and the Opposition are really going to cop out today, which it appears they are, they are going to give a gigantic gift to the tobacco companies-a bonanza-which even the tobacco companies did not expect to get. They have been expecting this loophole to be closed. They have formed task forces and all the rest of it to try to lobby against it. Obviously, they have been effective. The form of that gift is to give them more time to up the ante, to push up the price of sponsorship so that when the Government does get around to doing something, it is going to cost that much more. That is stupid, short-sighted, ridiculous and dangerous. How are we ever going to persuade a Treasurer if the price keeps going up and up? This does a disservice to those States and Territories which are doing the right thing-South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Those States are having their buy-out costs pushed up by a Federal government which is not prepared to act even though it has had the time and has been on notice to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as I said, makes a rod for its own back because it has to close these loopholes-it knows it does and it will only cost more. I can back up those claims. We are now in the dying days of print advertising and what have we seen? In a few months the tobacco companies have spent the equivalent of a 2 1/2-year print advertising budget so they can move out into wider circles beyond the print ban. </PARA>
<PARA> In the latest edition of the Women's Weekly a calendar was provided for those people who do not want to go cold-turkey, so they can have printed ads all next year in the Benson and Hedges calendar. There have been pop-up books in Cosmopolitan, mail-outs and competitions, and new brands launched with massive spending-all in a few months. That is what they will do when it comes to the sporting sponsorship. So why not act now? I cannot help remembering what Senator Herron said about 132 kids today taking up smoking and 32 of them dying. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government has had a year and it can have another year. We have talked with the Government and the Opposition. We have worked with the Government. We have pursued this with the Government. We did not let it forget. We did not lob this on it last week. I commend the work of Minister Staples's office. I regret that he has not been able to achieve the necessary breakthrough. I would like to help the Government in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the electoral popularity of this move has been discounted in this post-election period. I remind the Government of a survey that was done in 1987 on the political acceptability of an increase in tobacco taxation in which it was quite clear that the approval rate of a ban on tobacco company sponsorship of sport-if money were replaced from tobacco tax-was 57 per cent in Victoria and 75 per cent in South Australia. In 1988 there was 67 per cent approval in New South Wales. In July 1990, most recently, there was 69 per cent approval in Queensland. Clearly, the community has not set its sails against this kind of move and is prepared for progressive action on behalf of government. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of cigarette affordability in Australia, as my colleague Senator Spindler said earlier, cigarettes are cheaper in real terms than they were in 1949. Based on 1949 prices, for which we have a comparable consumer price index figure, we see that a packet of 20 Craven A filter cigarettes cost two shillings and two pence. That is equivalent to $3.20 in 1990 or 16c per actual cigarette. Today an actual cigarette costs 10.5c. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of cigarette taxes as a percentage of retail price-as I said in response to Senator Michael Baume, pricing is one of the areas where we can act-Australia's proportion of tax is the lowest in comparable Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Its rate of 55 per cent compares, for instance, with that of France at 72 per cent; Italy, at 72 per cent; Canada, at 59 per cent; Germany, at 73 per cent; Ireland, at 75 per cent; Denmark, at 86 per cent; and so on. I have plenty of other information. I am absolutely certain that the organisations that have been giving it to me have been giving it to the Government as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to do a cost-benefit analysis. The millions of dollars that it is costing the community must come into the calculations. The Minister says that he hopes and believes that measures will be taken expeditiously. As I have shown, they must be taken expeditiously. I challenge the Government to get its negotiations done and come back to us with amendments next week. We will ensure their speedy passage. The House of Representatives is coming back. Let us put it to work on this and get this thing done. </PARA>
<PARA> In this place last week I raised the question of the Prime Minister's XI cricket match being part of the Benson and Hedges sponsored Australian Cricket Board England tour. Immediately before the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) accepted the strong approach of the AMA and others, and we banned print advertising. That has not happened this time. Why not? I believe that is a legitimate question. Senator Peter Baume said that the tobacco companies have purchased sport and culture in this country. We would have to be asking the question today, as these amendments do not get support, as to whether or not the tobacco companies have not also purchased the other political parties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to the remarks that have been made during this debate. The contribution made by Senator Herron has been the one that I believe has influenced me most, and I say to the Committee that he should be congratulated on it. But there have been a number of other quite important contributions from the other side of the boat as well. Senator Michael Baume indicated that this is not an amendment about banning advertising: it is an amendment about banning the televising of advertising-in other words, banning the televising of sports, in this case, where there is incidental advertising in the form of billboards and the like. As such, we have to be clear on what we are doing at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (c) an agreement under which the competing licensee is prevented from purchasing programs from another supplier.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment is consequential upon the first. Both deal with networking. Amendment No. 1 inserts a definition for networking and amendment No. 4 deals with the application of this definition of networking. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of clauses in this Bill relate to the so-called networking agreements which exist between regional television stations and the major television networks providing for the supply of programs from the networks to the regionals. Clause 12 of this Bill will provide exemptions from ownership and control limits for the parties to the networking agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of these exemptions has come about from a recent ruling by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that networking agreements may breach the 60 per cent audience reach limit allowing networks to participate in the benefits of the regional licences, thereby breaching section 89a (1) (b). Since the aggregation of our regional markets relies heavily on these agreements, we accept that some action clearly had to be taken. It is already on the record that the Australian Democrats were opposed to the aggregation process from the beginning because we were concerned about the potential effects of this on local content. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of the Hawke Government have been directly responsible for the emergence of the three major networks in Australia. With the Hawke Government policy of aggregation, regional television monopolies are to be broken down. The pressure is now on for closer affiliation agreements and, because of the small number of networks, the regionals are virtually compelled to align themselves with one of these networks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats accept that regional viewers deserve to have the same choice of programs that their city counterparts have and are conscious of the widespread support there is for aggregation, particularly in rural areas. While we have reservations with respect to the aggregation of our regional television markets, we would have to say that to dismantle networking agreements at this stage-as the Opposition amendments are suggesting-would, in our opinion, be most destructive. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when considering the Opposition's attitude to these clauses of the Bill, it must be remembered that it has a policy of 100 per cent audience reach, which is essentially a nationwide aggregation policy. Indeed, paragraph 2.2 of the Opposition's communications policy states that it will ensure the availability of a wider range of television services through aggregation in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA> One area of concern to the Democrats relates to the access that regional stations will have to programs the networks purchase but choose not to show. This is an important issue as the networks have purchased much of the overseas product. The networking agreements, which I have had an opportunity to sight, allow this access. I hope that future negotiated agreements will also allow this access. I expect this to be an issue the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will consider when looking at the networking agreements that are lodged with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has stated that it feels that regional stations will become chained to the wheels of the networks. The Democrats recognise the potential that networking agreements provide for the networks to exert control over regionals and are concerned to ensure that this does not eventuate. The experience of the United States with respect to networking agreements shows us that certain rights of the regional stations do need to be protected. These include the affiliate's right to reject any network program it does not want to purchase; its right to show programs at the time of its choice; and its right to purchase programs from whichever network it chooses. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment I am moving to this clause will, I believe, ensure that the autonomy of the regional stations involved in networking agreements is protected. My amendment alters the definition of a networking agreement to include a proviso that networking agreements are valid `if and only if the agreement does not require either party to broadcast any particular programs or broadcast programs at a specific time, and does not prevent purchase from other networks'. This amendment will clarify the limits of networking agreements. It will provide the regional stations with a legislative reference where they believe the networks are in fact seeking to exercise control over their programming. Importantly, it will outlaw the `must buy' program clauses that the Federal Communications Commission in the United States identified as a major means by which networks in America exerted control over regional stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will not impose any additional requirements on the parties involved in the agreements. The amendment will ensure that networking agreements are mutually beneficial. If the Opposition is serious-as I believe it is-in its concern for regional stations, then I ask it to consider supporting this amendment, because the reality is that we will be supporting networking exemptions. The Opposition needs to consider the regionals' position in the light of this reality. What will the regionals say if in a couple of years the networks attempt to impose `must buy' conditions on the regionals?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not support these amendments. The Government recognises that it is only through effective and equitable networking arrangements that commercial broadcasters can provide the high quality broadcasting services they currently provide to the public. These proposed amendments would impinge to some extent on legitimate arrangements agreed between networks and affiliates. I notice that Senator Alston's circulated amendments go much further than that, but these proposed amendments would impinge on the networking arrangements-for example, to carry national advertising, which I know the commercial regional station in my area would be dead without, which are programs for the purpose of the Broadcasting Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These amendments also purport to introduce matters currently adequately covered by the Bill. The Bill confers no protection on agreements which do not provide for the supply of programs; hence paragraph (b) of these Democrat amendments is superfluous. This is also the case with paragraph (c), since under proposed section 89 (2) protection is accorded only to bona fide terms relating to the supply of programs. In respect of the business relationship created by those terms and the dependence of the licensee on that supply for the provision of that service under the licence, restricted trade practices are not covered by the protection of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has indicated, the Opposition's amendment seeks to omit the current provision. I do not wish to canvass all the matters dealt with more than adequately in the House of Representatives during the course of debate there, but I invite the Minister to indicate whether the Government has had any second thoughts or whether it is now in a better position to respond to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) at that time. The Opposition is particularly concerned about the term `lodged', so that a networking agreement merely has to be lodged with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, but otherwise there is no requirement for it to be further considered. That would seem to be in conflict with the requirements of proposed section 89, which involves the Tribunal in giving its active written consent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition does not support these amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. We see them as not only emasculating the current provision, but also effectively trying to turn the clock back and wishing in many ways that an audience reach limit as generous as the 60 per cent provided for in the legislation had never come into existence. The Opposition does not take that view. Although there might not be much inclination for going down that track at present, we think that it ought to be possible. In the meantime, agreements ought to be capable of being scrutinised and, if necessary, approved by the Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA> (4) Clause 5, page 3, subclause (2), lines 6 to 10, omit the subclause, insert the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Without limiting the application of the amendment made by paragraph (1) (a) to licences granted by way of renewal or further renewal after the commencement of this section, that amendment also applies to licences in force on that commencement otherwise than because of subsection 87 (3) of the Principal Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill increases the maximum licence renewal period from three to five years and clause 5 (2) of the Bill is a transitional provision setting out which licences will have that increased renewal period. There was a defect in the original clause 5 (2), in that as it was originally drafted it prevented the increase in the maximum renewal period to licences in categories when they were subsequently renewed; that is, licences that were being subjected to processes of the Tribunal. This amendment omits the original clause 5 (2) and substitutes a new clause which recognises that the increase in the maximum licence renewal period in clause 5 (1) (a) applies to licences renewed after commencement. It also applies the increase from three to five years to licences in force on commencement, other than those in force because of subsection 87 (3); that is, those that are being applied to Tribunal processes. The amendment makes no express reference to licences in force at the commencement for a period of less than three years as the amendment in clause 5 (1) (a) would not operate to increase the period that those licences continue in force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will oppose this clause. Part of the motivation behind this amendment could well be to reduce some of the workload of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. However, I believe the Government has approached it from the wrong direction. The Democrats believe that the solution to the Broadcasting Tribunal's backlog of work is not simply to remove some of the very important work that it does. Instead, it is to give the Tribunal sufficient resources to enable it to undertake sufficiently each and every one of its important tasks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the areas of inquiry that wanted the attention of the Tribunal were originally identified, the issue of the three-year licence renewal was seen as sufficiently important. To my knowledge, nothing has happened in the intervening period to make three-year licence inquiries less important. Given the current state of the Australian broadcasting industry, I would argue that this is considerably more important. I believe the Tribunal is being snowed under in its work as a direct response of chronic underfunding by this Government. Simply to say that the solution to this underfunding is to reduce the issues into which the Tribunal need inquire is unacceptable to the Democrats. I believe this a highly inappropriate time to extend licence periods. Licensees are facing financial turmoil. We have the uncertain effects of aggregation and new requirements for Australian content. With these conditions prevailing, I believe that more rather than less Tribunal oversight is required. </PARA>
<PARA> With a five-year licence, a licensee's service may be inadequate for two years but not attract any Tribunal sanctions because of an improvement in the last two years before renewal. We do not seem to be able to trust our politicians for five years, and I do not believe that it is unreasonable to review the performance of our media owners once every three years. As such, the Democrats are opposing this Government amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the amendment of the Australian Democrats. The official position is that we support the Government, but might I say that from my experience of following the peregrinations of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, it is quite clear that an enormous amount of time, energy and resources is wasted on the current exercises. In many ways, I think there is a much better case for having a perpetual licence which is capable of being revoked at any time if sufficient cause is shown. I might say that this is not a revolutionary proposal; it is one that has been adopted in other countries. It enables automatic renewal after whatever period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment, there is the worst of all possible worlds where, in theory, at the end of each period of three years a person could lose his licence because someone wants to lodge a heavy objection. He would get some warning of that, but quite often not sufficient. So a licensee has to prepare for that hearing as though his life is at stake. People will put some months of effort into preparing a case on the off chance that it might be opposed or that someone might want to argue that the licensee is no longer a fit and proper person. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that that is quite an inappropriate way of handling the business. There is no reason why we ought not be entitled to continue to have a licence until we forfeit our right to do so. We could forfeit that right at any time. If a person has just been granted a three-year licence and commits an offence three months down the track, why should that person then have two years and nine months of sanctity. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we go along with five-year licences mostly because of what the Tribunal has said about unnecessary licence renewal hearings-I notice that in many ways the Government really has not really fixed that up; it could have network hearings rather than individual licence hearings-the fact is that there is an enormous amount of time wasted that could be much better spent in all sorts of other areas of scrutiny, if that is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> My preference would be that once a person is granted a licence there is a presumption that he is entitled to retain that licence until he takes some action that puts it in jeopardy, in which case he will get a show cause summons and will then have to defend himself against a real charge-not against the prospect that every three years he might find himself in big trouble. We are content in the interim to go along with a five-year term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is perfectly true, as Senator Kernot has said, that one of the purposes of this amendment is to reduce the workload on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, but I can assure Senator Kernot that that purpose has not simply been prompted by a desire of the Government not to spend more money on more hearings of the Tribunal. It has been very largely based on the Tribunal's own experience that it is unnecessary to review the performance of licensees every three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has accepted that an extension to five years as the maximum period is necessary to have an appreciable impact on the Tribunal's workload and to enable it to devote more resources to substantive rather than formal scrutiny of licensee performance. The Government accepts that five-year renewals would still allow public interest groups and concerned citizens adequate opportunity to participate in the evaluation process. In this respect we note that if circumstances warrant it the Tribunal, as the legislation quite clearly says, still has the discretion to renew for less than the maximum period and also retains the power to inquire into matters of real concern at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed would not improve public participation in the evaluation of licensee performance and could in fact have an adverse effect on it by denying the Tribunal the very free use of its resources to address issues of substance, both at licence renewals and during the specific inquiries that the Tribunal has the power to hold from time to time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on the Government amendment for two reasons. Firstly, I acknowledge the points that were made by Senator Alston with regard to the problem of the time of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT). Certainly, as it is currently staffed and equipped, the ABT does have some concerns about the amount of time that is available to it to discharge its functions under the legislation. Of course, that is something that we should be aware of and should address, but more particularly it is something that the Government should be aware of. It should provide the Tribunal with the resources necessary for it to cope with its workload in a manner which enables it to discharge its functions adequately and fully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I was given certain guarantees some years ago by the Government. Those guarantees were with respect to broadcast and program standards. I raise that now in case the Department of Transport and Communications has forgotten about it. I have not. If the Government goes into an election or reneges on the agreement that was made on that occasion, certainly it will hear from me and from a lot of others. It was before the time of the Minister, so he may not know what I am talking about-but I am sure that the Department, the Tribunal, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and quite a lot of other people do. I simply make that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make that point in the context of the Broadcasting Tribunal's document TV Violence in Australia, which is order of the day No. 1 relating to Government documents. I do not want to anticipate debate on that document, but my fear is that there is a trend within the Department to suggest that there should be self-regulation. Self-regulation by whom? It would be by interest groups-that is, by the persons who are interested. </PARA>

<PARA>3. Clause 6, page 3, proposed subsections 89a (11), (12) and (13), lines 22 to 36, omit the subsection. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said in the second reading debate, my primary concern with clause 6 is that, if a situation is serious enough to warrant an inquiry in the first place, I think it is inappropriate to deem approval for the transaction simply because six months has elapsed. Indeed, it may be more appropriate to deem rejection rather than approval where an inquiry is incomplete after a prescribed period. If this Bill is passed, and I am sure that it will be, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be required to inquire only into issues of significance. What is a matter of significance is always a matter for debate. I believe that issues such as licence transfers have very significant repercussions for the industry as a whole, and simply to turn around and say that, because six months has elapsed, a transfer should be approved is not, I believe, sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the option is there for the Tribunal to extend the period of the inquiry where it feels that this is appropriate, but if because of some extenuating circumstance the Tribunal neglects to extend the inquiry, the inquiry will be closed and the licence transfer will be approved by default. To avoid the so-called deemed approval of transfer inquiries, the Aus- tralian Democrats have drawn up the amendment that I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose this amendment. It is not quite as Senator Kernot says, that a transfer will be deemed to have been approved if within six months the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has not completed its work. The proposal places what I do not think is a particularly onerous requirement on the Tribunal to deal with the matters before it expeditiously. The only other requirement that it places on the Tribunal, and I think it is a very reasonable one, is that, if it has not completed its work during that time, it is required to publish written reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>

But there are avenues available through the administrative decisions judicial review procedure to take that into account. Frankly, without getting into that matter, I do not think the requirement on the Tribunal to deal with the issues before it in terms of maintaining the public respect that is required for its credibility and to provide the degree of certainty and stability in the industry that the industry is looking for is an unreasonable requirement.

Suffice it to say that the Opposition takes the view that the Government ought to adhere to the advice proffered it by the Department of Transport and Communications, that the Tribunal ought to be in a position to decide whether these affiliation agreements or network agreements provide sufficient flexibility, whereas the insertion of these subsections means that there will simply be no choice in the matter. That will put a number of things at risk in the event that the networking agreement requires the regional stations to take programs direct in the metropolitan area. It may well mean a dearth, if not the death, of localism. We have that particular concern, so we seek to omit those two proposed subsections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of the Opposition's amendments 1 to 4 are, as Senator Alston has said, directed in effect to one end, and that is to addressing the question of networking. There has been some debate on that matter not just in the Committee but in the second reading debate today. Amendments 1 to 4 are intended to remove the networking exemptions from the Bill. As the Government has indicated, it will be opposing them. That exemption was included because the News case in the Solicitor-General's opinion indicates that the current networking arrangements whereby affiliate services take the majority of their programs from a network may give the network the control of the affiliate and therefore place the network in breach of the ownership and control requirements of the Act and allow the network to participate in the benefit of the licence without the approval of the Tribunal, contrary to the Act. That is the purpose of the Opposition's amendments, as Senator Alston has explained. They are all directed to that end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sum effect of all that-one either agrees with it or one does not-is that these amendments, if carried, would have the very profound effect of precluding effective networking arrangements from Australian television. Not only would that negate agreements freely entered into and, I would argue, of benefit to both broadcasters and the viewing public, but also it would effectively destroy the level of service offered the public. I am sure that Senator Alston, even in moving these amendments, would not agree with Senator Crichton-Browne that it would be satisfactory to have local television broadcasters having sufficient budgets in terms of the advertising revenue available to them only to broadcast home movies. </PARA>
<PARA> If it did not go that far, it would certainly lead to a severe diminution in the standard of the programs that are broadcast. The cost of negotiating program rights on a station by station basis would be prohibitive, and without the guarantee of program and national advertising sales to affiliates-I simply have to reflect on the effect it would have in my own area of Australia-no licensee on its own could afford to commission the quality Australian and overseas programs we have come to expect. By and large, by international comparisons, we have high quality broadcasting in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment No. 7 simply makes a drafting change to clause 17. Amendment No. 8 clarifies the impact of the joint control, by confining its operation to situations where persons act together to be in a position to exercise actual control rather than deemed control; that is, `control' as defined by section 89 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 9 inserts a new section into section 89 under clause 17.

<PARA> After proposed subparagraph 89kb (3) (b) (ii), insert the following new word and subparagraph: ``or</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) exercises direction or restraint over any substantial issue relating to the conduct of operations under the licence;''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is to amend Government amendment No. 9. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2), as the Minister has said, will abolish the registered lenders scheme. In practice, this scheme was not terribly effective and there was a need to review the process. As such, the Australian Democrats are not staunchly opposed to its abolition. However, we do believe that it is essential that we retain some form of scrutiny over lenders to commercial licensees. The new legislation proposes a broader definition of `control' and the banks have expressed a concern that this definition will, through normal loan covenants, deem them to be in control of broadcast stations. Because the banks have lent to a number of media outlets, they may then be in breach of a number of ownership and control limitations. The Minister has just quoted from the explanatory memorandum, ending with this section:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to what extent the authorised lender or a person in a position to control that lender is in a position to exercise control of a media company. </PARA>
<PARA>These exemptions will apply as long as the banks do not attempt to-and again I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) exercise control over persons or matters in such a way as to prevent the licensee complying with the condition of the licence; or</PARA>
<PARA>(2) control the selection or provision of programs to be broadcast pursuant to the licence. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of these two qualifying conditions is to ensure that, while the banks are exempted from the ownership and control provisions, they do not in fact attempt to exercise control over broadcast stations. One needs only a cursory glance at the state of television in this country at present to see the need for these sorts of limitations. I note that a number of media commentators seem to be of the opinion that the banks are already effectively controlling two of our major networks. So we need to consider the Government amendment in this case very carefully, because the basis of tribunal scrutiny of the industry is very much determined by the new definition of `control' that this Bill will be implementing. It is absolutely crucial. </PARA>
<PARA> To exempt any party from this definition of control will be to allow it to act basically independent of the Broadcasting Act and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In recognition of this very fact, the Government has included in its amendments the two qualifying conditions for the exemption that I have mentioned earlier. If we are to place authorised lenders outside the scope of control, I believe we need to be very careful that we do not allow them free rein over our broadcast stations. In case honourable senators think this is being a little paranoid, they need only look at what is happening with the Ten network. </PARA>
<PARA> Government amendments to section 92m of the principal Act, which we will look at later, will provide the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with the power to issue directions at any time to a person, including a registered lender, who is in a position of control of a commercial licence in order to protect a licence. Previously the Tribunal could take this course of action only when an inquiry was in progress. Fortunately, in the Ten network case, an inquiry was being conducted which allowed the Tribunal much closer oversight of the changes at Ten than it otherwise would have had. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats welcome the new powers under section 92m and also the two qualifying restrictions on the activities of the banks. We believe, however, that these restrictions do not go far enough in ensuring the autonomy of broadcast stations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the thrust of the Democrats' argument in this matter. The Government believes that the principal role of the Broadcasting Act is simply to protect the service to the public, not to protect the peripheral business arrangements of licensees that do not relate to programming or to the ability of licensees to meet their licence conditions. If lenders go beyond that, they will be subject, properly, to the scrutiny of the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the extent that the proposed amendment goes beyond the Government's own proposals, and this does seem uncertain, it can only intrude-and I think would intrude-into the normal business arrangements between licensees and their lenders. The Government sees no role in those arrangements where they do not affect programming or compliance by licensees of their licence conditions. On that basis the Government will be opposing this amendment because, firstly, we believe it is superfluous and, secondly, we believe that its effect will be very uncertain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I believe my amendment will in no way impede the normal commercial practices that go on between the banks and the licensee companies. It will, however, clearly draw the line between these normal practices and those situations where the banks may seek to exert some control over the licensee. I have no doubt that banks are very closely scrutinising the operations of the stations that they have lent to. Given the financial status of the two networks, the banks would be crazy not to be doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am happy for the banks to conduct these sorts of analyses, but I am not happy with them interfering with the day-to-day running of the stations. Where there are huge losses there will need to be some fairly significant changes made to the operation of broadcast stations and some rationalisation is inevitable. I am not opposed to this if, in the long run, it will help our broadcasting industry get back on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, however, that the Tribunal needs to have some oversight of this process in order to ensure that the public interest-I, too, am concerned about the public interest-is protected. While the industry is in such a vulnerable financial position, we must provide some protection to it and to the viewing public. I believe that the amendment I have proposed will do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, the difficulty the Government has with this amendment is that it gets to the question of what is a direction or restraint. Lending institutions commonly incorporate in their lending agreements clauses which sensibly and without question restrain the person getting the loan from dissipating the assets which are purchased with that loan without the prior consent of the lender. I do not think there is much question that there would be uncertainty as to the effect it would have in what I believe would have to be interpreted by a court as a restraint. It would make it absolutely impossible, if that sensible provision were removed or made inoperable by these amendments, for institutions to lend money to television licensees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 8 standing in my name deal with the whole issue of prior approval, or prior notification, which is another crucial issue, I believe, in the broadcasting debate. Rather than seeking to strengthen the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's hand with respect to the transaction approval process, the clauses of this Bill will, I believe, actually weaken the Tribunal by removing the obligation for parties to transactions to give the Tribunal prior notification of those transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that not only is this prior notification essential to the efficient operation of our broadcasting regulator but also that this power should be extended to require prior Australian Broadcasting Tribunal approval of ownership changes. Senator Alston will probably say we are trying to turn the clock back again. Of course, it was the infamous Murdoch amendments of 1981 which removed the prior approval requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report The Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of November 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure said it believed:</PARA>
<PARA>The present system of approvals after the event does not provide the Tribunal with the capacity to supervise changes in ownership and control effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted that, without prior approval, ownership changes have become a case of trying to unscramble eggs for the Tribunal. An example of this was radio station 3DB which changed hands five times in seven months in 1987, with the final change taking place before the Tribunal had completed its report on the first transaction. Another example clearly highlighting the Tribunal's powerlessness was the situation where the original purchase of the Nine network by Bond Media had not been approved before the Bond group had sold the network. As such, no inquiry needs to be held into Mr Kerry Packer's purchase-or should I say repurchase-of the Nine network. Perhaps of greater concern is the fact that the Tribunal was powerless to oversee any of the restructuring that occurred in radio and television back in 1986-87. We are now, I believe, seeing the shake-out of that restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> Once a share transaction has occurred, if the Tribunal decides not to approve the transaction its only option to date has been to order divestiture-which is rarely acting in the public interest. The Tribunal's post-hoc approval process for ownership changes means that there may be significant managerial, staff or programming changes or other changes in the operation of the licence before the Tribunal has made a determination. A report by the Department of Transport and Communications Broadcasting Review Group in July 1989 entitled A Review of Broadcasting Regulation Discussion Paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA>By the time a decision could be made by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in relation to a transaction that had already occurred, structural or other changes to the company in respect of which the shares were acquired could make it difficult and possibly disruptive to effect a divestiture. </PARA>
<PARA>An example of this occurred when Broadcom (Australia) Pty Ltd first bought the 10 Network and there were major changes in staffing and operations before the Tribunal had held an inquiry. More recently, Kerry Packer's return to Channel 9 and the subsequent sackings that occurred clearly demonstrated the significant changes that can take place very rapidly under the direction of a new owner. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the current system new owners may be in breach of cross-media ownership limits, audience reach restrictions or other ownership and control provisions. Not only does the system allow this but it also allows a new owner to maintain control for a substantial length of time before attracting Tribunal sanctions. The infamous Skase incident, where stations were purchased in excess of the 60 per cent audience reach limit with a certain arrogant confidence that the legislation would be changed before Mr Skase would have to divest, was a blatant disregard of this Act. On a recent Four Corners program the Acting Chairman of the Broadcasting Tribunal, Mr Peter Westerway, stated that he believed the Tribunal's public interest powers should be reinstated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications report to which I referred earlier concluded that `a limited prior approval requirement directed at significant ownership changes may now be appropriate under the Act'. It may come as a surprise to some people that broadcasting regulators in overseas countries have this prior approval power. This morning we were talking about foreign ownership requirements in other countries and indeed the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) used these overseas examples which I had used as support for why 20 per cent was a reasonable figure. The Federal Communications Commission in the United States has prior approval power, as does the Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission. As a consequence of having this power these countries have not experienced the sorts of problems that we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that in the public interest the Broadcasting Tribunal needs to be empowered to issue or withhold approval of share transactions that affect the ownership or control of licenses prior to those transactions taking place. The integrity of the licensing process must be ensured and, as such, the prior approval system for major changes in ownership or control of licences needs to be reintroduced. We believe that the prior approval process should be imposed only on those transactions involving real issues of control-that is, any purchases of 15 per cent of shares or more or any purchases which confer significantly greater control. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the Tribunal should be provided with the discretion to conduct inquiries into lesser purchases where it believes that this is warranted. Importantly, the Tribunal needs to be adequately funded to ensure that these inquiries can be performed expeditiously. Prior to the 1981 amendments the delays involved in conducting inquiries-which have been referred to already this evening-often frustrated proposed transactions because of rapid share trading and allowed other companies time to interfere with the transactions. We would need to ensure that normal commercial practices were not seriously disrupted by the reintroduction of the prior approval process. The experience of the United States and Canada shows us that the prior approval system is indeed workable. I believe it should be reinstated in this country as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats' initial intention was to draft our own amendments to install a prior approval process. However, it would have necessitated a virtual rewrite of the Bill and, as it had little prospect of passing the Senate and would have consumed a huge amount of the Senate budget, we did not proceed with this. I would, however, urge the Government to take my comments and those of many in the industry on board and to look to reintroducing the prior approval system in the major review of legislation which is currently under way. Clause 20 (e) will remove the prior notification requirement. For the Tribunal to at least be given the chance to function efficiently, it must be provided with all possible information. Without this information the Tribunal's already formidable task becomes much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems incredible to me that on this very day, when we are hearing so much about print media, we should be seeking to water down the powers of the regulatory body in the broadcasting media. The new powers given to the Tribunal under proposed new subsection 92m will assist, but the Tribunal needs to have access to information as soon as that information is available. We therefore oppose the removal of prior notification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose these amendments. The difficulty we have in accepting them is that the amendments with respect to these particular clauses relating to radio licensing and the subsequent amendments that the Australian Democrats will move with respect to television would simply remove all of the basic efficiencies that the Government is proposing to introduce. Of course, the Democrats have canvassed their view on this matter earlier but, as I have said, the Government believes that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal should be concerned with matters of substance and not with what can be irrelevant transactions on both sides of the argument-that is, where the interest is known to be minuscule or, on the other side of the argument, where the interest or control is known to be absolute. There is very little point served by the Tribunal examining an increase in a person's interests if the person is already clearly in control of the licensee. What point is served by the Tribunal examining interests too small to be of any real influence, or, as I have said before, examining interests that are known to be in control simply because they are required to go through that process and waste a great deal of resources in so doing?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be informed of interests in licensees and will be able to inquire into them if it thinks fit. But it should not be required to waste its resources on formal exercises. Having said that, as I have also made clear, it should then be accountable for its actions. The Government therefore wishes, I think reasonably, to see the Tribunal either complete ownership or control inquiries within six months or give written reasons why it cannot. For this reason the Government opposes the amendments, but it also opposes them because they will have the effect of validating the current situation where persons holding excess interests can demand and expect-and no doubt get-repeated extensions of time in which to dispose of those interests. Under the amendments only one such extension would be possible, which again I think is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will ensure that the Tribunal can concentrate its resources on matters of substance. In those circumstances, it is reasonable for the Tribunal to deal with those matters quickly and for persons with excess interests to be expected to comply with the requirements of the Act within a reasonable period. The reason why we will be opposing these amendments and also the amendments to clauses 27 and 28 is that if they are agreed to they will fundamentally destroy all of the efficiencies the Government is looking for with this Bill. </PARA>

We welcome the Government's moves to rectify this deficiency and we hope the experience with Network 10 has been a lesson for the Government and that it takes this on board in this long awaited fundamental review of broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, I believe, that whatever body we are to have to regulate this industry that the powers provided to it must be sufficient to enable it to protect the public interest in all cases. I believe that this particular amendment will ensure this protection and it has the support of the Democrats.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 5. After clause 29, page 27, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Review of decisions</PARA>
<PARA> ``29a. Section 119a of the Principal Act is amended by inserting after paragraph (1) (g) the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `(1) (gaaa) a direction by the Tribunal under subsection 92m (1aa);'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to section 92m, which provides very far reaching powers to give directions to protect licensees, clearly has to be exercised with caution. We think this amendment should certainly be the subject of review where necessary by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. On its face, it provides quite open-ended and draconian powers, which may or may not be exercised properly, which may or may not be reasonable in the circumstances, but which could have very significant secondary effects on a whole range of potential players, be they bankers, creditors or accountants. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that one can have unintended consequences in this area, as we saw recently with the bid by Asahi for shares in Elders IXL Ltd, which Senator Collins and I discussed in this chamber. One could have a situation which was never contemplated where, by dint of a series of interlocking transactions, one could have an ability to control a licence-something that never occurred to one in the first place when one simply bought shares in a quiet little manufacturing company that was subsequently discovered to have shares in a media organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the way in which the ability to influence or be in a position to exercise control is defined in section 89ja, taking it at its highest point, a person could exercise control merely by virtue of being in a position in any manner to indirectly exercise restraint over any substantial issue affecting the management or affairs of a company. That is nebulous in the extreme. It is very unpredictable and may well give rise to a determination by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that was not contemplated by a range of parties, and certainly those whose interests may be affected, but not properly taken into account at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore take the view that, just as section 119A prescribes a long list of circumstances in which the power of review is available to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), particularly where one has a power as sweeping as this to give directions affecting a whole range of third parties, one ought, in fairness and in terms of justice, to be entitled to have that direction by the Tribunal reviewed by the AAT where necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I do not think this is a particularly helpful amendment. I understand what Senator Alston is trying to achieve, but the effect of this amendment would be to delay an appeal for, say, three months after the event-and it is an important event which would necessitate an appeal. Within those three months, there is the possibility that asset stripping will take place. As I understand it, avenues for appeal would still be available under the Federal Court and under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. So I do not think that this particular amendment is either helpful or necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply respond to that by saying that it seems an extraordinary proposition that one can acknowledge the virtues of an appeal through the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act mechanism, which would make it a one-off in that sense, and yet section 119, which prescribes a whole list of situations in which one can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), Senator Kernot says should not be used because one has other rights. All those other situations attract those similar rights and yet the scheme of the Broadcasting Act is to allow the AAT to build up expertise to review these sorts of decisions. The decisions will not be made lightly. Unless one has a basis for doing it, one will not get to first base. I do not understand why Senator Kernot wishes to have this sort of situation treated differently when it has probably more far-reaching consequences in terms of the width of discretion than almost any other power of the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I indicate at the outset that the Opposition is supporting this legislation. We regret that the Bill must be looked at in the context of the Government's appalling corporate reform mess which has occurred in the last three years. I think it can be fairly said that the Government has handled the subject matter with little tact. In many ways it has contributed to the negative response it has received in recent years from the States. It has given little confidence to practitioners in the field, and it took little notice of the constitutional advice it had before it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The result has been an enormous waste of money and time, and the Government has done little credit to itself. Regrettably, we still see only half the package. As I understand it, the formal agreement upon which the scheme is based is still to be signed. The regulations which are critical to the application of this law are still to be seen. We have before us an amazing timetable. This is, as I said, at the end of some three years. The Government must have this legislation passed and assented to within the next few days. It must make the regulations, and anyone who knows anything about this area will realise that they will be highly complex. It must have the regulations printed and must then distribute the regulations-all of this in time for a start-up date on 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be seen as nothing more than an appalling indictment of the Government's legislative capacities. It is a total shambles. In the House of Representatives one hour was allowed for debate of this important package. No amendments were allowed. Members were in fact given only a few days notice of the details of the legislation. Why is the Government not now being reasonable and allowing adequate time for consideration? The reason is that it has before it a third commencement date. The first two dates have already passed-1 January 1990 and 1 July 1990, and now it has set for itself 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would obviously be humiliated if it were unable to meet its third deadline. It would be simply too embarrassing to again delay the package. That is even though such respected bodies as the Law Institute of Victoria are saying publicly that there should be a delay. Why? It is because practitioners obviously are not going to be able to give good advice. The law has not been passed and we are only a few days before the start-up date. Those who have to work to the law, the consumers in the corporate field, clearly will not understand their obligations. No-one could describe that as good law making. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council of Australia has detailed concerns. It has also had the difficulty of having had the proposed legislation for so short a period of time. Nevertheless, it has sought to meet its responsibility to its members and to the public-it has a public responsibility in this important area which it accepts-by giving advice to the Parliament and to those who are interested. That advice came to us on Monday of this week. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that, at the very least, the concerns of the Law Council should be put before a committee of this Parliament for some more detailed examination. I am pleased that it has now been agreed that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will examine those concerns at a meeting tomorrow night. I should stress that these are not concerns on matters of principle, but on matters of detail. I thank the Australian Democrats for their support. I regret to say that I do not think the Government would have been of a mind to give that extra consideration. At least we as a chamber will have done the minimum which was required although, bearing in mind the complexity, the novelty of the federalism solution that is incorporated in this package and the importance of the issues involved, it is still not really a satisfactory examination by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should have learnt the lesson by now of not doing the job properly because it was warned time and time again that the last package was running a major risk of failing to meet the constitutional requirements as they related to the power to legislate for incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I take a minute or two of the Senate's time to remind the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and the Government of my presentation, and the presentation of others as well, to the reference in October 1988 of the previous package to a joint committee, when I attempted to draw together all of the pieces of constitutional advice that were before the Senate. I asked the Government seriously to consider the danger of legislating when so many eminent practitioners were advising it that its legislation would fall. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look back through the history of the Commonwealth, we see that on a number of occasions it was believed that the Commonwealth's power was inadequate. In fact, there were referendums to change the Commonwealth's power in this area. In 1911, 1913, 1919, 1926-even back in those years-the short cut that the Government was seeking to take was considered to be inadequate. In 1929, the Royal Commission on the Constitution recommended that the Constitution be amended to confer power on the Commonwealth in legislative form in this area. In 1959, the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review recommended that the Constitution be amended to grant this power. The Government's advisory committee to the Constitutional Commission in 1987-the advisory committee on trade and national economic management-recommended constitutional reform to overcome doubts that existed as to the constitutional competence of the Commonwealth to support legislation of this type. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government will be aware, that advice was given only a few months after the conflicting advice of Sir Maurice Byers to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which looked at this matter in 1987. In fact, the Attorney-General's Department, in a submission to the Senate Committee, made it clear that it had doubts as to the constitutional validity of the Commonwealth in this area. It said that there was still room for doubt in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, the Government had before it a joint memorandum of the Solicitors-General of each of the States and the Northern Territory, produced on 9 March 1988, which unanimously questioned the Commonwealth's legal competence in this area. They said that there was at least a reasonable prospect that the High Court of Australia would conclude that the incorporation power of the Commonwealth did not extend to the matters. Advice from the Law Institute of Victoria which was given in August 1988 which the Government had before it was to a similar effect. </PARA>
<PARA> There were numerous other advisers-advisers from Mallesons Stephen Jaques, and advisers from the Law Council of Australia which put out its advice on 31 August 1988. It believed it would be irresponsible for the Commonwealth to legislate on the basis of its existing constitutional powers. It said that the Commonwealth should not legislate unless and until the Constitution had been appropriately amended. Despite all of that good advice the Government pressed on and it suffered the consequences when the High Court, on an action brought by the States, found against it. So all of that effort, all of the money that had been spent, the resources of practitioners, and the traumatic debates with the States, had been in effect wasted and the Government had to go back to square one again. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had more time, which we have not, I could go through so many other presentations before the Senate during those debates in which the Government was warned of the path it was entering upon. It did not accept the advice. There is no doubt that constitutional reform would be a more ideal way to go, or, as the Law Council has suggested in its advice which I mentioned that it gave to the Senate on Monday of this week, a referral of powers would be a better option than the path the Government has now gone down. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to discuss briefly what the Government has in fact adopted and what it is seeking to do by this legislation. In many ways it is really a refinement of the former cooperative scheme. A ministerial council remains which will have a consultative role in respect of all legislative proposals and a deliberative role in relation to company law statutes. So in some ways it is still not a national scheme in the sense that it seems the Commonwealth must take initiatives to the ministerial council. Presumably if other than incorporation matters are involved there will again be a need for reciprocal State legislation. The Minister might clarify that point. If that is so, we run the danger that the cooperative scheme ran into after a few years; that is, if the States-under different governments and different attitudes-do not respond with identical reciprocal legislation, it seems to me we are back to the position of inconsistency and lack of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA> Company law matters will be particularly important because of the constitutional matter that I raised. One wonders whether this Parliament is still going to achieve the proper parliamentary accountability that has been demanded for so long. It still seems that in many ways this ministerial council intervenes. As I said, we may not end up with the certainty that is required. It is difficult, despite what the Minister says in the second reading speech, to see a single clearly defined line of ministerial responsibility. It is true that there will be one regulatory body, one enforcement body. We on this side of the chamber believe that that is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say in passing that the State corporate affairs commissions (CACs) actually were not doing a bad job in relation to the enforcement aspects. I know many able practitioners-accountants and from the law-who have worked in the enforcement areas of CACs, particularly in my State of South Australia, and did a good job for many years, but the CACs have received little credit in this package. Certainly, the scheme will provide a national registration and that, we believe, is good. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been saying for a long time that because of the nature of business, apart from the very small types of business which some see as being more akin to a partnership form, there is a need for a more national approach and, in some ways, a more international approach. There should be a national registration. Those who trade with Australia should be able to look upon our corporate structures in national terms. That is why we accept that this measure, at least to that extent, is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have criticised in the past is not that direction but the fact that the Government sought to take it without accepting the requirement for cooperation: cooperation of the States; cooperation of those who practise in the field within the States; and cooperation of the business sector that has to exist under this regulatory regime. For some years the Government fought against the need for that cooperation and ultimately it lost. Even now it seems that it was not prepared to speak to the Opposition parties in Western Australia, and it has lost the opportunity-at least for the time being-of embracing all States within the package. I think that is a matter of regret. </PARA>
<PARA> The design of the scheme is for cooperative constitutional legislation and for uniform law and administration by one agency. As I said, we believe that is heading down the right path and we would therefore be prepared to give it support. There is no doubt that in the impossible timetable that the Government has set-because of the shambles it has got itself into in this area over the last three years-there will be shortcomings and flaws in this legislation. Despite our efforts tomorrow night, it will be a responsibility that the Government will have to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by raising a few other matters. I wonder what has happened to the close corporations aspect, which was seen as so valuable only some months ago but seems to have been dropped off the list in this legislative package. Also, what does the Government propose in relation to small companies that clearly are not of a national context and do not require the same level of regulatory intervention? We on this side of the chamber would certainly be interested in hearing what it intends to do in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I refute in many ways something that also appears in the Minister's second reading speech-that is, blaming the level of corporate misbehaviour which has occurred in this country in recent years on the shortcomings in the previous legislative scheme. By and large, that is not a fair criticism. It would be much more reasonable for the Government to accept that it is not a question of the shortcomings. I acknowledge that there are still shortcomings in the law, and I intend to mention them in a minute, but in many ways the failure to properly regulate reflected the refusal of the Commonwealth to apply reasonable resources to the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) in its enforcement role. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that refusal, the NCSC went down this path of seeking to find business solutions to legal problems, to find ways of reaching agreement-some might say doing deals. I have to say that it was a path that I always found uncomfortable. I have mentioned on a number of occasions in this chamber that I regard it as unsatisfactory, but the NCSC was given little choice as a result of being starved of resources. More resources are now being put into enforcement and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) might be given the credit, but in many ways it is unfair to seek to judge what its future performance will be with much greater funding compared with the past performance of the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned a moment ago, there are still many areas needing reform. The Government has concentrated over the last three years on its structural reform, to some extent avoiding the qualitative reform that has been necessary, at the very least, to keep up with the major changes in business practice, new technology, the internationalisation of business, and so forth. I notice that the Government tonight even acknowledges areas of shortcoming in relation to loans to directors, insider trading and many other areas. One might say that more effort should have gone into those areas of legislative reform in recent years if the Government was to meet its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I also voice the disappointment expressed by the Law Council of Australia that the Government now seems to have departed from its previous practice, which actually commenced before it took office, of providing exposure drafts which gave practitioners a chance to properly examine intended legislation and to produce better quality work as a result. As I said, that has been criticised in this instance by the Law Council. I also think it is a disappointing move in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time available tonight I simply sum up by saying that the final trend-if this is to be the final trend, although it in turn will have to stand the assessment of the courts and, as I said, it is a novel approach-is one which we nevertheless are prepared to support. We regret that the Government has not accepted the sensitivity of federalism in recent years, that an enormous amount of energy and resources have been lost through the Government's incompetence in this area, and that the uncertainty and failure to legislate properly and meet its responsibilities has also contributed to the poor standing to which some of the corporate world has fallen in recent years. I trust that the Government in its final year or two of office has now learnt that lesson and that it might now get on to some of the other areas of critically important qualitative reform which I outlined a moment ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to Senator Hill's speech, as I always do. If one understands his speech as Senator Hill no doubt meant it to be understood, one could only agree with much of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understood Senator Hill to be saying that the thrust of this legislation on corporations, what it aims to achieve and the means it will use in that regard are to be approved, indeed praised, although Senator Hill is less than happy with the method by which the legislation has got to this stage in the Senate. As I understand it, he was criticising the failure of the Government over the years to seek cooperation among the various groups that he says it should have. Indeed, he mentioned the States, the Law Council of Australia and the Law Institute of Victoria. I cannot but agree with him that proper consultation with those bodies and with all the groups with an interest in this legislation should have been carried out. His area of difference with the Government is with its process of consultation and certainly not with the substantive matters with which this legislation deals and the way in which it deals with that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of discussion leading to the present legislation. Over the years the matter has been discussed by some very eminent figures. I will take a short time to go through the names of the people who, through this Parliament, contributed mightily to the debate leading to the legislation before us tonight. In that context I should mention, firstly, the report of the Select Committee on Securities and Exchange-Australian Securities Markets and their Regulation-which was presented in this chamber in July 1974. The Chairman of the Committee which prepared that report was Senator Peter Rae. The other people on that Committee also deserve mention and honourable senators will see their eminence: Senator Durack, Senator Georges, Senator Lawrie, Senator Sim, Senator Wheeldon and Senator Wriedt. A former member of the Committee was Senator Cormack. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available to me I also mention the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-The Role of Parliament in relation to the National Companies Scheme-which was presented to the Senate in April 1987. The Chairman of that Committee when it presented the report was the present Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Nick Bolkus. Prior to that, the inquiry by the Committee had commenced under the chairmanship of Senator Michael Tate, who is presenting this Bill tonight. The Deputy Chairman of that Committee was also of some eminence, being Senator Robert Hill who, although he insisted tonight that there should have been more consultation by the Government with various bodies, certainly had given considerable consideration to these reports. The Government had available to it, not only in this report but also in other reports, the considerable learning of Senator Hill. No doubt he discussed these issues with the various bodies he mentioned tonight. Senator Alston was also on that Committee, as were Senator Puplick and Senator Margaret Reynolds. </PARA>
<PARA> A report was presented in the House of Representatives by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs under the chairmanship of Mr Alan Griffiths, who is now the Minister for Resources, with Mr Smith as his Deputy Chairman. The Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation also brought down a report. That Committee was chaired by Mr Ronald Edwards; Senator Jim Short was the Deputy Chairman and the Committee's members included Senator Alston, Senator Macklin from the Australian Democrats, Senator McMullan, Mr Warwick Smith and Mr Duncan Kerr. That Committee went deeply into this legislation and heard witnesses from many sources, including the various sources Senator Hill mentioned tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1989 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presented a report on company directors' duties to this chamber. Again it had the privilege of having serve on it Senator Alston, Senator Hill, Senator Pat Giles-who, as everyone would agree, has a fine legal mind which is too often underestimated, although she says she is not legally qualified-Senator Janet Powell, now leader of the Australian Democrats in this chamber, Senator Schacht, and Senator John Stone from Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I read through the list of people who prepared those reports to illustrate that, although consultation is another matter the Government should undertake, especially in an area like this, there is a limit to the amount of consultation to be undertaken, particularly when the corporate sector is being dealt with, that sector being the one that has the most to do with the economic life of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill said, there is a desperate need to have the framework by which the corporate sector operates in proper order. He agreed to that, although he said, as I understand him, that more consideration should be given to the way that framework is set up. Of course, that is a matter of judgment on his part. In my view, this legislation has been delayed for too long. Given the need, as I have already said, to set up a proper structure within which the economic life of this country must run, it is important to bring this legislation on track as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from being critical of the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy for having brought this matter on as rapidly as he has done, I think it is a great credit to him that he has been able to get this legislation before the House and passed, we hope, before Christmas so that it can come into operation by 1 January. I think that Mr Duffy deserves great praise for having guided the legislation to this point. I think he has shown himself to be a great Attorney-General in being able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> He has not been able to do it without the cooperation of two States-Victoria and New South Wales. Mr Kennan in Victoria has been a great advocate of the national scheme and has been of crucial importance in getting this legislation through. Two other people need to be mentioned: Mr Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales, has shown foresight and a generosity, which at times is not present in Premiers of various States, in seeing that this legislation goes through; Mr Dowd, his Attorney-General, deserves considerable praise, which I give him. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill says, `It may be that situations arise which would require amendment to this legislation'. That is no reason to stop its passage now. All legislation, particularly legislation as complex as this, does call for amendments from time to time. The very Act is a result of years of amendment, refurbishment and rethinking. No doubt, after this, history will be repeated. As things change, new provisions have to be brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some other matters that Senator Hill properly raised. He spoke of the need for proper regulation of corporations and of the lack of regulation during the 1980s. In that context, he spoke of the corporate misbehaviour that we all know of. Companies are central to our business life and, no doubt, dishonesty does occur in business, but it is extrinsic to it; that is, it is outside the normal, proper operations of business. </PARA>
<PARA> Insider trading, misuse of shareholders' funds, fraudulent statements in prospectuses, and illegal transfer of funds from one company to another all occur in a corporate sector, but are not intrinsic to its operation whereas production is. It is an essential mark of the business world that it be productive. If it is not, an essential dimension of its nature and purpose is denied. I want to deal quickly with that matter now. </PARA>
<PARA> Ugly betrayals of trust, gross misuse of boardroom powers and profligate expenditure of company funds have been rightly condemned in recent times. Laws have been made to meet these evils and are welcomed by the corporate sector as well as by the community generally. No person of decent instincts wants sharp, questionable or criminal practices to be tolerated, whether in the administration of companies or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these practices seem to have pervaded the business world in the last decade they do not reflect its essential role, which is to carry out Australia's trade and industry. Some important issues arise from that. Parliament and the courts properly punish delinquent conduct in the corporate sector. They are expected to do likewise wherever it appears. But how far should they intervene when the conduct, although not immoral, prejudices the success of a company's operations? Should officers who carry out a task with a lack of care and diligence be punished as criminals?</PARA>
<PARA> Section 229 (2) of the Companies Act 1981 and section 232 (4) of the Corporations Act 1989 provide that they should. I consider that to be harsh legislation, but it does show an understanding of the substantive character of corporate activities. Companies are instruments for carrying out trade and industry in an efficient and productive manner. If an officer diminishes their ability to do so, even though not in a criminal way, he strikes at their very essence. </PARA>
<PARA> By the proper running of companies I mean simply that the people within them should avoid committing criminal acts and show a proper dedication to the task to which they have been appointed, that is, as I said before, to carry out the trade and industry of the country. If they do that, they perform a proper function. In the end, that can be done only if there is a greater growth in the ethics with which people who are in control of companies go about their task. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this point: in that context, I think much praise should be given to Mr Henry Bosch, who is presently trying to ensure that ethical conduct becomes the norm of company activities. As Senator Hill suggested, and I repeat, Henry Bosch was one of the few people who in the 1980s warned of the impending turmoil into which the corporate sector has now come. Like the prophets of old, he saw the problem early in its gestation and struggled rather lonehandedly to do something about it. I think this is an appropriate time to note that and give him much praise. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue before the corporate sector in the 1990s seems to me to be not so much whether there will be the gross conduct of the past with conduct like insider trading but whether companies have the ability to conduct Australia's industry and financial life in a proper way for us to recover economically. We should be looking towards achieving that goal. I conclude by saying that this legislation lays a very solid and sound foundation for the corporate sector to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill raises the question in a very real sense as to whether we are one nation or a conglomeration of States each rowing its own boat. I believe it is a very significant step forward in our progress towards one nation. It is as yet, as has been mentioned before, imperfect, and it is for that reason that the Australian Democrats agreed to refer it to a committee, which will meet tomorrow. We wish to go a step further and seek Government assurance that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) advisory committee will carefully monitor the performance of this legislation and recommend to Parliament subsequent amendments that should be instituted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was mentioned by one of the earlier speakers-I believe it was Senator Hill-that the corporate misbehaviour was in part due to the old unsatisfactory legislation. That may certainly have been the case, but only to a small degree. We should not forget that corporate misbehaviour, irresponsible lending, the fraudulent behaviour of directors and all the other practices we are aware of were made possible by wholesale deregulation instituted by this Government and supported by the Opposition. In that situation, we should have been aware that we would need more rather than less regulation. Here I wish to extend my compliments to Mr Henry Bosch who, with very few and scarce resources, did a tremendous job over the years in attempting to keep some order and obedience to the law in the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As we now move to the conclusion of the development of this extremely important piece of legislation, it may be worth recalling its now quite extensive history and the part that various participants have played in it. Since the Government's announcement in 1987 that it would proceed to the national scheme to replace the existing cooperative scheme, the proposed national scheme has been thoroughly debated and examined. This detailed scrutiny and examination has been rarely matched in recent times, and to that extent I cannot agree with Senator Hill's complaint that consultation has been inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Parliament, pleasingly, has played an extremely significant role in advancing debate on the issue. The need for a national scheme to replace the cooperative scheme was acknowledged as early as 1974 by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, the Rae committee. That Committee concluded that it was vital that the national character of the corporate activities being regulated be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since the report of the Rae committee, the business environment and Australian securities and financial markets have changed rapidly and dramatically, but the mechanisms for dealing with them have scarcely changed at all. The problems associated with this situation were acknowledged yet again in 1987 by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which Senator Hill was a member. In its report The Role of the Parliament in relation to the National Companies Scheme the Committee concluded that the cooperative scheme had served the needs of the 1970s but had failed to meet the needs of business as we head into the next century. Increasingly, the cooperative scheme had become a creakingly inadequate mechanism, illequipped to adapt to the new business environment. The Committee report further recommended that the Federal Parliament develop and assume responsibility for the national companies and securities scheme. The report, then, had a considerable influence on the legislation which finally emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> This new approach-a single system of law for corporate legislation in Australia, an approach which, incidentally, in the Committee's recommendations was unanimous-was supported in principle by the Australian Democrats from the very beginning. First, the position adopted in the 1987 report and the need for a scheme looking into the future and our position rested on two further matters, both of them of major significance. One is parliamentary and ministerial accountability and the other is the attitude of the business community to the regulatory mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to parliamentary and ministerial accountability, it is obvious that there were serious problems with the old scheme. Every time, for example, an amendment was seen as necessary, the almost impossible task of getting the Commonwealth and all the States to agree put everybody off. On numerous occasions we were forced to pass deficient pieces of legislation, very often identified by the Parliament's own Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills because of this problem. In fact, Parliament was effectively denied the possibility of exercising proper responsibility in this important area. At the level of ministerial accountability, no single Minister had responsibility for the old scheme and therefore, in effect, nobody was in charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made our position clear in principle, the Democrats were keen to ensure that the process of developing this legislation was as constructive as possible and that the final version of the legislation was as good as possible. In line with that approach, when the first enormous version of the legislation came before this chamber the Australian Democrats moved to refer it to a joint select committee for examination of its complex detail. On this matter tribute should be paid to the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, for his cooperation at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> What we were hoping the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation would do-and in fact it did it-was to take evidence over six months from Australians, business organisations, business generally, lawyers and other groups that were interested in this area right around the country. It was a quite extensive process of consultation. The Committee took an innovative approach to the investigation, one which could well be used in future. A representative from the Attorney-General's Department, the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Australian Stock Exchange went with the Committee and provided it with invaluable expertise and information on a day-to-day basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Also as a result of the Committee reference, a very large number of people and businesses throughout Australia became aware of the import of the package and were willing to come forward with valu- able information and contributions. When the Committee's final report came out, the productive nature of the process was quite apparent, I believe, and the value of the whole exercise in relation to the largest group of Bills ever to be introduced in the Federal Parliament cannot be overestimated. A range of immediate amendments was agreed to and the quality of the whole package was significantly improved as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from other aspects, evidence before the Committee substantiated the view that most businesses throughout Australia also saw the need for a national scheme. They could see how imperative it was for the good of Australia's business community and Australia's future. The broadly constructive nature of the debate at that time was somewhat sullied by variants of spurious States rights arguments put forward in defiance of the clear national good that would be served by a national scheme. Furthermore, the Opposition parties wasted some time in wanting to debate the constitutionality of certain aspects of the package. As the Democrats noted at the time, this was essentially an exercise in futility. </PARA>
<PARA> The proper body to rule on constitutionality is the High Court of Australia. In due course it did so, and the consequences of its ruling are addressed in the legislation we have before us tonight. In that case, the High Court decided that section 51 (xx) of the Constitution did not give it proper power to legislate with respect to the incorporation of trading and financial corporations but that that did not detract from its plenary power to legislate on the governance and activities of such bodies after the formal act of incorporation had been concluded. That High Court ruling did nothing to diminish the conviction of the Australian Democrats that corporate regulation must be proceeded with on a national basis, and we were pleased to see that the Government's resolve remained as well. The Government's negotiations with the States and the Northern Territory led to agreement on future corporate regulation in Australia. The matters agreed in the heads of agreement are translated into the scheme to which the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect. The heads of agreement and the Bill take into account the decision of the High Court and the need to avoid any future constitutional uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> As this somewhat agonising and long overdue process was drawing to a conclusion, it is almost unbelievable that a segment of the Opposition parties has moved to partially cripple the scheme and completely unbelievable that the Federal leadership of the Liberal Party has failed to stop this happening. </PARA>
<PARA> With an astonishing capacity for political irresponsibility, the Western Australian Liberal Opposition has rejected the necessary mirroring legislation in that State's upper House. Presumably motivated by some obscure concept of States rights, it has probably done more damage to business in Western Australia than even some of that State's now disgraced corporate high fliers. Companies operating in Western Australia will have to experience the cost and confusion of complying with two systems of corporate law and administration. To quote the Chairman of the ASC, Mr Tony Hartnell, they will be `foreign companies' when they operate outside Western Australia. Even companies not domiciled in Western Australia but which conduct some operations or activities in Western Australia will face the extra cost and inconvenience of differing rules of compliance. The Western Australian Liberals obviously do not care about higher compliance costs, legal anomalies and potential litigation, increased legal costs and inevitable confusion and inconvenience. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more astounding than the gross irresponsibility of the Western Australian Liberals is the weakness of the Federal parliamentary Liberal leadership. Faced with this outrageous action on the part of his Western Australian branch, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has tried to have it both ways. He has publicly disagreed with its decision, but has done nothing to either prevent it or reverse it. </PARA>

<PARA> Even with the exhaustive amount of work already done, with legislation of this size and complexity, there are bound to be some unintended consequences and inadequacies in the transitional arrangements. Indeed, this week we in the chamber will be grappling with some last minute concerns that have been raised by the Law Council of Australia and Coles Myer Ltd. However, the ASC has said that it will deal sympathetically with anyone caught out by inadequacies in the transitional arrangements and will exercise its discretionary powers to exempt them from any unintended breaches of the new legislation. Monitoring arrangements are in place and the Parliament may need to make clarifying amendments in the future on the basis, I trust, of the recommendations from the advisory committee of the ASC which is to be charged with that duty. </PARA>
<PARA> However, to countenance now any further delay would be unconscionable. Domestic investor confidence, Australia's international reputation and the ability of our business community to function effectively and efficiently have all been badly shaken by the corporate excesses of the 1980s. This Parliament now has the opportunity to pass a national regime which offers the possibility of a sound and properly regulated framework for corporate activity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, I wish to advert to my private member's Bill, the Financial Corporations (Prudential Standards) Amendment Bill, introduced some weeks ago, which seeks to create a similar national scheme to regulate building societies and credit unions. It is time that we consider non-bank institutions as part of our financial system, and that the Commonwealth Government and the Reserve Bank of Australia take responsibility for those institutions that are stated in their charters. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the corporate experience of the 1980s, it is important that the passage of this legislation is implemented as quickly as possible. It is no exaggeration to describe this legislation as historic, and all those who see Australia as a single nation, with a need to secure its future economic well-being, will support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As our Leader in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, has said, the Opposition will be supporting the progress of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill through the Senate, although many of the comments I am about to make could possibly raise some doubt as to the level of support I give to the package. I open by responding to some of the outrageous remarks made by Senator Spindler. I think it was Senator Walsh, from the opposite side of the chamber, who during the last election referred to the Australian Democrats as being the fairies at the bottom of the garden. Some weeks ago I suggested that the fairies were no longer at the bottom of the garden; they had actually come into the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is absolutely outrageous that Senator Spindler should suggest that in this new corporations package a national scheme is now required because of the corporate excesses of the late 1980s and because of some failures of the cooperative scheme. In the whole of his address to the Senate tonight, he blamed the Opposition parties in Western Australia for upsetting this new national scheme. Senator Spindler even blamed Dr John Hewson, the Federal Leader of the Opposition, for not going over to Western Australia and telling them what to do. The Liberal Party of Australia does have a Federal system and the Federal Leader does not tell the members of a State upper House what they should do. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the worst aspect of what Senator Spindler tried to have the Senate believe tonight is that he did not criticise this Government at all during the whole of his address about the undermining of the cooperative scheme and the lack of resources for the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). The only negative political comments he made in his entire address were directed to the Opposition and, indeed, to the Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson. It shows that Senator Spindler is, indeed, quite out of touch with what has happened in corporations law reform over the last few years. I suggest that all he did tonight was attempt to read a speech probably written for him by former Senator Michael Macklin, who was indeed very much involved in the process of developing this new national scheme and deserves some credit for his role therein. Senator Spindler's contribution is far less evident. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the legislation has arrived in this chamber tonight after a tortuous process. As Senator Spindler correctly said, the legislation is the product of a deal that was done in Alice Springs nearly six months ago. At that time a heads of agreement and legislative program were put down, and we were told that the legislation would actually appear in September. So the legislation is quite late. As I suggested during the Appropriations debate, it may be that the delay in drafting that legislation was a matter of design as opposed to just bad luck or delays caused by the complexity of the matter, because it is fair to say that the parliaments around Australia-each State parliament, the Territory parliaments and, indeed, this Federal Parliament-have not had enough time to look at what is a very complex matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one of the most complex pieces of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. The new unofficial consolidation of the Corporations Act 1989 and the current amendment legislation form quite a weighty document, which acts as a good bookend on anyone's bookshelf. As Senator Hill said earlier, the amendment Bill deserves a lot more scrutiny by the Senate. I am quite sure the Australian Democrats would support me in that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for reform was quite clear some years ago. The cooperative scheme did have some failings but the process of reform that has been entered into in the intervening years has, I would suggest to the Senate, created a degree of uncertainty and a degree of lack of knowledge of the law. It is a reform process that has led to the situation where we are now in December 1990 looking forward to a 1 January start-up date for the new scheme, and where the peak professional bodies have very little idea of how the Bill or any of the new legislation is going to work. The Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Securities Commission, the bodies responsible for the legislation, have very little idea of how or if it is going to work or if the constitutional underpinnings of the legislative package are going to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The position that the Liberal and National Party Legislative councillors in Western Australia have taken is going to make the process slightly more difficult in that State. I suppose that was an unforeseen position; however, this Government was warned of such possibilities on many occasions. The opposition of the Western Australian Liberal Party to this whole national scheme has been well documented, is well known and should have been taken into account by people who had some idea of administration and who could have made some contingency plans for it. The legislation that we have before us tonight, in concert with the Corporations Act 1989, does centralise more power and control into the hands of very few bureaucrats and a couple of politicians in Canberra. It will be a system that will be far less in tune with the local business community, and the business and corporate sector influence in the whole corporate regulatory process will be significantly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We may ask ourselves why it is bad not to have business and corporate sector influence on the corporate regulatory pro- cess reduced. There is no better person to quote in relation to this matter than Henry Bosch, the former head of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). Mr Bosch, in his recently published book The Workings of a Watchdog, in his reference to the five part-time members of the NCSC, says:</PARA>
<PARA>They were all senior businessmen with wide experience and great strength and independence of mind. They all had wide personal contacts and considerable influence in important parts of the business community. The long experience of the chairman and deputy chairman in various parts of the private sector provided knowledge and confidence. The practice of maintaining frequent and detailed contact with business and professional organisations and the individual firms that were affected by our policies deepened our knowledge and strengthened our business relationships and our resolve. The fact that we were constantly dealing with scores of practical situations arising from investigations and applications from the private sector ensured that our judgments were based on up-to-date information. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that as we now have a scheme controlled by a much smaller bureaucracy in Canberra, contact with the business community is going to be somewhat reduced. One of the proposals that I would like the Government to consider, perhaps in the committee stage of this Bill tomorrow or whenever it may be, is that we have a regional advisory committee network set up as well as the national advisory committee, on which there are some business representatives from each State. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to believe the Government's rhetoric about trying to make the regional offices responsive to the local needs of the business community, the regional directors would be quite advantaged by having a small advisory group in each State and a formalised network. I know that that would be one thing that the Western Australian business community and the Western Australian Liberal Party, if it matters, would be sure to support. The regional directors in each of the States could have a formal mechanism for consultation with local business groups. Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) can answer that suggestion when he responds. </PARA>
<PARA> The genesis of this scheme is not something that has just arisen in the 1980s; the desire to centralise control over corporations has been a part of the Australian Labor Party's centralist doctrine since the early 1970s. In 1974, the introduction of the Lionel Murphy corporations and securities industry legislation was the first parliamentary representation of the Labor Party's centralist doctrine in relation to this area of policy. That initiative by the then Senator Murphy was cut short by the events of 11 November 1975. After that the Fraser Government introduced the scheme that we now have, the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This was not to dissuade the centralists in the Labor Party. In August 1979 the now retired Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, introduced a private member's Bill, which was fundamentally the Murphy package, in the House of Representatives, again trying to centralise control over corporations and securities. The former Attorney-General did not have much success in 1979. As has been said a number of times here tonight, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in April 1987 made representations that a national scheme be entered into. I think it is fair to say that at that time the Federal Government made a political commitment to ensure that the cooperative scheme was not enhanced, reformed or allowed to succeed. Mr Bosch's book refers to a letter from a senior Treasury officer in late 1987, saying that the Commonwealth will not entertain any more reform of the cooperative scheme `while there is to be no further legislative amendment in the context of the Co-operative Scheme'. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a determined conspiracy-I suppose that is a strong word, but it is the most descriptive word I can use-to ensure the cooperative scheme was not a success after 1987. The resourcing level of the NCSC after that date was something of a national scandal. Its annual budget was something in the order of $22m. As Mr Bosch says quite descriptively, that was less than the subsidy provided to the Australian Capital Territory bus service. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the sort of money that this Government committed to the national corporate watchdog, and we wonder why the members of the Senate and the Government can contend that there was a need for reform because the old scheme had failed. I put it to the Senate that the scheme failed because the Government wanted it to fail, and it has got its way. The later history of it is that the 1989 legislation appeared. As Senator Spindler, Senator Hill and others have referred to tonight, that failed on constitutional grounds, despite the best advice of that eminent centralist lawyer, Sir Maurice Byers, that it would stand up. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, a deal was done in June which saw the States agree to enter into a new arrangement to form this new national scheme. Part of that deal was to ensure that the New South Wales Government would see the chairman based in Sydney, with something like 8,000 square metres of office space, and all the attendant bureaucrats and employees of the Australian Securities Commission being settled in Sydney. For the people of New South Wales that was probably a good thing, because one of the problems that my constituents have is that it is a long way from Western Australia if one has problems or if one wants to have some influence on the course of corporate law reform or corporate law in any sense whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> In Sydney, I guess people such as the Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, have a little trouble understanding some of our opposition to this centralisation process. For people such as the good Premier and the good people of New South Wales, it will not really be a problem to go to the head office of the Australian Securities Commission because it will be located in their capital city. So the process of handing over State control to the Commonwealth does not have the very worrying effects that it has for people who live in Western Australia, so many thousands of kilometres away from the centre of political and corporate power in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The process I have just described has had, of course, some consequences that are less than desirable. It has, indeed, destroyed morale within the NCSC. It has destroyed the careers of many people in the NCSC and the corporate affairs commissions around the States. I think it is a disgrace that job offers were not made many months ago by the Australian Securities Commission to the staff of the corporate affairs commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> We were given an assurance by Senator Tate that job offers would be made towards the end of the first week in December, only some 20 days from the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission. These people have been living in some form of career limbo since the announcement of the deal back in June. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think any of us, in contemplating our futures, would like to have no idea for a period of a week or two, let alone six months, of when an offer was going to come or what our remuneration package or career structure would be. But these poor people in the corporate affairs offices around Australia have been subjected to this. Is it any wonder to any of us here that industrial disputes are taking place in most of the corporate affairs offices around Australia as I talk tonight?</PARA>
<PARA> There are many other problems that I have referred to earlier in relation to the setting up of the Australian Securities Commission. I do not intend going over these matters tonight. However, they are, of course, relevant in Western Australia. During the debate on the Appropriations the ASCOT principle-the Australian Securities Commission on time principle-was enunciated. It has now become quite clear to anyone who has anything to do with this legislative package, be it in the Parliament or be it out in the business community where it really matters, that ASCOT is not going to win its first race, that the odds are off, that ASCOT will not be achieved and that the Australian Securities Commission will not be on time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have all come to the realisation that the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, and the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Hartnell, are determined that at all cost they will start up the Australian Securities Commission on 1 January. It does not matter if Western Australia is in it. It does not really matter if the Commission does not have its offices set up. It does not matter if it does not have its computers or trained staff. The Commission has to get it up because it is politically imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not really matter about the service levels to the business community. It does not matter if the legal community and the professional community have not had time to look at the regulations. It does not matter if they have not had time to go down and buy the new Bills and the unofficial consolidation from the Government bookshop because the legislation will pass this place only a few days before the Australian Securities Commission is meant to be set up. It just does not matter to these people because their concern is the political imperative to get 1 January up and running and worry about all of the problems afterwards. Anyone who denies that is denying what is clear to the whole of the business community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it behoves me to relate my view of the position of the Western Australian Liberal Party. I think this matter deserves airing in the national Parliament. I believe it has been misrepresented by a number of people for their own political ends. We have witnessed a campaign, partly in the Senate, in which Senator Michael Beahan has asked Senator Tate some questions in relation to the position in Western Australia. I put it to honourable senators opposite that some of the answers have actually inflamed the situation. They have, for their own political ends, actually distorted the situation that will occur after 1 January. I guess that is part of the game we play. </PARA>
<PARA> The great thing about what the Western Australian Liberal Party and the National Party have done in Western Australia is that it does cover up the maladministration of the set-up of the Australian Securities Commission. It gives Tony Hartnell, the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, and all of the people associated with the ASCOT principle a very convenient veil to hide behind. We all know that the Australian Securities Commission cannot operate properly in Western Australia until at least March or April next year and that the sensible thing to do would be to delay the start-up date to probably 1 July, the beginning of the new financial year. But that did not matter. So I guess the Western Australian Liberals have given Mr Hartnell and his friends an excuse to hide their lack of administrative skills behind and I guess, to that extent, they have helped the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The great problem in relation to the Western Australian situation is that very few people had any idea of the scheme that was proposed. They did not know the constitutional underpinning of the legislative package. The business community in Western Australia and the Western Australian opposition group in particular, headed by Laurie Shervington, had very little, if any, consultation in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, Senator Tate, in answer to a question asked by Senator Beahan, again as part of their political program to try to rile the Opposition in Western Australia, tabled what he called the heads of agreement, as if it were some great new Magna Carta or document that provided service guarantees to the business community of Western Australia. I thought, `I am glad to see that Senator Tate is finally really concerned about the interests of the poor battling business people in Western Australia and not his own political ends for once'. I flicked through the document and was disgusted to find that it was just really the document that came out of the Alice Springs meeting. If Senator Beahan reads through it he will see that it has nothing to do with service levels in the States. It is really just a document that tries to create a transitional arrangement. It is for the bureaucrats, not the business people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Beahan's question in the Senate this afternoon implied that it was some guarantee of service levels to the people of Western Australia. Of course, the honourable senator knows about the deal that was done by the Western Australian Government. His colleague Joe Berinson, the Attorney-General in Western Australia, signed that heads of agreement with a condition precedent that there would be some guarantees of staffing levels, service levels and various other things. This was, as I said, a condition precedent to the Western Australian Government getting involved in this dirty deal. Those guarantees have never been given. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter that the head of the Western Australian Opposition group, Laurie Shervington, sent to Mr Hartnell on 6 June was replied to in part. But most of the serious issues that he raised, which concern the business community in Western Australia, were not replied to even though he did receive some acknowledgment of his letter from an officer of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We are yet to sight the formal agreement. We have not been told when that formal agreement will be available. Of course, the problem that the Legislative Councillors had in Western Australia was that they really had no time to consider this complex legislation. So they did what they had to and said, `Look, we have not had proper time to consider this. In principle, we are opposed to this centralisation. We have not been consulted about it so we are opposing it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been around this place for something over six months now. As the Minister knows, I have been bitterly opposed to this centralisation. But I have come to realise that once the deal was done, as soon as Nick Greiner decided to be part of the deal and the other States agreed, the whole thing was probably a reality and what Western Australia did probably did not matter. So I have been working very hard for the last months to try to get some guarantees of service for the Western Australian business community. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that the Western Australian Liberal Party position will create some problems for the business community but they are problems that could be easily overcome if this Government were cooperative and took a conciliatory approach to achieving its goal of national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Tony Hartnell, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, went across to Western Australia last Monday to discuss this issue with the Liberal Party. My reports from that meeting were that he took a very conciliatory approach. It surprised me that he did so. I have some letters and some correspondence between Mr Hartnell and Mr Derrick Tomlinson, the Liberal Party Legislative Councillor, who is the shadow Minister handling this legislation, which show that Mr Hartnell made it quite clear to those people that although he did not support their position, he was prepared to compromise on some points and agree to some of the compromise proposals that those Legislative Councillors in Western Australia proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, what happened? His compromise, his conciliatory approach to the Liberals and his clear message that he would be prepared to work through the problem and try to get it going in consultation with the upper House people, lasted only a few hours. When he got back to the eastern States he did a 180 degree turn because his conciliatory approach with the upper House people in Western Australia did not fit into this Government's political program, which was to crash through or crash. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a barrage of statements by the new Minister, the Attorney-General, and by the Chairman, Mr Hartnell, saying, `We'll leave Western Australia out on a limb, we'll let them wither on the vine and we'll just go ahead without them'. They even said they would not set up an office in Perth, which has proved to me to be a distortion of the truth because work on building the office at 66 St Georges Terrace is going ahead full speed today. So it is clearly a bluff. </PARA>
<PARA> My call to this Government is that the Western Australian Liberal Party does have the genuine concerns of the business community at heart; it does have genuine concerns about centralising power. It will assist the Australian Securities Commission in achieving a national scheme, but it will require cooperation, compromise and conciliation. It will not occur by people banging their fists on the table and saying, `You can all go and jump'. The Government will not achieve its stated objective by these means. I doubt that the Government's objective is to get it up and running in Western Australia. The Government's objective is to score political points at a time when Australia needs some hard heads to sort out some of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> My prognosis for the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission is shared by Chanticleer on the back page of the Australian Financial Review of 28 November 1990. Alan Kohler was the correspondent. He basically said that people in business and corporate lawyers should get out of town, take a holiday in January. I do not share Senator Spindler's view that this is the last we will see of this legislation. I think we will be back here all of next year and the year after with amendment after amendment to get this scheme really working. </PARA>
<PARA> One commitment I give to this Government is that I will be here to make sure that it is amended properly, that we certainly commit far more time to this whole area of public policy, and that the interests of the Western Australian business community are far better protected than they have been to date. </PARA>
<PARA> In his article, Alan Kohler refers to a number of issues which he thinks will cause immediate problems. The first one is the matter of rights issues and capital raisings. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the nastiest: any rights issue or other capital raising or share issue that comes under the new capital raising provisions of the Act, and which is still open to the public on January 1, must have a prospectus. In other words, there is no `grandfathering' for any issues that were announced or started before that date.</PARA>
<PARA>So he is saying that if a person is thinking about making an issue, make sure it is closed on 31 December or get another prospectus. The other matter of uncertainty which he raised was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a broader source of uncertainty in the method of getting around the Constitution, which is to `federalise' State law. </PARA>
<PARA>He referred to Bob Austin, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The new law will apply as State law, but the Bill tries to treat it as Commonwealth law as far as possible. This will create legal problems, uncertainty and legal challenges. </PARA>
<PARA>We must never allow corporate law to be made this way again. The process demonstrates what a low ebb has been reached in corporate and securities law reform. </PARA>
<PARA>I commit myself to ensuring that law reform in the future is not carried out like this. I conclude by saying that part of the political barrage that the Western Australian business community has had to put up with in the last week was a threat by Tony Hartnell and the Attorney-General that Western Australian companies will be treated as foreigners. I have read section 102 of the Act on which Tony Hartnell relies. I believe he is scaremongering in a political way. I do not believe Western Australian businesses will be treated in this way. I think the Minister should look into the claims made by Tony Hartnell in relation to the effect of those clauses and reassure the Western Australian business community about the real legal position that they are in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I wish to raise a matter of concern to the Australian Capital Territory Government, not so much because of anything contained in the legislation, but because the ACT is excluded. The reason it is excluded is that section 23(1) (h) of the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Act 1988 precludes the ACT Government from making laws with respect to companies, close corporations, foreign companies, the acquisition of shares in bodies corporate, and the regulation of the securities industry and the futures industry-one of a number of exclusions to the general grant of power for functions of a State-type nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a consequence of this exclusion, the ACT Attorney-General, Mr Collaery, is the only State or Territory Attorney-General who does not have full membership of the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities, a body which I think all would agree has an important consultative role for legislative amendments in this area of corporate law and a deliberative role for law reform. It should be noted that the Northern Territory Attorney-General, following the grant of self-government to the Northern Territory, was granted full membership of the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises two issues. The first is the question of the purpose of the Commonwealth in denying the ACT Government the right to pass laws relating to these matters. I ask whether it is intended to change this or leave it as it is. I do not recall at the time of the legislation being passed any explanation being given for this decision. In view of the recent Special Premiers Conference, where it was suggested that there should be discussions between States, Territories and the Federal Government as to powers and responsibilities, I would like to know whether this will be included as a matter for discussion in the near future. I would appreciate clarification from the Government concerning the reason why the ACT perhaps was excluded in 1988 and still remains excluded. I would also like comment from the Government about whether it believes this should continue. If so, why? If not, when is it likely to change?</PARA>
<PARA> The second issue is whether, notwithstanding the ACT's lack of power to legislate on the matters I have referred to, there are other good reasons for the inclusion of the ACT as a party to the heads of agreement and as a full member of the Ministerial Council. The heads of agreement which were concluded in Alice Springs on 29 June-which have been referred to previously in this debate, and which are included in this legislation-exclude the ACT because of its lack of legislative power with respect to companies and securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General for the ACT has written to all of the State Attorneys-General and to the Federal Attorney-General, putting a case for the inclusion of the ACT in the Ministerial Council, in the belief that the arguments that he has put forward are of substance. I ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate): will the Federal Government look at the reasons given by the ACT Attorney-General? I would hope that a response to this may be given tomorrow night when the Committee meets to discuss this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, I would also ask the Minister to consider giving a response in writing because I understand there are delays with the production of the Senate Hansard for committee reports, so that the response of the Government can be considered before the debate on this matter is concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than taking the time of the Senate tonight in going through in detail the matters raised by the ACT Attorney, I intend to seek leave to incorporate a copy of his letter. He deals with all the issues that are of significance, particularly the question of revenue to the ACT. Mr Deputy President, you may have heard me speak previously in debates about the way I feel regarding the Commonwealth's attitude to the ACT on the transitional funding arrangements. This is not quite the same issue, but we are sensitive about ACT funding matters. The Attorney raises the question of stamp duty, the overlap with local laws, the role of the courts and criminal offences under this legislation, and the matter of certainty in the ACT of the legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the letter, which is addressed to the Attorney-General of South Australia, although copies were to be sent to all State Attorneys, the Northern Territory Attorney and the Federal Attorney. I hope the Government will respond to this in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Sumner,</PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE SCHEME: CORPORATIONS LAW</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to ask if you will support the inclusion of the Australian Capital Territory as a full member in the proposed new national scheme on companies and securities. I have read with interest the Second Reading Speech by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, Hon. Michael Duffy, on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and there is much to commend the proposed legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust you appreciate, however, that I am trying to be constructive when I say that there is, in my opinion, one major deficiency in the scheme and that is the exclusion of the A.C.T. Government as a party to the Heads of Agreement and as full member of the redefined Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities (MINCO). </PARA>
<PARA>There is, I submit, a strong case for the inclusion of the Australian Capital Territory as a full member within the proposed new scheme. I ask you to consider the following</PARA>
<PARA>* MINCO: with its redefined role MINCO will not have power to direct the Australian Securities Commission (ASC); MINCO will have a consultative role for legislative amendments and a deliberative role for law reform; there is no legal nor logical reason to exclude the A.C.T. from full membership of MINCO. </PARA>
<PARA>* HEADS OF AGREEMENT: the Heads of Agreement concluded in Alice Springs on 29 June 1990, excludes the A.C.T. because the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly is precluded from making laws with respect to companies and securities by paragraph 23(1) (h) of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988; nevertheless, there are aspects of the national scheme which could have, at least, recognised the emergence of the A.C.T. as a political entity; the need to supplement the Agreement to settle the ``federalising'' of the courts and criminal offences offers an opportunity for the A.C.T. to be invited as a signatory to this national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>* ONE NATION: a national scheme should be truly national and allow for the recognition of all jurisdictions; our laws should evolve along with the growth of the nation and include newly-emerged political entities. </PARA>
<PARA>* REVENUE: the A.C.T. estimates that the excess of revenue over expenditure on a per annum basis for corporate affairs functions in the A.C.T. runs to some $2.5 million; technically, the revenue issue in the context of the A.C.T. is complex as it also involves consideration of the Commonwealth's general revenue grant to the A.C.T., and the broader issue of A.C.T. involvement in corporate affairs; nevertheless, if the A.C.T. was placed on the same footing as the States and the Northern Territory in the matter of compensation for loss of a corporate affairs function, then it could have expected $1.88 million per annum (i.e. allowing a 25% reduction for the increased funding for the ASC); this notional $1.88 million is, of course, additional to the amounts already agreed under the Heads of Agreement, to compensate the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>* STAMP DUTY: there is a concern that jurisdictions may diverge on stamp duty issues and the A.C.T. needs to protect its own revenue base in this area; while the Commonwealth law is neutral on stamp duty issues it is a subject area which directly affects the A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA>* OVERLAP WITH LOCAL LAWS: regulation of building societies, co-operatives and associations brings with it the need to have some nexus with the financial, securities and corporate sectors (e.g. the recent conversion of one of our building societies into a company for amalgamation into a bank); also there is a move for such regulation to mirror the more sophisticated approach used in the companies and securities area; there is no reason to exclude the A.C.T. from the benefit of intelligence and information sharing which can be available through the national scheme for companies and securities. </PARA>
<PARA>* COURTS: CORPORATE CRIMINAL OFFENCES: the ``federalising'' of the courts, and the prosecution of offences under the new Commonwealth Corporations Law will see the involvement of the A.C.T. Supreme Court and the A.C.T.'s enforcement and detention services; the A.C.T. should have a direct say in the use of such services by the Commonwealth; the A.C.T. Supreme Court will, of course, also be a venue for civil actions under the proposed new national law. </PARA>
<PARA>* LOCAL LEGISLATIVE CERTAINTY: paragraph 23(1) (h) in the A.C.T. Self-Government legislation becomes redundant once the new Corporations Law is enacted, yet, unless paragraph 23(1) (h) is repealed or amended it will continue to prevent the A.C.T. from making necessary local laws which touch upon company matters (e.g. the recent example of the building society conversion); the A.C.T. laws in question will deal only with Territory matters and will not intrude into the national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The residents of the Australian Capital Territory, at present, have no say within their own jurisdiction as to the form and content of this important legislation. The law will be enacted by the Commonwealth in the Federal Parliament. Local Federal Members will have a vote, of course, but only in the context of a Commonwealth law. Unlike the residents of the States and the Northern Territory, A.C.T. residents have no voice through their local Minister. I submit that it is important that all Australians should have the same level of access irrespective of whether they can be excluded by the narrow application of a technicality of constitutional law. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, I ask you to give favourable and urgent consideration to the inclusion of the Australian Capital Territory in this important national scheme. A.C.T. residents are shareholders, investors and taxpayers as well as being, in some cases, active participants in the direction and management of companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate and indicated that the chamber will indeed support in principle the passage of this very significant legislation. What it does with its passage is bring back to this Parliament political responsibility for the shaping of the companies and securities law which will be in place to regulate those extremely important areas of our economy and of our social and national life Australia-wide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to say to Senator Campbell that I welcome the fact that he has said that he will take up the challenge of contributing to the formulation of legislation to do with companies and securities, as Senator Barney Cooney will, as Senator Spindler will, and as I know Senator Robert Hill will when his duties permit. This chamber, by virtue of what we will be doing over the next few hours and days, will take political responsibility for the formation and passage of this important legislation in a way which has not been true in the years of the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the fundamental flaw and democratic weakness of that scheme. Senator Spindler touched on it to some extent but not perhaps as extensively as he might have. He spoke of the difficulty of putting together and composing the legislation which was put out by the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities. That is one aspect of it, but the other aspect is that it was passed too easily. It was very difficult to put together but it was passed too easily because there was an automatic obligation on the various parliaments around Australia to actually pass that legislation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that because there was some misunderstanding. But before doing so let me say in relation to Senator Campbell's constructive contribution that he misunderstands some of the history of the financial support and allocation of resources to the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). That was the case when it came to the Commonwealth's participation in that scheme. I know Senator Hill would verify at Estimates committees that when the Ministerial Council made a commitment to provide further resources for the National Companies and Securities Commission, the Federal Government immediately appropriated the funds. But that was not always the case in the States. In fact, the States, as we know, used the companies area as something of a revenue raiser and siphoned off the moneys and put them into other areas of their administration through their Consolidated Revenue, rather than using the moneys generated in order to regulate that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When new fee structures were put forward by the Ministerial Council, once again the Federal Government did its part very speedily; I think one or two other States did but others did not. In so far as the NCSC lost support around Australian jurisdictions, the Federal Government could not be held responsible in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We are faced with a peculiar constitutional arrangement following the decision of the High Court of Australia by agreement between all governments and it has this particular impact, which I might just emphasise: that the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill converts the Corporations Act 1989 into a law under section 122 of the Constitution for the Government of the Australian Capital Territory to be known as the Corporations Law of the Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporations law will then be applied by State and Northern Territory application of laws Acts as the corporations laws of each of those jurisdictions. In this way a single national corporations law will be enacted throughout Australia. It is important because it helps answer one of the queries and misgivings that Senator Hill quite legitimately raised, which was this: what if State parliaments do not take up and immediately pass mirror legislation and one gets a discordance, fragmentation, lack of consistency, and lack of uniformity Australia-wide?</PARA>
<PARA> With an application of laws-type provision in all of the State and the Northern Territory parliaments, we will have a situation where, as this Parliament passes amendments to the corporations law, those amendments will be taken up automatically in the laws of the various jurisdictions concerned. In that way the corporations law will form a uniform text of the new national law applying in all jurisdictions. So what one has is an application of laws-type situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill also mentioned the question of the Ministerial Council and the role it will play. Once again, Senator Hill was somewhat worried whether that might lead to a situation where perhaps people had a veto, or some jurisdictions had a veto, which could be exercised in a disruptive and fragmenting way. Senator Hill will know that the Ministerial Council will have a consultative role in respect of all legislative proposals and a deliberative role in relation to the reform of what can be broadly described as company law matters. Takeovers, securities, public fundraising and futures will be pre-eminent matters for the Commonwealth, subject to the general consultative role of the Ministerial Council. </PARA>

The point I am trying to make is that we were in a situation, which the honourable senator would acknowledge because he was on the Senate committee that dealt with this particular problem, where there was a complete lack of political democratic responsibility for the shape of corporations and securities laws. There was no particular parliament that took ultimate responsibility. There was no ministerial line of responsibility which could lead to a particular elected representative of the people being held accountable. I think that that is extremely important.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The collective responsibility led to the difficulties in the composition of the legislation which have already been referred to and to the passage through the various parliaments, without proper scrutiny, of the amendments that were put forward from time to time. So that was not a satisfactory democratic situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also take up the point made by Senator Campbell about the way in which the Western Australian phenomenon has emerged in recent months and weeks and, of course, in a very acute form, in the last couple of days. I want to emphasise that in my answer today I was trying to say that, despite some rhetoric that accompanies statements emanating from Western Australia, which has that secessionist tinge and speaks of sovereignty in States' rights issues, I believe that the Liberal Party and the National Party in the upper House were motivated by a very real concern to look after the interests of the business community in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the pressure that came from Western Australia, not only from those interests but also from the Attorney-General, Mr Joe Berinson, led to the inclusion in the heads of agreement, which I tabled at Question Time, of clause 3 and the clauses following, which may be described and have been described in colloquial parlance as the Western Australian clauses. I am sorry that the honourable senator did not get a chance to read the document as fully as he might have because of his other senatorial duties. On page 2, under `ASC Regional Administration', clause 3.3 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The ASC will, through these regional offices and business centres, maintain a level of service not less than current levels of service provided by Corporate Affairs Commissions in each State. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable senator might say that that is rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3.4 goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The ASC will put in place performance indicators to ensure the maintenance of those levels of service and report twice yearly to each State Minister on the performance of the ASC in the State against those indicators. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3.5 says:</PARA>
<PARA>The ASC will also, to the fullest extent practicable and efficient, delegate the exercise of powers to Regional Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we know that there will be a role for the Regional Liaison Committee. I believe this Committee, as the honourable senator indicated, will have an extremely important role to play. I know that there is a willingness to try to make that system work. It depends on the appointment of a Regional Commissioner who, of course, will be the linchpin person, but there is no cap on the numbers of persons on the Regional Liaison Committee. It can comprise any number of people whose presence on such a liaison committee would be of assistance in ensuring that the interflow of information between the local business community and the ASC does take place. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Campbell" NAMEID="H15">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Campbell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tell me where the performance indicators are and where the delegated powers are. Where are the guarantees?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The guarantees are included in this heads of agreement. This is an agreement made under great pressure-I acknowledge it, and it is a fact-from the various Attorneys-General around the various jurisdictions of Australia. I believe that we can accept in relation to those particular undertakings which have been given and which form the political foundation for the legislation we are debating that those particular ingredients of clause 3 will be realised soon. I am very confident that, unless they do, this whole endeavour will collapse. I do not believe that that is at all a prospect. I believe that those particular performance indicators that the honourable senator speaks of are going to play a very important role, because not only will the business community be concerned to see that they are properly formulated and adhered to through their membership of the Regional Liaison Committee, but, of course, State Ministers have a right to go to the Ministerial Council and complain about the lack of measuring up to the performance indicators and require a response from the Commonwealth within one month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a most unusual situation, but there it is. It is put in, probably because of the suspicions which the honourable senator is voicing so eloquently on behalf of Western Australians. But it is in there and there is a requirement for a Federal Government response within one month. I believe that indicates that at the political level of State Ministers and at the liaison level, dealing with the business community, there is more than enough scope for the sorts of consultations which are important and which the honourable senator has indicated are going to be an absolutely vital key to the success of the ASC operation out of the eastern seaboard capitals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crichton-Browne. It certainly was in those three short years that my father was the manager. I believe that I have some understanding of the sort of sentiment which underlies the concerns which the honourable senator has expressed in moderate terms, but forcefully, during the course of the debate and at various Question Times over the last several days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Campbell raised one substantive matter. That was the question of the Act imposing the requirement for a prospectus to be required when a company is making a rights issue. It was said that this will cause difficulties for companies which have a rights issue on offer before 1 January which remains open after 1 January. I was exercised by this myself last night and so I sought some advice on it. It has been pointed out to me that the requirement that a prospectus be lodged or registered for a rights issue is not a new proposal. This amendment to the law was contained in the Corporations Act when first introduced in May 1988. The Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation reviewed, in particular, the fundraising provisions of the Act, but that in itself would not answer the honourable senator's particular problem. The next paragraph does. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Securities Commission has power under section 1084 of the corporations law to give an exemption from compliance with the prospectus provisions in an appropriate case. Whether such an exemption should be available in a particular case such as this is a matter obviously within the discretion of the Australian Securities Commission, but there is a capacity-not a formal grandfathering clause in a blanket sense of a categorisation of particular prospectuses lodged for a rights issue-within the Australian Securities Commission to deal with the matter which the honourable senator raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that honourable senators wish this debate to be brought to a speedy conclusion. I believe that I have covered most of the major matters of principle that have been raised. I have given an undertaking to Senator Reid that I will answer in the committee stage tomorrow some of the matters which she raised, apart from the general underlying policy issues, which of course have been determined in relation to the self-government of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) by higher authorities than myself or the Attorney. Those include the major political questions as to what power should be vested in the ACT Government. However, the more particular questions that the Attorney-General, Mr Bernard Collaery, has raised about revenue and so on can and will be answered in the Committee tomorrow night. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is a remarkable piece of legislation. It has a peculiar constitutional genesis which has led to some great innovation both in the way in which legislation can now be made, which has an Australia-wide effect, and, of course, in the various ways in which civil and criminal jurisdiction is vested in the State courts and the Federal Court and how the investigation, prosecution and sentencing of those who offend against the provisions of this law can be undertaken by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, I believe, a matter of some pride that the political representatives of the Australian people have been able to come to this particular arrangement. It has survived the scrutiny of the most learned counsel throughout Australia, including the very intense scrutiny of the various Solicitors-General at various times in the composition and drafting of this legislative scheme. I believe it forms a firm and secure foundation, since the High Court of Australia decision, for the sort of regulation of companies and securities which this country so desperately requires. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this legislation is required to restore confidence domestically within Australia as to the operations of the marketplace in relation to companies and securities matters. Our international reputation has also been gravely damaged. I believe that with the passage of this legislation-and I still hope for the accession to this particular national scheme by the Western Australian upper House-we will have Australia-wide such a legal and administrative structure in place that confidence, internationally as well as domestically, can be revived in a way which will allow our companies and securities markets to operate efficiently and fairly in the interests of the creation of wealth and the well-being of all the citizens and residents of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to discuss a matter raised in this place on 12 November by Senator McLean. I have advised Senator McLean that I would be doing so. The honourable senator has made no secret of the fact that he is pursuing a hit list of banks he accuses of malpractice and corrupt practice. He has promised to provide the national bank inquiry with what he calls a `wheelbarrow' of material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that I have listened to Senator McLean in adjournment speeches for quite some time now. I have been a little apprehensive about the names he has dropped under parliamentary privilege. In the adjournment speech to which I refer, he was not content to allow that inquiry to assess the matters brought to his attention, but he proceeded, I believe, to convene a kangaroo court to act as judge and jury to destroy the reputation of a particular banking official. I believe that Senator McLean acted solely in reliance on complaints made to him by certain individuals. I am informed that he made no attempt whatsoever to contact the person he planned to defame in order to investigate the truth of the allegations or to give that person an opportunity to present his side of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean launched into a sustained attack on the character of the former National Australia Bank manager in Toowoomba, a Mr Colin Cannon. I personally feel free to name Mr Cannon because his name has already been maligned through the media. Senator McLean did this by recklessly scattering allegations of malpractice and corrupt practice, fraud, conspiracy, deliberate deceit, greed and financial thuggery. His attacks, couched as they were in such extreme and uncompromising language, gained extensive coverage in the local newspaper and on Toowoomba television. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean may or may not be aware that there was a large feature article in the Toowoomba Chronicle headed `Senate told of bank's fraud, deceit and greed'. In fact, Senator McLean is quoted throughout that article. One can only speculate about how the local media obtained such complete details of the matters aired in the Senate. I would have to say that one would not expect the adjournment debates in the Senate to be closely monitored by the Toowoomba Chronicle. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that as a result of that adjournment speech Mr Cannon was featured with still pictures of himself in the lead story on Star Television news. Again, the same remarks were repeated in that lead story on the television station. When Senator McLean throws names around like this, I wonder whether he recognises the damage that can be done. Senators can imagine the grievous, possibly irreparable, damage done to a person's reputation by this type of publicity. The distress caused not to Mr Cannon in particular, but to his wife and children and the harm to his future career can scarcely be calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> People may ask, `How can we believe in this man's integrity when a member of the Senate would say such things about him in the Commonwealth Parliament?'. It is obvious that Senator McLean relied on the complaints of two individuals who claim to have suffered loss as a result of the bank's actions. This chamber is not in a position to adjudicate in commercial disputes. I shall not detain the Senate by recounting all the details of the dealings between the bank and the customer. They are well documented, and particularly well documented in the two court hearings that were held on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> However, although Senator McLean dismissed the fact that the complaints did not succeed as a technicality, it is a matter of record that his informants had failed twice in court action designed to establish their claim. Unlike him, I shall not embarrass these particular people-they have admittedly suffered financial loss for whatever reason-by naming them in the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two court cases. In the initial court case, judgment was handed down on 29 September 1988 and is available for public scrutiny. The appeal case before three judges of the Federal Court of Australia, held on 21 April 1989, also failed. It disturbs me that Senator McLean was willing to use this chamber under the protection of privilege to make allegations against an individual without apparently being in possession of all the facts in relation to the matter; indeed, without even giving the target of his attack an opportunity to state his side of the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Had Senator McLean made even a perfunctory effort to investigate the complaint brought to him, he may have discovered what the courts have said about the credibility of his informants-informants whose complaints the Senator seems to have accepted without question. Senator McLean chose to table 33 documents following his speech, but in this bulk of paper he neglected to include the two court judgments which record that many of the assertions and allegations he made were not accepted by the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to look at the relevant litigation, which alleged that Mr Cannon engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to certain property transactions. In the Federal Court the case turned upon the credibility of witnesses. It is significant to note that the trial judge, Mr Justice Neaves, made firm findings of credit and generally accepted Mr Cannon's evidence and did not accept the evidence of the complainants. Of one of the complainants, His Honour said that he `formed such an adverse view of her as a witness that I have completely disregarded what she said except where it is confirmed by other credible evidence'. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the judge chose to believe Mr Cannon's evidence that two crucial alleged meetings referred to by Senator McLean had not taken place as claimed by the complainant. His Honour found that, even assuming that alternate unsatisfactory evidence was reliable, it was insufficient to establish the allegations against Mr Cannon. On appeal the applicants tried to amend their claim, but permission was refused not only because it would have led to unfairness at that late stage but also because it would not have led to any different result. That is what was found by the three judges. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, to my deep regret, I can only conclude that Senator McLean has abused the privilege enjoyed by honourable senators-something that was alluded to last night by Senator Aulich and, in fact, I understand picked up by Senator McLean himself. In the process Senator McLean has undoubtedly damaged his own credibility, calling into question the reliability of all the other adjournment debate bank malpractice exposes to which he has treated us. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, as I mentioned, we were lectured by Senator Aulich on this matter. He advised us to recognise:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that parliamentary privilege exists for a very specific purpose; namely, as a protection for parliamentarians who must raise contentious issues that are demonstrably in the public interest. It exists for their protection against defamation and for no other purpose. If it is to be used for personal attacks on people, either through implication or innuendo, and if attacks without substance against individuals who are not in this chamber are to be the order of the day, then the question of parliamentary privilege will be queried all around this country.</PARA>
<PARA>It was rather a coincidence that the next speaker was Senator McLean, who announced that he intended yet again to use parliamentary privilege for another of his anti-bank crusades, although he acknowledged the extreme seriousness that is associated with the use of parliamentary privilege. I believe that Senator McLean's actions belie the fact that he has any notion about the seriousness of relying on parliamentary privilege to attack defenceless individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Cannon phoned me to discuss this matter he was in a state of great distress. Two court cases had been held on the matter and he had been found innocent in both. He said to me that he did not care much about himself, that he was happy to accept the cut and thrust of life, but that his wife and daughters were distraught. It had even got to the stage, for a man who had been married some 15 or 20 years, where his own wife was saying, `If you are innocent, how come you cannot protest your innocence against these claims made in the Federal Parliament?'. He phoned me and asked me what he could do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I went to some lengths to look into the matter before I got up in this place to debate it. I believe that a decent and responsible citizen has had his character damaged by reckless and unfounded statements made in this place. I think that if Senator McLean has any sense of honour and principle-and since coming into this place I have believed that he has had honour and principle-he should offer a full apology to the person he has wronged. He should also contact the newspapers and the media who quite improperly reported what he said in this place. It will not repair the damage he has done, but it may go some way to restoring the self-esteem of a decent man and his family. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been very selective in what I have put before the Senate. I have said that I have in excess of 400 cases. I have chosen to put some of those cases before the Senate. I made the judgment on the evidence that was brought to me by constituents, and I responded as a senator. I am now prepared, as I say, to live with the consequences of that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now proceed to the issue of what I consider to be bank malpractice and corrupt practices-but not this particular matter. Honourable senators will be relieved to hear that I will be brief. They will recall that during the adjournment debates of 13 and 14 September 1990, and then again last night, I disclosed what has been referred to as the Rigg case. I have demonstrated that in 1984 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia marketed a finance package to small business proprietors offering a bills discount facility with foreign currency loan options. I demonstrated that the bills drawn down by the bank were a sham, calculated to extract from the borrower-in this case the Riggs-the interest that would otherwise be paid to an independent dealer on the open money market, together with the bank's usual fees and margins, together with compounded overdraft interest thereon, in addition to foreign exchange losses incurred by the borrower pursuant to a contractual pretence. </PARA>
<PARA> The finance package was offered to Mr and Mrs Rigg and their company, Tony Rigg Welding and Manufacturing Pty Ltd. The bank provided to the Riggs the bill discount facility and the Riggs business was crippled. Such a finance package was also offered to Mr and Mrs Rahme-whose case I will now briefly describe-and their company, David Securities Pty Ltd. The bank provided the Rahmes with the foreign currency loan, as a result of which the Rahmes business was crippled. </PARA>
<PARA> I am citing only two cases-and I will place them before the bank inquiry-out of what is estimated to have been 1,400 such cases in Australia at that time. It is this process about which Dr Henry Stalder a few weeks ago made a quite unsolicited comment when I was sitting with Swiss bankers in Zurich. He said-and I paraphrase it-that the senior bank officers who manipulated Australian business people and farmers into Swiss foreign bank loans between 1984 and 1986 are little more than criminals and should be in gaol. He said that he would come to Australia to testify to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> By a loan agreement dated 17 December 1984-and at the end of my speech I will seek leave to table the document supporting what I am saying here tonight-David Securities, as the borrower, entered into a purported foreign currency loan with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia of Suite 2204, 50 Raffles Place, Singapore, as the bank. I contend that the agreement was a sham-a contractual pretence entered into by the bank to induce the borrower to accept a foreign exchange risk that did not exist. In other words, the system that the bank was using was to extract profit at the expense of customers under this particular mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend that if the loan had been a genuine foreign currency loan the bank would have complied with the laws of Singapore and Australia and would religiously have observed and performed the terms of agreement to ensure its enforceability against the borrower. The bank did not do that. By entering into an agreement the bank traded out of a permanent establishment in Singapore. That would have required the bank to be registered in Singapore as a corporation. It appears from the face of the agreement that the bank was not registered in Singapore as a corporation. Further the bank would have been obliged to hold a banker's licence and to lodge a tax return disclosing interest and foreign exchange profits paid by the borrower. I am aware that the Singaporean Government is undertaking an investigation into the activities of the bank in Singapore and may shortly call evidence from representatives of the borrower. I will endeavour to keep the Senate informed of these developments. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 (a) of the agreement requires the borrower to give written notice to the bank-that is, in Singapore-requesting draw-downs. The bank did not seek or receive any such notices. Clause 5 (a) (i) requires the bank to give notice to the borrower in Singapore of any agreements to make an advance in Swiss francs. No such notices were ever given. Clause 2 requires the bank to make available all advances in Singapore. No advances were made available in Singapore. The advances were made available by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. I cite a letter from Mr K. T. Robinson to the borrower, dated 7 January 1985, and I will seek leave to table that at the end of my statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 (d) of the agreement requires the borrower to give written notice to the bank in Singapore requesting renewals of roll-overs of the loan. The bank did not seek or receive any such notices. The roll-over notices from the borrower were addressed to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dee Why. I cite as an example a notice received on 21 June 1985, which was accepted by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dee Why. I cite also a letter from Mr G. R. Porter to the borrower, dated 2 October 1985. Moreover the bank did not seek or receive any applications from the borrower for extensions to the loan. The applications for renewal from the borrower were addressed to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dee Why. I refer to an application dated 18 December 1986, which was accepted by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dee Why, and a further undated letter on the same subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 (a) (i) of the agreement in conjunction with a letter from Mr Robinson required interest payments in Swiss francs to be paid to the bank in Singapore. The borrower did not make any such payments to the bank at all, nor did the bank request or demand any such payments. In fact, payments of interest and withholding tax were remitted by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dee Why, to the CBA, Sydney. I cite the memorandum from Mr Robinson to the Dee Why branch, dated 28 June 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 (a) (i) further provides that payments by the borrower in United States dollars were to be paid to an account designated by the bank in New York City. After the loan was changed from Swiss francs to United States dollars, the bank did not designate a New York account. The borrower did not make any payments to the bank in New York at all, nor did the bank request or demand any such payments. In fact, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sydney, purported to place the loan in default, to remain designated in United States dollars, but did not even mention the New York requirement. I cite a letter from Mr G. Pearce to the borrower dated 29 October 1987. Moreover the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, issued a cross-claim against the borrower and against Mr and Mrs Rahme as guarantors-and I will table that cross-claim-in its own name and on its own behalf, not claiming the United States dollars as payable to the Singapore branch nor to a New York City branch. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 (b) of the agreement provides that the borrower shall pay all interest payments to the bank in Singapore without deduction of any tax. This means that the borrower is obliged to pay withholding tax on the interest payments to the Australian Taxation Office. We know that funds representing withholding tax were remitted from the Commonwealth Bank, Dee Why, to the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney. I will table evidence of that. Honourable senators will also know that several hundred million dollars collected by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and other major banks as withholding tax were not paid to the Australian Taxation Office and were not refunded to the borrowers. That is what happened in this case and the borrower is taking the issue to the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sydney, not pay the withholding tax on behalf of the borrower to the Australian Taxation Office? If the foreign currency loan was legitimate and interest payments were made by the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, on behalf of the borrower to the bank in Singapore, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sydney, was obliged by law to pay the withholding tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Failure to do so would be a fraud against the Australian Government. If the foreign currency loan was a sham, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sydney, was not obliged by law to pay the withholding tax to the Australian Taxation Office. If that be the case, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sydney, has defrauded the borrower in respect of charging foreign exchange `losses' to the borrower and misappropriating the withholding tax. I believe the Commonwealth Bank of Australia should not be allowed to get away with such delinquent and illegal conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of whether the foreign currency loan in this case was legitimate can only be resolved by establishing whether there was a nexus between the Swiss francs remitted by the bank in Singapore to the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney and the Australian dollar equivalent credited to the account of the borrower or its nominee. That can only be done by undertaking an audit trail of the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue I have raised here is a matter of national importance and could lay bare the greatest banking scandal in Australia's history. In my view this issue comes within paragraph (d) (i), `Product innovation', of the terms of reference of the inquiry to be conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I propose to make a submission to that Committee relating to this specific case in conjunction with the Rigg matter and call for the audit to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank is proceeding against David Securities Pty Ltd and Mr and Mrs Rahme by way of notices pursuant to section 57 (2) (b) of the New South Wales Real Property Act. I will table those notices. I believe I have produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the loan agreement is a sham. It means that the loan agreement is probably unenforceable and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sydney, never had standing to sue on it. I call upon the directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to withhold any action on the notices until the issues I have raised are resolved by the parliamentary inquiry. I seek leave to table the documents to which I have referred in my speech. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr President. I shall do that. Last night Senator Aulich spoke very well in principle on the subject of maligning people but he had no sooner finished than Senator McLean, after acknowledging Senator Aulich was right and saying how proper his speech was, proceeded to malign someone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would hope that Senator Aulich, in fairness, would get up tonight and make the same speech that he gave last night about Senator McLean. One wonders if there is something going on between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party whereby they do not accuse and chastise each other. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight's exhibition by Senator McLean has been absolutely disgraceful. Senator Parer has quite rightly pointed out how this person was maligned and defamed and the enormous problems, hurt and trauma that this has caused him and his family. He described this very clearly, rationally and calmly, and I congratulate him for bringing this matter to the Senate. He very calmly suggested that Senator McLean might do the decent thing, acknowledge that what he said was wrong, apologise, and undertake to contact all those press outlets that he apparently ran to so quickly with his release last time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer suggested that Senator McLean might have the decency to issue press releases to try in some way to repair the damage he has done. What did Senator McLean do? He did absolutely nothing except acknowledge that he knew the court cases that Senator Parer referred to but did not bother to tell us. He has the indecency now not even to acknowledge it. It is an absolutely disgraceful act, one that I think should be referred to some sort of privileges committee of the Parliament, or whatever else. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean has been tabling a lot of documents. We usually give him permission to do so, but we wonder whether we should do that in the future when it seems that Senator McLean only tables documents that suit his cause and enable him to defame people. Any documents, such as the judgment which Senator Parer referred to, that show that what Senator McLean is talking about is nonsense, do not seem to be tabled. Maybe we and the Government should very seriously consider whether we will allow the tabling of these wheelbarrow loads of documents to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first came to the Senate, I wondered what Senator McLean was on about. I spoke to one of my more senior colleagues who, in fact, that night, warned Senator McLean, because he had not shown us the documents to be tabled beforehand, that he should not set himself up as judge, jury, prosecutor and executioner. Senator McLean now very blandly says that he will wear whatever odium comes to him, but he still continues to be prosecutor, judge and executioner. I think this is a disgraceful misuse of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator McLean has any understanding of the issues of British justice, he will realise that he cannot go around accusing people, being judge and jury, and determining the issue after hearing only one side of any argument. He should have been around for long enough to know that whenever there is one side of an argument, there is always another side. That is what is so unfortunate in what Senator McLean has done. </PARA>
<PARA> Such cases all sound terrible. If there have been malpractices, the courts of the land are there to deal with them. In fact, in the case that Senator Parer mentioned, the courts of the land did deal with them and came to an entirely different conclusion, in the proper legal way of British justice, which seems to refute, in just one instance that we know of, the sort of evidence that Senator McLean has allegedly been bringing before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it is very late, but I was moved to raise that point. Having heard Senator Aulich last night, I was astounded that Senator McLean got up and did exactly the same thing. Tonight the mischief that has been caused has been shown very clearly by Senator Parer, yet Senator McLean does not even have the decency to apologise publicly to that man and to undertake certain actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator McLean now if he has the decency to apologise to that man and to issue, in an apologetic form, the sort of wide ranging press releases that he issued in accusing him. I think that would not cause too much hurt, but it would go some way towards re-establishing the dignity of this place and of members of parliament generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to keep the Senate for more than a couple of minutes. I believe that what has been occurring over the last few weeks in this Senate degrades the Senate by abusing the privilege that honourable senators have in this place. Senator McLean has given the Senate hearsay evidence of what has occurred-in his belief or his informant's belief-in a small country town, without giving the person he is accusing any opportunity of response. Indeed, even when a court case has been held and the court has decided on the person's innocence, we have not been told that the court case was even held. We were told only one side-the hearsay evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Evidently, Senator McLean finds it very easy to stand up here and say that he is well aware of what he is doing and that he is willing to wear it. I wonder whether he really understands that he is not the only one having to wear what he has been saying in this place. Mr Cannon and his family also have to wear what he has been saying in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Has he any idea of what living in a small town is like? I do. I used to live in a small town. I can assure Senator McLean that he cannot undo the damage he has done to this gentleman because a small town does not work that way. Even if he stood here and apologised in the Senate, he may do some good but he will never remove the mud that he has thrown. I think that anyone who comes into this place besmirching a man's reputation without ever approaching that man and asking for his point of view on the hearsay evidence lacks all credibility. Anyone who has any responsibility at all should not do this. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to join with my colleagues in asking Senator McLean whether he would be willing to apologise. He should forget about what he is thinking. He must know that what he has brought into this place is just hearsay evidence. He should at least follow up what he has told the Toowoomba Chronicle, make sure that that is corrected and, at least in that sense, respond to Mr Cannon in this instance. </PARA>

It is certainly a view that Mr Hawke has put forward and a view that Dr Hewson has put forward. It is certainly a view that Senator Powell and her colleagues put from time to time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly. I have always held Senator McLean in high regard in my short time here. The allegations that have been made tonight are essentially that Senator McLean has made comments upon a person's character based upon documents that were tabled selectively. Parliamentary privilege exists so that parliamentarians can make allegations in the public good. Sometimes that entails making an allegation which is mistaken; that is, an allegation which is made in good faith but is based upon a mistake. That is why we have parliamentary privilege. I think there is a difference between an allegation based on a mistake and an allegation based on the selectivity of documents that have been tabled. I do not intend to act as a judge, a prosecutor or a jury in the case of Senator McLean; I just raise this as a distinction between the two bases upon which this sort of allegation can be raised. If it is the case that Senator McLean has based an allegation upon selectively tabled documents, I will be very disturbed. I hope that my faith in Senator McLean has not been misplaced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there is also a distinction to be made when one queries a court case because we are here as crusaders, I believe, for the public good. Sometimes that means that we in this Senate must question things and fight for causes. But we always have to be very careful when we start to query the results of court cases because I believe there is another distinction that must be made as well-that is, to distinguish between alleging guilt or innocence after a case has been heard by a court. I believe that it is fair and permissible for a member of the Senate to allege that a court may have found wrongly and that a man or a woman was in fact innocent when he or she was found guilty. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do not believe it is appropriate for any member of parliament to raise a question of somebody's guilt, of somebody's negligence or of malfeasance after a court has acquitted him of that charge. That is not our role and that is not what parliamentary privilege should be used for. I only cite the oft repeated phrase of Blackstone who said that it is better that 10 guilty men go free than that one innocent man be condemned. I think this is something that we must always bear in mind when we use our privilege in this case and question court cases. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I do not intend to condemn Senator McLean. I have always held him in the highest regard. I would only suggest that in the cold light of day tomorrow, perhaps when Senator McLean has had the opportunity to review the matter and when he is perhaps feeling less personally involved, as a result of some of the statements that have been made by honourable senators this evening, he may wish to change the comments he has made. He may wish to make another statement. If Senator McLean were to do that, I would welcome that statement wholeheartedly. It would restore my faith in him and I think it would do much to restore my faith in the manner in which we in this Senate use our parliamentary privilege. </PARA>

It is one of the rare occasions that my demeanour is an advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak very briefly on this matter. Senator McLean sought from this chamber, not that long ago, leave to make some brief remarks and he did so on the basis that he wanted to make a response. I think the fair understanding from that was that he was going to respond to the substantive remarks that had been made. Instead, what we were subjected to was a short lecture of vitriol. It was probably some insight into Senator McLean when he is near the end of his tether. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this chamber were not treated to any response to the remarks made by Senator Parer at all-the basis, of course, on which the leave was given. What we were treated to, if one can summarise it and paraphrase it, was Senator McLean saying to this chamber, `Don't you challenge me to answer to you here in this chamber for what I have said; don't you challenge me here to answer for the omissions I have made. But you do what I want you to do. You have this particular Senate inquiry that I want you to have, and then you can have your chance at me.'-I notice that Senator Bell has come in to support Senator McLean and, heaven knows, he needs a bit of support on this matter- `You do what I want to do and have this Senate inquiry, and through that you'll be able to show whether I'm right or wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that Senator McLean has made certain remarks, certain omissions, and Senator Parer has come in and put some further light on the story. Some people are, I think, entitled to draw the conclusion that the truth has been told by Senator McLean, but not the whole truth. Of course the reason one says, `Tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth' is that, if one does not tell the truth and the whole truth, one can mislead. So leave was granted to Senator McLean to clear this matter up, to tell us where Senator Parer was wrong. Leave was granted for that to be done and it was not done. In fact, there was pretty much silence as to the matters that Senator Parer had raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, the Australian Democrats are going to come here into this chamber tomorrow on a completely different matter and they are going to argue that silence is acquiescence, it is consent and it is agreement. They are going to say in relation to another matter altogether that if one does not open one's mouth and point out where someone else is wrong, one is agreeing with him. That is the line that we are going to hear trotted out tomorrow in relation to a piece of retrospective legislation. So I wonder why they are not doing it tonight. Can we assume from Senator McLean's silence with respect to the allegations made by Senator Parer that he acquiesces to them? Can we assume by his huffing and puffing and simply bypassing what Senator Parer has raised that he does in fact agree?</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude at this point, Mr President, simply by saying that I think it is very regrettable where a senator comes in and does what Senator McLean has done, is challenged by another with an alternative or an additional set of facts, seeks leave to make a response to that and does not take up that opportunity. Senator Kemp invited Senator McLean to do the right and decent thing and to apologise. He has failed to do it. I think that is regrettable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, far be it from anyone on the Government side to seek to intervene in a war of destructive rhetoric between the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, but there are some serious issues that have been raised tonight. It is always a serious matter when someone under cover of privilege raises allegations about guilt or innocence of offences or impropriety of a high order. I do not believe there is anything prima facie wrong about doing so, provided the person makes those allegations or suggestions in good faith and backs them up with something in the nature of substantial or at least prima facie evidence. Without wishing to go into the canvassing of the merits of the situation, I think that point ought to be acknowledged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Equally, anyone bringing forward matters of this kind in the Senate has to be conscious, as a number of honourable senators have said, of the very great potential damage that allegations of that kind can do to people's reputations, and it is for that reason that the conventions and the procedures of this place are couched in such a way as to ensure, hopefully, that allegations are not made under cover of privilege, unless there is a strong basis or believed basis for doing so-and I think that is the way we ought to look at it. I just cannot forbear from one further comment--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to be more than hearsay evidence when a court case has been held.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comment I am obliged to make in these circumstances is that, for all the enthusiasm we have heard on the Opposition side tonight about accepting due process in the courts, I cannot help but recall innumerable cases in the past, and some running presently, when there has been an utter unwillingness on the part of the Opposition as a whole or particular Opposition senators to accept the principle of innocence until guilt or impropriety is established by court or by royal commission, as the case may be, and all sorts of allegations are constantly being made against carefully targeted people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite do not need me to remind them now at this hour of some of the occasions in the past when witch-hunts of this kind have been maintained. They do not need me to remind them of one of the witch-hunts that is presently being set in train by some of their number at the moment in relation to matters presently or potentially the subject of royal commissions or conceivably, ultimately, court hearings. The principle of innocence being presumed until guilt is established is not one that has been honoured in the observance, for all the unctuous lakes of crocodile tears that we see on so many occasions and that we have seen again being filled up tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> So, having said that, Mr President, I think it should be acknowledged nonetheless-I repeat again-that there are important issues involved whenever serious allegations are raised under cover of privilege. It is not competent for this chamber tonight to evaluate the merits of these allegations. It is not competent for me to make any judgment about the good faith or otherwise with which those allegations have been made or answered. I just make the point on behalf of the Government, which is a not very interested spectator of this particular combat at the moment, that it is incumbent on both sides to this debate to think very carefully before embarking further on a course which may be damaging to the reputations either way of particular individuals-and I hope we can leave the debate there for tonight, although no doubt that is not the last we are going to hear of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with a great deal of patience and tolerance to this debate from its inception. I would not have spoken but for the outrageous behaviour of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). To classify what has gone on tonight as some sort of squabble between the Australian Democrats and the Opposition is to either have a total lack of understanding of what the debate was about or to be utterly, completely and totally irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fundamental issue that those on this side of the chamber have been seeking to establish and defend is the fact that the Parliament has a reputation as an institution. It is the institution of the Parliament that is under assault when these sorts of attacks are made on innocent, or presumably innocent, individuals in the community who have no recourse to defend themselves. It is quite different when leading political figures in the country are under attack. They are fair game. All of us in this chamber are fair game for criticism and for attack, to have our motives assailed and debased and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA> What my colleagues have been doing tonight is defending the institution of the Parliament. I understand from what the Minister has said that he does not have the first comprehension of what a parliament is about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) According to provisional data reported to the Department by international airlines flying to and from Adelaide, 168,259 passengers arrived and departed Adelaide international airport in the 12 months ending June 1990. This data excludes transit passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) From the same source of data, 138,433 passengers arrived and departed Adelaide international airport in the 12 months ending June 1989. This data excludes transit passengers. The number of passengers for the 12 months ending June 1990 represents an increase of approximately 21.6 per cent compared with the number of passengers for the 12 months ending June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Department is unable to readily provide data on the major country of origin of passengers by arrival on international flights. However, using data by total movement (ie arrivals and departures), the major country of origin of passengers on flights to and from Adelaide for the 12 months ending June 1990 was the United Kingdom (representing approximately 33.3 per cent of visitor arrivals and departures).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Provisional data reported to the Department by international airlines flying to and from Adelaide shows that there were 5,077 passengers travelling non-stop from Adelaide to New Zealand in the 12 months ending June 1990, with 4,608 passengers travelling non-stop from New Zealand to Adelaide during the same period. These numbers actually represent passengers carried from December 1989 to June 1990 as there were no non-stop flights between Adelaide and New Zealand (and vice versa) for the period July to November 1989.</PARA>
