<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990 has four purposes. First of all, its essential purpose is to put in place arrangements for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1990-91, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference in June. Secondly, the Bill effectively determines the payments to be made to local governments for general purposes under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act. Thirdly, the Bill makes provision for machinery adjustments for the transfer of the debits tax to the States. Finally, the Bill makes provision for recoupment of State contributions for higher education superannuation and recoupment of moneys where there is a breach of higher education funding conditions as outlined in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which has not been debated in the Senate, although it has gone through the House of Representatives. It will come here later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, let me say that the coalition has no problems with the first of these purposes, namely, to put in place the machinery arrangements for the provision of general purposes assistance to the States and the Northern Territory as agreed at the Premiers Conference. It is clear that at the Premiers Conference the Commonwealth should have been tougher on the States in terms of the total arrangements negotiated, taking into account all the payments that go to the States, but the Commonwealth itself has proven to be even more lax in terms of its own purpose outlays than was apparent at the time of the conference. It would be unjust to inflict an even heavier burden on the States when the Commonwealth itself is unprepared to take the necessary fiscal measures to put those measures in line with the needs of this economy, an economy which is, as we all know now-and even the Government has at last admitted it-heavily recessed as a result of Government policies: a recession engineered quite deliberately by the Government at great cost and hardship to every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth spending in real terms has increased dramatically since this Government came to office. I will come back to that in a moment. There certainly has been no equity between the Commonwealth and the States so far as restraint is concerned. I have circulated and now move on behalf of the Opposition a second reading amendment in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that while some States have not done enough to use efficiently and effectively their own-source revenues, they have nevertheless borne the brunt of the Commonwealth Government's fiscal restraint and condemns the Commonwealth Government for its inability to make appropriate reductions in its own-purpose spending; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Commonwealth Government for strengthening its dominance over the States by providing an increasing proportion of its payments in tied form.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I move that amendment because, as I have said, the amount of restraint that has been exercised by the Commonwealth in terms of its own spending over the period of this Government has been minimal. One of the great cons, I believe, of the politics of the last eight years is the impression that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Government seem to have been able to get across in the community that this Government has been a government of fiscal restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing could be further from the truth. Commonwealth spending in real terms since this Government came to power has increased by 32.4 per cent, while State expenditures over the same period have increased by only 10.2 per cent. At the same time, State revenues have increased by 23.8 per cent but Commonwealth revenues in real terms have increased by 38.6 per cent, almost 50 per cent more. On top of that, Commonwealth payments to the States have declined by 5.3 per cent in real terms over that period. For 1990-91, the year which is the focus of attention for this Bill, the States as a whole have budgeted to hold expenditure more tightly than the Commonwealth. They have not budgeted to hold it as tightly as they should, but they have nevertheless budgeted to hold it more tightly than the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> States' expenditure this year is to increase by 6.1 per cent compared with growth in the Federal Government's own purpose outlays this year-money being spent on its own programs-of a quite profligate and excessive 11.9 per cent. So much for the Government's boasting or claims of fiscal restraint. It is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's spending on its own purpose programs this year is going to go up by 12 per cent-11.9 per cent-at a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer are telling all Australians that they have to pull their belts in and lower their standards of living because of the policies of this Government. While that is happening, the Government is going on its profligate and excessive way, spending very large increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures reveal an excessive aggregate increase in public sector outlays in 1990-91 which is quite inconsistent with the need for overall fiscal restraint. The Commonwealth has to bear much of the blame for this as it has again been unprepared to shoulder its own fair share of the fiscal burden. The Commonwealth should have been prepared at least to be as tough on itself as it has been on the States. The figures that I have just quoted blow quite out of the water the Treasurer's contention that it is the States that are the financial vandals, to use a term coined by the Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss. Far from that being the truth, the real economic vandal on the Australian scene is the Commonwealth Government with, of course, its Labor State counterparts, particularly in Victoria and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is all the more true since the release of the latest financial transactions statement by the Government which provides quite clear evidence of a Commonwealth Budget blow-out. It is also clear that the processes involved at the Premiers Conference negotiations are quite inappropriate in terms of the requirements that we have for a sophisticated approach to financial management and fiscal policy in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said last month by Western Australian Labor Premier Lawrence-and I would agree with this statement; it is one of the few statements of Premier Lawrence's that I would agree with-of the Premiers Conference:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite its increasing significance, we still have this extraordinary ritual whereby the Commonwealth's offer to the States is placed under Premiers' doors before breakfast on the day of the conference, leaving no time for meaningful discussion and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is actually what happens. Two hours before the Premiers Conference starts, the Commonwealth slips under the doors of Premiers' bedrooms in Canberra the actual offer documents that are to be negotiated and which involve taxpayers' money to the tune of up to $25 billion. That is the way in which financial negotiations have been going on in this country. It is an appalling state of affairs. I am glad to say that steps appear to be in the process of being taken to have the conduct of future Premiers Conferences and Loan Council meetings changed. Such reforms have been long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the recent Special Premiers Conference, the offer document from the Commonwealth to the States will in future be available to the States and the Territories two days prior to the conference. There will be more meaningful consultation involving all the parties before the document is produced in the first place. Whether that is a sufficient response to the serious situation that has prevailed for many years is something that we will have to look at and judge. But at least it is a step in the right direction and it is welcomed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of general purpose payments to be paid under the Bill that we are now debating is currently estimated to be $13,508m. That is about 15 per cent of Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1990-91. The payments are of this large magnitude because of the degree-to use the jargon of today-of vertical fiscal imbalance in Australia which arises out of the imbalance between the financial resources available to each tier of government and the expenditure responsibilities they are expected to meet. Currently, the Federal Government collects around 80 per cent of total taxation revenue in Australia, whilst being directly responsible for around only 50 per cent of total general government expenditures. A paper recently released by the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) states that the financial arrangements have been the major obstacle to rationalising intergovernmental duplication. The EPAC paper has expressed particular concern about the Commonwealth's dominance of the taxation arena and the increasing emphasis on conditional or tied funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that the system that we have is fraught with problems. The current arrangements for Commonwealth-State financial arrangements have developed in an ad hoc fashion since Federation as circumstances have dictated. Successive piecemeal changes have been made without due regard to the overall impact on the entire system of financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Special Premiers Conference that was held recently was essentially prompted by the calls of the coalition earlier this year for a fundamental revamp, reshape and relook at the whole area of Commonwealth-State relations. I am pleased to say that the Government responded to those calls of Dr Hewson and the coalition. As a result of that we have had one Special Premiers Conference and that has given some hope that the system of financial relations arrangements will be fully reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the terms of reference for the working group set up at that first conference that has been given the task of reviewing the distribution of Commonwealth and State taxing powers, appears to be more restrictive than we would have wished it to be. Of course, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. We will have to wait and see whether that working group is prepared to take on more than a Clayton's review of this central issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the Commonwealth must be in a position to pursue an overall effective fiscal policy. But the undeniable fact of the matter, as I have said, is that the Commonwealth in recent years has passed on to the States much of the burden of fiscal restraint. A profligate State can do damage to macro-economic management, just as can a profligate central government. While that is the case, concentrating the taxing powers in the hands of one government-the Commonwealth-means, of course, technically and theoretically, that much greater havoc can be caused by a single player in the game than if the revenue raising and expenditure burden were more equally distributed. One only has to look at the profligacy of the Whitlam Government and this Government in several of its Budgets in the 1980s to see the damage that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The payments in this Bill are lower than would otherwise have been the case because of the growth this year in the proportion of tied payments made to the States. The Bill we are debating today relates only to general purpose payments to the States-that is, payments that are made without strings attached to them. The figures, therefore, for these general purpose payments are lower than would otherwise have been the case because this year there has been a very significant increase in the proportion of funds that are paid to the States on conditional terms-in other words, tied payments. That is a matter of very considerable concern to the coalition and to the States. It is one of the great issues that will require review in the revamping and reforming of Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1982-83, when this Government came to power, specific purpose payments-that is, tied payments-have increased from 36 per cent of total Commonwealth payments to the States to an estimated 50 per cent in 1990-91. This has meant less freedom for the States to determine their own expenditure priorities. It has also meant more Canberra bureaucrats determining the priorities of State and Territory governments with more red tape inhibiting rational policy options. Again, in looking at this issue some progress seems to have been made. It was agreed at the recent Premiers Conference that the inefficiencies caused by the escalation in the proportion of tied grants being paid to the States should be reviewed. It is essential that something meaningful comes out of that review. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the next purpose of this Bill is to make provisions for payments to local government from the Commonwealth. The coalition has no difficulty with that proposition. Again, it is of a traditional machinery nature and I will not pursue it any further. Nor do we have any difficulties with that part of the Bill which makes a machinery provision for transfer of the debits tax to the States. The Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990 is to be debated later today and I will leave my comments on this aspect until the Senate considers that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The final purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill relates to the conditions which the States must meet in order to receive their full entitlements under this Bill. This is a matter of great concern to the coalition. I refer in particular to clause 12, which aims to allow the recoupment of any payments due to the Commonwealth as a result of States breaching conditions to be instituted under the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990, which is yet to be debated in this place. This Bill effectively requires the States to continue to comply with compulsory student unionism and, if they do not, to pay the Commonwealth, either directly or through reductions in general revenue payments under the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, any costs arising from non-compliance under the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> That proposition is quite repugnant to the coalition. We will move an amendment in committee, which I have circulated, to delete clause 12 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. I will speak more about it in committee and will explain the total opposition we have in principle to the concept contained in clause 12. Setting aside for the moment the principle involved in the question of student unionism, and whether it should be compulsory or not, there are other things that have to be said about having clause 12 as part of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the clause should not be part of a general purposes payments Bill. This Bill is supposed to deal essentially with matters that were agreed to at the Premiers Conference. The question of penalising States depending on their view on student unionism was not a matter agreed to at the Premiers Conference. It had nothing to do with the Premiers Conference and was not raised at the Premiers Conference. To have this clause tagged into this Bill is nothing more than a blatant attempt to blackmail the States to go along with the enforcement of compulsory student unionism. It is indicative of the paternalism that has come to characterise so much of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, which is not conducive to an atmosphere of co- operation required if the current review of Commonwealth-State relations is even to start being successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's action in tagging this matter onto this particular Bill is a quite blatant misuse of legislative procedures for political ends. The Government was hoping somehow to sneak this clause through by putting it in a piece of legislation to which it clearly should not relate. If this clause is agreed to, then it will set very dangerous precedents indeed for the whole future legislative process in this nation because it will mean that governments of the day will attempt to get through pieces of legislation in particular areas which do not necessarily have anything to do with the prime purpose of the Bill at hand. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter widely, including with the Australian Democrats. I hope the Democrats will treat this matter as seriously as the Opposition does because if clause 12 is allowed to proceed and to continue in this Bill, then the precedents for the future are very dangerous indeed. It is ironic that, as a result of clause 12, these so-called general purpose funds are now being tied. We have seen the thin edge of the wedge here with recoupment for higher education superannuation and some other one-off recoupment clauses being used in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it seems that tagging on special conditions to this Bill is becoming more of a first rather than a last resort option for the Commonwealth to recoup moneys it considers itself to be entitled to. It is a further abuse of the financial dominance that the Commonwealth has sought progressively over the years. The Hawke Government has elevated it to an art form to produce this dominance over the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also not given due regard to the extent to which such conditions complicate the already extremely complex calculation of payments to the States. It will be another blow to transparency in payments to the States; it will make accountability that much more difficult; and it will make the whole process of Commonwealth-State financial relations that much more complicated, complex and difficult and, therefore, unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will be opposing clause 12 on the grounds of principle in relation to an Act which is supposed to deal with general purpose or untied funds, and also because of the abhorrent nature of the conditions which the Government is attempting to force on the States. I will speak more on that matter in committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports this Bill with the exception of that provision contained in clause 12. We feel so strongly about clause 12 that if it remains not only will we be opposing it in committee but also we shall vote against the Bill at the third reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is discussing the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990. The payment of general revenue assistance in 1990-91 represents a cut of some $400m from the Forward Estimates. This represents a 3.7 per cent reduction and thus continues a trend of annual cuts in general revenue assistance to the States since 1987-88. Much of the so-called savings announced by the Commonwealth in its various economic statements have consisted of cuts to general purpose payments to the States over this period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has occurred in earlier years, additional funding has been provided to the Northern Territory to assist with its budgetary situation. This funding, however, has come from the overall pool of funds, which represents a contribution by the other States to the Northern Territory. Thus it is a reflection of the closed system of funding which has operated since the early 1980s rather than the open-ended system which operated up to the 1980s whereby the provision of additional assistance required an additional input of funds from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> At the 1990 Premiers Conference the Commonwealth gave a qualified guarantee to keep State general revenue assistance constant in real terms from 1991-92 to 1993-94, the qualification being that this would only apply if there were no major deterioration in Australia's economic circumstances. Thus, we must now put a substantial question mark over that commitment, with the attendant uncertainty for State budgetary considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be noted that the last time such a guarantee was given was in 1985-86, when the Commonwealth pledged that in 1986-87 and 1987-88 general revenue funding would be increased by 2 per cent in real terms. That guarantee was kept for 1986-87, although substantial cuts were made to general purpose capital funding, while the Government reneged on the promise for 1987-88, claiming that the need for economic stringency would not permit the guarantee to be met. It seems to us that we are in danger of moving into a similar situation where States once again will be starved of necessary funds. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1987-88 until the present, funding has been given on a purely annual basis, with no indication of future funding arrangements. Obviously, this has presented many problems to the States in terms of forward planning. The present approach of the Commonwealth Grants Commission will be to base its relativities recommendations on a review of the last five years financial results of the States rather than the previous three years. While this approach will smooth the changes in relativities, it means that relativities will now be based in part on State Budget results which are quite old and may not bear much resemblance to current budgetary conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has just completed a report on fiscal equalisation, and this will form the basis of discussion on Grants Commission methodology in the run-up to the next major review of relativities, which will occur in 1993. Of course, in the meantime, the process of annual updates will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has continued the process of requiring its authorities to pay taxes, fees and charges to the States and local government. This has already been done to a great extent, but provision has been made this year for motor vehicle taxes of Telecom Australia and Australia Post to be paid to the States. As in previous years, the Commonwealth is clawing back some 90 per cent of such taxes by reducing grants to the States, and this year the recoupment has taken the form of reduction in capital grants. While this process places authorities on a more similar basis to private enterprises, it nevertheless has had the effect over recent years of enabling the Commonwealth to shift outlays off budget. Thus, to a large extent, a feature of the Government's deregulation program is to give up an ever greater slice of responsibility and control over our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, State general purpose assistance has been cut on an annual basis over the past few years. Some States have argued that this has made it difficult for them to undertake the types of outlays-such as expenditure on infrastructure, redundancy payments, et cetera-required to achieve the sort of micro-economic reform which the Commonwealth would like to see achieved. Some States have had to increase taxes and charges, with consequent impact on inflation, while other States have borrowed funds to fund general Government outlays of a non self-financing nature. As we all know, this has placed the finances of a couple of States into difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, the Commonwealth has again begun to place specific conditions on the provision of general purpose assistance to the States. For example, Queensland was threatened with reduced funding if it did not meet the global borrowing limits imposed by its authorities. Other conditions have related to higher education superannuation contributions and the like. As Senator Short said, it should be noted that this Bill also imposes conditions relating to higher education funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have carefully considered in detail the arguments put forward by the Opposition on clause 12. After consideration, we have decided not to support the Opposition in its attempt to delete clause 12. However, I foreshadow amendments to be moved to the higher education legislation by my colleague Senator Bell to ensure that students who object to the arrangements, where funds could be used for political activities of the student organisations, will be able to opt out. Their contributions will be channelled totally into services provided by educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is important that we continue an incentive for students to remain members of what is after all their governing body within a tertiary institution. Thus we will make it possible for individuals to opt out of an obligation to join the student association and to have a portion of its service fee applied to activities which they may not agree to. We believe it is a right that individuals should have. Nevertheless, we believe that the overall concept of supporting the student organisations, which play an important role in the life of a tertiary institution, should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to advert to the lunacy of States competing against each other to attract investments and any short term gain which that may yield. The competition involves taxation, environmental standards, workers' safety or a combination of these things-most of them with long term costs. We need to eliminate such ridiculous auctions. A recent one involving my own State was the disgraceful action of Mr Greiner in bowing to the tobacco lobby and stealing the Australian Motor Cycle Grand Prix from Phillip Island. This caused increased costs to New South Wales taxpayers and will cost the Victorian economy in future years; all just to appease corporate interests. I refer to an edition of the Sun-Herald of 2 December 1990, in which it is clearly stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The dream has turned into a financial nightmare for Greiner and his government. Costs have accelerated sharply to more than $60m and are still rising. </PARA>
<PARA>The article refers to the Eastern Creek raceway, to which Mr Greiner committed himself so that he was able to steal from Victoria the Motor Cycle Grand Prix.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the decisions made at the last largely constructive Premiers Conference, the area of non-bank financial institutions is still disappointing. All that emerged from the Premiers Conference was a somewhat pathetic proposal vaguely similar to the failed cooperative model tried in the company law area, which has now been abandoned by this Parliament. I remind the Senate that I have introduced the Financial Corporations (Prudential Standards) Amendment Bill which seeks to complete the work of this Parliament. We believe we must do better for depositors in non-banking financial institutions than we are doing now. Their deposits must be secure and the institutions must be supervised to ensure that guarantees can be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which is at last receiving some attention is that of infrastructure. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, has brought into the public debate the need for more public investment in this country. Indeed, there is now a growing acceptance of the benefits of public infrastructure investment. I refer to the Economic Planning Advisory Council paper No. 33 entitled Economic Infrastructure in Australia, which found there was evidence of deficiencies in areas such as urban roads, airport facilities, telecommunications and railways. Pages 39 and 41 of the paper warned of problems emerging in the maintenance of existing assets such as water storage, distribution and waste disposal systems and referred to a number of studies which showed that potentially high returns were available in some specific areas of infrastructure investment. Add to this the horrendous over-investment in electricity generation and irrigation, with its appalling environmental legacy, and we have to realise that we must change our ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Public sector investment has declined markedly since the mid-1960s when it was almost 10 per cent of GDP. The Whitlam Government boosted the level up to about 9 per cent but since then decline has been rapid, apart from in the early 1980s. Currently the level has declined to a little over 6 per cent of GDP. A lot of fiscal restraint is exercised in this case by this Government simply cutting back essential public investment, both on its own account and on behalf of the States. It is clear that we need more public transport, much better waste disposal systems, better railways and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The other noticeable trend is the increase in the proportion of investment by government business enterprises and the decline by the general government sector. To a limited extent this can be explained by corporatisation, which we do not object to and in fact support as a means of increasing the efficiency of government business enterprises. There remains within that increasing commercialisation and corporatisation the area of environmental concern and social consequences of a policy which pursues profit as its major incentive. As an example I point to the need to switch to public transport and railway systems. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent example of the trend which the Government appears to be accepting is its preparedness to reallocate some $250m earmarked originally for the Koonong Valley and Mullum Mullum Valley freeway in Melbourne to a railway to be built along the same line, providing much cheaper and environmentally less damaging public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Australian Democrats support the Government's Bill on States grants that is before the Senate today, subject to the reservations I have expressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I would like to direct most of my comments on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill to the second part which deals with local government. I have had quite a number of representations from councils in my State of Tasmania which feel they have been seriously disadvantaged by the way the Federal Government is allocating funding. For instance, overall, Tasmanian councils will have received $19.022m for 1990-91. This represents a mere $450,000 more than they received last year. When these figures are adjusted to take account of inflation, it is clear that Tasmanian councils have received $1m less from the Federal Government than the amount they received last year. This can be put into an even worse context by comparing the national increase of 3.2 per cent with Tasmania's 2.2 per cent increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the major losers in Tasmania are the cities of Hobart and Launceston. This follows a similar situation that occurred last year when once again these cities were major losers. Hobart will receive $728,000, which represents a loss in real terms of $200,000 this year, whilst the city of Launceston in the north of the State has suffered a loss of $160,000, or around $300,000 in real terms. I am concerned, and I know that councils in Tasmania are concerned, that ultimately these costs are going to be passed on to the ratepayers. </PARA>
<PARA> A week or so ago in the Senate I referred briefly to the Commonwealth Grants Commission and more particularly to the inquiry by the Commonwealth Grants Commission into the distribution of financial assistance grants for local government throughout Australia. I have a particular concern that the principle of fiscal equalisation should continue to be adopted in relation to funding distribution. I know that there are States throughout Australia which do not have the capacity to raise revenues and increase costs to the same extent as other local government areas, and these States will be seriously disadvantaged by the use of the unweighted population as a base for determining the shares of the total Bill which makes up the financial assistance grants. </PARA>
<PARA> When fiscal equalisation principles occur, grants are made to local government areas so that when local government units are compared on a national level, they are able to provide services comparable to those in other States, provided they make a similar effort to raise taxes and charges. By this method we are able to guarantee that those States and Territories which suffer disadvantages receive a level of funding to compensate for these costs. The danger when funding is not allocated on a fiscal equalisation basis and some other relatively simple basis is used is that local government areas may be penalised unnecessarily, and similarly others may be assisted unintentionally. It continues to be important to assess the capacity of each State and therefore its local government authorities to raise the revenue required to fund its existence. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously in the Senate I have referred to, for example, the difference in real estate prices between Tasmania and the mainland. I believe that Tasmanian prices are, on average, half those of their mainland counterparts. This becomes even worse when we move away from the major metropolitan areas. For instance, in June 1990 the median price of a house in Sydney was $177,000 and in Melbourne, $133,000. This compares with Tasmania where the median price in the same period was $84,000. So quite obviously the amount of rates that can be raised from those properties is not as significant as it is in other States. </PARA>
<PARA> We also should remember that Tasmania does not have the level of commercial and industrial development which occurs on the mainland. When we compare all those factors it becomes apparent that the amount of rate income that can be generated by the other States is certainly different from what Tasmania can generate and there is a higher degree of effort required by Tasmanian councils. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, whilst we have had reduced funding, local government has had the problem of greater expenditure because of the community's insistence on upgrading, for instance, the sewerage plants, as they have an expectation of the environment being improved. For instance, in my former city of Clarence they have just had to spend $1.5m, with little or no help from the State Government, on upgrading their sewerage plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, through the Premiers Conference, as Senator Short said, has tried to enforce fiscal restraint on the States and local government. In fact, as Senator Spindler said earlier, in 1990 general revenue grants to the States were cut by $400m, or 2 per cent in real terms. On the other hand, the Commonwealth Government increased specific purpose grants by 4 per cent, but these specific purpose grants, of course, give more power to the Commonwealth and further dominance over the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The net effect is that Tasmania once again has suffered severe funding cuts by the Hawke Government. State funding has been reduced by more than $500m since the Australian Labor Party took control of the treasury bench in Canberra. Quite frankly, I get a bit sick of listening to the State Labor Premier in Tasmania complaining about the fiscal mess being caused by the previous Liberal Government when we know that funds to Tasmania were reduced by over $500m during the term of this Government. That is fair enough if the Commonwealth is showing the same restraint as it is expecting in States and local government areas, but unfortunately local government, as we all know, is at the end of the line. It cannot pass on its costs. It cannot pass on its problems because it is at the end of the line. Who will suffer? Of course, it is the ratepayer. The ratepayer is normally the head of a family. It is the same old story: it is the family that is getting hit. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that local government is expected to provide services-roads, cleaning beaches, home help, water, sewerage, libraries, pest control, planning, street lighting, tourism facilities, public toilets, reserves, community arts, and community programs. These are just a few of the things that local governments are asked by the ratepayers to provide and are expected to provide. Who is the major funding source for all these things? Of course, it is the ratepayer. Reducing funding at the Commonwealth level means the councils are faced with the decision of whether to increase their rates or reduce their services. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is as a result of this situation that last week there was on the front page of the Australian an article stating that some councils throughout Australia, because of the recession and the increased rate demands, are being forced to sell family homes. People who have owned their houses all their lives and who have battled through high interest rates and repayments are now being forced to sell their homes because they cannot afford to pay their rates. I think that sums up what I have been saying. At the end of the line the local government ratepayers get everything passed on to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) a question about this problem the other day and I was interested in his answer. I appreciate his answer because he had gone to a lot of trouble. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Local government, like the Commonwealth and the States, has had to shoulder its part of the burden of economic restraint.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that the States have had to shoulder the burden. We know that local government certainly has had to shoulder the burden. But I think figures show that certainly the Commonwealth has not shouldered the burden to the same extent. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In some cases local government may need to put its own house in order. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that many councils around Australia would be very pleased to hear that sort of news!</PARA>
<PARA> Previously, the Tasmanian Government has made increased use of land tax. This is another impost on the ratepayer. Apart from having to pay rates, he now has the unenviable task of having to pay land tax on his property. In my own State of Tasmania, local government is required by law to collect also a number of rates and levies which are transferred to the State Government to fund library and fire protection services. On top of that, just recently the Field Labor Government has chosen to levy councils for the costs of providing services including planning and environment matters. In effect, councils will now be directly funding State Government obligations. I hope that the Commonwealth Government takes note of this: because it has reduced funding to the States, the States have passed costs on to local government. As I said before, local governments are at the end of the line; they have nowhere to pass costs except to the ratepayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this situation of collecting levies for planning and environment matters is unique to the State of Tasmania. I do not believe other State governments have put this impost on their ratepayers. While it might provide a windfall for the Field Government, it is certainly placing a heavy burden on those already hard done by ratepayers. I know for a fact that many councils will be issuing supplementary rate bills for $100 right on Christmas this year and I do not think the families in my former municipality will be very impressed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, local governments are required to provide many services. Over recent years, councils have come to play an increasing role in the provision of children's services, services for the elderly and services for youth. In outlying areas of Tasmania, it is not uncommon for councils to assume almost all Federal Government responsibilities, and this certainly imposes another heavy cost in service provision. I noticed the other day that the Glenorchy City Council has just started a home and community care (HACC) scheme. My former council of Clarence has a HACC scheme. They are very good schemes and they provide very good services for the people, but at the end of the day it is the ratepayer who ends up funding them. Because Tasmania's population is growing extremely slowly, service provision will remain on a high cost per head basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last three years, expenditure per capita by Tasmanian local governments on human and welfare services has increased by 77 per cent compared with a national increase of only 33 per cent. Of the 46 municipalities and cities in the State, 18 currently have some direct involvement in human services and housing programs. Because of the need to provide services, local government in Tasmania is using its untied revenues to broaden the range of responsibilities, despite the obvious factors making it difficult to raise revenue and the reduced share of untied financial assistance grants coming to the State. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress strongly enough the effect which the loss of fiscal equalisation principles from the grant distribution to Tasmania is having and will have on our community. Tasmanians have always had a proud record of seeking to assist themselves where possible. However, clearly in this case there are a number of areas to which I believe special consideration should be given by the Government to improve funding arrangements to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember talking to Professor Peter Self a couple of years ago about the report of his National Inquiry into Local Government Finance and its recommendations on how local government should be funded. Broadly speaking, I think the Government picked up the second option that he gave them, and that was on a population basis. He did say quite strongly that in his opinion, after having spent so much time looking at funding arrangements around Australia for local government areas, places like Western Australia and Tasmania in particular were in need of special assistance. Unfortunately, that has not occurred and we are seeing the results of it and will continue to see the results of it while we have the method of funding that is being used at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say once again how concerned I am that we are arriving at the situation where councils are being forced to sell ratepayers' homes to collect their rate bills. I think it is a pretty sorry state of affairs when we see that sort of thing happening in what was once a wonderful country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak only on clause 12 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. Clause 12 has 16 lines. It is a disgraceful legislative proposal. We are totally opposed to these 16 lines. We in the Opposition are totally opposed to the whole concept of compulsory student unionism. This clause is in parallel with the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which we are to debate next week and which has already passed through the House of Representatives. That funding Bill proposes to place in the mechanism for passing on billions of dollars to our universities and colleges an amendment that says that the money is available in full to those universities only if there is nothing in them to bar compulsory student unionism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been discussions in recent years that certain State governments, particularly those of a Liberal persuasion, would legislate to require voluntary student unionism in universities. If that were to happen, this Hawke-Keating-Dawkins Labor Government would get out the big stick and say, `We will take from a State's general revenue the exact amount that is required to make up the figure that would have totalled all students compulsorily being members of the union and paying the full union fees'. That is what the first part of clause 12 does. It says that such amounts are payable because the State has failed to fulfil a higher education funding condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of clause 12 gives authority to the Treasurer, after the end of May of any year, to deduct from the payment due to the State under this Act any amount that is payable to the State and Commonwealth under paragraph (a); that is, to make up the money. </PARA>

It is this Government interfering in the decisions of the students of universities in Australia by the big stick of funding mechanisms and pushing around States to make up the money that they may choose to allow students to pay voluntarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you will know and all honourable senators will know that there is not one country in the world that has put in place such offensive legislation. Not one country requires compulsory unionism, not even in an industrial field, and not even as a trade union. Yet, here, this Labor Government is going beyond compulsory unionism in the industrial field to force the students of Australia to become members of an association. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the choice? Where is the freedom of conscience? We are used to debates in this place against those matters that will undermine democracy in any country. We are opposed to any government forcing its citizens to become a member of a certain group. We believe that it is a principle that ought to undergird everything we do in this country; that there be freedom of association. It is just as important as freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in the United Nations Charter and in all sorts of human rights summaries of principles, there is an affirmation of the right of freedom of association. This legislation tramples over that. It says that the students of Australia must become associated with a student union. We all know that student unions have several purposes. One is the admirable purpose of providing sporting facilities, dining facilities, places for students to meet in an extracurricular setting, places of fellowship, and places for societies to have rooms to enable students to come together. </PARA>
<PARA> The offensive aspect of any compulsion of students to be a part of an association is that there is a set of political activities that student associations engage in, and those political activities are often directly opposed by many students. Every year those students have taken steps to dissociate themselves from the political activities of a student association. It is offensive not only that a student be forced to be a member of an association but also that such associations pay moneys that can be used for political purposes against the conscience of those students. Mr Crean says that this legislation is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I charge him with exactly that offence and regard his statement as a joke. This Labor Government wants Parliament to legislate to restrict the freedom of choice for students when we should be legislating to enhance and entrench freedom of choice. This clause and the associated Bill supports compulsory unionism in every one of our higher education institutions. It goes to the length of using the Commonwealth's pre-eminent position in the funding of higher education to thwart any State government. But students should have a free and unfettered choice as to whether or not they join the student union at their institution; it is as simple as that. It is for that reason that the Opposition will totally oppose clause 12 and will vote against the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill when we debate it next week. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that I listened carefully to Senator Spindler's reference in his speech this morning to his colleague Senator Bell's suggested amendment that would give an opting out provision for students. Certainly, the Opposition is very interested in that proposal, and we would like to see the precise words of Senator Bell's amendment. If it is as described by Senator Spindler in his speech this morning, we are very likely to support it. It is the case that we will be opposing the higher education funding legislation. It is the case that we are opposed to any compulsion not only in relation to membership of an association but also in regard to the payment of a student levy. But the opting out provision appears to meet at least some of the principles that we are advocating here now and will advocate next week in regard to that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making just two points. Conscious of the propensity in our universities to have outspoken people-people prepared to speak out on principle-and conscious that there are many in our universities concerned about human rights and civil liberties, I am dumbfounded that we have not had scores of letters coming to us as members of parliament to protest this trespass upon human rights and the principle of freedom of association. I also refer to the institutionalised officers in each university for equal employment opportunity (EEO). Where are those EEO officers? Why have they not applied their minds to this Government compulsion? If they are taking very seriously the principle of equal employment opportunity, equal opportunities for students, fairness, non-discrimination and conscientiousness, where are their protests? Why are they not also putting their views to us in this Parliament and through the press to the public? I note that the education spokesman of the Opposition, David Kemp, has made similar--</PARA>

My final point is to come back to a statement I made at the beginning. Mr Deputy President, you will understand this very clearly. Nowhere in the rest of the world is there legislation for compulsion of this kind. Why is it that Australia is the one country out?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Paradoxically the Labor Government wants this chamber to take this path at exactly the time the totalitarian dictatorships of the past 70 years, such as the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe since the Second World War, are actually introducing choice and are opposing compulsion in their association and political arrangements. In the past 12 months we have seen the constitutions of the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries actually changed by their supreme soviets to deny a monopoly of power by the Communist Party in taking office or taking representative positions in those countries. The reason why that huge change has swept over eastern Europe is that those countries realise it is essential for political representatives to be freely chosen by the people so there can be a responsiveness from representatives to the people they represent and a dialogue between the representatives and the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the serious reasons for the failure of the communist system was the offensive compulsion over the past 70 years in the Soviet Union of people to vote only for Communist Party representatives. Just at the time when we see liberty breaking out in eastern Europe we find the Labor Government-totally contrary to the times and to the experience of all other countries in the world-placing compulsion on a student union. Simply put, the view of the Opposition is that students should be wooed, should be able to make a free choice and should see the benefits of being associated with a union and paying for membership of that union on the basis of the benefits which they assess will flow from that association. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this legislation is disgraceful. It should be opposed not only by the Opposition but also by the Australian Democrats. I put it to Senator Spindler and the Democrats that in regard to this Bill-quite apart from the debate we will have next week when we may well agree on the amendment proposed by the Democrats-they should join the Opposition in throwing this clause out completely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my colleague Senator Teague I also will confine my remarks to clause 12 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990, which deals with the question of compulsory student unionism and indeed is complementary to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These amendments are designed to coerce the States into maintaining the current regime of compulsory student unionism, which the Opposition opposes. At present every Australian university student is forced to pay student union fees. The trade union slogan of `No ticket, no start' has been translated into a regime of `No union fee, no degree' by university administrations. Students are being threatened with expulsion due to their attempts to deny student unions of membership dues and others have been denied their university degrees due to their conscientious beliefs. This makes student unions among the most comprehensive and rigorous enforcers of the closed shop mentality in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no defence of civil liberties from university administrators. Universities seem to jealously guard their independence and their rights to free inquiry and free speech, but they are only too willing to compromise students' rights to free association. University vice-chancellors could perhaps be described as almost being the collectors for student unions by this compulsory requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Effective representation requires that students have the ability to communicate their disapproval of an organisation by withdrawing their funding if they wish. This is denied them. Compulsory membership removes an essential channel of communication. If the membership were voluntary, we would see this mechanism work. Student unions become resource rich centres for those who control them and the scope for political activity is almost without limit. </PARA>
<PARA> In being forced to join student unions, students often find themselves involuntarily contributing funds for the promotion of causes with which they adamantly disagree. A litany of left wing groups have been propped up by student union fees over the years. Instead of providing a safety net to ensnare quality services, the compulsory union fee is the hammock, one could say, in which political activists luxuriate at the expense of students. </PARA>
<PARA> Before Liberal Party of Australia and National Party of Australia students won control of the University of Queensland Union, a women's rights librarian was paid a full time wage even though there were only 100 books in the collection. At Griffith University a `tree tax' was paid to conservation groups out of students' funds supposedly to compensate for trees cut down in the production of a student newspaper. The logic is mind-bending. </PARA>
<PARA> One could say that there are those who believe that feminist causes require public funding as distinct from those who believe they should do their own funding. On one campus a sum of $100,000 of students' fees was spent on feminist causes. Dr Gerard Henderson, Executive Director of the Sydney Institute, who first questioned compulsory student unionism 20 years ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Very often a small minority of left-wing political activists run student unions like a campus soviet-financially rewarding their mates and favourite political causes in the process. </PARA>
<PARA>There are plenty of examples to prove his statement is accurate. The effect of compulsory student unionism is best evidenced if one looks at what happens with the National Union of Students (NUS). NUS was formed in December 1987 and this year had an income from affiliated fees of close to $800,000. Approximately 80 per cent of NUS expenditure is directed towards wages and administration. The union has five fully paid student office bearers on a 12-member executive. That relates very well to Dr Henderson's statement. Membership of the NUS is compulsory for every student on campuses affiliated with the union so that individual students are not permitted to opt out of that union. The procedure prescribed by the NUS constitution renders disaffiliation at best difficult and in many cases practically impossible. Last year the union allocated $28,000 simply to campaign to get further affiliations and thereby more money in its coffers and more money for its mates. </PARA>

There is no way NUS can claim to be representative of the majority of the students when campuses such as the Sydney University, the University of Queensland, the Australian National University and many other of the country's main campuses simply will not have a bar of it. By the introduction of this Bill and the associated amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act this Government becomes the shop steward for student unions right across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make one thing clear: I have no objection to students organising for common pursuit. Indeed, that is part of the activity of all students in universities. Student unionism becomes objectionable only when it is based upon compulsory membership and fees. It is objectionable for the very reason that compulsory trade unionism is objectionable-that is, being forced to join an organisation against one's will is a violation of the fundamental human right of freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, this is a simple issue of right and wrong. The question of right is the right of students to free association. The question of wrong is being forced to join a student union when one does not wish to so do. The main argument advanced in support of compulsory membership of student unions is that they provide for general student representation through compulsory membership. Therefore, there are no free riders because everybody is made to pay. It has been contended that if students did not have such an organisation their interests would suffer at the hands of parsimonious university administrations and governments. It could be argued that that is occurring now. If students feel that they have a need for student political representation, they will voluntarily associate in order to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, the union is little more than a campus extension of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). There is plenty of evidence on the record of that. At the 1987 NUS annual conference, it was resolved to spend $50,000 of students' money, compulsorily acquired, against the New South Wales coalition during the 1988 election because the then Opposition Leader, Nick Greiner, had promised to introduce voluntary student unionism. In other words, he was going to let people belong to a union if they wished and not be compulsorily required to do so-and $50,000 was spent on that. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last Federal election, the union devoted considerable resources to publications which were circulated across the country and which attacked the education policy of the coalition. This was in addition to a marginal seats campaign which also attacked the coalition. The union commissioned AGB: McNair Anderson to undertake a survey of student opinion prior to the election. We can draw our own conclusions as for what purpose this information was used. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have the primary motivation for the Government's wish to maintain compulsory student unionism. Very simply, the Government sees it as an activity which is helpful to the ALP cause. Take away compulsion and taken away is a vital training ground for Labor Party activists; they might actually have to do it of their own volition. </PARA>
<PARA> From an economic point of view, compulsory union fees subsidise a range of service functions for student unions. These include cafeterias and refectories, bars, newsagents, theatres and gymnasiums. Of course, there are unsubsidised, off-campus alternatives to all of these services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which are often used. But, of course, if a monopoly situation is provided on the campus, there is a lack of true competition between those who are genuinely in business and those who provide the service on campus. The result is that subsidisation allows student services to operate inefficiently, often running at a loss. Since membership is compulsory and due to the union's monopoly position, there is no discipline in prices or quality of service that ought properly to arise from competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition's policy simply is that student unionism should and must be voluntary. Thus, we will be moving in the committee stage of this Bill an amendment in accordance with that belief. The case against compulsory student unionism is a compelling one. It goes to the very essence of the right to choose, the right to say how the money that one supplies is spent, the right not to be compelled to have one's money finance causes in which one not only does not believe but very often is absolutely opposed to. This is a serious issue, and that is why many of us are choosing to speak on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I also rise to speak on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill and to endorse the remarks of my colleagues, Senator Short, Senator Teague and Senator Bishop. I believe that this Bill contains one clause which, as my colleagues have stated, is particularly offensive not only to members of the Liberal and National parties but to all people who genuinely believe in civil liberties. As Senator Bishop has effectively outlined, clause 12 of the legislation is designed to buttress the pernicious practice of compulsory student unionism. It must be faced that compulsory unionism is a violation of freedom of association in this country. It is ironic that compulsory unionism has been allowed to develop throughout educational institutions which pride themselves in their rights to free speech, yet deny their students an equally important civil right-that of freedom of association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party (ALP), to its undying shame, has played a leading role in denying tertiary students the right which so many other Australians enjoy. Above all, I think that this Government will go down in history as one that was noted for helping its mates, for granting special favours and for doing deals at the expense of principles which most people in this country strongly adhere to. One of the principles we are discussing today is the principle of freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 of this Bill is yet another attempt by a desperate government, and indeed a desperate and divided political party, to guarantee some sort of long term viability to its mates. It is an attempt to artificially perpetuate the existence of left wing student unions, many of which are members of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> Young people wishing to pursue further studies at tertiary institutions cannot do so without purchasing a union ticket. That is an absolute disgrace. Those who support compulsory unionism defensively claim that if a student is dissatisfied with a student union of which he or she is a member this student has the choice to become actively involved to reform such a union. Have the defenders of compulsory unionism forgotten that most students attend tertiary institutions to study and that many, quite properly, have no desire to spend vast amounts of time in student politics? They wish to spend more time on their studies. We give them credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Have student leaders forgotten that the way to empower-a word that the Left like to use a lot-students is to give students freedom of choice and allow students to truly express their own views. One of the best ways they can express those views is through the marketplace and through their willingness to join or not join a union. Tertiary students, by and large, are adults; they have the right to vote. Yet some people still wish to patronise these students by telling them that they are not capable of weighing up the costs and benefits of union membership and making a voluntary decision on whether to join a union or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 of this Bill will ensure that States suffer a financial penalty if they legislate to end compulsory membership of student unions. This penalty will be the same loss to revenue as institutions will lose as a result of any change to voluntary student unionism. The States which choose, correctly, to go down this path of voluntary unionism amongst students would be penalised by losing many millions of dollars-sometimes tens of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not opposed to unions; indeed, I have said in this chamber before that the more unions the better-provided, of course, they reflect the wishes of their members rather than the dictates of their officials. It is more than possible that voluntary student unionism would create more effective unions on many campuses. At last we would have student leaders whose success would be accurately measured by their ability to sign up members. Rather than face compulsion, students would join because they genuinely believed the union offered quality services and quality representation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under voluntary student unionism, student leaders can of course, if they so wish, spend vast sums of money on the very things that Senator Bishop has mentioned. They can spend money promoting the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Australian Labor Party or, indeed, the Orange People, if they are still around. We are not preventing them from doing that but we are saying that they will have to convince their members that this money is well spent, that this spending of money reflects the priorities of their members, and if it does not they will suffer the ultimate sanction that all politicians suffer when they ignore their electorate-they will be chucked out of office; a principle which all of us in this chamber endorse. It is eminently predictable that a union leadership with a guaranteed source of income is likely to lose touch with mainstream membership concerns. Senator Bishop and Senator Campbell have pointed out to this chamber how out of touch in many areas the National Union of Students is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler commented on the amendment that the coalition parties have moved. The Australian Democrats have a policy of voluntary unionism. Many in this chamber may not believe that, because we have to say that time and time again that is a policy which is more honoured in the breech rather than given effect to. The Democrats had a chance yesterday in relation to the Government proposal for mega-unions to again assert the right of voluntary unionism, and they did not do it. As we often see, when it comes down to making some hard decisions in relation to voluntary unionism regrettably they tend to support the Government. Today the Democrats have had another opportunity to bring Government legislation into line with their own policy. They could have done this by supporting the coalition's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. They have told us that, and we believe them. Article 20 of that declaration states:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. </PARA>
<PARA>2. No one may be compelled to belong to an association. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan is looking surprised by that, but that is one of the key rights in the Declaration of Human Rights, which, it has to be said, Senator McMullan's Party does not support. Is this not a time for the Democrats to support the policy as set out in their own policy documents? If the Democrats genuinely believe that no-one may be forced to join an association, they can effectively put that policy into effect by supporting the amendment to clause 12 of this Bill which Senator Short will be moving. They have said in this chamber that they will be supporting an amendment to the higher education funding legislation which will be coming before the Senate in the near future, to give students the right to opt out. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often suggested that conscientious objection is one way to safeguard the rights of those who do not wish to be members of a student union. Such clauses, however, are clearly inadequate in a number of ways. The basic human right embodied in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights concerns itself with the initial freedom to join an association-this is otherwise known as opting in-as opposed to conscientious objection clauses, which supposedly allow students to opt out. We believe that conscientious objection clauses, while possibly better than nothing, do not fully safeguard the freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset it should be stated that student unions should earn their membership. The responsibility for the promotion of membership of student unions should clearly be the responsibility of those who run their organisations. Student unions are in many ways no different from other voluntary associations-sporting clubs, insurance companies and the like-and those organisations have to solicit membership. If the services they offer are attractive to a large group of people, such organisations survive. There exists no justifiable reason for a student union to subsist without the consent of those who provide the funds for its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats had a chance to restore their credibility on the issue of voluntary unionism today. It is a great pity that once again they did not follow their stated principles. </PARA>

<PARA> We are debating the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill of 1990, which gives effect to the arrangements agreed at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings which took place on 28 and 29 June of this year. In general terms, general revenue grants for recurrent outlays will increase by 2.8 per cent in nominal terms, meaning a predictable fall of 3.7 per cent in real terms. Capital grants will remain constant in nominal terms, at $310.5m, and the Northern Territory is to receive $50m, while the borrowing limit for the six States for 1990-91 will total $3,800m with a per capita formula to be phased in over the next five years as the basis for allocating the global limit amongst the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a provisional commitment by the Commonwealth to maintain general revenue grants in real terms for three years, providing Australia does not experience any major economic deterioration-which of course is now thoroughly predictable. Of course, there is also clause 12, which has been debated thus far. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for an increase of 1.5 per cent in real terms for Commonwealth funding to the States. The States and local government account for 50 per cent of all government spending in Australia although they raise only about a quarter of all revenue directly. If this fact has any virtue, it is that it gives the Commonwealth control over fiscal policy. While the Commonwealth raises the bulk of government revenue, its funding to the States amounts to about 40 per cent of their revenue. It is interesting to compare that with 1980-81, for instance, when they provided 50 per cent of their revenue. This reduction has imposed a measure of restraint, superficially at least, on State spending and it has in some part allowed the Commonwealth to develop something of a public sector surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be a reduction in special purpose grants and an increase in general purpose grants. It is interesting that general revenue grants have been cut by 2 per cent and specific purpose grants have increased by 4 per cent, notwithstanding the commitments given at the recent Premiers meeting in Brisbane. There needs to be a greater capacity for and by the States to raise their own revenue. The States have to be given access to other revenues they presently do not have. Some time ago the States were handed payroll tax-a most difficult and unpleasant tax. When Malcolm Fraser introduced his federalist policy, which allowed direct raising of taxes by the States, the States were very reluctant to take up that responsibility and take unto themselves the obligations that they have. It seems that the States are happy to accept and spend the revenue but not take the odium of raising it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other areas that must be looked at, and will be looked at by the next coalition government, is the question of duplication. The Senate can have all sorts of philosophical arguments about who is responsible for these various areas-whether education ought to be a State matter, a Commonwealth matter or a local government matter. At the end of the day, while that is philosophically important from a practical and economic point of view, it is important to sort out which tier of government is best able to manage it and which tier of government ought to be managing it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look across the whole spectrum-education, roads, health, communications-we find that each tier of government has been dabbling, none particularly effectively, and adding enormously to the cost of administration. It is interesting to look at those States which are now in the best financial shape. For all the criticism that may have been directed at the Queensland Government, the Goss Government is now living on the responsible manner in which the Bjelke-Petersen Government balanced its books each year for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Those States with the greatest financial difficulty, putting aside Tasmania, are Victoria and Western Australia. They have not governed themselves with proper restraint and responsibility. I will not canvass the question of clause 12, which I understand is going to cause us to be divided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the debate, I thank Opposition and Democrat speakers for their contributions and for their relative admirable brevity. Even Senator Crichton-Browne made a short speech, which in itself is a noteworthy event. Later I will acknowledge the even more alarming consequence that I agreed with a substantial number of things the honourable senator said. I will have to go and contemplate how this could have taken place; it is so unusual. I do thank honourable senators for their contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Short said in opening his response, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill has three essential purposes. The primary one, which, apart from the honourable senator's contribution, has not received great discussion-and understandably so-relates to general revenue grants and general purpose capital grants, as decided at the June Premiers Conference and the Loan Council. In any financial sense, this is overwhelmingly the predominant purpose of the Bill-I will make some comments about that in a moment-but it is not that which has engendered controversy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second purpose is the provision to take account of transfer of bank accounts, debits tax and other related tax-type changes. These matters are important in terms of the evolution of Commonwealth-State financial relations but not in terms of amounts of money with regard to this Bill. They are not, once again, the centre of controversy. The controversy has arisen around clause 12, and I will come back to that. Primarily the Senate will have a debate about that at the committee stage because we need to have a committee-type debate on it. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of this Bill, clause 12 is essentially a mechanism for implementing the decisions of any government should the higher education funding amendment legislation subsequently be carried. Most of the debate-and the honourable senators involved acknowledge this quite directly-relates to the provisions in the higher education funding legislation. In terms of student unionism, this is a very minor Bill because it is only the mechanism for implementing other matters if those other matters in the subsequent legislation pass the Senate and then if this Government or some subsequent government makes the decision. I do not mean that it is inappropriate for people to talk about it; I am simply saying this Bill does not carry the burden of that matter, that it is only the mechanism at the final stage after many other issues have been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> I do want to say something about clause 12. This clause was such a substantial part of several senators' contribution to the debate that I could not properly conclude the debate without referring to it. Senator Short raised a matter and in his second reading amendment referred specifically to the hoary argument that goes on from time to time about the relative financial restraint of the States and the Commonwealth. I want to say something about that relativity and something about the implications of calls for enhanced fiscal restraint by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of relative fiscal restraint, the key question is: from what date do we start to measure these changes? In all measurements of trends and relative performances, the statistical validity of any comparison depends upon the validity of the starting point which is chosen. There are, of course, a myriad of those which could be chosen. Realistically, we all have to acknowledge that the fiscal restraint which all governments came to feel and which was sharply felt by Australians started in the fiscal year 1985-86 when external financial circumstances and particularly matters triggering a substantial decline in the value of the Australian dollar put great pressure on all levels of government for fiscal restraint. Spending cuts became the order of the day and that has been the overall fiscal atmosphere within which these matters have been debated in all the financial years since 1985-86. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1985-86 and 1989-90-I choose that year only because it is the latest year for which up-to-date data on the States is available to us-the Commonwealth's own purpose general government outlays have fallen by around 2 per cent in real terms compared with an increase of around 5 per cent for the State and local government sector. Over the same period, the Commonwealth's revenue has increased by about 12 per cent in real terms compared with about 20 per cent for State and local own source revenue. I know those figures are not going to end the debate that has been going on for a long time, but I think it is important on each occasion to put those on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> I want briefly to refer to the other aspect of part (a) of the Opposition's second reading amendment: the failure of the Commonwealth Government to make sufficient cuts in its own purpose revenues. Those opposite cannot have a Tuesday economic policy and a Wednesday economic policy. Yesterday Senator Boswell was crying about the problems for small business-very real problems, very ineffectively advocated-but hundreds and thousands of small businesses will be very adversely affected by further substantial cuts in Commonwealth own purpose outlays because they provide services to the Government, they provide services to people who provide services to the Government, they provide services to the employees of the Government or-and all of them are in this category-they are dependent upon the level of economic growth in the economy. I will not duplicate any further the discussion which we had yesterday on the matter of public importance, but it is important to continue to recognise that in economics, as in other things, the whole equals the sum of the parts. If people keep advocating contradictory positions in different debates, the economic policy that ensues will not be coherent. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly say something about Senator Calvert's contribution. I acknowledge the genuineness of his concern about local government. It is not directly relevant to the particular debate we are having today, but obviously the whole question of federalism is important for local government and he has spoken about that in this Parliament on many occasions. He spoke about fiscal equalisation and I do not want to deal at great length with the points that he made. They are matters that are under review in the very important and healthy process of the current review of federalism and Commonwealth-State relations. Each time we talk about the important question of enhancing the capacity of the States to raise their own revenue to meet their own requirements, we have to be aware that we reduce the capacity of the Commonwealth to play a fiscal equalisation role because it does not have, to distribute to the States, the surplus with which that fiscal equalisation function can be performed. That is just a question of balance that we all have to acknowledge. </PARA>

I am sorry that in my comments on part (a) I did not go on. I will be very brief. The question of the increasing proportion of payments in tied form was raised; it is a very slight increase in this Bill. The increase is not a major aspect of it, but I understand there is a very genuine concern and interest about the amount of Commonwealth funds going to the States in tied form. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made it clear that it is a matter about which he is conscious, and it is under review at the moment in the discussions in the series of Special Premiers Conferences. It goes very much also to the point that Senator Crichton-Browne was making about duplication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those issues are important. They are not matters that we ought to hold up the valuable time of the Senate with now other than to say yes, we all agree that is important, but I note the proposal in the amendment and I draw to the attention of the Senate the very important-perhaps the most important for many years-review of that which is under way at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are all pressed for time, getting towards the end of the parliamentary year, I do not want to deal at great length in the second reading debate with the arguments about clause 12 when it is all too obvious that that will come up in the committee stage, but I want to say a couple of things about it. One is-to repeat my point in opening-that this is primarily the mechanism for the implementation of policy which is reflected in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill; it is not of itself a matter dealing with the policy to do with student unionism, and that ought to be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, to make it very clear, because there has been some misunderstanding by some senators, the Commonwealth will not be telling universities or student associations how they should run their business; we are telling the States not to tell them how to run their business. That is what the Commonwealth is doing. This is a Bill about the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States and we are saying to State governments that they are not to legislate in such a way that will prevent tertiary institutions and student associations proceeding down their own chosen routes of student organisation. If a State government is of a mind to do so, this is a mechanism for our saying that the institution should not be financially disadvantaged as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this Bill does, but I am not backing away from the philosophical debate which I assume we will have in the discussion in the committee stage around clause 12 and which I am quite happy to indulge in so long as the Whip allows me time to keep doing so. We have to keep in perspective that discussion and its relationship to this Bill. I oppose the Opposition's amendment, but I welcome the general support for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 12, page 8, clause to be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it has been made fairly clear from the contributions made in the second reading debate, particularly by my colleagues Senators Teague, Bishop and Kemp, as well as by me, that the Opposition is very strongly opposed to clause 12. Indeed, that was the reason why we divided on the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of clause 12 as stated in the explanatory memorandum is to complement amendments currently before the Parliament to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act are designed to impose on the States a requirement, as a condition of grants under that Act, not to prevent or hinder the imposition and collection of fees for organisations that represent the interest generally of students at an institution. </PARA>
<PARA>But what in effect clause 12 does is to entrench the practice of compulsory membership of student unions or, to put it perhaps more precisely, to seek to protect the capacity of tertiary institutions to force students to join a student union and pay the appropriate fee as a precondition of entry into the tertiary institution. It does that by having a provision to penalise any State which seeks to prevent tertiary institutions from undertaking what we regard very much as an obnoxious practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, through this Bill, is in essence telling the States that, if they seek to protect the basic rights of students by ending the practice of coerced membership of student unions, they will suffer a financial penalty. The penalty they will suffer will equate with the revenue that the institutions will lose as a result of a change to the voluntary membership provisions of the student union. I think it is difficult to look at clause 12 as anything other than blatant blackmail of the States to enforce compulsory student unionism because, if they do not do so, they will be penalised financially. That is a form of coercion of the very strongest kind. </PARA>
<PARA> In his remarks, as I understood them, in summing up the second reading debate, Senator McMullan said that this was really a machinery clause at the end of a series of other actions of which the key actions are those contained in the Higher Education Funding Act. That is technically correct. Nevertheless, there are two points to be made on that. The first one is that it is very odd to be debating here a Bill which will have machinery provisions relating to another Bill which has not been debated in this chamber. Apart from anything else, the timing of consideration within the Senate of those two Bills seems to be wrongly juxtaposed. But that perhaps is not a matter for overly serious comment, although we do not know what the outcome of consideration of the Higher Education Funding Bill will be. As the Australian Democrats have said, the Bill may well finish up being a different Bill from what is now the Government's intention. So the juxtaposition is not a completely irrelevant matter by any means. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to make in relation to Senator McMullan's comment that this is essentially a machinery provision in this States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is that it is a machinery provision of, as I said, a blatant blackmail nature because it will financially penalise States which have tertiary institutions which may have the courage and the foresight to go the route of voluntary unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> So I do not believe that clause 12 can be pushed under the carpet as purely a machinery type matter. It goes to a very fundamental matter indeed-a matter that my colleagues in the second reading debate put very eloquently and I believe very persuasively. I will not go over all their arguments again, other than to say that we believe that clause 12 of this Bill goes right to the heart of the basic principle of freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA> For a student who does not wish to join a student union when enrolling in a tertiary institution, the practice of forced membership of the student union effectively means that that student will be forced to violate his or her deeply held political beliefs, or lack of political beliefs, as a precondition for enrolment. That violates the student's right to freedom of association and the equally fundamental right of freedom not to associate. That is what it is all about. Those rights of freedom of association or freedom not to associate are considered so important internationally and go to the whole core of our democracy. They are considered so important and integral to basic freedoms that they are in fact referred to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. So we are talking about something of very considerable principle and magnitude indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Any provision requiring compulsory membership of any organisation violates the basic liberal values for anyone to associate with any organisation or not to associate with any organisation. As soon as we start allowing into this Parliament an acceptance that we will pass laws which contravene the freedom of association or the freedom not to associate, we start going down the road of an antidemocratic state. So the basic principle involved in this of the right of freedom of association is fundamental to our approach to this clause 12 and, therefore, to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other points to be made in relation to clause 12, apart from the principle involved. The fact is that the role of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill traditionally has been to implement the decisions of the Premiers Conference. That is what this Bill is there for; that is its essential purpose. The issue of student unionism has nothing whatsoever to do with the Premiers Conference. It was not discussed at the Premiers Conference; it was not an issue at the Premiers Conference; no-one ever vaguely thought it had anything to do with the Premiers Conference, least of all the Premiers. So inclusion of clause 12 in this Bill clouds the very reason for the Bill's existence. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point is that clause 12 puts into a Bill dealing with general purpose payments-that is, untied, unconditional payments to the States-tied conditions because the payments to the States will be conditional on the tertiary institutions in those States acting in a certain way in relation to student unionism. So, again, it cuts across the whole conceptual thrust of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that inclusion of clause 12 does in this Bill, because it does not relate at all to the main purpose of the Bill, is to invoke the piggybacking principle frequently adopted in countries, particularly by the United States Congress, of tying onto pieces of legislation provisions unrelated to that legislation in the hope that the piggyback bit will get through because the parliament wants to get the principal purpose of the Bill through. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a form of legislative sleight of hand, of legislative blackmail. It is certainly quite contrary to all normally accepted parliamentary practice in Australia. Therefore, if we pass this Bill with clause 12 still included in it, I believe we will be setting a very dangerous legislative precedent indeed. If the Government wishes to pursue, for whatever reason, its wish to enforce and coerce compulsory student unionism, let it be honest and frank about it and do it in a legislative way not involving its being piggybacked through on something that is unrelated to it. There are other legislative processes available to the Government to attempt to get the concept of clause 12 through, if it wants to. It is absolutely wrong for it to be attempting to do so in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the reasons, apart from the point of principle that I mentioned at the start, why I hope that the Democrats will-before we vote on this clause-have another look at their attitude to it, because it involves very important points of not only basic human rights principles but also, as I have said, basic legislative principles and practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted Senator Spindler's comments as to proposed amendments to the Higher Education Funding Bill that we will be debating next week. The amendments that the Democrats will be moving to that Bill next week, if I understood Senator Spindler correctly, do not really meet the concern that we have with the student unionism point because they will not enable a student to opt out of student unionism. Rather, they will allow them to opt out of paying that part of the student dues. If I am wrong on that-I see Senator Bell shaking his head-I will be interested to hear about it. But it will not affect our position on this Bill for all the other reasons that I have mentioned. I do hope that the Democrats will have another look at this because the Opposition believes that we will rue the day if we allow this clause to persist in this Bill because we will prostitute those fundamental principles. I commend the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 12 in this Bill and the amendment moved by Senator Short on behalf of the Opposition raise two important issues. One of them relates to compulsory membership of organisations; I prefer to distinguish those from unions because, although the term student unions is used, I believe they should be distinguished from industrial unions which have a slightly different function. I believe it is a distinction worth making. Nevertheless, the principle remains that compulsory membership of organisations is something the Australian Democrats do not support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other factor that is raised by clause 12 is whether a national government, a Federal government, is entitled to use legislation that it introduces to promote national policies across the country, in a sense overriding States' rights. That raises the old debate of whether we are one nation or a conglomeration of States and it has to be decided on the merits of each particular issue as to whether it is a national policy and so desirable that the Federal government should press for all States to reach a similar stance and to obey similar laws. We have various degrees of cooperative arrangements. We have had them in corporate legislation. We have not had them in other areas where we perhaps would have been better off if we had had them, such as a national railway system. The Australian Democrats believe that a national tertiary education system and the principles that this provision seeks to promote are a worthwhile national objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I return, however, to the compulsory membership of associations. I contrast that negative with our belief that student participation in the governing of tertiary institutions should be promoted. We believe that people belonging to an organisation-in this case, students attending a tertiary institution-should have an effective say in the running of that institution. If students are not part of the student organisation which elects a students representative council which then, in turn, provides members to the governing body of the institution, that means that these students have not a base or a right to participate in the governing of the institution that they attend. There is, therefore, a case to be made for encouraging such participation. It is somewhat akin to saying to a person, `You have voting rights and you pay taxes in a country. You really cannot opt out because you should contribute and you should have the right to have a say in the decisions that are being made in the governance of that country. You can emigrate if you do not like it'. In a sense, that is the amendment that we will suggest and move to the subsequent Bill, the Higher Education Funding Bill, next week which my colleague Senator Bell will have carriage of for the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the question that Senator Short raised, it is our intention to provide in that amendment for the possibility for a student to opt out of membership of a student organisation, whatever it is called. We do not believe that that student should be allowed not to pay the service fees that go into providing the services that he or she would enjoy but we will seek to have a provision whereby those moneys are being paid for general services available to students rather than for political or semipolitical purposes to which that student may object. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this provision satisfies entirely the stance that we take in opposition to compulsory membership of associations. Quite clearly, an individual should be able to opt out. A citizen should be able to leave the country if he or she wishes to do so. But, at the same time, we believe that tertiary institutions will be better off if we have stronger student participation in those institutions. Subject to that qualification and amendment which, as I said, will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Bill when it is before the Senate, we do not support the deletion of clause 12 in the Bill which is now before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Spindler for his comments, particularly the clarification he gave. Without wishing to prolong the debate, I just want to make two points. The question of enabling people to opt out of an organisation is, of course, totally different from the concept of their being free to join or not to join the association in the first place. What is being done is to provide a loophole, a way out, for people in relation to membership of an organisation, but to force them in the first instance to join that organisation. Therefore, the points that I was making in terms of freedom of association-the right to be free to associate or not to associate in the first instance-is not covered by that opting out procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sorry that Senator Spindler did not address that fundamental principle as well as I would have hoped he would have done. I am sorry also that he has not addressed the other points of legislative practice and procedure and the precedents that the inclusion of clause 12 will set for future legislative possibilities and the whole obnoxious practice of piggybacking. Obviously, I am not going to be able to convince the Australian Democrats to change their minds. But I just want to record again my regret because I think that, by supporting the Government on this, they are being party to a very dangerous prostitution of the legislative procedures of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I consider that this clause has no place at all in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. Nobody cares how I voted, but I voted for the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill which added the following to the end of the motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that while some States have not done enough to use efficiently and effectively their own-source revenues, they have nevertheless borne the brunt of the Commonwealth Government's fiscal restraint and condemns the Commonwealth Government for its inability to make appropriate reductions in its own-purpose spending; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Commonwealth Government for strengthening its dominance over the States by providing an increasing proportion of its payments in tied form.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I supported that. Here we have an example of what the Commonwealth is trying to do. It is trying to impose its will on the States in an area essentially of State responsibility. I am not saying that on every occasion this should be opposed, but I am saying that it is an unfortunate precedent; I suppose it is a precedent when it is tied like this to a States Grants (General Purposes) Bill because normally, when the Commonwealth seeks to impose its will on the States, it must do so by reference to its constitutional powers. The Commonwealth will say, `Well, the States can take it or leave it; they have a free choice.' But that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being stated here is that, if the States exercise certain rights in their area of responsibility, they just do not get the money. That is economic blackmail. That is not doing things in a proper, constitutional fashion, relying on heads of power under the Constitution. I agree with what Senator Short says: this is just not a proper way of going about it. If the Government wants to do it, it should do it directly and do it by reference to a head of power under the Constitution. I must say that there are a couple of things that are going around in my mind that need to be clarified at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 7 of the explanatory memorandum clearly indicates that complementary amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act are designed to impose on the States a requirement, as a condition of grants under that Act, `not to prevent or hinder the imposition and collection of fees for organisations that represent the interest generally of students at an institution'. </PARA>
<PARA> I must stand here and agree with what has just been said by, I think, Senator Spindler. There is a vast difference between industrial organisations-trade unions-and organisations that are called unions but really are clubs, that is, student unions. The latter organisations have their place; there is no doubt about that. People should be encouraged to take part in whatever walk of life they are in. They should take part in their community organisations and in other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> But trade unions, that is, industrial organisations, were set up to ensure that workers receive a fair go. In the Australian context, the existence of industrial organisations is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the industrial relations system of the Commonwealth and, indeed, of each of the States. Those organisations represent their members, the workers; they are their bread and butter. It may be said that student organisations have similar responsibilities, but those aspects represent only a very minor part of their responsibilities. Overall, they play the role almost of clubs. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the concept that has been advanced by a previous speaker, that there will be an amendment to a subsequent Bill, the Higher Education Funding Bill, that is coming before the Parliament, I think, next week, which will go to this question of compulsory--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a longstanding principle that Australians travelling overseas, particularly those who have held high office, do not disparage their own country or necessarily their own Government while they are overseas. I did note that former Senator Haines, before she left this country, said she would do the relevant amount of grovelling in Baghdad, but I have to say she has been done over by a master in Mr Uren. The most galling comment by Mr Uren today in the Sydney Morning Herald was when he said the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>[Mr] Hawke never consulted Cabinet about the decision [to send ships to the Persian Gulf; . . . I told the Iraqis that this was clearly undemocratic . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The first thing I have to say about that is that the matter did go to Cabinet and was endorsed unanimously by Cabinet. I just wonder what sort of discussions Mr Uren would have had in Iraq about democracy. Did he discuss malapportionment in the north-west electoral zone in Iraq? Did he thoroughly analyse the Baghdad south state school results last time and postulate on why the swing was there, or were his hosts simply too busy signing death warrants for dissidents to discuss this particular matter with him? I wonder whether he asked if the Kurdish minority enjoyed participating in Iraqi democracy whereby the only way one survived to vote was with a gas mask. I wonder whether he discussed with the Iraqis the democratic principles involved in the summary execution of ambitious army officers and nosy foreign journalists.</PARA>
<PARA> I also have to say that Mr Uren's visit to Baghdad was a classic case of the dog that did not bark. He gave several emotional and strident anti-war speeches in Australia before he left for Iraq. Surely, as such a principled individual, he would have done the same in Iraq, but I do not have one report back that he made the same sort of speeches in Iraq as he made here. I wonder what the reaction of his Iraqi hosts would have been to them. Did Mr Uren raise the question of one million casualties in the Iran-Iraq war and ask his hosts to justify their annihilation of Kuwait and the daily executions that are occurring there at present? The answer would have to be no.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken a hard line on the principle of hostage taking, but it also expressed the hope that private envoys would be as successful as possible. We are particularly pleased that all foreign nationals now appear to be free to leave Iraq, and we do not think for a moment that this would have occurred without the resolute pressure applied by the whole civilised world.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that what Mr Uren has done has been to humiliate not only himself but also his country with his antics in Baghdad. I note his gratuitous advice when he goes on to criticise the new leadership of the Left for their so-called subservience and then worries about their place in history. Maybe some of that leadership of the Left will look back to the era when Mr Uren regularly briefed former Prime Minister Fraser on internal divisions within the Labor Party. That is something best forgotten on this side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note from public reports before Mr Uren left for Iraq that his trip was paid for by local Arab Australians. What a pity a man of such great principle did not dip into his own vast superannuation payments and pay his own way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The outcomes of the mission that John Kerin led overseas to promote Australian wool look more promising than was anticipated before he left. Some say the success of the trip is being reflected in the rise in trade buying at wool sales in recent days. This is possibly a bit simplistic. However, the wool mission did significantly reduce the fear of massive inventory losses if our customers return to the auctions in some strength. Confidence is the key in bringing them back into the market and the wool mission was crucial in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all major buying countries, uncertainty in the marketplace has brought pipeline stocks down to an absolute minimum. Buying for immediate processing for retail sale in the 1991-92 Northern Hemisphere autumn-winter will occur over the December and January sales. So far in December we have seen a good pick up in demand with a Corporation buy-in rate falling to around 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Final retail demand remains strong in Japan, Germany, Korea and Italy; moderate in France and weaker in the United Kingdom. Demand in the Soviet Union is also strong at all stages of the pipeline. However, the economic problems of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have left it without the foreign exchange to purchase stocks. We are confident that the $400m credit facility we put in place will kick-start the Russian trade and we will see it active in the market in the near future. There are clear signs that Japan will play a bigger role in the market next year. China, which has its own stockpile of wool and a depressed internal and external retail demand, will be slower to resume buying on a large scale, but I expect its purchases will steadily increase.</PARA>
<PARA> The short answer to Senator Foreman's question is that the prospects for increased export sales of Australian wool are brighter than at perhaps any other time over the last 12 months. However, we must wait and see whether these prospects turn into reality before we can claim that they are ultimately successful. However, any improvement cannot come too early. Even if the present improvement is maintained, the wool industry in Australia is still facing difficult times and hard decisions as it is forced to manage the current oversupply situation and the massive stock overhang that will, unfortunately, be around for some seasons to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Welfare agencies have been around for a long time. They preceded the recession. They have seen many other recessions.

I was not aware of any figures from South Australia. I do have a number of articles here, but I have not seen one from South Australia just yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will certainly take Senator Lees's word for the fact that one cannot have a recession without more people out of work, and when more people go out of work undoubtedly the strain on charities will become very much greater. The Government will continue to provide a welfare safety net which, in my view, is second to none. It will, however, not satisfy those who are going out of work. Obviously, it will mean the tightening of belts for very many Australian families over Christmas. No-one on the Government side would have wanted that. Having said that, either we take tough decisions now or we hand these problems to the next generation. I would like to think that, after all of us in this Parliament leave parliamentary service, we will have sought to minimise the problems that we hand down to the next generation. That is what the decisions that the Government has taken will undoubtedly do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I have not indicated that we would be providing them with assistance. That has been a matter mostly for voluntary aid and sometimes for State governments. It is not on the program at the present time for us to do so. I simply made the point that those organisations had not approached us. I understand that people fall through the welfare net. However, they fall through the net for matters of days, not for months. The welfare net is there for the obvious purpose of picking them up and does so. Some who fall through the net do so because they do not pass relative tests. They do not pass relative tests often because of the amounts they have in the bank. We have recently had some quite surprising cases reported to us of people coming in wanting to get on relief and yet having quite extraordinary sums of money in the bank. For most people that is not the case. Most are struggling. But if they are struggling they do not fall through the net, because the income and assets tests that they go through are set at such levels that anyone who is genuinely in need will pass.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I preface my question by saying that the Minister will be aware of the rapid increase on supermarket shelves lately of products that are claimed to be environmentally friendly. Can the Minister tell the Senate what the Government is doing to ensure that consumers are able to make environmentally safe purchases?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator West has been observant in noticing that many manufacturers and suppliers do attach some sort of environmental friendly logo to their products on supermarket shelves and elsewhere in an attempt to make claims about the way in which those particular goods have a beneficial impact on the environment. I believe there is a growing confusion in the marketplace about the proliferation of such labels and, indeed, I think they can be misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a danger that some schemes which have been suggested, such as a green spot scheme and so on, can be too crude and simplistic and do not take into account all the factors needed to determine whether or not a particular product being purchased has a severely detrimental impact on the environment. For example, one has to take into account such factors as the mode of production, of manufacture, of the particular good, or perhaps the way in which it was harvested, grown or produced. Also, one has to look at the packaging in which the particular item is sold, and the way in which that packaging can be disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA> It is this cradle to grave approach which certainly cannot be comprehended in some simple green spot labelling scheme. For that reason, both in my case and in that of Mrs Kelly, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, there has been a concern that one looks to the wider issues of education of consumers and of manufacturers and retailers to enable a more sophisticated approach to satisfying the legitimate requirement and desire of those who are purchasing goods to, as far as possible, avoid making purchases which contribute to a detrimental impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> To that end Mrs Kelly organised a round table conference a couple of days ago in Canberra with industry leaders, government planners and consumer and environmental groups. I believe that some more practical proposals in this regard will emerge from that round table conference. It is important to note that protection against false or misleading environmental claims already exists under the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act and the fair trading Acts in the various States with, I believe, penalties for making misleading claims including fines of up $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for corporations. A structure is in place and can be invoked to deal with those cases where blatantly misleading advertising of a product as environmentally friendly takes place. If it is deceptive and misleading, it ought to be dealt with in terms of that legislation. Indeed, the Trade Practices Commission only last Friday put out draft guidelines dealing with that particular matter, which can be responded to shortly.</PARA>

In fact, since it was commissioned in October last year, it has been responsible for saving in excess of 70 lives.

<PARA> I conclude by saying that there is another reason why they should do so. The search conditions again were highly hazardous yesterday for the searchers. It is not stretching the point to say that the people who searched for that vessel risked their lives in doing so. Regrettably, they were forced to spend a much longer time in the search area under very hazardous conditions because the vessel did not have an EPIRB and they were forced to try to track it down by the old method of positioning themselves on the radio signals from the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA> Had the EPIRB been carried, they would have been able to go immediately to the location of the vessel, and the rescue could have been effected some hours earlier, taking the searchers out of a very dangerous and hazardous area. I take this opportunity to stress once again to all mariners that they should spend the $200. The installation of satellite compatible EPIRBs by mariners before they go to sea is a very small investment in terms of preserving life.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no danger of that occurring. Senator Teague ought to appreciate, if he knows anything about what the proposal was and how it was proposed to be implemented, that that is so. The simple truth of the matter is that the Australian proposal, as now endorsed not only by the Permanent Five but by the entire United Nations at least through the Security Council and now the UN General Assembly, is a proposal which was built around the concept of a transitional period in Cambodia which will involve a UN peacekeeping presence, a UN organised election and a UN supervised civil administration to ensure a level playing field, and there is no better guarantee that I can think of that a fair outcome will result. If at the end of that particular process it is the case that the Khmer Rouge chooses not to accept the results of a ballot so conducted but to go on fighting, which is something we have always acknowledged to be a possibility, it will be doing so, by definition in the context of this settlement, in an environment where it is no longer being supplied by any external country-including, in particular, China, which has armed and kept the Khmer Rouge going-and as such has the eminently likely prospect of being marginalised and isolated within a comparatively short period of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first two questions is yes and yes. To the third question, I can tell the Senate that today I launched a survey conducted by the Confederation of Australian Industry which demonstrates the increasing need for managers to be trained in practical, up-to-date industrial relations skills. The survey on training needs of managers shows that today's supervisors have clearly assumed responsibilities for day-to-day industrial relations functions. Eighty-six per cent of supervisors have to deal with industrial relations issues on a regular basis; 90 per cent of companies use supervisors to brief their work force on matters affecting them; and yet 91 per cent of supervisors learn their industrial relations skills on the job or try to pick them up as they go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Management at all levels needs to keep pace with changes being made in industrial relations at both industry and enterprise levels. Only by having the knowledge with which management will need to be equipped will it grasp new opportunities and challenges available under the structural efficiency principles. The report which was released today to the National Labour Consultative Council by the Confederation of Australian Industry was funded by the Commonwealth and identifies that the industrial relations training needs of managers at different levels in both large and small enterprises are critical and must be increased.</PARA>
<PARA> The report identifies that one of the biggest blockages to structural reform in the workplace is the lack of skills, in particular, of middle management. In responding to this need, I announced today a new component of the national workplace reform program entitled `Management Training and Industrial Relations'. We have developed this program as a significant initiative with the Confederation and will begin to address many of the issues raised in the report.</PARA>
<PARA> I have approved Federal Government funding of $400,000 to allow the Confederation of Australian Industry to develop suitable training packages based on the `working together' package developed jointly by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the Confederation and my Department. The presentation of these courses will be coordinated by the Confederation of Australian Industry across all States through Confederation affiliates and other interested organisations. It is intended that 6,000 managers and supervisors around Australia will be trained in the first six months of 1991. I believe that significant demand will be generated by this initiative. Industry bodies and individual enterprises will be encouraged to accept the challenge to provide a significant upgrading of training at management levels. Work will also commence on compiling a register of suitable industrial relations courses in line with the report's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> The theme for the 1990s in industrial relations will be workplace change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean says there were some 1,500 veterans and members of their families at the rally at the Town Hall last Monday. My information is that there were about 800 people there. As Senator McLean was not there-and I do not believe he sent any substitute from the Australian Democrats to attend that rally-I prefer to take my reliable source rather than his exaggerated claim as to those who attended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not all those who were in the audience opposed the proposition. If Senator McLean had attended he would have noticed the presence, for example, in the audience of the National President of the War Widows Guild, Mrs Billie Cutler. I believe that she supports the proposal for integration very strenuously, because she can see great benefits not only for the war widows of New South Wales but for those of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate might like to know that in New South Wales last year there were about 123,000 entitled veterans. Of these, 25,000 were happily treated in public hospitals. Some 15,000 were treated at Concord. All of these veterans will benefit from the proposed private patients scheme and the integration process. The fact that 25,000 veterans were treated so well and in such a satisfactory way in the public hospital system in New South Wales indicates, no doubt, that they wanted to be closer to their families and friends in the local community and more adjacent to their normal place of residence.</PARA>
<PARA> As has been stated on numerous occasions previously, no decision will be made on integration of any repatriation general hospital if there are reasonable concerns on treatment arrangements. Of course, the repatriation hospitals will not be closing. By integrating them into the State health systems, veterans will have available a wider freedom of choice of hospitals than is currently available to them. The private patients scheme proposed by the Government extends the current treatment arrangements which are already available to country veterans. Veterans will be entitled to receive hospital care as private patients, with shared accommodation at a local public hospital or, where necessary, in a private hospital.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Collins has obviously put a negotiating position, and the Commonwealth will enter into detailed negotiations. I do not propose to comment further on those negotiations. But I notice that Mr Collins wants the matter resolved very quickly, if possible, as it is in the best interests of the veterans and the general community. That will be done.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the target date for hospital integration, the Government has stated that 1995 or earlier is the target date, provided certain guarantees are met. That stands. It was never intended that it could not proceed earlier, provided that all parties agreed. Quite clearly, Mr Peter Collins, the Liberal Minister for Health in New South Wales, wants it to be resolved much earlier than that. The Government is well aware of future overall bed demand projections.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is, none. In fact, if an employer wishes to breach an award he should be prosecuted for that breach of the award. That is the simple law. What the honourable senator is asking is that the Government should not enforce the law. I ask her to consider her responsibility, as a senator in this place, and the implications of requesting a government not to enforce the law. So the answer to her question is, no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The implication of her question is that in times of economic slowdown there may be an agreement in a workplace to change the working arrangements in order that more people will be retained in employment. The answer to that part of the question is that there are procedures to be followed to see that an arrangement is consistent with industrial relations principles and not one in which workers are told by employers, `agree or you are sacked'-therefore, an employee has no choice; it is not a bargain between equals but a bargain between a dominant group able to victimise a group that is not dominant.</PARA>
<PARA> If the proper procedures are followed, there are provisions within the Industrial Relations Act which enable award flexibility clauses to be negotiated and approved of by the umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to guarantee that they are fair and approved of in such a way that the award can then be varied.</PARA>
<PARA> My very firm advice to employers who may be contemplating opening negotiations of the sort that the honourable senator's question implies may occur, is that they take care to see that they conform with the proper procedures under the Act. Otherwise, they will be contracting out of their lawful responsibility and inducing others to do so as well, and that is a clear breach.</PARA>

The reason why the question is impossible to answer is that it does depend on the nature of the agreement. I cannot foreshadow what each agreement might be. If I could, I would answer the question. If the agreement has been properly negotiated and the union representing workers in the workplace has been involved then, by consent, it would go through the proceedings of the Industrial Relations Commission speedily. If the agreement has not been negotiated and the union which is the representative of the workers in the workplace is not involved, if it is an attempt to bypass the union and divert the proceedings away from the Commission, and if it is an agreement which is unfair and is contested, then it may take a lot longer. This raises another question: if an employer is proposing or wanting to enter into an agreement of this sort, the employer is best advised to give as much notice as possible to enable proper and full consultation with the work force involved and the unions concerned so that--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. So that the procedures can be followed. The honourable senator refers to the words `technical breach'. I would like to know where under any law the defence can be, `We technically breached the law, but we ought not be penalised'. This is the law. I believe that the honourable senator in her private life is a solicitor. She would know, according to that, that a person either breaks the law or does not, and a person cannot take the defence that this was a technical breach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go to another matter which touches on exactly this sort of issue and which is an important matter in terms of balance, equity and fairness. In the years 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988, the economy in this country was growing strongly. Employment was burgeoning; the bargaining shares that might normally obtain in industrial relations were firmly on the side of the unions and balanced against employers. At that time, when unions could have exploited the economic cycle to their benefit, we got moderate outcomes on wages, and the Opposition lambasted the Government at the polls, saying that we had reduced real wages. We had, but we had increased real household disposable income per capita. The Opposition did not tell that truth. But real wages fell at a time in which unions could have pressed their claims.</PARA>
<PARA> Now that the economic cycle is flatter and the bargaining shares are on the side of the employers, I would like to see employers in this country exercise the same discipline and responsibility to the national economy that unions did during the time in which the bargaining shares stood in their favour. I would like to see them do it in a way in which they involve their work forces in effecting the workplace reform programs capable of being achieved under award restructuring- something that this Government has introduced with the support of the Confederation of Australian Industry and of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to make workplaces more efficient and more productive. That is the way to weather the terms of the recession, not by victimising people and saying, `Out the gate if you don't agree'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the article. I hope that more science students and teachers read it. There are too few employment opportunities for science graduates in industry because industry has been slow to recognise the benefits of research. We have had a clear policy, however, of encouraging research com- mercialisation, and a number of schemes such as the national teaching company scheme, which has been very well regarded, have been put in place for that purpose, as has the national procurement development program.</PARA></TALK.START>

CRA Ltd will be the first advanced technology development unit company to take up work in that park.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also add that, in spite of many rumours or stories to the contrary, we have had a significant net gain by the migration of technically qualified scientists and engineers in the last few years. In current circumstances, that pool of talent has added to the significant number of Australian trained scientists and engineers already here.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a mammoth undertaking to consider in five minutes the reports of the Repatriation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs and obviously quite impossible: they are huge documents. There are, however, two matters which have been of particular concern to the veterans' community referred to in those reports, which I should like to address very briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report under the heading of `Major Achievements', outlines the review it undertook of the second edition of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, also known as GARP II, and the recommendations flowing from it. These recommendations have led to the creation of GARP III, which was recently tabled in the Senate. In the eyes of the ex-service community, this has been far from a major achievement, as claimed by the annual report. GARP III has effectively excluded any consideration of lifestyle effects in the determination of the rate of disability pension payable to a veteran. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has abolished the lifestyle report, which has been the subject of much criticism by veterans, from GARP II. However, in doing so it has removed any concession to the impact on lifestyle which a disability may cause to different veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the obvious problems associated with GARP III, I have given notice that I will disallow it unless the Government and the ex-service organisations can come to a satisfactory agreement on a revised version or an alternative. We hope that the Government properly addresses its responsibility on this matter and that the interest of the veterans' community is paramount-not only the convenience of the Department and the efficiency of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect associated with the annual report which I would like to comment on concerns the proposed transfer of the repatriation general hospitals to the States. The Government has yet to satisfy major concerns with the integration raised by the ex-service organisations and the States. These are proper concerns and relate to the priority of access, the quality of care, the funding arrangements and the timetable proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It has often been mentioned in this place that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised, back in April 1989 before there was an election, that no repatriation hospital would be transferred to a State unless these concerns I have mentioned had been satisfactorily addressed. Since that time, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has been telling the veterans' organisations that it does not matter how much they object, integration is proceeding and it will be impossible to wind back by the next election. Of course, that steamrolling effect has simply stiffened the resolve of the veterans' organisations-and also, of course, the Opposition-which believe that the Prime Minister must be made to honour his promise. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the war veterans rally which was held in Sydney early this week, I think the Government is coming to recognise that it cannot continue blindly to push ahead with integration when there are so many unresolved issues that have not been dealt with. There were hundreds and hundreds of veterans at that turnout in the Sydney Town Hall this week, and Minister Tate tried to belittle that rally. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs seemed to be changing his tune there because instead of saying, `It does not matter how much one screams and yells, it is going to happen, we are committed to it and it will all be in place by the next election', he simply said that it will not take place unless, firstly, all reasonable concerns of the Returned Services League and other veterans' organisations are resolved; secondly, unions have reached a satisfactory agreement with the Government; and, thirdly, Federal and State governments can agree on the terms and conditions associated with the proposed transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> I was glad to hear the Minister starting to change his tune. However, I hope that was not simply to quieten down a very heated meeting. I hope that he and the Prime Minister will stick to those promises. It was sensible of the Minister to change his tune because there is no hope of getting his own way with a gun at the head of the veterans' organisations-which is the way he has been going on this year. Both the questions of GARP III and the integration of the hospitals can only be dealt with on the basis of the benefit for the veterans. For the sake of the veterans they have to have considered and informed discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to get projections on the expected usage of the private hospitals, the public hospitals or the repatriation hospitals in an integration process is a matter of concern. Equally worrying is the fact that the Senate has been told by Senator Tate that the Government does not even know what such a scheme would cost; whether it would be more expensive or less expensive than the existing one. It simply took a policy decision with no information at all. That is no way to govern this country, especially when it comes to governing for a veterans' population which is elderly and needs stability, certainty and care. We do owe a debt to the men and women who fought for this country. </PARA>

Veterans are becoming much more politicised and aggressive in expression of their dissatisfaction about the Government's attitude towards them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly an ongoing source of dissatisfaction to veterans has been the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions or the method of assessing their disability, which has been put alongside this intrusive lifestyles questionnaire which they have resented for so long. It is a running sore. It is something that the Government has to address and resolve in the best interests of veterans' needs. There is no doubt that they feel strongly on this issue. They are not satisfied with the prevailing set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I give notice that the Australian Democrats will be supporting Senator Newman's disallowance motion on Thursday of next week. We have had extensive discussion with veterans' peak organisations and also with officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, explaining why we will be supporting the disallowance. We will be attempting to make a positive contribution and a positive range of suggestions to the Department and to the Government whilst at the same time putting things on a temporary hold-it might be quite a temporary hold-in the hope that this ongoing area of dissatisfaction can finally be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer briefly to Senator Tate's response to my questions earlier in Question Time, which, in fact, related to the rally at Sydney lower Town Hall on Monday. I was not there. I have been to the last two rallies in the lower Town Hall. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has not been to the last two. He was there on Monday. I will accept the fact, perhaps on hearsay, from many of the people who have contacted me that he was received in a very angry and aggressive manner by a veterans' constituency which is increasingly disillusioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of that rally was the question of the amalgamation of repatriation hospitals or their absorption into the general hospital system. Senator Tate has stood in this place over and over again in response to questions from me and reiterated the empty assurances that the Minister and the Government have given, and gave yet again on Monday, to veterans that this transition will be smooth and there will be no lack of provision, yet at the same meeting we have got a State Minister standing up and saying if that is going to occur the cost is going to be $150m each year, year after year, or alternatively, the private hospital system is going to have to absorb the impact. The private hospital system is not capable of absorbing it, and nor is the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Government has done two things here. As Senator Newman rightly said in closing her remarks, it has failed to do the homework. It has not analysed the implications of this speeded transition. It has not anticipated the reaction of State health Ministers in saying they will not wear the cost of it. It has not adequately sampled the opinion of veterans as to whether they want it to go that way. Some do, but many do not. Therein lies the rub. </PARA>
<PARA> It has not attempted, nor did Senator Tate attempt today, to address the enormity of the costs of the private hospital sector having to pick up the servicing of veterans' needs. Frankly, I think there is a whole range of unanswered questions within the administration of this Department which are not adequately acknowledged in this report, which puts a good face on the servicing and administration of the Department, and which is in fact confronted with a very dissatisfied constituency. The Government is simply not accepting the realities of the degree and the nature of that dissatisfaction amongst the veteran community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, in market downturns, superannuation funds, including the Government's own fund-the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT)-suffer downturns in earnings. I have been critical in the past of the nature and style of this annual report of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. I think it is a much improved annual report and I am glad to see that members of this superannuation fund are now regarded by the management as entitled to know what stocks are held, what equities are held, on their behalf by this fund-not that it makes necessarily very happy reading, but nonetheless, the information is once again made available, following my criticism a couple of years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no point in dwelling on some of the disasters. In general, the fund's performance is claimed by the fund to be better than the benchmark of comparable funds. Although it is worth noting that it is not impervious to disaster, I see that 10 million Northern Star shares are held in its portfolio along with a lot of those stocks which are loosely described as entrepreneurial stocks: for example, Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, Bell Resources Ltd and so on. Nonetheless, there has been a fair sweep of some of these shares out of its portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do have some problems, in that there has been an overall underperformance compared to some of the comparable funds, largely because the SFIT has a very large property portfolio. That decision to move heavily into commercial property is now not looking terribly good. One assumes that there will be further problems facing the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust earnings, which, as I said, have fallen this year compared to the last year, as the recession we had to have further damages these values. </PARA>
<PARA> I do have some difficulties, however, working out why the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust is claiming such high rates of return when the figures in the income statement and the statement of assets indicate rates of return far lower than claimed in the Chairman's report. I hope that the trust may be able to explain, for example, why its return on equities, which it says is 9 per cent for Australian equities, appears on the balance sheet figures to be only 4 per cent, and why its overseas equities, which it claims bring a return of 6.2 per cent, appear from the figures to be returning at only 5 per cent; and so on all through its returns. Maybe it has a different way of doing the sums; if it does, I think it should reveal what that is.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there have been some significant downturns in various areas of income: for example, the fund's investments in property. Instead of bringing in an appreciation on the previous years of $218m, that has fallen by $190m to only $28m. In other areas of long term income, there was a loss of only $4m on the depreciation of the value of the investment, compared to a loss of $85m the previous year. It is clear that if it had not been for a significant increase in the value of very short term investments, which is not, one would assume, a continuing situation, the figures would have been something like $71m worse this year than they did appear. </PARA>
<PARA> However, while I have got some problems with various aspects of this report, I am glad to see that the quality of the report has improved considerably and that information is available to the many thousands of people in the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund Investment Trust so they can see very clearly by looking at the back of the book just how their investments are going. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to note briefly that the Opposition certainly endorses the adoption by the Resource Assessment Commission of an integrated approach to both conservation-which includes all environmental and ecological considerations-and development aspects at an early stage. In other words, there should not be a simple rejection of all proposals on environmental grounds without proper consideration of the aspects of projected developments in Australia, which unfortunately has not taken place in the very emotional debate that has far too frequently blurred the reality of the environmental debate. As the annual report of the Resource Assessment Commission says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources, having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations, ecological integrity and sustainability, ecosystem integrity and sustainability, the sustainability of any development, and an equitable distribution of the return on resources. </PARA>
<PARA>This sort of balanced approach, this sustainable development approach, seems to me and certainly the Opposition to be the rational way to look at the serious problems and the serious threats to the environment often posed by major developments. However, by having a rational and coherent analysis, one hopefully will get rid of the very emotional responses that so often take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted this week, for example, that a much more rational approach is being developed to questions of the ozone layer where, according to the Toronto Statement, the risk to the ozone layer appears to have been diminished by 80 per cent in terms of the threats apparently posed to the rate of diminution of the ozone layer by various emissions. As a result, of course, that more rational approach raises question marks over the sense of the Government's determination to adopt a reduction in emissions which may well, on the basis of the latest information, not be necessary. The annual report notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes may provide for additional uses that are compatible with the primary purpose values for the area, recognising in some cases both conservation . . . and development interests can be accommodated concurrently . . . and in other cases, choices must be made between alternative uses or combination of uses. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that, instead of just rejecting out of hand many worthwhile and vital developments, in view of the terrible state of our balance of payments, on ecological or environmental emotional arguments, at least now we are going to have the opportunity through this Commission of having rational argument. The Opposition is strongly in favour of sustainable development being argued rationally instead of actions being taken on the basis of emotion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I am now going to talk about Tasmania and, when I come to appendix 8 dealing with concerts and attendances, Senator Tate might be able to enlighten me. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that for the year 1989-90, as distinct from the year 1988-89, the number of school orchestral concerts that were presented in Tasmania dropped from 32 to six. That has meant that, whereas 11,921 children attended concerts in Tasmania in the year 1988-89, in the year 1989-90 only 1,800 children were able to attend. I find this particularly interesting because at page 69 of the report-this is part of appendix 12, dealing with advisory council members and recommendations-there is a note about concerts which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>GM TSO-</PARA>
<PARA>which I presume is the General Manager of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra-</PARA>
<PARA>be applauded for his decision to waive charges for school concerts and that other states should seriously reconsider this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Going back to appendix 8, the only problem with that is that the number of free orchestral concerts for the year 1989-90 is listed as none, whereas in the year 1988-89 six were listed and some 5,800 children attended those concerts. Overall, there seems to be a diminution in the number of concerts held across the board. Attendances have dropped on those two comparative years from 790,857 to 777,159, with the number of concerts dropping from 542 to 525. Those figures seem to have been affected by the fact that Queensland, for instance, has had a drop in school concerts from 34 to 22 and a drop in attendance from 34,774 to 19,814. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to those figures because it is important in having a well-rounded education, and indeed in looking for informed audiences for the future, that school children are able to have the pleasure of listening to symphony concerts and attending those concerts which are organised especially for them. Perhaps at a later date there may be an opportunity to ask about the reasons for the fewer number of concerts and the lessened opportunities in particular for school children to attend organised concerts. Also, I would like to know the reason for this curious note commending the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra for introducing more free orchestral concerts, and then having listed it as in fact having conducted none. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a time of such hardship and turmoil in the commercial broadcasting sector, it is pleasing to be able to rise to speak to yet another strong annual report submitted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Across the four areas of radio, television, Radio Australia and ABC concerts, the ABC has reported a number of very encouraging results. Of particular interest in this year's report is the publication of the results of a very comprehensive public opinion survey conducted by ANOP Research Services Pty Ltd, which looked at people's use and perception of the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The survey revealed some very interesting statistics, some of which I would like to go through now. Looking first at radio it was found that approximately 50 per cent of all radio listeners are now listening to the ABC at some time during each week and, of those, a full 17 per cent listen to the ABC and to no other station. In commercial radio terms, this is an excellent result which would attract substantial commercial backing to the station. I can only hope these impressive results motivate the Government to provide adequate funding to ABC radio in coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great concern to the Australian Democrats that ABC radio has had to discontinue a number of its programs, in particular a number of its excellent children's educational programs. This was mentioned at length in the Estimates Committee debate. But, speaking as a former teacher, I can testify to the extraordinary creativity of content and teaching method reflected in these programs which are often the only resource available to many state schools. I think these programs clearly qualify for continued funding within the ABC budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the impressive audience reach results for ABC radio, the survey also showed that listeners strongly support the non-commercial style of the ABC and its great value as a news and information provider. Confirming listeners opinion of ABC radio as a quality broadcaster, the station collected seven major international awards for documentary and music programs during the year. </PARA>
<PARA> As a final comment on the radio section of this report, I would like to congratulate the ABC's youth network, JJJ, on its extension over this past year into five of Australia's major capital cities. I would particularly like to welcome it to my home town of Brisbane. While I am not a big listener myself, my staff are certainly big fans. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey showed that ABC television has increased its audience share to the point where an amazing 83 per cent of television viewers tune into the ABC at some time during each week. When one considers the enormous, although admittedly shrinking, budgets that Australia's commercial television networks are running on, for the ABC to return such an impressive result is a credit to all involved. Clearly, part of this success can be put down to the fact that, despite running to a tight budget, 87 per cent of the ABC's evening program was first-run material. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of ABC's contribution to quality television, an unprecedented number of awards were made to the Corporation this year. What is clear from the above results is that the ABC is providing a valuable and widely used alternative to our commercial broadcasters. When radio and television are combined, we find that the ABC reaches around 86 per cent of Australians aged 15 or over each week-that is, 86 per cent of Australians find the alternative services provided by our national broadcaster desirable and clearly worth 8c a day. </PARA>
<PARA> An important result from the ANOP survey was that over 80 per cent of Australians were opposed to the introduction of advertising to the ABC and 79 per cent fully supported the public funding of it. I certainly hope the Government takes this result on board, and remembers it when the issue of ABC funding again raises its head-as it will in the framing of next year's Budget. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make 30 seconds worth of comment in respect of some of Senator Spindler's remarks in the discussion before lunch. Firstly, Senator Spindler pointed out that there is a case for strong student bodies and organisations in tertiary institutions. The coalition has no strong disagreement with that view. However, the coalition disagrees with the Australian Democrats on how best to achieve such strong, vigorous, vibrant, worthwhile and representative as possible student organisations and bodies. The approach of the Democrats and the Government seems to be that there has to be compulsory student unionism, although the Democrats have knocked out that provision, to ensure in the first instance the strength of the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition's view is quite contrary to that. The Liberal Party and the National Party hold the view that voluntary student unionism has a much better chance of leading to a stronger organisation-certainly a more democratic one-which is more widely representative than would be the case under the compulsory unionism approach. If one looks at student unions around the campuses of Australia, one would find it undeniable that many of them are not only unrepresentative in terms of the number of students actively participating in the work, activities and thoughts of the organisations, but also frequently unrepresentative in the range of issues with which they deal. I make it clear for the record that our approach to the subject has nothing at all to do with any suggestion that we do not want to see a strong student body on campuses. That is quite clearly not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler's other point was about someone not being a member of a student association, either through our approach of voluntary unionism or through the Democrats' approach of permitting opting out. I think he alluded to the proposal-with which we would certainly agree-that there would be a strong case indeed for those who were not members of the association to pay for the services they utilised. If they did not use the services provided within the institutions, they would not have to pay for them. I thought I should comment on those two points in response to Senator Spindler's remarks because I did not mention them in my earlier remarks. I would use them as an argument to strengthen further our approach and argument in relation to clause 12. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for clarifying that point. It goes to the question about the rights of the States and their responsibilities in respect of education. I think the point raised by Senator Short was whether the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990 is an appropriate vehicle to enforce that view of the Commonwealth on the States. That is essentially the reason that I am opposed to the provision in clause 12 (1).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just before lunch-and I will be brief-I was referring to the distinction between industrial organisations, that is to say, trade unions, and student organisations, which are sometimes called student unions. Very strong arguments can be advanced for preference for unionists in the area of industrial organisations. I and quite a number of other people within the trade union movement are opposed to compulsory unionism but can see the very strong arguments for agreements and awards to have provisions for preference for unionists-that is to say, to enable those people who are paying their way to gain certain preference in their employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a long recognised and acknowledged policy which is accepted by all of the unions and, it appears, the majority of employers. It certainly is one which the Industrial Relations Commission and its predecessors have agreed should form part of the industrial process, because of the importance of the trade union movement to that balance which was referred to by Senator Cook in his response today to Senator Vanstone, always of course providing for conscientious objectors. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a completely different area from the one which we are talking about today. My difficulty in allowing this through is two-fold: first of all, I am not sure as to what will be the final form of the Democrat amendment to the Higher Education Funding Bill, which is referred to in the explanatory note to this Bill; and, secondly, I am sure that this is not the appropriate method for the Government to pursue to influence States along the lines that it believes the States ought to act. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned very briefly before the debate was adjourned, if the Government believes in what it is proposing it should search around for a head of power in the Constitution and bring forward legislation here so that that can be debated on its merit rather than have a piggy-back situation and, as Senator Short mentioned, doing it through a States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly respond. People have been brief in their contributions in the committee stage, so I will not abuse the situation by making a long speech. The essence of what I want to say about the fundamental question of compulsory student unionism is reflected in the point I made in response to Senator Harradine. This Bill is not saying that there must be compulsory student unionism; it is saying to the States, `You should not come between the institutions and students in their decisions about that matter'. That is the nature of the Bill. It is actually the nature of the Higher Education Funding Bill, too, although I do not want to debate that in a surrogate manner here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In essence, that is why in the end this is the only Bill in which this matter can ultimately be dealt with. It would not be the appropriate vehicle to take the initial action on this matter. That is why the Higher Education Funding Bill will establish the obligation and will set down what we believe the States ought do and not do and the consequences of it. We do not intrude on their right to say that there should not be compulsory student unionism; we simply say that if they are going to do that they should compensate the institutions financially for the loss of revenue that would otherwise flow to them from that. </PARA>
<PARA> If they do not do that, we will compensate the institutions. The only ultimate redress we will have from the States is to say that it is they and not the Commonwealth that should bear the financial responsibility for their action-to say that, if all else fails, we will deduct the amount we have paid to the institutions from their general revenue grants. It is not that this is where we are going as a first recourse, but it is a last recourse. That is why this clause is in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> All other things being equal, it would be preferable that we had dealt with the Higher Education Funding Bill before this Bill, but I do not want to debate the somewhat leisurely timetable by which we have passed other legislation. This Bill has to be passed this week. That is why it is getting priority. We have to have the money to give to the States next week. That is why we are considering the Bills in this sequence, which I agree is less than perfect, although I do not think that is significant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned in my second reading remarks, the Opposition will be calling a division on the third reading. That is a significant step because the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill does provide for the payment of general purpose grants to the States as decided and agreed at the Premiers Conference. It is therefore not a step that we take lightly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As is clear from the debate we have had today, the only reason we are doing this is the quite fundamental objection we have to the principle embodied in clause 12 of the Bill, relating to student unionism. I will not go into all of that debate again, but in essence we believe that clause 12 of this Bill constitutes blackmail of the States so that they enforce compulsory student unionism. We believe that it involves a major coercion of students to belong to student unions and we believe, above all else, that it is a denial of the basic freedom of association which in a democratic parliamentary nation such as ours must be preserved at all costs, and anything that is done legislatively or in any other way to damage that basic principle of freedom of association we will resist at every step and at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made the point that there are other reasons why we are opposed to this clause being contained in this Bill. The Bill has nothing at all to do with the subject with which clause 12 deals. It also puts into a general purpose Bill tied conditions, which is absolutely contrary to the whole principle of the Bill. It involves a piggybacking arrangement that sets very dangerous precedents for future legislation in Australia, for reasons we have gone into earlier today. We are not seeking, of course, to prevent the Commonwealth implementing the decisions of the Premiers Conference in respect of general purpose payments to the States. There are other options for action available to the Government in relation to clause 12. If it wants to pursue the type of approach embodied in that clause, it has other legislative processes by which it can do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make absolutely clear why we are taking this significant step of opposing the third reading of this Bill. </PARA>

I reiterate that the Australian Democrats believe that the States should be encouraged to support student organisations and that students individually should be encouraged to take part in the governance of their institutions.

There is a very grave difference between voluntary student unionism and having to opt out of an association. Senator Spindler cannot possibly say that it is exactly the same.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the third reading of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990 must be confined to whether or not the third reading motion should be accepted. I am going to support the motion for the third reading, notwithstanding the fact that I opposed clause 12(1) of the Bill. I do so because the Bill itself is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and Northern Territory in 1990-91, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council meeting on 28 and 29 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the matter which was raised by the Opposition is very important, I feel that to oppose the Bill totally would deny to the States substantial amounts. Obviously the Opposition has a contingency plan in that regard. I agree with Senator Short that the issue which the Opposition raised was a very vital issue. If the Opposition is voting against the third reading, it indicates a strong objection to the use of a measure such as this, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, to piggyback another policy decision of the Government which is not relevant to this legislation and to avoid going to a constitutional head of power for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Opposition in that regard, but I feel that the debate on that matter has taken place on clause 12(2) and that the legislation itself, as it relates to moneys going to the States, should not be held up. I certainly will be looking very carefully at the subsequent Bill next week. It is to be hoped that the matter can be rectified there and then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on whether to accept the motion for the third reading of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill has been confused somewhat by a contribution by Senator Walters, who suggested that, in relation to a future Bill, some consideration will be given to an amendment which the Australian Democrats have foreshadowed. The nature of that amendment has been misrepresented. There is no question that the Democrats' amendment will have the intention of requiring students to opt in before they opt out or to join before they opt out. What we would hope to achieve with our amendment is the opportunity for those who do not want to join to be capable of opting out. It is as simple as that. The confusion that has been brought to the consideration of this Bill has been unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now resuming the debate on two Bills, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and the Debits Tax Termination Bill. I will speak briefly on the Debits Tax Termination Bill. The carriage for the Opposition of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) will be the responsibility of Senator Watson, who will speak later in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Debits Tax Termination Bill proposes to transfer the responsibility for the bank account debits tax, formerly known as the BAD tax, from the Commonwealth to the States and Territories. At the same time it terminates the imposition of the tax by the Commonwealth. I make it clear at the outset that the Liberal and National parties are not opposing this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect, as the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech, to the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 19 July, in which he proposed a major review of Commonwealth-State relations and said that the Commonwealth would respond positively to the request made by some of the States to transfer the debits tax to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the Prime Minister's response in July to that request from some of the States, because it was in effect a response to a call that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the coalition some time earlier for a major review of Commonwealth-State financial relations. Indeed, in Dr Hewson's first press conference on becoming Leader of the Opposition, he listed Federal-State relations as the issue of the 1990s. That is a view with which I would fully agree because, if we look at the gamut of Federal-State relations and the impact that that has on the lives of every Australian, without doubt that relationship between the Commonwealth and the States-and also local government-has a major effect on everyone. It is a rusty arrangement; it is one that has never been as fully reviewed as carefully as it should, although there have been various attempts along the way. The 1990s, I think, will prove to be a critically important decade for the future of the Federation. In that context, it is entirely appropriate that we look at a full review of the Federal-State arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems, of course, with Federal-State relations is the degree of fiscal imbalance that exists between the Federal and State governments. The Federal Government raises 80 per cent of the total tax revenue in Australia but is responsible for spending only 50 per cent of that. Conversely, the State governments raise a much smaller proportion of their expenditure requirements than the Commonwealth and therefore have to look to the Commonwealth for major financial assistance in order to be able to meet their expenditure requirements and responsibilities. That is, of course, to use the jargon, the vertical fiscal imbalance which has become increasingly an important issue for consideration and debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to terminate the Commonwealth's role in the debits tax-the bank account debits tax, as it was called-and to transfer the responsibility for the tax to the States is a very small start along the way to correcting the imbalance that exists. In monetary terms the amount involved for the remainder of the 1990-91 financial year in the tax transfer-which will start, as I understand it, from 1 December-is $190m or thereabouts. The full year of impact will see something of the order of $400m in increased revenue collections by the States, if the States decide to raise the tax themselves. That amount will be offset by a corresponding reduction in the general purpose payments to the States; so the net financial impact on the Commonwealth will be nil but the effect will be to make a very small start towards correcting the fiscal imbalance that now exists between the Commonwealth and the States. The smallness of it is highlighted by the fact that the total Federal Budget is something of the order of $96 billion-$96,000m. We are talking here of a figure of, say, $400m, which is very small in a proportionate sense but is certainly a worthwhile accretion or addition to the revenue base of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> What will be very important is how the States deal with this transfer to them of the responsibility for the tax. The tax itself can be said to be a tax which distorts financial markets and it is to be hoped that, now it is in the hands of the States, they will either reform it and look at it in relation to the other taxes they have on financial institutions or take other steps to remove the distortions that now exist. Certainly, I would not have thought that there was any need for the States-or any desire on their part-to continue with two financial duties which effectively tax both turnovers and net incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> For this variety of reasons, the Opposition has said that we will support the Bill. We believe that any genuine reform of Commonwealth-State relations must seek to redress the current fiscal imbalance and provide the opportunity to rationalise this country's plethora of taxes. The whole question of where we go in the area of Commonwealth-State financial relations is a very complex one. There is-rightly, I think-a general view held by both sides of politics that, in looking at correcting the fiscal imbalance that now occurs between the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth should not be put in a position where it would be unable to exercise an effective fiscal policy. On the other hand, as we have seen in recent years, just because the Commonwealth has the fiscal policy levers in its hands does not mean it will do a good job with them. Indeed, the appalling recessionary state that Australia finds itself in today, at great cost and hardship to all Australians, is due very largely to a gross failure on the part of the Federal Government-the Hawke Government-to pursue a responsible fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> So the argument that if one is to have responsible fiscal policy it has to be very strongly in the hands of the Federal Government as distinct from the State governments is not a one-way street. I think it is an argument that we are going to have to look at very carefully, dispassionately and objectively as we progress over the next few years in our major review of Commonwealth-State financial arrange- ments. </PARA>
<PARA> I might put on the record that the coalition has been, as I said earlier, very strongly of the view that there ought to be a major review of Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. On 21 June this year a meeting of all Liberal parliamentary leaders around Australia, Federal and State, was called by the Leader of the Federal Opposition, Dr Hewson. As a result of that meeting a communique was issued stating their support for `a genuinely federalist approach to Australia's future'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very concerned about the degree to which power has moved towards Canberra and away from the States. This has been happening for many decades now-indeed, right through the history of Federation. Obviously there are some areas in which that has been desirable. I think there have been many areas in which it has not been desirable. I think that is what the debate is going to be about over the next few years. We want to know where we are going in terms of each of the aspects of Federal-State relations so that at the end of the day we will get a Federal system and a relationship between Federal and State governments that is in the overall best interests of all Australians, regardless of where they live. That is going to be a very difficult exercise. It is one that has been attempted on and off in a very ad hoc way for many years. It is important that we get our act together much more than we have in the past in addressing these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> As a coalition, we have welcomed the Prime Minister's belated moves in response to calls from the coalition to convene a series of Special Premiers Conferences to look at the matters I have been referring to. The first such Special Premiers Conference was held in October. It is regrettable that, despite Dr Hewson's request for the Opposition to be represented at that Conference in a spirit of bi-partisanship in terms of reviewing Federal-State relations, that request was rejected by the Prime Minister. This makes us wonder about the genuineness of the Prime Minister's call for a bipartisan approach in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a lot of talk at the conference. Some worthwhile results emanated from it. But the main result of that first Special Premiers Conference was the establishment of a series of working groups or task forces to consider further many of the issues and items that were under the main heads on the agenda paper. The likely success or otherwise of the review of Federal-State relations that is under way in the form of those Special Premiers Conferences will remain to be seen and will be determined by the outcome of those working groups and the actions and decisions that may be taken on the basis of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not delay the Senate any further at this stage. I reiterate that the coalition supports this legislation to terminate the debits tax so far as the Commonwealth is concerned and to transfer responsibility for it to the States. We will watch with interest what that leads to. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of points in the second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and in the Bill which are not entirely clear. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, may be able to enlighten us on these matters when he is closing the second reading debate. My understanding is-I do not think this is contained in the Bill-that the transfer will take place as from 1 December. There is the question of 1990. There is the question of who will actually collect the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Australian Taxation Office is prepared to continue to collect on behalf of individual States until such time as they decide what they want to do. I also understand that a fee will be charged if those States invite the Australian Taxation Office to continue to collect the tax on their behalf. I do not think there are details in the Bill as to the nature of that fee or how it would operate. Senator McMullan may be able to enlighten us a little more in the course of the debate on this very interesting and worthwhile step that is being taken by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990 which seeks to implement the Government's decision to transfer debits tax to the States. The tax was originally introduced by the then Treasurer, Mr John Howard, as the bank accounts debits tax, the delightful acronym of which is BAD tax. The tax was subsequently broadened to include other institutions and the name of the levy was altered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States already levy the financial institutions duty on deposits of financial institutions and this transfer will give the States control of this field of taxation. The Commonwealth will cease the imposition of the debits tax on a date to be proclaimed or six months after the Bill is given royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Debits Tax Administration Act is the piece of legislation that describes how the tax is calculated and collected. This Act will remain so that outstanding amounts can continue to be collected after the imposition Act is terminated and existing legal action can continue concerning its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that handing this tax to the States is an eminently sensible policy. Duplication will be avoided by maintaining the existing administration and collection arrangements, with the States simply receiving revenue which is collected on their behalf. It is understood that such an arrangement will be contingent on the State concerned mirroring the existing law currently operating at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Bill stands, no revenue gains will be made by the States unless they alter the rate of the tax as the revenue foregone by the Commonwealth will be clawed back by the reductions in grants made to the States. On that basis, it is mainly a machinery provision to streamline the collection of tax and the flow of funds into State coffers. The Australian Democrats support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1990 incorporates a number of taxation changes that were foreshadowed in the Budget. I would like to take this opportunity again to remind the Government to get its legislation right the first time-not the second, third or even fourth time, as we have been accustomed to seeing in recent times. We have major concerns with the area of provisional tax-particularly the penalty provisions-which is introduced in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that many of the provisions of the Bill concerning rebates for superannuation eligibility and provisional tax are completely inconsistent with the Government's stated objective of moving towards a simpler income tax system. I imagine it would be completely inconsistent with the principles of the Green Paper that was promised in August, again in September, and twice in October, which we are still awaiting. This Bill proposes to impose additional tax by way of penalty-this Government is great on penalising taxpayers-where a taxpayer overestimates the amount of tax instalment deductions from salary or wages in an application to vary provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the penalty is to be calculated in these ways: firstly, for lump sum provisional taxpayers, 20 per cent of the overestimate of the tax instalment deductions; and, secondly, for instalment payers, 20 per cent per annum, with a penalty period as defined by section 221ya (1) and with a shortfall in instalment by virtue of the taxpayer's overestimate in relation to instalment deductions. This additional tax is an application of the self-assessment provisions that were foreshadowed in the Budget Papers. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the Government has not been able to get its act together. Budget Paper No. 1 states at page 4.12:</PARA>
<PARA>Extension to Certain Wage and Salary Income</PARA>
<PARA> To remove opportunities to defer the payment of tax on wages and salary, liability for provisional tax for 1990-91 and subsequent years will be extended to all cases where, in respect of the year preceding the year for which the provisional tax liability is to be imposed:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a taxpayer with salary or wage income has a balance of tax to pay on instalments of $3000 or more; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the shortfall of tax instalment deductions in respect of the salary or wages income of the income year is $3000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA>This is explained further in the next paragraph. The final paragraph of this section states:</PARA>
<PARA> In support of this change, the income tax law will be amended to include a new interest-based penalty where a taxpayer over-estimates the amount of tax instalment deductions from salary or wages income in an application to vary provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA>To the extent that this is an interest-based penalty, I concur with that approach. On reading the Budget Papers, however, a taxpayer would be induced to believe that these changes to force directors and others who may receive one-off payments at the end of the year-such as judges, who do not pay tax until the end of the year-to pay their tax as close as possible to the period earned would have been incorporated into one piece of legislation. But this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part of the change was incorporated into the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, but the penalty regime is now contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1990. Why could not the Government get its act together and put these in the one Bill? Thus, the first rule for simplicity, grouping and collecting the same parts of a changed law into one Bill, is actually broken. The Government in its wisdom has chosen to extend the issue into two separate and unrelated Bills. Again, this is completely inconsistent with a government proposing to have a Green Paper on tax simplification. One would think that, if the Government were considering simplification of the tax Act, it would start to put its own ideas into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The chamber has been advised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) that the Green Paper on tax simplification was an important priority of the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I still believe it is. But we have been made to wait an unduly long time since the initial date that was promised for release. The delayed release of this paper is of considerable concern, given that we have been advised on various occasions that it would be part of the Budget or released some time after the Budget. We were given dates in September, mid-October, and late October. It is now December and we are still waiting; it is more than two months past the deadline. We must ask the Government, therefore, whether this noble priority is starting to wither on the vine. </PARA>
<PARA> The cynic may well observe that the Government is hell-bent on imposing more costs of compliance on taxpayers, adding pages of jargon to income tax legislation. We have seen, not only in this particular provision but also in other provisions-159, et cetera-that at the same time it adds some minor refinements in the name of simplicity. Is this Government still committed to simplifying the Income Tax Act? If it is, should the legislation before us not be reflecting that move towards simplification? Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case. Clauses 21, 22, 25, 28 (8) and 32 reflect the accuracy of my comments. </PARA>
<PARA> To impose additional tax by way of penalty in situations of overestimating the amount of tax instalment deductions in an application to vary provisional tax is an extra burden, and possibly unnecessary. The Government admits that the revenue impact is negligible. So we are adding pages and pages to the Act for negligible impact. Not surprisingly, the people affected by this change have had cause to comment. The provisional tax change will cause hardship for many taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> It has come to my attention that many pensioners, some in their eighties, will be forced to pay up to 67 per cent of their pension in extra tax over a six-month period next year. The problem has been caused by the previous Bill-the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990. Representations as to the ramifications of this change were made to me only after the passage of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990. However, the penalty regime for this change is now in the Bill currently before the Senate. Therefore, I mention it now. </PARA>
<PARA> To add insult to injury, many innocent people could be up for substantial penalties. Let me inform this chamber of the problems being caused by this provisional tax change. We acknowledge that Australia adopted the pay as you earn system in January 1946, and it is hard to argue against the PAYE system applied uniformly, but there are problems. The system has two elements: tax instalment deductions before payment of any salary, wages or pension; and provisional tax on other income. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, instead of chasing taxpayers who had not deducted correct tax instalments-the employers-an easier way was to charge provisional tax if insufficient tax had been deducted during the preceding year. Again, there was a lack of proper enforcement. It has now come to my attention that the change will cause some extreme hardship for elderly pensioners. I am talking about people on Commonwealth security-type pensions. One 83-year-old retired United Kingdom serviceman will have to pay out about $16,000 in tax in March. With additional provisional tax, this will become $32,000. Further, he will need to pay another $8,000 as the quarterly instalment commences on 1 September. Naturally, he is worried. </PARA>
<PARA> Another elderly citizen is in similar circumstances, but has another $15,000 in additional annual income. This side of September, he will need to pay out more than half of his total income in extra tax. From his total income of just over $62,000, his total tax payments by September will come to $45,000. Lower down the income scale, another pensioner in his seventies, and grossing $23,000, must find another $4,000 by April. </PARA>
<PARA> When company instalments were altered, relief was given, although it became available only after the Opposition pointed out this problem on numerous occasions to the Minister then representing the Treasurer. So I ask the Parliamentary Secretary representing the Treasurer in relation to these Bills to again consider the provisional tax problem and how these changes will affect the elderly so that we do not have these initial distortions, complications and problems, particularly for the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the elderly who are outraged. In particular, the judges of this land have been shocked and outraged not only at the extra penalty but also at the whole system of inducing the judiciary into the provisional tax system. In order to pay provisional tax, the judges of this land will also be placed in grave financial hardship. The judges have not complained publicly, but they do resent the fact that they were never approached by the Government about the way the changes should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, section 72 (iii) of the Constitution provides that the remuneration of Federal judges may not be diminished during their term of office. This is in the Constitution for very good reason. It is there to stop judges from being intimidated by government or being induced to take a course of action by a government. In fact, it helps to keep the independence of the judiciary intact. Changes to the tax law mean that the Federal judges will have to pay out a hefty payment in provisional tax, and this clearly reduces their remuneration. They will also have to pay arrears of PAYE tax instalments, and this will also reduce their remuneration or take-home pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual payments are as follows: the unheralded changes will mean that they will have to find almost $60,000 to pay provisional tax on their judicial salaries for this financial year, together with a payment of more than $50,000 for their salaries in the last financial year. At present, a judge's salary is about $124,000. Two tax payments totalling $111,000 will leave an after tax income of $12,500. So it is the transition that is really going to cause problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst many judges go to the Bench after successful and lucrative careers at the Bar and may be able to find the extra $60,000, there are, on the other hand, other judges who may not have come from such lucrative backgrounds. Family Court judges are likely to be hardest hit, as comparatively few of them have had top earning practices at the Bar. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that judges were not mentioned in the Budget statement in this area. The Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA>To keep the tax system fair provisional tax arrangements will be extended to remove the scope for high income earners deferring tax payments on wage and salary income at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. This practice has been particularly prevalent in relation to director's fees, commissions and bonuses and short term employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Here comes the rub. Little did the Australian Labor Party Ministers realise at the time they were approving such changes that provisional tax would, under this provision, extend to their ministerial allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to placate the wrath of the judiciary of this land, and contrary to what was stated in the Budget-and this is serious-the Attorney-General's Department now is offering another alternative to the judges, which is not surprising, given their wrath. They are being asked to join the PAYE group deduction system. I quote from a circular letter signed by the First Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, Richard Highfield, on 17 October 1990. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>Judges who commence now to have normal monthly tax instalment deductions made from his or her salary, say from 1 January 1991, may be granted an extension of time to pay any 1990-91 provisional tax without the imposition of additional penalty tax for late payment until 15 June 1991. This treatment takes into account the changed circumstances in which judges find themselves as a consequence of the tax instalment deductions not being required from their judicial salary. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to state that a judge will need to make his or her own arrangements for an extension of time with the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation at which the 1989-90 return of income is to be lodged. Therefore, judges who now want time to pay their provisional tax, et cetera, will have to go and beg the Commissioner for an indulgence at the same time as they may be sitting on cases involving either the Commissioner or the Government. This further compromises the independence of the judiciary. It puts the judge in an impossible position-a position that is supposed to be prevented under section 72 (iii) of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Either the Government was blind to this obvious conflict when it introduced the previous Bill, and now this Bill, or it has done this deliberately. I should like to point out once again that this change was done without any consultation with the judiciary. As a consequence, the judges of our land are being put into the same category as those who are unfairly taking advantage of the tax system at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a contradiction of ethics and values here. Surely a judge is not a wilful tax avoider. What is happening is contrary to all the notions of natural justice which the judges require governments and other bodies to apply. Our judiciary should not be threatened. It assumes that the judges are employees, presumably employees of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Australian Legal Convention last year, the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, referred indirectly to the problem of money and the exercise of power. He said that pressures were being placed on the judiciary in the way the courts are being forced to conform to a new religion whose deities were economical rationalism and managerial efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, a senior Victorian Supreme Court judge, Mr Justice McGarvie, identified some of the threats facing judicial independence and called for legislative changes to cover such matters as the removal of judges and magistrates; the protection of judicial salaries; the administration of the courts by the judges; and the protection of the Supreme Court and other superior courts from abolition. He said that there was a conflict between the Government and judicial independence and that there had been a disconcertingly high success rate for the Government interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, my biggest concern is to maintain the independence of the judges, as section 72 (iii) of the Constitution sets out to do, and this chamber should always be wary to continue this protection, as it is basic to our fundamental principles of democracy. It is our job to see that this chamber of review ensures that anomalies such as this do not creep into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the problem with provisional tax, the Opposition notes a number of other changes to the legislation. Firstly, there is the extension of the fringe benefits tax exemption to employers who make contributions to obtain priority of access in certain commercial care centres. Secondly, there is a modification of the availability of the capital gains roll-over relief provisions, where currently a limitation is applied in respect of the replacement cost not to exceed 120 per cent of the market value of the asset at the time of the loss. This is modified where assets are disposed of involuntarily, but in the case of a natural disaster, of course, that limitation is waived. So roll-over relief applies where the assets were acquired before 30 September, 1985, and destroyed as a result of natural disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the extension of the availability of the principal residence situation for capital gains purposes during a taxpayer's temporary absence. All of these are welcomed. I think there are three or four parts, of which I will mention several. One provision concerns the dwelling not being used to produce income, and another says that it will not be necessary for the taxpayer to reoccupy the property prior to disposal. Again, they are welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a provision that I am quite unhappy about, and that concerns the rebate for superannuation contributions by employees. Again, it is a step in the right direction but the mechanics that have been employed to bring this about are indeed very messy; they are very long; and they total something like 13 pages of amendment. Recognising that they apply to people of middle and, particularly, low income levels, I find it quite unacceptable, because most of these people will find it necessary, in order to claim such deduction, to seek out an accountant or registered tax agent. The fees paid to this person will certainly diminish the effect of what really amounts to a fairly minimum sort of rebate that has taken 13 pages of enactment to express in this amendment. It is certainly a step in the right direction but it is complicated and messy. </PARA>
<PARA> It represents a consensus type of decision and the result in such circumstances is always confusing and not readily understood by the people to whom the provisions are going to apply. It applies to people who have a limited superannuation support-generally those with not more than $1,600 per annum. However, for identification and rebate purposes, a person will have to be a member of an eligible scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A further limitation is also imposed by way of an income limit. The provision talks about `assessable' income up to $25,000. I would have preferred `taxable' but I should like a clarification on that particular point because that suggests that it is prior to deduction. While the maximum rebate goes up to $25,000, there is a sliding scale, opting out at the rate of 50c until the income level reaches $31,000, where it is completely lost. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the question of two unknown factors, until after the year has actually ended, before the taxpayer can be fully aware of whether he can actually claim the benefit that he might be entitled to. This is another area for simplification. So a government committed to the notion of simplification should not have gone down this ponderous track to provide what I say is a very needy sort of benefit to encourage people to move into superannuation. We must encourage that at all costs, but we cannot say that this is the price we have to pay to get a simple income tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue is that there are changes to eligible termination payments, as I have mentioned, increases in the concessions for personal superannuation contributions and changes that ensure that the Income Tax Assessment Act complies as far as possible with the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. Indeed, these are welcome. But there is also a technical correction which requires a new provision in this Act which overcomes deficiencies in relation to the tax file number quotation to a fund in order to comply with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I must not forget to mention the allowance for a tax deduction under section 78 of the Act whereby contributions to eligible charities and institutions, provided the payment by a taxpayer is $2 or more, qualify as eligible tax deductions. This has now been extended to Gifts to the Friends of the Duke of Edinburgh in Australia Award scheme. Also the Government has seen fit to extend by six months, to 31 December this year, deductions for contributions to Australian Vietnam Forces Welcome Home '87 Pty Ltd, the national memorial project. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also provisions exempting from income tax the pay and allowances of members of the Australian defence forces who are allotted for duty in parts of the Middle East. Again, we commend the Government on that particular provision. The last concession, I believe, is the least that we should be doing in respect of any members of our armed forces who are being sent into a possible area of war. The value of a life is inestimable. Therefore, I ask this chamber to take note of the concerns which have been expressed by the Opposition about the need for simplification of the Act and the need to give relief provisions to the hardships that are going to be caused as a result of the changeover legislation governing provisional tax and the need to maintain at all costs the independence of the judiciary of this land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is an omnibus Bill which proposes, amongst other provisions, to exempt from tax the pay and allowances of Defence Force personnel on operational service in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The exemption commences on 2 August 1990 with a total cost of $8.75m projected for 1990-91. As well, it is proposed to relax some parts of the capital gains tax so that where assets are destroyed by a natural disaster the replacement asset may exceed 120 per cent of the value of the destroyed asset, but the replacement must be substantially the same as the original asset. This is certainly a welcome amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the four-year temporary absence rule for principal residences has been increased to six years retrospectively. That is, taxpayers will now be able to rent out their houses for up to six years and still retain exemption from capital gains tax. This will take account of some of the arrangements that people have to make in our society, where people change jobs and move residences considerably frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to make some technical amendments to the treatment of excessive superannuation benefits derived after 1 July 1990. As well, it allows donations of $2 or more to the Friends of the Duke of Edinburgh Award in Australia Inc. made on or after September 1990 to qualify as being tax deductible. In addition, deductibility is extended until 31 September 1990 for two Vietnam forces benefits funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow at this stage that I shall be moving an amendment which will seek to provide this tax deductibility to the Australian Nutrition Foundation Inc. The Foundation is a national non-profit community service organisation incorporated in Canberra in March 1981. It is a unique organisation devoted to promoting the nutritional health of Australians. It operates the national better health program which, amongst others, has identified nutrition as a priority area. I commend that particular amendment to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other provisions in the Bill include a technical amendment concerning the timing of the quotation of a tax file number when receiving a superannuation benefit to reduce the exclusion currently granted to taxation laws under the Sex Discrimination Act. All differences between married and de facto spouses are to be removed, and other discriminatory measures are made gender neutral. An example is the extension of the daughter-housekeeper rebate to include any child who performs housekeeping functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to introduce a penalty for the minimisation of provisional tax by overstating the amount of tax instalment deductions which are expected to be deducted during a year. The penalty is aligned to the recently passed measures imposing provisional tax on salary and wage income where no tax is deducted under the pay as you earn system and, as such, they complete effective provisions in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill proposes to retain the current exemption from fringe benefits tax in respect of child-care facilities that are jointly funded by the Commonwealth Government and employers and to extend it where employers contribute to commercial child-care centres which qualify under the services for families with children program. Extending the fringe benefits tax exemption in this way will amount to an effective subsidy to commercial child-care centres. This exemption can in fact lead to a reduction in community child-care places if businesses purchase existing places. Of course, this is not the fault of the businesses and it would not be appropriate to deny the exemption. In fact, if community-based places are affected and their number is reduced, we must lay the blame at the feet of the Government and seek further effective action in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The major provisions in the Bill concern the taxation treatment of contributions to superannuation funds. For people who have no employer contributions made on their behalf-for instance, self-employed people-and those whose only employer contributions are made under the so-called three per cent award superannuation clause, the existing limit on tax deductible contributions of $3,000 is to be increased to $3,000 plus 75 per cent of contributions in excess of $3,000. The only restriction is that the ultimate superannuation benefit must not be excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were announced in the 1989 Budget and then modified by a press release of 29 June 1990. The press release also introduced a proposal to introduce a limited tax rebate to employees who do not qualify for a tax deduction as stated above, and where the employer support is less than $1,600 per year. This is an additional benefit which should be supported. However, it is targeted to disappear completely when a person earns $31,000, which is only just above average weekly earnings. Our amendment, which shall be moved during the committee stage, aims to relax slightly the targeting so that the rebate disappears when a person earns $35,000 instead of $31,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed relaxation to $35,000 will not affect the maximum limit on the employer superannuation benefit of $1,600. The system of providing such rebates is much more equitable than granting tax deductions and is supported by the Australian Council of Social Service. Maximum assistance can be granted to low income earners as opposed to high income earners who benefit from deductibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also proposing to extend the general anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, part IVa to the proposed rebates mentioned above. This should be supported. However, it seems to be a very partial measure. The Australian Democrats' alternative budget contained the proposal to extend part IVa to all rebates and foreign tax credits. An additional category, which should be scooped up in that way, is the withholding tax and schemes that are employed in that particular area. It is therefore recommended that the Senate supports the Democrats' amendments to broaden the scope of part IVa to include rebates and withholding tax as well as foreign tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IVa is the general anti-avoidance provision of the income tax legislation. It was the high-water mark of John Howard's legislative efforts against tax avoidance-Senator Watson might wish to note that. It has replaced the former provision-section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act-which was completely emasculated by the High Court decision of Sir Garfield Barwick. Ironically, some recent decisions concerning section 260 have actually given the provision the teeth it should always have had. Of course, it now no longer applies as part IVa has replaced it. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IVa has had the desired effect of discouraging most of the blatant artificial tax avoidance schemes. However, its scope is still too limited. As I have said, this Bill proposes to include one type of rebate under its ambit. We propose that all rebates be so included, just as all income and all deductions are included. Furthermore, foreign tax credits should be brought under the general anti-avoidance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Incomes) Bill, which is still to be debated, is absolutely massive. It is essentially an anti-avoidance measure which encourages productive offshore investment. For convenience sake, I propose to move for the inclusion of the foreign tax credits under part IVa of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). </PARA>
<PARA> An area that requires specific comment is the withholding tax. I will be moving amendments to bring in arrangements which attempt to avoid withholding tax under part IVA. The withholding tax has been in the news lately, and the news has not been good. A Melbourne academic, Ms Barbara Smith, has been fighting a battle to try to get a commonly used tax rort ended. The rort involves changing income, which would be subject to ordinary tax rates, into interest income which is supposedly earned by foreign lenders. Such interest is only taxed at 10 per cent. However, often the foreign lender is connected with the Australian resident, so the loan arrangement is merely a device to reduce taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 December 1990, the Australian Taxation Office submitted to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration estimates of revenue losses arising from interest withholding tax schemes. The estimates varied from $100m to over $600m per year. The Tax Office then made the somewhat incredible claim that, since about 50 per cent of the loans involved the largest corporations and some public bodies, these bodies would not risk being involved in questionable schemes. However, when we look at the success of the large corporate audit program being conducted by the Tax Office-it yielded some $600m this year-this is a somewhat bizarre claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Barbara Smith has been pursuing this matter for some time now. She has made submissions to the Committee. She has also provided information to the Tax Office. For her actions to protect the public revenue, she has been subjected to attack and to denigration in public by both a senior officer of the Tax Office, Mr Brian Nolan, and a senior tax professional who willingly admits that he used the device on blatant tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been reported that Ms Smith is merely seeking publicity rather than the resolution of the taxation issues. She has been accused of withholding information from the Tax Office by Mr Nolan and by Mr Liebler-an accusation she vehemently and, I believe, properly denies. Ms Smith has written to Mr Nolan seeking a public statement and a written verification of the fact that any information she has been offered has been immediately given to the Tax Office complete with the provider's name where that has been agreed. No such statement has been provided. In addition, at least one Melbourne tax official has been banned from talking to Ms Smith. In this case, there is no question about illegal transmission of information, merely a ban on a public official speaking to a member of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> That particular official was shifted to another office rather suddenly after he discussed the matter with Barbara Smith. Furthermore, her requests for documents under the Freedom of Information Act are to be referred to head office in Canberra. Senior Melbourne tax officers have refused to comment on this. The journalist, Roger Scott of Sydney's Sun-Herald, has reported this sorry tale, yet we still have had no adequate explanation. Surely Ms Smith is entitled to a public apology from Mr Nolan if his accusations prove groundless. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by summarising the amendments I shall move: firstly, to alter the phase-out of the tax rebate for superannuation contributions to end at $355,000 instead of $31,000; secondly, to extend part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act to apply to all rebates, withholding tax and foreign tax credits; and, thirdly, to grant tax deductibility for donations of $2 or more to the Australian Nutrition Foundation. There was to be a further amendment detailing the substantiation provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is little wonder that the Australian Democrats have so little economic credibility. I was interested to hear Senator Spindler suggest that the rebate phase-out should be extended to $35,000, but I was fascinated that he advanced no particular justification for that. It sounds very much like the Democrats simply are wanting to be a little different. They are trying somehow to suggest some relevance but, more importantly, they did not put any cost on the effect of that initiative. What appalled me more than anything was that he seems to have swallowed the Government line on this whole change and simply picked up, at its most base level, the notion that somehow rebates are better than tax deductions and that that, therefore, leads inexorably to equity in the field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was amazed that Senator Spindler obviously did not have any comprehension of analyses that have been done of this particular initiative. If he had, he would have been acutely aware that the industry has regarded this as a complete disaster from the beginning. The Government has been roundly condemned for its total lack of consultation with the industry prior to the original Budget announcement in 1989. Most importantly, Senator Spindler simply failed to comprehend that the Government has absolutely changed its position. He talked about a slight modification and the introduction of a new rebate system as though this was all part of a positive approach of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened in the 1989 Budget was that we had, in respect of employees with little employer support and those with only award superannuation support, a firm commitment to tax deductibility. That was repeated in the run-up to the last election in the February 1990 Economic Statement. Then, without any warning at all, we had the height of dishonesty in the form of a press release put out by the Treasurer's office a couple of nights before the end of the financial year-on a Friday night after the close of business-to the effect that it would be too complex. This press release was four or five pages in length and was cleverly designed to disguise the fact that it constituted a comprehensive change of the rule. I think that it was probably quite successful in deceiving the financial journalists, because very little was written about it at the time or even subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the matter is that the Government finally announced in that notorious press release a very different proposal which was very narrow in concept; which, for no obvious reason, was targeted at the lower end of the market; and which has-according to CCH Australia Ltd-a number of very substantial inequities. That is why I thought Senator Spindler would have been jumping to his feet about the manifest social injustice of the outcome of this back down. But we did not hear a word of that; we simply heard the simplistic nonsense that, somehow, a rebate is better than a tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just deal with some of the proposals. It is not even clear-or it was not in the initial stages-whether or not one would be entitled to a tax deduction at all. One faced the prospect of waiting until the end of the year to find out whether the average employer contribution was in excess of $1,600. In the event that it was, one dipped out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One had to be part of a scheme, but one was also entirely dependent-in the classic roulette sense-on the activities of others. That meant that one could have faced the worst of all possible outcomes. One would not have got tax deductibility, the contribution would have been made on a false basis, and it would have been preserved until retirement age. So one would have got the worst of all possible worlds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, there has been a subsequent modification so that the test is now based on the prior income year. But I would be fascinated to hear from Senator McMullan in due course about the rationale for this whole structure. Why do we need to have such limitations as $1,600? Why do we need to have this $25,000 to $31,000 area with a cliff over which we fall and miss out completely once we are a dollar over the limit? Indeed, why do we not simply have what the Government's original intention was-that is, deductions available, presumably, to the limit of our reasonable benefit limits?</PARA>
<PARA> We are really talking, by and large, about employees who are very reluctant to make contributions. People are deserting this system in droves. We have got this nonsense of award superannuation which the Government pretends, somehow, covers 80 per cent of the work force. The reality is that something like 80 per cent of awards might have the three per cent written into them, with of course very little in terms of freedom of choice-but that is another debate. If we then look at the extent to which people are actually benefiting from those award entitlements, we find that there is massive non-compliance in the private sector: 60 per cent of private sector employees have no superannuation at all, despite the fact that they have got this nominal entitlement to the 3 per cent. If they realised that they have been diddled in this manner, I am sure they would be screaming. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council of Trade Unions, which represents about one-third of private sector employees, took it upon itself to forgo a wage increase for these low income earners-and of course they had no say in it-on the basis that they would then pick it up by getting the first round 3 per cent. These low income earners have got neither. What a disastrous outcome! Can anyone blame employees for being exceedingly reluctant to get into the business of superannuation? That is what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The only people who are getting the increase are those in the public sector, where something like 90 per cent are actually getting their entitlements. I find it fascinating to look at the correlation between the level of unionisation in the public and private sectors and the extent of award entitlement-not coverage-in those two sectors. We find in the private sector that about 33 per cent of the work force has union coverage and about 40 per cent is getting the award superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the system has been in place since 1986, there is absolutely no sign of the trade union movement doing anything other than wringing its hands. The trade union movement has no incentive to extend it beyond its own membership, other than to talk about perhaps running a test case-I think that was Gary Weaven's best suggestion-or beefing up the inspectorate, which is Senator Cook's preferred option. But other than that, there are crocodile tears. We will continue to find that the vast majority of the private sector will vote with its feet and stay out of award superannuation schemes, at the same time that the award obligation is accruing day by day and has almost reached the $1 billion mark. It is accruing at the rate of about $17m a week, mainly for small businesses that have a very limited capacity to pay that 3 per cent, let alone to backdate it and somehow comply with an award, if they have been in default for some years. I just complete the analogy. According to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, unionisation in the public sector is of the order of 75 per cent and the extent of entitlements is of the order of 90 per cent. So I think that there is a stark correlation there which tells us what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, I would have thought that the Government would be interested in offering tangible incentives to induce low income earners to contribute voluntarily out of their own wage packets. Given that we are now in the recession we had to have, that is not an easy thing to do. Presumably, they are flat out making ends meet. It is not very likely that low income earners will turn around and decide that they have got a greater capacity to make contributions. They are being offered this very limited mickey mouse rebate scheme which is utterly incomprehensible and which, I am sure, will be greeted with the contempt that it deserves. As a result, we will simply have very little drain on the public purse. We are told that this great new initiative will cost something like $145m. I will be very surprised if it costs anything like that, for the simple reason that I cannot see how it is going to be attractive in any way. Let me run through some of these inequities that obviously Senator Spindler is not aware of. As the CCH says:</PARA>
<PARA>From an administrative standpoint there can be no doubt that the new arrangements are far better than the previous arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that is what was foisted on the industry back in August 1989. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The only responsibilities now on funds where all members receive non-award employer support are: to advise members whether or not it is an eligible scheme and, where it is, to preserve the member finance benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>That is great. As far as the funded administrators are concerned, life is a lot easier, and the ferocious behind the scenes struggle to modify these unworkable arrangements has succeeded to that extent. But if we look at the object of the exercise and see who benefits from it, by way of analysis, CCH had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, to achieve that administrative simplicity, substantial areas of inequity, relative to the previous proposals, have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>I run through them:</PARA>
<PARA>Basing the rebate on the average level of support in a scheme can, at best, only produce broad equity. Any members who are denied a rebate because of higher paid or higher support employees in the same scheme or category will feel somewhat cheated. </PARA>
<PARA>Category, as I understand it, is capable of being defined however one likes. On the face of it, one could have each employee in a firm in a separate category. From the employee's point of view, that might be one way of achieving the desired result. But assuming that that is some sort of artificial device and it is going to be caught by the successor to section 260, the name of which I cannot remember any more, then we will find that those employers will be at risk through no fault of their own, through no action over which they have any control. They can simply become ineligible because there are other higher paid employees in the firm who are getting more superannuation benefits and, as a result, the average goes over this magical $1,600 figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the equity in that? Surely if one targets a particular group, one wants to provide it with that benefit and not have it taken away from it by persons and factors outside its control. That is like saying, `We will give you an unemployment benefit unless we decide the Budget deficit is too high, in which case you will forfeit it. Sorry, but that is the way things are. It will automatically operate because of extraneous factors beyond your control'. That would be an outrage under any other system, but that is what is contemplated here. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposition is that an employee with award contributions plus, say, $1,200 a year of non-award superannu- ation support will be treated more favourably for tax purposes than an individual with a similar level of total support, all of which is non-award. There is no logic in that; it is simply an arbitrary and artificial distinction. Thirdly, a large cliff applies to the rebate. If one's non-award super is $1,599, one will get the full rebate; if one is one dollar over that, one will not get any rebate at all. In every other area of the social security system we seem to have phase-out arrangements. I do not know why we do not have them here-presumably because it is all just too difficult and this arbitrary figure has been chosen as a result and will be applied irrespective of the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth example of inequity is that some employees are now entitled to tax deductions for contributions while others are entitled to rebates. The result is not the same. In fact, it is generally more advantageous to be entitled to a rebate, because that is equivalent to a deduction of 40 per cent because a 15 per cent contributions tax does not apply and the contribution counts as undeducted contributions for RBLs and benefits tax purposes. I suppose the Senator Spindlers of this world would say, `That's all right. It is not a level playing field but as long as rebates are better than tax deductions that is fair enough'. It is not fair enough between employees and that is really what we ought to be talking about. Where is the equity in a result of a two-tiered outcome such as that? Again, it is because of factors beyond the control of the employee. It is simply a function of a series of artificial limits imposed by this latest nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth example of manifest inequity is that employees with award-only support and salaries over $31,000 can obtain a tax deduction for personal contributions but no tax concession is available to simi-lar employees with similar support outside the award process. Again, I would be very interested to hear the rationale for that. Employees who do not qualify for a rebate but are members of an eligible scheme will have their contributions preserved despite the fact they received no tax concessions on those contributions. I think I made that point earlier. Some employees will be disqualified from any tax concessions as a result of being a member of a plan which was not an eligible scheme even though the period of membership was very short. Again, for reasons beyond their control, they might miss out altogether, but end up with their contri- butions being tied up although they cannot get any tax concession for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The devastating conclusion is that overall the new arrangements are probably better and fairer than the rules which we have applied up to now. However, the latest announcements remove many of the positive features of the announcements made in last year's Budget. Where is the gain from all that pain? I suppose it is too much to expect that the Government would actually have been honest in its elaboration of the reasons for its back-down. No doubt a gentleman of the stature of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who has all the time in the world to make off-the-cuff pronouncements about how much he would be able to turn the country and the economy around if only he were given unfettered ability and was not constrained by such things as numbers in Caucus, Prime Ministers who have outstayed their welcome, ungrateful media and carping oppositions, would have been able to attend to some of these inequities. But no, the industry constantly tells me-and I presume it also tells Senator McMullan, because I am sure he has consulted widely-that it cannot believe the lack of consultation that goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Senator McMullan has been working on this tax simplification exercise which presumably will involve superannuation simplification in due course. The Government obviously has been sitting on that for some months now, presumably because of the economic statement next February, which at this stage is being vehemently denied but no doubt it is in the course of preparation and we might hear something about it at that time. It is cold comfort for those who had expected that by the time the legislation was introduced we have would been able to evolve a system which was satisfactory and equitable. Instead we have neither. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the two Bills in sequence and speak firstly to the Debits Tax Termination Bill. Firstly, I apologise to the Senate and particularly, in his absence, to Senator Short that the Government's proposed amendment to this Bill was not available to him before he spoke. That was unintended and I apologise for it. The situation was rectified as soon as I found out about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short referred to the arrangements for the transfer and subsequent collection of the tax after it is transferred to the States. The Government amendment will make it clear that the transfer will take place on 1 January. As he indicated, the arrangements for collection, as is authorised by the legislation, will be based on negotiations between the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and the counterpart officers of the State and Territory authorities. All the State and Territory authorities, I understand, except the Australian Capital Territory, have now passed legislation or are at a sufficiently advanced stage to approve the final passage of the necessary legislation. I am advised that the negotiations are proceeding sufficiently for a 1 January start-up in all those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short asked whether there would be a fee for the collection. That is ultimately a question of the outcome of those negotiations, but I would be very surprised if there was not a fee for the provision of service. I am sure the States would be even more surprised. Had Senator Short seen the amendment, I am sure he would have appreciated that. I regret the fact that the amendment was not available to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, I agree with the other part of what he said-but not some of the rhetorical flourishes he put around it-that, while this is not in itself a major change in Commonwealth-State relations, it is an important step in the major process now under way and, both symbolically and of itself, it is a very worthwhile measure and enhancement of Commonwealth-State relations. Apart from saying that, I commend the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990 and reiterate that I will move the Government amendment at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) has a large number of elements and it would be inappropriate in these circumstances to go through a recounting of them all. That was essentially done on behalf of the Government in the second reading speech. Let me deal with some and then with some of the points raised in the debate. In macro terms, it is not a Bill that constitutes any major policy changes. There are a lot of minor matters, which are important to some individuals, but as a matter of macro-economic management or tax policy there are no major changes. There is the implementation of past Budget decisions, particularly with regard to superannuation contributions. The Bill deals with the important although uncontroversial question of the exemption from tax of the pay and allowances of Australian Defence Force personnel involved in the response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. I appreciate the fact that everyone supported that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill modifies the tax laws to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act, which is part of the program to reduce exemptions under that Act. There are a lot of what I would call `minor' measures, although they may be important to many individuals and organisations-for example, those regarding eligible termination payments and the excessive components of those. There is also the fringe benefits tax matter, to which Senator Watson referred, concerning employer child- care contributions; that is, extending that exemption to payments made to a com- mercial child-care centre. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into the Bill itself more than that, and I do not want to pursue Senator Spindler's amendments too much because we will do that in the committee stage. I simply indicate at this stage that we are not supporting any of those amendments, and I will make more detailed comments at the time. We have different levels of opposition to the amendments. Some we oppose because we think it is the wrong way to go about things; others we think are at least premature. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment I would say that we are not persuaded by the third amendment to do with part IVa. It is not that we are opposed to the endeavour in principle, but we are not persuaded that it is necessary or even useful. With an already complex piece of legislation, adding further proposals and propositions where to us there is no apparent benefit is, we think, inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say something about the question of simplification. It got a couple of honourable mentions. Without disclosing anything, can I say that a very little patience will do a bit of good on that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will even have $100 a day for you on that. I cannot say much more about that. It is not my prerogative, but it sounds like it could be a very profitable day for me if only I could get some takers. There were some important questions raised by senators, and I want to deal with those a little more seriously than in that throwaway line, which I did enjoy and the significance of which will be apparent to all honourable senators in the not too distant future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson raised a couple of questions about provisional tax changes. While I share his proper concern for the independence of the judiciary, I for one have never felt that that independence was dependent upon their independence from the tax system. I continue to have that view. The provisional tax system will catch a large number of people. There is a need for appropriate transitional arrangements. They are being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Judges are not unique in that sense. If they in the main are making sensible and appropriate arrangements to pay in the same manner as all other Australians have been required to pay for many years, I do not think it is appropriate that we make special arrangements for them. But I think that it is necessary and appropriate that they and others who confront transitional problems with what is, I think, an entirely appropriate change, not targeted at judges, should make other accommodations such that in future I expect the outcome to be appropriate. In my view, a much more important point that Senator Watson raised was the potential of adverse consequences for pensioners and other people like them. I am somewhat more concerned about their economic circumstances than those of judges. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson would know this, but can I just say for the record that nobody who receives any of the pensioner rebate will be paying provisional tax. Any person who gets any part of that rebate is exempt from paying provisional tax. That remains the case. That does not cover every aged person, but it covers all people in that category. I think that is appropriate. I am advised that for 1990-91 pensioners are exempted from paying provisional tax where their 1989-90 taxable income was, for single pensioners, less than $15,667. I understand that Senator Watson raised another example and that some individuals-not pensioners in the sense to which I am referring-can still be--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was only saying for the record that I understand that what I am saying does not contradict what Senator Watson said. I just wanted to make sure that there was no misunderstanding by anybody who may have the misfortune to have to read all this. I expect that there will be a very small number of people reading it, possibly none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we are dealing with that matter, it is important to say that, obviously, we cannot bring in a measure that will raise a large amount of revenue and have nobody worse off. Obviously, as a matter of logic, it is not possible. It is conceivable that in all such changes some individuals may be adversely affected in the transition either because of the way the provisional tax in this instance falls upon them in the first year of its operation or because it takes them a while to restructure their financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say as a generality, particularly with regard to judges, that if any individual finds himself significantly adversely affected in a manner other than that intended by the legislation-that is, he is not adversely affected simply because he has been caught doing something he should not have been doing; I am talking about honest taxpayers who are suffering a short term inconvenience because of transitional arrangements-I simply suggest that he take up the standing opportunity to consult with the Australian Taxation Office about arrangements that might ease that problem for him if he is confronting it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to pursue every rabbit that Senator Alston sent running down several burrows in the course of his rather discursive contribution. It did seem to me to have some problems within it. I understand that the Opposition's role is to raise a lot of questions-and there is nothing wrong with that-but yesterday I was involved in a debate here in which Senator Boswell said that all these small businesses were going broke because of superannuation payments. Now we find that Senator Watson says that none of them are paying them. They cannot both be right. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also had two questions being pursued about simplicity, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the need sometimes in the pursuit of that to have what otherwise are arbitrary arrangements and limits. It is true that from time to time there is in tax, as in everything else, a trade-off between the several objectives of equity, efficiency and simplicity. We all know that. It is a question that has been the subject of debate in every forum in which tax is discussed. To make the point that those three things involve a trade-off is to make no new point at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has spent five years of tax reform essentially concentrating on equity, and we certainly intend to try to maintain that priority. But it is appropriate that a large number of people approach us about the simplicity question, particularly with regard to superannuation. That is a complex matter which is difficult to resolve. It will take quite some time. We will always need to weigh all those factors in the equation. I do agree with the part of Senator Alston's contribution in which he read from CCH saying that current arrangements under this will be better and fairer than those which previously existed. I think that is important and correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other overall points that I feel need to be made in this debate relate to Senator Spindler's Blue Hills saga about Ms Smith. I do not wish to say too much about it. We have all had a few goes at debating this around the Parliament and publicly. I simply say that it does not enhance public debate to believe every rumour that one hears, even if it is a rumour which, if true, would make it easier to balance one's notional budget. If there were $1 billion dollars out there that one could get back to balance the notional budget so much more easily, that would not make the rumour true. Governments and in fact parties which aspire to government need to deal with facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was being generous to Senator Alston. That is very rare, I know, and I do not blame him for missing it, but that was my intention at the time. I do not want to pursue that; it is a fair way away from this Bill. I will say a bit more about it when I say why I do not support the Australian Democrats' amendment. I simply say that in fact the Martin committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Fin- ance and Public Administration, is conducting a very important inquiry that incorporates an examination of that, and the Commissioner of Taxation went before the Committee quite recently and it seems to me, from what I have been able to glean of what was said by him and to him, that the matter has been put in a much clearer and more objective light now than previously. I do not think we want to pursue that tangent any further here. I will make my comments in detail on amendments in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson raised the question of assessable income. To make sure there is no misunderstanding, I want to say something about that. Senator Watson is correct-the income test threshold for the new superannuation rebate is based on assessable income and not taxable income. This provides a much simpler test. It is easier to measure, and for the people targeted for the rebate it is not expected that there will be a significant variation between the two, so we opted for that. But he is correct and I thank him for drawing it to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important in regard to another point, too, which we will come back to in the committee stage. It is important to realise that the cut-off figures-for example, the $25,000-are cut-off figures for assessable income, which is different from salary. So if we are trying to make an average weekly earnings cut-off, we do not want it to be the same level as it would be for assessable income. The distinction is important. I will not labour that; the logic is obvious. I simply want to put it on the record in this second reading debate. I thank honourable senators for their support for the legislation. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats have attempted to add a very worthy body, the Australian Nutrition Foundation Inc., to the very long list of eligible organisations and institutions whereby taxpayers who contribute by way of donation to these particular bodies, providing the donation is of $2 or more, can obtain tax relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have reservations as to the particular technique that has been used in these circumstances whereby we have members of an upper House in a minority position trying to impose their Budget priorities on a properly elected Government from the lower House.

As it is not the House of government, we must discharge our responsibilities to ensure that the legislation is correct and does not infringe on personal liberties and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> To start having a Dutch auction as to who can provide the greatest list or the most qualified institutions or bodies for section 78 deductions I do not think is appropriate.

There are numerous occasions on record where the Opposition has moved amendments to the Budget provisions of the Government of the day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Opposition, the Government will not be supporting this amendment, as I indicated before. There are essentially two reasons. The Australian Nutrition Foundation wrote to me about this matter and I have already advised it-in fact, on 20 August-that there is very little prospect of the income tax gift provisions being amended to include that body. That is a statement I could make about hundreds of very worthy organisations in Australia, many of which I am a member. That does not mean that those organisations ought to receive tax deductibility for donations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very fine mesh that is put across this particular channel to protect it from the thousands of bodies which seek tax deductibility for donations to them. That is not to say that the bodies that do not receive this tax deductibility are less worthy than many of those that do. The history of this section has been riddled over the years with anomalies. Anybody who is prepared to delve into those is much braver than I am or anybody I have ever met. It is important, therefore, that we keep a discipline in the manner in which we deal with these matters. The fundamental premise of the Government in dealing with this matter is virtually that there are no new bodies admitted. We start from that premise and very occasionally vary it at the margin for special cases. That will continue to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government felt that the Australian Nutrition Foundation was playing a role of such importance that it ought to receive government support, then the most appropriate thing to do would be to make a grant to it in the Budget. If the Government wants to give taxpayers' money to some other organisation-there is nothing wrong with that and we do it often; there are grants-in-aid under very many Acts of Parliament-it ought to be done explicitly and transparently and through legislation. The Government will not be agreeing to this or any similar proposals that bob up out of debate generally. We try to give consideration to the bodies that write to us and do not just reject them as a matter of course, but it is very rare that one gets through the mesh. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion, however, as I said in my letter to the Nutrition Foundation, that it is quite possible that there will be circumstances in which gifts made to it may still qualify for a deduction. Depending upon the circumstance in which the taxpayer carrying on a business makes that gift, it could well be said to have a relationship with the production of a taxpayer's assessable income. That applies to all organisations, and they ought not to fail to take that possibility into account in seeking support. The Government does not consider it appropriate to add in an ad hoc and random manner bodies such as this to the section 78 exemption, and we will be opposing the amendment accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA>I have adverted before to the purpose of this clause: that is, to increase the taper so that income levels of $35,000 still receive part of the rebate. In putting forward this amendment, I acknowledge part of what Senator Alston said-that it was generally acknowledged at the time that the original proposals included in the Government's Budget were unworkable. We have had some considerable discussions with industry representatives and, as a result of those consultations, have agreed that the original intention of the Government must be varied. Consequently we agree in principle with the rebate system, for the reason to which I have previously adverted: organisations concerned about low income earners believe-and it is been demonstrated-that rebates are much more equitable than tax deductions, which benefit high income earners first and foremost. If Senator Alston has uncovered so many complaints-most of which, as I said, we would agree with-I suggest that he join us in moving amendments to improve the legislation so that we get a workable system, something that is better than the Government has been able to put forward so far. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debates about somewhat arbitrary limits-such as whether a cut-off point should be at $25,000 worth of assessable income or whether the phase-out should be at 30c in the dollar or 50c-are always difficult because it is very rare that we have the comfort of secure, agreed objective criteria. We all have to make best estimates and ask: what is a reasonable balance between equity, simplicity and revenue implications? That is always a question of judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most fundamental thing about this amendment is that there is not one skerrick of evidence to say that the $35,000 cut-off point has any greater merit than $31,000. I am not trying to lift $31,000 to some element of objective purity; it is a best estimate, working from the $25,000 starting figure for the phase-out. As I said, it is assessable income, not salary, so it relates to a somewhat higher salary level than $25,000, but it is not possible immediately to say what that will be. </PARA>
<PARA> With that starting point, the 50c in the dollar was a simple calculation. It always seems to be a fair starting point. In certain circumstances there may well be a case for varying it, but I think the onus of proof is why it should be varied. I do not share a lot of the views expressed by Senator Alston about the proposal as a whole. I was tempted to make a somewhat longer contribution in the second reading debate on what he had to say. I think some of his criticisms of that part of the amendment are valid. There would be a higher revenue cost for this concession if we extended it. It is not possible immediately to put a value on that, but it is evident there would be some cost. There is no objective evidence to say that the figure selected is in any way superior or more appropriate than that which has been set in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to proceed on the basis of the understanding that the industry and the affected individuals have. Should subsequent evidence indicate that an alternative level would deliver a more appropriate result, we will deal with that problem when it arises. We cannot all guess and have a `pin the tail on the donkey' game in the Committee. We have to proceed on the basis of sensible balanced estimates of the various factors. The best estimate we can make is that this phase-out is the most appropriate. I urge the Committee to stick with the proposal put forward in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments seek to apply part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act to foreign tax credits, rebates and the withholding tax. The Government has put superannuation rebates under part IVa. If that is desirable policy, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) why the remainder of the rebates should not be placed under the ambit of part IVa. I believe that we have ample evidence that tax avoidance schemes are rife and are costing taxpayers billions of dollars. We should give the Commissioner of Taxation every possible tool we can to enable the Australian Taxation Office to do its job. As I have mentioned before, part IVa has replaced the former provision-section 260, which has proved to be very effective in its rejuvenated form. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it somewhat difficult to relate all the changes in the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) which we are now debating in the committee stage. I believe it is another unfortunate example of tacking on something which the coalition disapproves of. That occurred in the debate earlier today. The Opposition took great exception to tacking on, or piggybacking, unrelated issues to the Bills before the Senate. I believe that Senator Spindler, inappropriately, is trying to impose some features in this legislation in what could be described as the Australian Democrats' alternative Budget. I believe that a better procedure than the one that he has attempted to adopt today would be for the Australian Democrats to introduce their own private member's Bill to effect the sorts of amendments that they are seeking to put in place today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(6.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated previously, the Government will not be supporting this body of amendments-not because we are any less concerned about tax avoidance than the Australian Democrats but because, on the best analysis we can make, we cannot find the tax avoidance with which they are trying to deal. If we extended part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act to all rebates, withholding tax and foreign tax credits, it would be hard to find a circumstance in which any avoidance scheme under any of those arrangements would not already be covered, because we would be creating a situation in which what should otherwise be assessable income is no longer assessable income, and that ought to be able to be dealt with under part IVa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators would know, there are four broad categories of rebate in the income tax law which might be affected by this extension. The first covers those given to people because of their particular circumstances, such as the dependent spouse rebate. On the face of it this is not likely to be the subject of tax avoidance arrangements; if it is, we do not think part IVa is the best solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The second type of rebate, which is not quite so common, is designed to encourage people to incur expenditure on particular activities that the Parliament has determined from time to time to be worth while or desirable. For example, it may be a rebate to encourage people to invest in a particular type of company. An extension of part IVa to cover these rebates would seem inappropriate if it prevented people from entering into what might be called arrangements to take advantage of such rebates. That is what we want them to do in respect of those sorts of rebates. We want them to invest in those things and take advantage of the rebates. It means that there is more expenditure in the area affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category covers rebates given to taxpayers with a particular type of income-that is, the rebate for dividends received by companies. If, under this heading, people are entering into arrangements to substitute what is really a particular type of income with a type of income that is rebatable, it would be our expectation and understanding that part IVa would apply to that already. So we do not see under that extension that there is any potential for tax avoidance that is not already covered. </PARA>
<PARA> If the concern is that the payment of withholding tax on interest and dividend income is being avoided, once again it is not apparent why part IVa would not already apply. Similarly, under the foreign tax credit arrangements, if one wants to obtain credit it is necessary to obtain some foreign income. If foreign income is being substituted for other non-rebatable income that should have been included in accessable income, part IVa would cover such a situation already. </PARA>
<PARA> So our view at the moment is that the amendments are well intentioned but do not achieve any public policy purpose. If the Democrats, their advisers or the people who put this proposal before them have some evidence that would indicate that some extension of part IVa is necessary to deal with a tax avoidance problem of which they are aware and we are not, I would appreciate it if this could be brought to our attention. The objective is appropriately stated. I simply think the amendments do not achieve the objective and, therefore, we oppose them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating as allied Bills the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990. The two Bills which relate to resources will be dealt with by Senator Parer; that is, the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990. I will be taking the first Bill listed, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, this Bill contains eight sections and amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Schedule 1 reduces the rate of duty for articles of vulcanised rubber from the current 2 per cent to a free rate of duty. Schedule 2 amends the subheading `Description of certain fabrics' and extends the scope of item 41a of Part III in schedule 4 to include lightweight wool fabrics. Schedule 3 omits and inserts a new item 44 to extend this item to goods of New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Forum Islands and developing country origin. Schedule 4 removes items made redundant due to the sunset entry provisions having expired on the 31 December 1989. These items were part of the chemical and plastics industries assistance arrangements announced by the Government in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The deletion of New Zealand rates of duty from heading 5903, the incorporation of badges, labels, logos and such in apparel without the application of separate tariff agreements and the putting in place of the tender quota rates for textiles, clothing and footwear goods are contained in schedule 5. Schedule 6 deletes redundant duty rates where phasing rates have been implemented and closes subheadings where common rates of duty have been reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 7 revokes an item which allowed duty free entry of goods for Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities. Amongst the changes in schedule 8 is a change to duty free entry for protein concentrate, coal tar and pitch, an amendment to the treatment of ride-on motor mowers, and the assignment of a more specific description of certain goods of cardboard and paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these changes are minor or administrative; some of them are long overdue. They correct anomalies such as existed in the case of ride-on mowers, and particularly in reference to imported light weight woollen fabrics. Wool is a matter of great importance at present with the difficulties in selling the product overseas. It is certainly very much in Australia's interest to promote the use of wool in whatever way we can. In recent years, with the development of lightweight wool-which is a high quality product used both in male and female clothing-there has been a very longstanding anomaly where we have had a high rate of duty on the importation of these lightweight wool fabrics, which has put an unnecessary penalty on our manufacturing industry. That has now been removed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Two aspects of the Bill that I wish to comment on very briefly are the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) quota schedule and the matter that relates to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities not being able to get goods in free of customs duty, as has been the case up to the present. In financial terms, special attention to the textiles, clothing and footwear related changes is pertinent because of the value of the tender allocation for 1990-91, which has been raised by 20 per cent above the 1989-90 levels. Increased imports are expected to raise an additional $101.6m in customs revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased tender allocation is in line with the textiles, clothing and footwear plan introduced on 1 March 1989, the objective of which is to encourage industries that are efficient, internationally competitive and export oriented and make them less reliant on community support within Australia. The Liberal Party and the National Party support this objective. We would like to see the textiles, clothing and footwear plan accelerated, at least to the extent that quotas are abolished ahead of schedule. The Industry Commission (IC) has estimated that the cost of tariff quotas is equivalent to an estimated 40 per cent consumption tax on TCF products which are produced by a fragmented sector in Australia. In 1987 there were over 3,000 enterprises involved in the textiles, clothing and footwear sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The assistance levels given to the textiles, clothing and footwear sector are the highest for Australian manufacturing industry. The cost of this protection to the consumer is estimated to be around $1 billion per annum. It is worth observing that a large part of that is essential expenditure; some of it certainly is discretionary with respect to some garments. Everyone has to be clothed and everyone has to be shod, and an extra $1 billion, particularly on the poorer sections of the community-the less well off-is a very significant impost. </PARA>
<PARA> The great impact that this high level of tariff protection for the textiles, clothing and footwear industry imposes on the Australian community is not often noted in the cost of living assessments in Australia. The IC estimated that the average effective rate of protection on the textile segment was 74 per cent in 1988-89, or roughly 4 1/2 times the average for manufacturing industry. It was 150 per cent for the clothing industry and in excess of 200 per cent for footwear. That is more than 12 times the average for Australian manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the TCF plan is to force the restructuring of this sector to open it up to the reality of competition. It is very interesting that, despite all the doom and gloom talked about the TCF plan by some sectors in the past-to the effect that any let-up in the levels of tariff protection would spell the end of the industry-the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority made the following comment in its 1990 report on the state of the industry:</PARA>
<PARA>Significantly, the adjustment pressure of the past year has arisen largely because of adverse economic conditions and the abrupt ending of a prolonged period of demand growth in the TCF industries. Any effects attributable to the TCF plan have only been minor to date. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that the textiles, clothing and footwear industry needs to be restructured. That restructuring means increasing the use of advanced technology and more effective work management practices. </PARA>
<PARA> During the first 11 months of 1989-90 the total value of clothing imports was 20 per cent higher than a year earlier. Imports from Fiji jumped by more than 40 per cent while imports from New Zealand jumped by 78 per cent, a consequence of the closer economic relations agreement. The biggest surge in clothing imports this financial year came from China, which lifted its exports of apparel and clothing accessories to Australia by 25 per cent in the first 11 months of last year. Over the same period, TCF exports rose by 120 per cent-from $651.1m to $1,636.5m. Two years before in 1987 this export component represented about 5 or 6 per cent of total production. It is interesting to note our place in the global market. In 1986-87 Australia ranked thirty-eighth on the world textile exporting scale and fifteenth on the world textile importing scale. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason for those involved in the textiles, clothing and footwear sector to fear lower levels of tariff protection. Provided relevant and intelligent changes are made to the industry, it will not only survive but also prosper. But it will be very different from what it is today; there will be different people in it and they will be doing different things. </PARA>
<PARA> From a national point of view, it is quite incredible that there is so little pro- cessing of the natural fibres that we produce in this country-namely, wool and cotton. There is very real financial gain in sending wool and cotton out of Australia other than in wool bales or cotton bales. If we can process the fibre further we do make very significant value added gains to the Australian economy. If we are going to do that there will have to be some significant changes in our union-dictated work practices so that the most efficient technology can be installed and that technology can be used efficiently. Any sort of further processing is of benefit to us even if it is only a first step towards manufactured garments. We ought to be aiming to go as far down the chain as is possible. We certainly ought to be weaving and preparing our own fabrics and we ought to be looking at using those fabrics, probably the high quality ones, in manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as the 1950s and the 1960s this country produced the finest wool suitings in the world. The Yarra Falls men's suitings, for example, were world famous. Today we produce very little in the way of fabrics. The reason we do not produce them is simply the self-indulgent work practices we follow. Modern automatic weaving machines are very expensive and they can be made to pay only if they run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is 168 hours a week-not the 36 hours at best that they do at present. The union movement, of which the Australian Labor Party is the parliamentary wing, will not allow what is only economic commonsense to take place. So we end up producing the natural fibres and having to buy the manufactured fabrics back in from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> We can never match the very low wage structure of Third World countries, particularly in the mass production of garments. It is therefore incumbent on us to exploit what advantage we have in being the source of the natural fibres and exploiting fully the benefits of advanced technology to develop particular sections of the textiles and clothing industry. If we do that, and we can do that successfully, we will see an expansion of the industry within Australia. For these reasons the Liberal Party and the National Party support this Bill. We are committed to a phased and predictable reduction in protection, alongside structural reforms in areas such as the labour market and the transport and telecommunications section. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to raise concerns the amendments to schedule 4 of this Bill. The amendments to schedule 4 relate to the imposition of a charge equal to customs duty on imports. In his second reading speech the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This change places public service managers on the same footing as private enterprise managers whereby purchasing decisions will be made on the full duty paid price. </PARA>
<PARA>The argument behind that is that it puts imported goods for Government departments on precisely the same plane, on a level playing field-to use the cliches of today-as Australian industry. On the surface, it is a very attractive move. The reality of the situation is that those benefits may well be quite illusory. In the first place, Australian Government departments do not pay customs duty; they pay a fee said to be equivalent to that. The compilation of that fee will be based purely on the nominal rates of customs duty for those goods. It will not have to include any of the economic hedging that has to be built into a customs agent's fees to cover the liability for incorrect description of goods or things such as that, for which the Government has now very heavily penalised any misstatements. The actual payment of the fee will not be quite equivalent to what private industry will face. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it really is a little bit nonsensical to say that the Government will be in a zero cost operation. One of the objections has been from the Department of Defence, which finds that it has a very heavy import bill. It has protested, and protested publicly, about the imposition of this move. The Government has said, `We'll make a transfer by the Department of Finance for the costs involved so that, at the end of the day, the Department of Defence does not suffer any financial penalty for this change to the Act'. That is really a very glib bureaucratic answer to the problem. Every time the Commonwealth Government puts its sticky fingers on money it costs the taxpayers money. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Department of Defence, or any other Commonwealth department, will have to pay this fee equivalent to customs duty, it will have to create its own empire which it will have to staff with personnel and resources. There is a considerable cost in that. The fee is then added on to the value of the goods. It is ultimately reimbursed by the Department of Finance to the extent that the Department is out of pocket on the whole thing. It is all pointless; it is just building costs into government administration. We will not quibble with that point and we certainly will not oppose that clause of the Bill. On behalf of the Liberal and National parties I wish the Bill a speedy passage. We will be supporting the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats with respect to the reduction and elimination of duty on certain classes of goods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 and cognate Bills. This Bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The principal amendments are: the removal of duty on certain articles of rubber apparel, protein concentrates, coal, tar, pitch and certain tractors; and removal of the exemption of duty-free entries of goods for Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities. It does not reduce new tender duty rates for certain goods in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries from 1 March 1990 extending to 22 February 1991 as part of the long term plan in the TCF industries to reduce tariffs over time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The levels of assistance for TCF industries are the highest in Australian manufacturing. The Industry Commission has estimated that the cost to consumers of protection to the industry is approximately $1 billion per annum. The plan was introduced on 1 March 1989 and is scheduled to run to June 1995. Its stated aim is to make TCF industries more competitive internationally by restructuring through such measures as a gradual removal of tariff quotas, positive assistance programs for industry restructuring and a shift to a tariff-only system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some evidence that the textiles, clothing and footwear industries are currently in a fairly bad way. There is no doubt that high interest rates, the high dollar and an Australian economy in recession have added to the problems faced by the industry. But there also seems to be a fair amount of evidence that the industry is a little sluggish in taking up the opportunities offered by the plan. I note an article in the Australian Financial Review of 16 October in which Julie Power points out that the response by the industry to positive assistance programs has indeed been lethargic. The strategies are designed to improve performance, accelerate restructuring and boost export opportunities. The available assistance includes the provision of highly subsidised overseas trips to learn export marketing skills. These had to be axed after very poor attendance at the first course. </PARA>
<PARA> Another initiative was the offer of an accountant from Price Waterhouse to assist with export and domestic cost structures at the cost of $200 per day compared with the normal rate of $1,200 per day. As it happened, not one company took up the offer. This appears to show a complete lack of commitment by most of the industry to taking on board the aims of the TCF plan. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we should not be too hasty. If a plan is not working and people are not taking up the offers being made, the question inevitably arises: has the Government chosen the right policy initiatives? Has it made the right offers? Do they really suit this particular industry? It is fairly clear that, as we move into the next decade, we must achieve an economy that is self-sufficient and sustainable. We will not do that if we demolish all our home-grown industries, particularly the textile industry, which, to such a large extent, is dependent on the wool that our primary industry is producing. The aim of the textile industry and indeed of the Government should be to increase the amount of wool that we can process in our country rather than import carpets, apparel and other items, which means that we ship the raw material overseas, people are then employed in foreign countries, and we ship back the finished products. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we judge the industry too harshly and reduce tariffs too quickly, we should review the activities that the Government has offered to the industry. We should review the whole strategy of the plan. It appears from the very indifferent performance so far that the plan requires thorough review before we kill off our industries, put our people out of employment and further damage our primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the amendments circulated in my name. They sought to implement the recommendations made in the Industry Commission report No. 3 dated 18 July 1990, entitled Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities. This report recommends changes to the tariffs applying to aids and appliances used by disabled people. In fact, most disability equipment is free of duty, either substantially or through tariff concessions. Major exceptions are wheelchairs and pacemakers, as well as mass produced orthopaedic footwear and incontinence aids. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments that were circulated to lower the tariffs on those items received a positive response from the Government. I am in possession of a customs order to take effect from 1 January next year that states that wheelchairs, pacemakers and defribillators are made free of customs duty, at a somewhat more accelerated rate than I suggested in my amendment. I thank the Minister responsible for taking that action. It is extremely appropriate. In view of that, I now give notice that I withdraw my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two items that the Government has not taken on board in its commitment. These are the orthopaedic footwear and incontinence aids. Having had some consultations on those items with the Department, I accept that there are some difficulties in this area and that these matters will be picked up early in the new year. If the Government does not move I will, of course, reintroduce my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> But I am gratified that the Government has taken this action, and I thank the Opposition for its preparedness, as Senator MacGibbon announced in his speech, to support my amendments. I believe that we must take account of the needs of disabled people. I remind the Senate once again of the John Rolls principle: that a community is judged by the way it treats its most disadvantaged members. I believe that this is a very gratifying outcome to the amendments I have attempted to introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to one of the other Bills which we are debating as an allied Bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990. This Bill has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and after a couple of meetings the situation now is that the Australian Democrats will support it. The issue that is raised by the Bill is the acknowledged retrospectivity of the Government's attempts in that Bill to rectify a drafting mistake which happened in 1984. It is acknowledged without a doubt that retrospectivity is to be avoided wherever possible. However, there are obvious exceptions, and I point to the fact that one Bill, which makes similar provisions and will come before the Senate shortly, and which will be passed, I understand, by all parties without dissent, retrospectively ensures that weapons, guns, landmines and other equipment which is currently held by the Australian Customs Service, under admittedly defective legislation, is not released into the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill we are dealing with a similar situation. The claim by Esso-BHP for the return of funds which it has paid as an excise on oil between 1984 and 1990, since amended to a lesser amount for just 12 months-the total amount would have been $200m and the lesser amount is approximately $30m-rests on a draftsman's error. In the legislation which was introduced in 1984, by-law 78 was repealed but the effect of the by-law which the Minister intended to continue was not transposed in the legislation. There is ample evidence of the intention of the Minister to do so. There are press statements, second reading speeches and explanatory memoranda which state very clearly that the classification of the oil which attracts the higher excise should not be reviewed. Nevertheless, by the omission of the relevant words, on a strict legal interpretation, oil produced since 1984 would be classified as new oil and under these circumstances BHP would be entitled to receive $30m of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that we should take account of the substance of the legislation, which is clearly demonstrated by the documents supporting the Minister's intention at the time. We believe that we should not allow a drafting mistake to remove $30m in funds from the public purse. We believe that this is a case where the party paying the higher level of excise has not done it in any way under protest or under the assumption that it has been paying a wrong amount. During the committee proceedings I pushed that question quite clearly. I asked whether there had been a very specific protest in relation to the payment of the higher excise and the answer, as the Hansard will reveal, was quite clearly no. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that non-protest necessarily means that the taxpayer, in this case Esso-BHP, has agreed to the payment of the higher excise. However, it is evidence of the fact that at the time and during the whole period between 1984 and March 1990 all parties were of the view that the legislation was in place which obliged Esso-BHP to pay the higher excise. During all of that time Esso-BHP has proceeded in business and has no doubt taken account of that liability in calculating its costs and managing its business. It is perhaps instructive to look briefly at the profits made by that company in those 10 years. They range from $200m in 1980 to $492m in 1985, and to $395m in 1990. I advert to these figures only to show that the taxpayer did not suffer any deprivation in that period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not immaterial because the situation would be different if the legislation were changed in substance and if the taxpayer had been severely disadvantaged in the intervening period. That obviously is a factor that would go to whether or not an exception to retrospectivity should be made. As I have said previously, exceptions to retrospectivity have been agreed to on previous occasions and the Opposition is going to agree to one in the current session of Parliament. Clearly it is not a situation where retrospectivity is, of itself, abhorrent. It is as a general principle, but there are exceptions. In our view, this is one such exception and I am sure that my colleague Senator Coulter will go further into the detail of this Bill and the reason for our stance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating as allied Bills the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990. The Middle East is in turmoil over oil and as a result we are seeing world peace balanced at this stage on a knife edge. The Middle East conflict has had a dramatic effect on the cost of petroleum and petroleum products in Australia. The West Texas intermediate crude oil price has risen from around $21 per barrel in August to settle at $27 today, having peaked at around $40.65 in mid-October. It is in this volatile climate that further adjustments are being made to our own petroleum industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 10 October, has three parts. The first part seeks to make a number of amendments consequential to the introduction of separate volume weighted average of realised (VOLWARE) prices for different oilfields. It is consequential to amendments contained in the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990. The second part of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill relates to the adjustment of the excise duty for naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas. The third part deals with the definition of new and old oil and has complex and far-reaching ramifications for the oil industry. I intend to deal at length with this aspect of the Bill, but first I will deal with the first two aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the first part of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 also relates to the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 and it seeks to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987. The principal Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act applies to offshore areas producing excisable petroleum and, as such, has been confined to Bass Strait. The Opposition is not opposed to the legislation in the broad sense. However a number of aspects do give us concern and should be thoroughly debated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative that the oil industry is given as much encouragement as possible to step up its exploration for oil in Australia. Sadly, encouragement has been lacking in recent years and our oilfields which supply our domestic oil are in decline. This must be reversed. The oil industry is on the horns of a dilemma. The view has been taken that Australia is not a very prospective area. The attitude of people such as Senator Cook, when he was Minister for Resources, was to make the best of the secondary taxes while they were available. </PARA>
<PARA> If, on the other hand, Australia is considered to be prospective, complex secondary taxes are imposed by governments just in case someone makes a major discovery. Whatever the scenario, it is a no-win situation for oil explorers but, more importantly, it is a no-win situation for Australia as complex secondary tax regimes drive explorers and potential explorers to countries other than Australia. It is the recent view of oil geologists that prospective basins in Australia are under-explored when compared with similar structures overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of the arguments mounted for secondary taxes, the major reason for the relatively low level of oil exploration in Australia is undoubtedly the tax regime as compared with other countries. As our domestic oil reserves continue to dwindle, that regime must change by necessity. With limited capital and competing ends for that capital, it is inevitable that it will be directed to the most attractive competitor. Decisions which have to be made on that basis will always be costs, markets and perceived political stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I continue, I must clarify that the two Bills we are debating today are separate from the resource rent tax which, if passed by the Parliament, will be extended to Bass Strait from 1 July 1990, replacing the current excise and royalty regime. As a transitional arrangement, the Bass Strait producers will continue to be liable for excise and royalty until the amending legislation is enacted. The Bills we are debating relate to the three areas that I have mentioned previously, which I will expand on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 provides for onshore oilfields to pay excise if the oilfield exceeds the $30m threshold. This part of the Bill also provides the facility for calculating different volume weighted average of realised prices for sales of crude oil from different oil producing regions. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> Just before the quorum was called I was talking about VOLWARE. This amendment anticipates that Jackson oilfield will exceed 30 million barrels early in 1991, so production above this limit would be excisable. The coalition has been advised, however, that no excise will ever be recovered from Jackson because production is expected to fall lower than the approximately three million barrel annual limit below which no excise is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition-the Liberal and National parties-do not oppose the intent of this legislation. However, we do not agree with the proposition as it stands that the legislation be retrospective to the end of 1987. The Government argues that this is to save the publication of a Commonwealth of Australia Gazette item dealing with VOLWARE prices for an interim period for Bass Strait. To date, no oilfield has produced beyond the 30 million barrel threshold, except Bass Strait and that is covered by the original Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is now trying to legislate because the Jackson field might reach the first requirement of 30 million barrels. Surely it would be far better in that case to make the commencement for this provision at some date in the future, not from 1987 because it brings in the retrospectivity element.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no justification for making this Bill retrospective. It would make far more sense to make payment for this excise prospective from the date of royal assent; there is no monetary effect involved. Consequently, I foreshadow that the Opposition will move an amendment in the committee stage of the Bill to ensure that this aspect of the legislation commences from the date of royal assent-that it is prospective, not retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is to increase the rate of excise on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This is adjusted each year on 1 April and 1 October in accordance with the liquefied petroleum gas excise policy announced in April 1980. It is not our intention to interfere in any way with the LPG changes in the legislation. The excise rate will be amended with effect from 1 April 1990 from zero to $5.78 per kilolitre. The increase reflects the higher export prices obtained for LPG over the six months to March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The third part of this legislation gives the Opposition grave concern. Indeed, what the Government has tried to pass through the Parliament should be of concern to every senator and anyone who does business with this Government. The Government says it is moving to correct what the Minister calls a technical error-this was regurgitated earlier by Senator Spindler-to the definition of new oil. However, its course of action in remedying it has serious ramifications, as the classification of oil from the 10-year-old Tuna oilfield in Bass Strait has been the subject of a dispute between the joint partners-BHP, Esso and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Crude oil is categorised as old or new oil, depending on when the oilfield was discovered and brought into production. The definition of new oil was altered in 1984 and because of the Government's legislative inefficiencies it has come to light that the previous amendment had an unintended effect; that is, to allow some oilfields that had previously been classified under an excise by-law as old oil to be classified as new oil. Right from the word go it was new oil-and I do not think anyone will dispute that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt the Government has handled the Tuna L oilfield in Bass Strait in a very clumsy manner. It has tried to deal with a very complex issue using piecemeal legislation. In this legislation it has tried to retrospectively legislate away the rights of the Bass Strait partners. But worse, it also intended to use its legislative powers to interfere with the course of hearings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which is the body empowered to consider these disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> This is contrary to the longstanding view of the Liberal and National parties that the Commonwealth should not legislate against potentially adverse findings of bodies who have been empowered to resolve such matters, still less try to change the effect of judicial determinations once made-a very important point. At this point I cite the fifth edition of Odgers, which quotes Jordan J. in Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd: Re Truth and Sportman Ltd and another:</PARA>
<PARA>It is of extreme public interest that no conduct should be permitted which is likely to prevent a litigant in a court of justice from having his case tried free from all matter of prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the legislation we are debating here today, the prejudice is extreme indeed. The courts and, following them, the Senate have always allowed that the public interest might be held to justify a breach of the sub judice rule. But in this case the only interest in the matter is whether the litigants ought properly to have had their case heard and determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation had two elements to it which the Opposition found repugnant. First, it was clearly retrospective and, secondly, it would have pre-empted an appeal to the AAT-I might say, determined today-against charges for excise which under 1984 legislation were not lawful. The appeal was listed today. The AAT was told that the Commonwealth did not contest the matter, and the AAT then awarded BHP and Esso what they had claimed. I think the Australian Democrats should take this on board, because it is quite apparent that the effect of this legislation, if it is passed without the amendments that we will be moving in the committee stage, will be that the damages awarded by the AAT will be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to enable evidence to be heard from both the public servants and one of the Bass Strait partners, and to consider Opposition amendments. Prior to that, the Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Bills flagged the objectionable retrospective provisions of the Bill in its Alert Digest No. 8 of 1990. In a subsequent report tabled on 7 November, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee included this quote from a submission from BHP:</PARA>
<PARA> We consider that the provisions of this Bill should concern your Committee because it will make rights, liberties, or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable administrative decisions, and that retrospectively for 10 years. In the very act of seeking the review open to us, the Government, by this legislation, proposed to take that right away from us. </PARA>
<PARA> We submit that the legislative principle is the same, whether it is a corporation like BHP or a private citizen. If the Government can persuade the Parliament that this is a legitimate action, it will be easier for the Government to do it again. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal-National Party agrees with those sentiments. In the Committee, when discussing the definition of `new' oil and `old' oil, I understand that the Government and BHP, the two parties to the action, both agreed that Tuna L was in fact `new' oil. There is no dispute about that. This means that the Bass Strait partners should not have been required to pay the higher excise. The Government claims that the legislation is necessary to save it paying out over collections. While the Government initially claimed the amount would be $200m, BHP believed it was entitled to one year's overpayment, an amount of $30m, which in fact is the amount that has been determined by the AAT today. </PARA>
<PARA> To reinforce the limit of potential liability to the Government and to preserve the principle of preventing governments from retrospectively legislating to prevent citizens from appealing against illegal impositions of government, an alternative amendment was put to the Committee which would have guaranteed the outcome if the AAT found in favour of the Bass Strait partners-and the AAT has so found today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that when a vote was taken in the Committee on this particular amendment it was a straw vote and quite inconclusive. The result appeared to be three-all and apparently the amendment was lost. As Hansard shows, however, it is clear that Government members themselves were very reluctantly acting under directions and thus harboured the concerns of the Opposition about setting this quite disgraceful precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that the Chairman declined to exercise a casting vote and that Senator Giles, when asked how she would vote, responded-and I quote from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>What am I instructed to say?</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Democrats that, by not supporting the Opposition amendment, they are party to condoning retrospective legislation to remove the rights of Australian citizens. Under our system in Australia, compared with the United States-this is where Senator Spindler seems to have some difficulty-it is the legislation which is paramount. </PARA>
<PARA> A cornerstone of the stability of our parliamentary system is the ability of Australians to rely on legislation. For the Democrats to support the Government and not the Opposition on this matter is tantamount to repudiation. As I said in earlier debate, the players are absolutely immaterial; they do not matter. What is material is the principle. Retrospectivity is either supported or it is not, and the Liberal and National parties will not support retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years ago, the High Court considered a matter not dissimilar from the one now at hand. In the case of Lee v. Watson, 1979, 144 Commonwealth Law Reports 374, the question arose whether a technical failure to make certain foreign exchange regulations available for sale affected their validity. The High Court found they did. The Chief Justice said:</PARA>
<PARA>To bind the citizen by law, the terms of which he has no means of knowing, would be a mark of tyranny'. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, however, the law was defective. The Government of the day sought to amend it as soon as possible. It is interesting that my colleague Senator Durack, then the Attorney-General, brought in legislation to correct the error. But, unlike the present Government, he was careful to omit from his Bill any retrospective application to the people who at the time had a case before the High Court. The then Attorney-General's action was correct, just as that of the present Government is totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Institute of Australia (TIA) has also strongly condemned the Government's action. In a press release headed, `Government's action sets dangerous precedent for taxpayers', the President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, Mr Richard Buchanan, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's hasty retrospective `technical correction' to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, aimed specifically at BHP Petroleum, must be viewed as making the role of courts and tribunals redundant, and possibly even interfering with the rule of law'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Buchanan was also quoted as calling the Government's move as an `unwarranted intrusion on the Australian system of justice and fair play'. He went on to say that `the TIA was not so much supporting BHP Petroleum'-and I think that is important; it really is immaterial who it is-`as alerting the electorate to a matter of grave concern'. The TIA press release went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Buchanan said BHP Petroleum was taking the correct legal action and yet while this was going on the Government had manipulated the system to suit its own end. </PARA>
<PARA>It is crystal clear from the reasons that I have outlined that the Liberal and National parties have some grave concerns about the legislation. We are opposed to the retrospective elements of the legislation and will oppose the second reading by moving the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA>Leave out all words after ``That'', insert:</PARA>
<PARA>``the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 be now read a second time, and that consideration of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 be deferred until the money which is determined to be due and payable to Bass Strait crude oil producers by the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 12 December 1990 has been ascertained and refunded to the producers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly important amendment, because it means that, even though the AAT today has found on behalf of BHP and Esso, the Bass Strait partners, if this legislation goes through unamended, it will take away the decision which was brought down by the AAT. I move this amendment because one of the improper and unacceptable aspects of this Bill is that it was introduced to pre-empt an appeal to the existing legislation to the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, what is material is that the appeal be allowed to proceed to its absolute conclusion and that the outcome be given effect without it being nullified by this legislation. I hope that the Democrats listen carefully to the point my colleagues and I are making about this amendment. If they do, I believe they will have some opportunity to salvage a semblance of respect for the principles to which they claim to aspire. The acid test is what they do when hard decisions on principle must be made. We in the Liberal and National parties are giving them this opportunity in this amendment. If they do not take that opportunity, any talk in the future by the Democrats about principles will be treated with the derision it will richly deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> They could well make a phone call to their founder, Mr Don Chipp, who claimed to have founded the Australian Democrats on the grounds of honesty and principle. I am sure that, if they do, he will tell them that they have been compromised. The Democrats may care to cast their minds back to the numerous occasions recorded in Hansard when Mr Chipp expressed his abhorrence for retrospective legislation. His utter dislike for retrospective legislation is well documented. I will cite a few of them. He included his Democrat colleagues on 6 March 1984 during debate on the tax assessment amendment legislation when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Even those in this chamber who favour retrospective legislation-and they do not include me, Senator Haines or Senator Macklin-would realise that it sets dangerous precedents and undermines the rule of law. Therefore, they must be prepared to make out a very good case as to why legislation should be made retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure the Democrats stated reasons for supporting this legislation. I quote Senator Spindler during the Standing Committee hearing on this latest legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>Our votes were based on the fairly clear evidence which we have obtained at the last Committee session that it was the clearly enunciated intention of government to legislate that the oil in question be old oil carrying the higher excise duty.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in this vein for a short while, in spite of the fact that the Chairman had said only a short while earlier that the Government and BHP, the two parties, both agreed that it was new oil. So here we had the two parties saying it was new oil and Senator Spindler taking a different view. I am sure this argument would not pass Don Chipp's criterion when he said that a very good case had to be made out as to why legislation should be retrospective. In the same speech, Mr Chipp had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I will not have a bar of the principle of retrospectivity at any price. Therefore, notwithstanding how good the reason, I reject it. </PARA>
<PARA>Further he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We agree with this legislation. The only part of the legislation with which we disagree is its retrospective aspect. </PARA>
<PARA>So he agreed with the legislation but not the retrospective aspect. A few years earlier, in November 1982, he said on the tax assessment legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>Good heavens: give politicians the chance to legislate retrospectively and we will open a Pandora's Box. I find this quite frightening . . . I am prepared to go to the barricades in respect of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Democrats do not heed their founder's warning and take the opportunity we are giving them today, any talk in the future by them about principles will be treated with derision. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the time factor involved, I seek leave to incorporate the background and legislative history of this legislation in Hansard. I have already shown it to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Policy background. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1983 Policy</PARA>
<PARA>* On 30-June 1983 the Government announced changes to the excise arrangements which would ``remove the distinction between discoveries made by exploration and development drilling.''</PARA>
<PARA>* In future ``new'' oil application would be assessed on the basis of whether the oil was discovered after 17 September 1975 and whether it was present as a naturally occurring discrete accumulation irrespective of the objective of the discovery well. </PARA>
<PARA>* This meant that the Minister's determination in 1980 would have been wrong if made any time after 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>* However, the Minister said earlier decisions ``would not be reviewed.''</PARA>
<PARA>* Amendments to the Excise Tariff Act came into effect on 1 July 1984 and By-law 78 was revoked on 30 June 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>* The effect of these changes was to classify any crude oil discovered after 17 September 1975 as ``new'' oil. </PARA>
<PARA>* From then on, there was likewise no need for the Minister to make a determination and there is no doubt that Tuna Field oil falls within the new definition, and has always done so. </PARA>
<PARA>* Although the Minister had said earlier decision ``would not be reviewed'', the 1984 legislation did not so provide. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1990 refund claim</PARA>
<PARA>* Although BHP-Esso did not exercise various options open to them to protest the Minister's decision, they remained unhappy about paying the higher rate of excise. </PARA>
<PARA>* In 1990 they made a claim for refund to the Collector of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA>* The maximum amount that can be refunded (see Customs Regulation 53) is excise for 12 months-somewhere between $15-20m. The Government has said a ``contingent'' liability of $200m could be involved but the law would not allow that much to be refunded. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1975 Policy</PARA>
<PARA>* In September 1975, the then Prime Minister announced a new policy on crude oil pricing applicable to oil discovered on or after 17 September 1975. The policy distinguished between ``old'' oil and ``new'' oil, the latter being oil discovered after 17 September 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>* Excise By-law 78 was gazetted on 7 June 1977. It said that the definition of ``new'' oil</PARA>
<PARA> ``applies to stabilised crude petroleum obtained from a naturally occurring discrete accumulation discovered on or after 18 August 1976 as a result of drilling a well which, after drilling, is classified by the Minister within one of the following categories; namely:</PARA>
<PARA> * New field discovery;</PARA>
<PARA> * new pool (pay) discovery;</PARA>
<PARA> * deeper pool discovery; or</PARA>
<PARA> * shallower pool discovery.''</PARA>
<PARA>* It will be seen that the decision by the Minister to classify the oil establishes its category. It is a Ministerial discretion, not reviewable by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>* This by-law, as made by the Minister, meant that item 17 of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 applied to the oil. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980 Decision</PARA>
<PARA>* In 1978 Development drilling in the Tuna Field began. One of the wells encountered previously undiscovered discrete accumulations of crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA>* A letter from Esso Australia dated 21 January 1980 to the Department of National Development asked the Minister for a declaration under the Crude Oil Pricing Policy that the oil so found was ``new''. </PARA>
<PARA>* On 29 August 1980, the Department said that the Minister had refused the application. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned earlier that the Bills were taken to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The attention of everyone in that Committee was drawn to the retrospective elements. In discussions at that time with the Democrats they were totally in support of what the Opposition was trying to do. In the meantime, something has happened to change their view. I ask why they have changed their view. Was it because prejudices took precedence over principle? When we listen to Senator Spindler talking about the companies involved and the dollars which are totally immaterial to this matter of principle, one has to suspect that might be the case. Or were the Democrats bought off by the Government, thus supporting the view in the corridors of Parliament House that one cannot buy the Democrats; one can only hire them by the hour? If the reason for the change was the former, I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that players do not matter. The smallest private citizen and the largest corporation are equally affected. The outcome of the appeal does not matter. The monetary amount-whether it is $1 or $1m-does not matter. What does matter is that this Parliament must uphold the right of every citizen and every company to appeal against a law which may or may not be wrong without the government of the day preventing them from doing so by legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the Government's frantic attempts to rush this Bill through the Parliament, its incompetent management of the legislative program gave the companies their day in court. As I mentioned before, the AAT heard from the Commonwealth lawyers that they did not dispute the companies' claim, so the AAT issued an order in favour of the companies. Why do we have this legislation before us? It is a blatant and cynically contemptuous swipe at the judiciary. The Government, presuming on Democratic compliance, has let the companies have their day in court, but tongue firmly in cheek it now expects the Democrats to ratify retrospectively what the court has plainly said was never law. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5577" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) &amp;(2) The Social Security Act presently requires that a person must be at least 85% permanently incapacitated for work and that at least 50% of the permanent incapacity for work must be directly caused by a permanent physical or mental impairment. A permanent incapacity for work is measured by reference to medical and non-medical (socio-economic) factors. The impairment causation requirement means that the non-medical factors cannot outweigh the medical factors.</PARA>
<PARA> Once the primary test of permanent incapacity for work is met, the decision-maker must then determine the extent to which the person's impairment(s) contributed to that permanent incapacity. An impairment level of 30% or more will usually mean that the second test is also met (i.e. that the incapacity arises primarily from impairment). Careful consideration needs to be given to cases where the impairment level is between 15% and 30%. Where the impairment is 15% or less it is very unlikely that the impairment is the major factor causing the incapacity. A critical evaluation of the extent to which the impairment is causing the incapacity must be made in all cases where non-medical factors are significant in contributing to a person's incapacity.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The correct application of Departmental guidelines should ensure consistency of decision making for invalid pension eligibility purposes. In deciding whether the applicant satisfies the 85% permanent incapacity rule and the impairment causation requirement, Department of Social Security (DSS) officers are required to apply a set of standard national policy guidelines. The consistent application of these guidelines is achieved through the process of cross determination of claims within regional offices, regular quality control and common training for regional office pension assessors. Authorised Review Officers are also available in Area Offices to review decisions. Feedback from them helps to ensure consistency in decision-making.</PARA>
<PARA> In making qualitative decisions DSS officers are also required to have regard to an independently determined impairment rating. Because impairment is a medical concept the ratings are decided impartially by a Commonwealth Medical Officer (CMO) employed by the Department of Community Services and Health. The CMO undertakes individual examinations of applicants and assigns an impairment rating in accordance with a standard set of measurements and tables.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) &amp;5 It is intended that the new eligibility criteria for Disability Support Pension will be based on two separate components: a minimum 20% level of impairment and an assessment of inability to work which is due wholly or substantially to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment.</PARA>
<PARA> Those who do not meet the 20% impairment threshold will be automatically rejected for Disability Support Pension.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the minimum impairment level is satisfied, eligibility will be determined on the basis of a person's work force potential. ``Work'' will be defined to include full time and substantial part time work. Inability to work must be long term (that is for the ``foreseeable future'', to be defined as not less than two years). A delegate of the Secretary will decide eligibility on the basis of residence, age, income and assets and:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) whether the person is totally unfit for any work (including work the person currently does not have the skills to undertake) because of the medical condition alone;</PARA>
<PARA>Grant if Yes</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) if there are any areas of the labour market still open to the person, whether he/she has the skills to do this kind of work and access to such work is not precluded by the medical condition;</PARA>
<PARA>Reject if Yes</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) if the person does not have the skills, whether it is reasonable to expect him/her to obtain the skills. Acceptable reasons for not obtaining skills are limited to lack of access (caused by the medical condition) and age;</PARA>
<PARA>Reject if Yes</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) if there may be eligibility after steps (ii) and (iii), whether eligibility arises primarily from medical impairment.</PARA>
<PARA>Reject if No</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In the majority of cases, where the determination is not straight forward specialist staff in DSS (Disability Officers) will be responsible for determining eligibility for Disability Support Pension. Their classification level is to be agreed between DSS and the Department of Finance (DoF). The DoF is conducting a work value assessment before the two departments meet to resolve the issue. The funding for the positions has been set at the ASO 5 level, as an interim arrangement, with a commitment for additional funding if the agreed classification level is higher than the ASO 5 level.</PARA>
<PARA> Panels convened by the Disability Officers and made up of staff from DEET and DCSH will be the main source of advice when a Disability Officer is assessing a person's ability to work. The DEET officers will be at the same ASO level as the Disability Officers and the DCSH staff will be a professional grade, equivalent in salary terms to a level between ASO 5 and ASO 6.</PARA>
<PARA> Disability Officers will be able to consult widely in making assessments and treating doctors, specialists and other experts may be contacted.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is estimated that approximately two per cent of existing invalid pensioners at 21 August 1990 will have medical reviews scheduled and, therefore, will have their eligibility reviewed within the first 12 months following the introduction of the Disability Support Pension. In addition, an expected 30 per cent of those granted invalid pension after the Budget announcement and before the 1 October changes will be progressively reviewed from 1 October 1991. Other existing invalid pensioners may opt to participate in the new Disability Support Pension system.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Invalid pensioners current at 1 October 1991 will be automatically transferred to Disability Support Pension. Those scheduled for a review after that date will be reviewed under the new criteria. Those transferred will be able to take advantage of provisions that encourage part time work and may volunteer for training and rehabilitation assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) In most respects the cost of administering the Disability Support Pension will be similar to that currently incurred in administering the Invalid Pension, Sheltered Employment Allowance and Rehabilitation Allowance. The major additional factor which will be brought to bear on the administration of Disability Support Pension is the role of the Disability Officers.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1991-92 it is estimated that the cost of these Officers will average $12.90 per Disability Support Pensioner. In 1989-90 dollar terms the 1991-92 costs of these advisors will be $5.1 million.</PARA>
<PARA> The new system is intended to help the maximum possible number of applicants for pension to be rehabilitated and be economically and socially active. In the longer term it should reduce the number of people receiving pension for life and, therefore, be cost effective and in the interest of the individuals concerned.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Are other departments, including the Senate, Joint House, Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the House of Representatives also subject to the rationalisation; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is one aim of the rationalisation to impose a uniform Financial Management Information System (FMIS) throughout all the parliamentary departments and is it intended that the Buildings Operations and Maintenance Management System (BOMMS) be that uniform FMIS.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) No. As I advised Estimates Committee A on September 11 1990, the Secretary of the Joint House Department proposed to the Presiding Officers in late 1989 that the three joint departments (the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff) investigate the scope for greater efficiencies in the provision of some corporate services common to them but performed separately in each. On 2 March 1990, the Speaker and I wrote to the Secretary of the Joint House Department supporting the proposal and asked to be kept informed of developments. We recently received a report which we believed did not develop the concept to its full potential and have asked for further work to be done. The Chamber Departments are not involved in the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> (3), (4) and (5) The Speaker and I are concerned that the needs of each Parliamentary Department in respect of Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS) are properly met, bearing in mind the respective user requirements of each Department. BOMMS and other systems currently in use in the Parliament are being reviewed by the five departments and we are awaiting their advice. The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Department of the Parliamentary Library are however, currently implementing an interim system acceptable to the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. PISO and SAVO were transferred and there has been no rationalisation of Corporate Services.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes. A draft report was sent to the Speaker and me for approval. Certain suggestions on matters of fact were made to the Librarian and were reflected in the final report.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Yes. The Committee was to review all documentation (debates, parliamentary papers) held by the Library with a view to establishing greater storage of such material by electronic means.</PARA>

<PARA> Mr Peter Ward of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff</PARA>
<PARA> (10) See answer to Question No. 6.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) No. I must advise that the Speaker and I are concerned about a number of operational deficiencies within the Parliamentary Library over the past 12 to 18 months. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> * the events which led to the PISO `unofficial account', which were investigated by Senate Estimates Committee A and, subsequently, the Public Accounts Committee;</PARA>
<PARA> * the failure of the Library to maintain correct financial delegations;</PARA>
<PARA> * the invalidity of the documents purporting to transfer PISO and SAVO staff from the Library to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the exhaustion of the Department's 1990 supply appropriation, necessitating the use of the Presiding Officer's Joint Advance for basic administration purposes such as salaries.</PARA>
<PARA> * On 5 December the Speaker and I had discussions with the Auditor-General about the performance of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, in particular, what appeared to be inadequacies in its Corporate Services area.
