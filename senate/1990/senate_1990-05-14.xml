<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the Minister inform honourable senators whether the level of industrial disputation in Australia has been lower under the Hawke Government than under previous governments? If it has been lower, can the Minister say whether the accord between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has played a part in this result? Can he say how the Australian level of industrial disputation under the accord compares with the position in other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries against which Australia is currently measured?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="382" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not include Senator Jones, as the asker of the question, in this comment but I do deplore the inference in some sections of the community, the Opposition and the media that the industrial disputes index, the time lost index-is the only or, indeed, the most important index one should consider under the heading of `lost time'. Lost time due to industrial accidents in this country usually runs at a much higher level than industrial disputes and is often of longer running importance. As Senator Button pointed out to me not all that long ago, a high turnover of labour is also a factor in terms of affecting production, and it is a factor that can often be dealt with better by managerial practice rather than anything else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in answer to Senator Jones's question about industrial disputation, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 190 working days per 1,000 employees were lost in the year to the end of January 1990. This is the same figure as recorded in the calendar year 1989, which was the lowest annual level of industrial disputation in Australia since the Bureau of Statistics first published disputation figures on an annual basis in 1968.</PARA>
<PARA> In the seven years of the Hawke Labor Government industrial disputation has more than halved; the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees has been, on average, 61 per cent lower than under the Fraser Government. Independent research also confirms the Government's record. Beggs and Chapman from the Australian National University concluded that the Hawke Government's consensus based income policies have contributed to reducing the level of industrial disputation in Australia and that this reduction has not been simply a manifestation of international events and forces. The Beggs and Chapman study estimates that, after adjusting for changes in economic conditions, strike activity during the accord period 1983 to 1987 was 82 per cent lower than for the period 1964 to 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> International comparisons show that the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees in Australia in the Fraser years between 1976 and 1982 were 580 compared to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 390. However, in the Hawke years between 1983 and 1987 Australia's rate of 250 working days was exactly the same as the OECD average for the same period.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it indicates that the prices and incomes accord, which is the linchpin of the Government's economic policy, has served, is serving and will continue to serve this country well in providing a less confrontationist and more consensus based approach to industrial relations and, thus, has an impact in bringing down the level of disputation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce say on the Walsh Report on television yesterday that Australia is now in `an economic downturn of some severity' and that in the present circumstances it is not fair or appropriate to talk about rising living standards? How does he reconcile this statement with that of the Treasurer to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) last Friday that economic growth will in fact hold up and that it is not the Government's view that we are in a recession and with the Treasurer's pre-election claim that living standards would rise each year through the 1990s? In the light of the conflicting statements by the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Minister for Finance about the state of the economy, will the Government now attempt to remove this damaging confusion by putting down an economic statement before the Parliament rises?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been no difference between me and the Treasurer about current economic circumstances. I will table, if I may, a copy of the transcript of the interview which I gave on the Walsh Report, recorded on Friday and broadcast on Sunday. There is no doubt that, as a result of current high interest rates and something of a credit squeeze which has been imposed by the banks, a lot of people in this country are finding the circumstances somewhat difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has said all along, and I have said on numerous occasions in the Senate, that to reduce interest rates or relax monetary policy would be economically irresponsible at present. To make any difference between myself on that and the Treasurer's statement made at EPAC is taking an enormous intellectual leap and trying to make an argument that there is inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the question of living standards is concerned-as Senator Short well knows, seeing he has read the transcript-I went on to point out that there were different measures of living standards, and under this Government, if one uses the household disposable income measure of living standards, they have continually risen. I think all I can reduce my remarks to is to say that there will be difficult times for a number of businesses in the course of this year. I do not retreat from that at all. I do not think that the Treasurer put a different view to EPAC in any way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations, concerns the industrial dispute at the Kilkenny plant of John Shearer Ltd in South Australia. Is it a fact that though Shearer's management has been criticised by Deputy President Keogh of the Industrial Relations Commission  and though both parties have been directed to settle their differences according to established industrial relations guidelines, the management has continued to behave in a provocative and damaging manner and, in effect, ignored the directions of the IRC? Where an employer disregards the industrial relations conventions and practices established in this country, what options are open to the Government to enforce these conventions and practices?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="383" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the industrial dispute which has been running now for some time at John Shearer in South Australia and the fact, as the honourable senator has rightly said, that Deputy President Keogh of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission criticised the management of that company quite strongly for not abiding by directions issued by him in proceedings before him in the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has clearly been the Commission's view that there is considerable room for improvement in the situation at John Shearer and that the matter could be resolved satisfactorily if the company would accept those directions. I understand that an interim order relating to some matters in dispute has been issued by the Commission and now accepted by the employees, and that a further hearing in this matter is due before the Commission later this week, I think on Thursday.</PARA>
<PARA> As to what can be done about it, the industrial relations system is in the end only as good as the parties to it and what they make of it. The legislation is there to provide an appropriate framework for employers and unions to use and it is there to protect all the parties. But the parties must share the responsibility for good industrial relations equally between themselves. Just as there are instances where unions have disregarded directions and advice of the Industrial Relations Commission there are also cases where employers have done so. This appears to be one of them. They are rightly criticised in these circumstances, as would be the case if unions had not complied with those directions. In all of the circumstances I think that the best result in this case would be for John Shearer now to comply to enable the hearing for Thursday this week to be a hearing which settles the matter and not a simple way station, a way of it continuing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans told the Parliament on 24 October 1989 and again on 21 November: It is Australia's assessment that all formed military units have been withdrawn from Cambodia. However, until internationally accepted verification procedures are implemented it will not be possible to be satisfied that there has been a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. In addition Australia must be satisfied that a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian issue is in place or at least in prospect before bilateral aid can commence. However, Australia has supported a resumption of lending to Vietnam by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank consistent with the charters of those institutions, which provide that their operations in member countries should be based on economic consideration alone. Staff missions to Vietnam late last year from the institutions reported that economic reforms undertaken by the Vietnamese Government justified a resumption of lending. We are concerned that Vietnam will not be able to sustain its reforms without such support. As well as supporting resumed lending by international financial institutions Australia has expressed interest in a French proposal to assist Vietnam in clearing its arrears to the International Monetary Fund and thereby re-establishing its eligibility for IMF assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since this Government came to office there have been a number of changes in the levels of assistance offered in respect of the motor vehicle industry. Senator Durack will recall, because he was in the previous Government, that we inherited a motor vehicle plan which provided for tariffs of 150 per cent in the mid-1990s. In 1984 we announced a phase-down of tariffs and in 1988 we announced the abolition of quotas and a further phase-down of tariffs. That was done without reference to the Industry Commission; it was done by the Government. The only question that concerned us as a Government on this occasion was whether there should be a reference to the Industry Commission or whether, again, the Government should announce a further phasing of tariffs and other changes to the regime in place for the motor vehicle industry without reference to the Industry Commission. My concern, of course, as industry Minister was that it should be done as quickly as possible. Agreement was then reached that there be a reference to the Industry Commission and that reference should be completed by 31 December this year. That was a course about which I and the Treasurer were quite happy.</PARA></TALK.START>

These things are the subject of Cabinet decisions. There are discussions in Cabinet and differences of emphasis between various Ministers on this issue-not just the Treasurer and myself.

I think there were some delays in that process largely because of slowness in obtaining reports about various technological aspects of that industry and so on which affected the rate of progress.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article mentioned by Senator Colston. I welcome the opportunity to refute the criticism contained in the editorial and put on the record the Government's appreciation of the efforts of the Australian defence forces in providing vital assistance to the flood affected communities in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article showed total ignorance of the procedures for obtaining military assistance in times of disaster. Under existing arrangements the relevant State emergency services approach the Natural Disasters Organisation when Commonwealth assistance is needed. The Natural Disasters Organisation coordinates the Commonwealth assistance and calls on various agencies, including the defence forces, to undertake each task. In other words, the defence forces must have a request for assistance before they can meet it. In fact, the Australian defence forces have responded to all requests for assistance made through the Natural Disasters Organisation. This assistance has included the evacuation of Charleville and Nyngan; temporary tent accommodation for 2,000 evacuees at Charleville, supported by 135 personnel, plus catering and supply staff; the provision of temporary medical facilities at Charleville; transport of food, fuel, relief personnel and supplies to isolated towns and individual homesteads; and aerial fodder dropping.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian defence forces are continuing to provide assistance in some of the worst affected areas. An Army engineering group of 130 men, 60 trucks and plant and equipment are in the Jericho Shire in Queensland assisting in reconstruction work. Fodder dropping and food resupply tasks are also ongoing. At the height of the relief operations approximately 500 personnel and 39 aircraft were deployed. Additional personnel and equipment were on standby.</PARA>
<PARA> As the floodwaters in New South Wales and Queensland recede, the need for the Commonwealth to respond quickly is diminishing. Our prime concern now is the restoration of reasonable living conditions for the affected populations, including the provision of accommodation, repairs to public services and cleaning up of the disaster area. I am currently considering appropriate arrangements for coordinating Commonwealth assistance in this rehabilitation phase.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the defence forces have an excellent record of providing assistance to communities in times of disaster. I am sure all honourable senators would agree with me, as is evidenced by the unanimous resolution that was passed last week which Senator Newman was kind enough to sponsor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is something of a dorothy dixer. I expected this question from the Opposition early in Question Time, but I did not get it. I make a few points about the Bureau of Industry Economics report. First, it should be emphasised that the paper finishing operations should not be confused with the company's film sensitising and finishing operations to which the bounty relates. Film sensitising and finishing operations are undertaken in a different plant. I understand that Kodak considered the Australian film sensitising plant to be one of the two most efficient in its world operations and to be internationally competitive. The BIE study relating to the paper finishing plant is based largely on information available until late 1988 and relates specifically to photographic paper finishing. The report compares this aspect of Kodak's operations in Australia with Kodak plants in Brazil, Canada and the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is one of a number of international productivity comparisons which are being sponsored by the Australian Manufacturing Council. The issue of Australia's relative productivity performance and the steps required to accelerate the rate of improvement is a major study of the Australian Manufacturing Council's current work program.</PARA>
<PARA> The Kodak Corporation itself recognised the inadequacy of the paper operation, and in May 1989 it decided to transfer the plant's export oriented activities to its Brazilian plant. The Australian plant has continued to supply the domestic market, equipment has since been changed and the work force reduced. Kodak says that the paper finishing operation is now more efficient and internationally competitive in cost.</PARA>
<PARA> The BIE report also alludes to the changes being made by Kodak. For example, in the area of industrial relations Kodak and its work force are now a leading example of the benefits of award restructuring and union rationalisation processes. This has followed from some persuasion, if I may so call it, from the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday, the workers at Kodak received their second round award restructuring payment after the Commission approved a range of demarcation efficiency reforms-a single award with a four-union structure. The manufacturing operations of the company are currently being negotiated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and individual unions. This will be down from 12 unions and 13 awards prior to the discussions with the Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to make, and unfortunately the evidence for it is becoming more obvious with every passing day, is that the organisation that was responsible for inflicting the horrendous damage, and it was horrendous, on Tasmania, certainly on the Northern Territory and other places that depend so much on domestic travel for the tourist industry, apart from anything else, was the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP). In terms of nailing that one down even further, I note that Dr Nicholas Blain, who is something of an expert in industrial relations in the aviation industry, has just released some interesting statistics on the pay increases that have actually been paid to pilots who have gone back to work in this new system because of the increased productivity that they are now delivering to the airlines that employ them-and, I might add, now employ 50 per cent fewer pilots than they did before. He refers to productivity increases of some 30 to 40 per cent and pay increases of about the same amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an Australian, it is with some degree of anger, and certainly as a Territorian it is with some degree of anger, that one sees that information revealed and one reflects on what could have been saved to this country, certainly to Tasmania, if it had not been for that mindless exercise. In fact, if the AFAP had done what Qantas pilots did, which almost went without notice during that industrial disputation and while the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots Dispute was meeting-going quietly and without any fuss through the Commission and under the wage fixing system-they would have achieved a very significant pay increase for themselves using the system.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the ever-increasing evidence that is now available continues to emphasise what a number of us said at the time: that is, that that dispute will go down in history as one of the most costly, senseless and stupid pieces of industrial disputation that this country has ever seen. In respect of that matter, and because no doubt this issue will be canvassed by members of the Opposition during the Estimates committee hearings to be held this week, the Government took the quite proper action of dealing with what was and still is the most serious crisis in the total paralysis of Australia's civil aviation system in providing at that time--</PARA>

I ask: First, is it a fact that no submission was offered by the management of Australian National to justify the planned cessation of its passenger services to Mount Gambier, Broken Hill or Whyalla? Secondly, is the Minister able to say that it is departmental policy to consider only the impact of such closures on the accounts of Australian National? Thirdly, will the Minister explain how the claimed cost benefits of such closures are reconciled with the costs to the community as a whole, such as increased road maintenance, increased road trauma, and an increased burden on health, justice and law enforcement agencies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees is quite properly concerned as a South Australian senator about this issue. I am aware of the press reports. In respect of the matters that Senator Lees has raised, the situation is this: the Government has made no decision to close those regional services. Australian National operates three regional services in South Australia in addition to the interstate services it provides. They are in fact original services that Senator Lees mentioned in her question. No decision has been taken to terminate those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A full evaluation of the matters that Senator Lees again raised properly in her question that need to be considered is going to be conducted by Australian National. The Government will not make a decision in respect of those regional services until it has fully consulted with the South Australian Government, and for Senator Lees's advice the Government will also be considering in a general sense over the next few months the cost benefits-taking all of the matters that Senator Lees has raised into account-of all the passenger services provided by Australian National.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Administrative Services seen reports of an unauthorised release of genetically modified animals onto the South Australian market? Are these reports accurate? Will the Government take action to ensure that there is an adequate regulatory structure to ensure that no repeat of such unauthorised release occurs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley rightly asks me this question as I have responsibility for the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC). The Committee operates nationally and acts in a number of ways, one of which is as an advisory body to the Federal Government in this area and the second of which is to administer guidelines for this particular area of genetically modified organisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The incident that Senator Crowley has raised relates to a number of pigs which in fact were produced in an experimental genetic modification program. These animals were transported live to an abattoir near Adelaide in 1988 from the experimental facility in which they were produced. The company involved in this project was Metrotec, which has, as part of its operation, a group within the University of Adelaide. The release of the genetically modified organisms was considered by GMAC to be an appropriate release under its guidelines and the transport of the pigs should have been the subject of a submission to the responsible committee-in this case, GMAC. However, it was not processed in that way, and GMAC regards this particular release as an unauthorised release.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it should be stated that the company involved did in fact have the animals assessed by the food, science and technology subcommittee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, and that subcommittee did consider them fit for human consumption. So there was not any question of an impairment of safety or health arising from the unauthorised release.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue does, however, raise a number of matters which need to be considered by government. The whole area of genetic modification raises legal, ethical and environmental issues and, of course, when we have a case, as has been instanced here where we have a non-statutory regulatory environment which does not offer the degree of protection that some would wish, then there needs to be consideration of enhancement of protections in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was to examine this area before the election. I anticipate that it will do so in the near future. The Government considers that its examination would be an appropriate forum for the issues involved in this area to be discussed and for that Committee to prepare advice for Government so that the Government can act, if necessary, on those legal, ethical and environmental issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a matter of English I suppose I find it strange that somebody should write that I have concluded privately that something is feasible. If I have concluded that privately I assume nobody would know about it, but if I concluded it publicly, it certainly would be known. However, that is a quibble. The answer is that I have not reached any conclusion about the feasibility of the project. A range of studies is presently under way to help determine the economic and social feasibility of the project and until these are concluded no-one is in an informed position properly to assess feasibility of a multifunction polis in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that I have concluded, as have others, that the concept is worth pursuing, but that is a different question from reaching a conclusion ultimately economic and social feasibility. What I have said is that I have some optimism about the feasibility of the project and this is the general preliminary view amongst most participants in the study-that is, encouragement in respect of progress so far.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I have said constantly that unless full feasibility, both economic and social, is determined the project will not go ahead; that is, the Government will not agree to proceed with the next phases of the MFP project unless the concept is determined to be right for Australia. Currently work is proceeding to determine preliminary economic feasibility and this week the five mainland States will submit proposals to the Australian members of the joint steering committee of the MFP chaired by Mr Will Bailey, the Chief Executive of the ANZ Bank. The committee will, in turn, make a recommendation to government on preliminary economic feasibility and will nominate a prime site for the MFP from the five State government proposals.

If I am wrong, I am surprised that that matter, for instance, has not been raised before, but of course it has not. The interpretation that has been put on the resolution is a reasonable one-that is, it is intended to have continuing effect. The thrusts and merits of the word dictate that any reasonable person on either side of the Parliament would understand that there was no merit in assuming that its intention would lapse at the conclusion of a parliament. That is why there is a distinction between resolutions of a continuing nature, which have a continuous effect, and those which cease to have practical effect at the cessation of a parliament. Without question the resolution continues to prevail. The reason that I referenced that resolution and the reason the Committee unanimously included it in the report was because it had not been observed up until the time of the meeting of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee.

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I introduce this Bill to bring attention to the failings of the present system for electing members to the House of Representatives of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the present electoral system for the Lower House is not properly representing the voters of this country. It is a strange result when a party with votes of less than 40% of Australian voters can form a government with an eight seat majority, while other parties, some with 11% of the total vote, are denied any representation in the House of Representatives at all. </PARA>
<PARA> An electoral system that regularly fills the House of Representatives with people who would be the first preference of a minority of electors, and which leaves very large minorities, even a majority in some electorates, effectively unrepresented, is not a fair system. The result is to create a Parliament that is unresponsive to the wishes of the people and that is dominated by a few large political parties, a Parliament that often puts the interests of the major parties before those of the electorate it is supposed to serve and represent. </PARA>
<PARA> The system currently in use for elections to the Lower House is what is known as an ``alternative vote'' system and is a variant of the ``majoritarian'' electoral system which requires the winning candidate to receive a majority of the votes to ensure election. </PARA>
<PARA> As is well known, candidates are regularly elected under the present system who are the first choice of only a minority of electors, but who have garnered enough second preference votes to emerge with a ``compromise'' majority. This is a system that often sends to Parliament candidates of whom the best that can be said is that large numbers of electors dislike them less. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the normal case in the House of Representatives for the electors of a constituency to have as their sole representative a person for whom many feel indifference and even antipathy: they are denied effective representation and substantial sections of public opinion are not reflected in the composition of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a compulsory preferential system: the voters are compelled to express a preference for candidates whom they would not support in any other circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> To overcome many of these problems, proportional representation systems have been developed and are used widely in Europe, and in Australia for upper House elections. Proportional representation systems relate the allocation of seats as closely as possible to the distribution of votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly are conducted under a system of proportional representation which is known as the Hare Clark system. The introduction of the Hare system in Tasmania in 1896 owed much to the then Attorney-General, Inglis Clark, whose name is now associated with the Tasmanian variant. It was designed to assure Parliamentary representation for significant sections of public opinion. In the first instance the system operated only in Hobart and Launceston where there were multiple member districts. In 1907 the Electoral Act applied it to all five House of Representatives seats established in Tasmania under federal law. </PARA>
<PARA> The system incorporates a single transferable vote and in simple terms it operates in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In order to cast a valid vote an elector must express at least seven preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Party groups are identified on ballot papers with ungrouped candidates listed together. Candidates' positions within groups are determined on a rotational basis so that all candidates appear on the same number of ballot papers in the preferred position thereby eliminating the `donkey vote'. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. In order to be elected candidates must obtain a quota. The quota is determined by dividing the total first-preference votes in a constituency by eight, plus one (the `Droop' formula). </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Once a candidate has secured a quota his or her surplus preferences are distributed to other candidates. After the distribution of surplus, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and his or her votes are transferred to the unelected candidates who remain in the count. This process continues until either seven candidates are elected or all candidates except seven are excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantages of a proportional representation system which incorporates the single transferable vote may be determined by considering it against the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Quality of members</PARA>
<PARA> The system operates to give electors a greater opportunity to indicate a preference for a particular candidate. It increases the electorate's freedom of choice in selecting its representatives at the expense of the political parties. Whether this results in improved quality of members may depend on the quality of the electorate itself and the information available to it about candidates. These are important considerations: there is room for improvement in the electoral information presented to the Australian voter, particularly as the means of mass communication are in so few hands in this country. However, I do not believe these problems of proportional representation systems are such as to continue with the present system in which the results are so heavily influenced by party machines. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Relationship with the constituency</PARA>
<PARA> Since, under the Hare Clark system, each electorate has several members, none is as closely connected with a particular locality as is a representative from a single member district. While this may be regarded as a disadvantage, it has been observed that representatives from multi-member districts develop a personal and political following with which they are closely associated and which often have a geographical connection. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Accurate reflection of electoral opinion</PARA>
<PARA> The major advantage of any proportional representation system is that it more faithfully reflects the wishes of the electorate. The voters' will is accurately reproduced and avoids the unfortunate outcome in many single member electorates where a very large minority of voters-sometimes as high as 49.9 per cent-is effectively disenfranchised. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, under the proportional representation system, parties and interest groups achieve seats in accordance with the proportion of votes they obtain. In this context it is interesting to compare the proportionality of votes and seats in the federal Senate and the House of Representatives elections in 1975. In that year, the ALP won 44.3 per cent of the national vote in the House of Representatives but obtained only 28.4 per cent of the seats. By contrast, that party won 40.9 per cent of the votes and 42.1 per cent of the seats in the Senate poll at the same election. I believe the fairer outcome in the Senate was due mainly to the proportional representation system that applies in the election of senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept the proposition that in some circumstances under a proportional representation system minor parties and independent representatives may possess political power disproportionate to the number of votes they obtained in the election. It has been said that a minor party may obtain between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the overall vote, but may hold the balance of power in the legislature and thus be in position to dictate to the political parties which obtained a much more substantial share of the vote. That is a major party perspective: the reality is that such minor party members frequently find themselves in opposition to both the major party groupings that tend to dominate this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of one of the major groupings functioning as an ``opposition'' has become more and more a fiction in the debate of issues in this Parliament. When I sought an urgent debate of the provisions of my Australian Heritage Commission (National Estate Protection) Amendment Bill late last year, Government and Opposition members crowded on to the other side of the chamber and voted together against the motion. That is why it so important to have a system which allows representation of a greater range of community opinion than the present one permits. Governments in this Parliament now accept that they must operate without control of the Senate. State Governments accept the same situation in their upper Houses. The Tasmanian Government has come to terms with a similar situation in Legislative Assembly. If we are to have truly representative government, we must accept the probability of the Tasmanian situation arising in this Parliament and learn to live with it. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Effective representation of minority and special interest groups</PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that political parties' pre-selection procedures are vital in determining whether the significant characteristics of the population are reflected in the composition of the legislature. But under a proportional representation electoral system, parties would have an increased incentive to ensure the election of representatives of interest groups, regions, ethnic groups and women. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand's Royal Commission on the Electoral System cautioned on the difficulty of obtaining reliable cross-national data on the representation of groups and minorities. Despite this, the available evidence showed that women are in general more likely to be elected in list systems of proportional representations than in other electoral systems. A national list, the Royal Commission argued, allows a party to strive for an overall balance among its candidates. Candidates elected from a list may also be able to serve a nation-wide constituency whose members are scattered throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have the unitary system of Government that applies in New Zealand, but the advantages of the proportional representation system suggested for that country can be availed of under our Federal system. Political parties would have much more latitude to develop a list of candidates more representative of the ethnic, gender, and opinion groupings of the population of each State and constituency. The present system of election of candidates for the House of Representatives imposes a kind of tyranny of the majority, with its concern for finding one candidate who will appeal to the majority group in each electorate. The result is a House of Representatives peopled mainly by political clones of a particular variety. </PARA>
<PARA> Under a proportional representation system with multi-member electorates, sizeable groups of electors within a constituency could have a reasonable prospect of electing a favoured candidate. I believe this might promote higher quality candidates than the standard achieved in many cases by the party pre-selection process. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Stability in government</PARA>
<PARA> It is often argued that one of the characteristics of proportional representation is that it tends to increase the number of parties securing representation thereby preventing any one party from securing a working majority and raising the likelihood of unstable government. However, according to Lakeman, in her book `How Democracies Vote' published by Faber and Faber, London, opponents of proportional representation exaggerate its tendency to facilitate an increase in the number of parties and ignore the fact that a multi-party system may arise from various other causes. In addition, she points out, a multiplicity of parties often exists under majority systems. She argues that it is more correct to say not that proportional representation creates parties, but that once they exist, they tend to be represented in parliament. She observed that in Tasmania, voters needs are met by only two parties and the Independents. This remains the case today. </PARA>
<PARA>6. By-election</PARA>
<PARA> The problems of filling casual vacancies in by-elections are avoided under the Hare Clark system by providing for candidates for whom voters have already expressed a preference, to be selected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Constitution in section 24, by providing that the `` . . . House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth'' appears to preclude that option and my Bill would therefore allow for by-elections to fill a casual vacancy. I believe that by-elections provide a salutary indication of the electorate's attitude to the incumbent government during the term of office and in this respect they are an important aspect of any democracy. However, with only one seat to be filled, a by-election would confer the unfair advantage on major party candidates which the multi-member electorate system is designed to avoid. To remove this inequity, it may be necessary for the matter to be put to referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>7. Donkey vote eliminated</PARA>
<PARA> One particularly valuable feature of the electoral system for the Tasmanian House of Assembly is the provision requiring the candidates' positions within groups to be rotated so that all candidates' names appear on the same proportion of ballot papers in the favoured positions. In this way any advantage which a candidate may derive from being at the top of the grouping, or some other preferred position, is eliminated. The Bill I have introduced incorporates this important feature. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1990 is, as far as possible, to bring the advantages of the Hare Clark electoral system which I have outlined to the system for electing members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes appropriate amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in order to achieve this effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the Bill provides that it is to apply to elections to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 provides for the distribution of States and Territories into electoral divisions each returning, as far as practicable, five members. With each electoral division returning five members, constituents could be reasonably sure of having at least one representative in the Parliament who reflected their views and who would be responsive to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 provides for the names of the candidates in each division to be arranged under their group heading, with ungrouped candidates following grouped candidates in the order on the paper under a separate `ungrouped' heading. This clause also provides for the order of candidates within each group to be rotated on the ballot paper: different batches of ballot papers would order the candidates differently and each candidate would have equal access to the favoured positions, making the choice of candidate rely more on the relative merits of the candidates in the eyes of the voter, rather than something contrived by the machinations of the party. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 18 provides for first, second and third preference votes to be expressed and thereafter at the option of the voter. This provision for a partly `optional preferential' system of voting recognises the reality that for many voters there is a limit to the preferences they would wish to express. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Tasmanian system, my Bill does not apply a `countback' method for filling casual vacancies. These would be filled in a by-election as section 24 of the Commonwealth Constitution appears to require this. I have already referred to the desirability of putting to referendum a question as to the filling of casual vacancies which, if passed, would allow any inequities inherent in the procedure for filling casual vacancies to be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to this House. </PARA>
