<TITLE>Pornographic Video Cassettes</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we, the undersigned, having great concern over the effect that increasing availability of pornographic material is having in hastening the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's guidelines for classification of video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which obtain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc. or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>
<PARA>2. Resist moves to have Federal Funds granted to subsidise the production and export of X-rated videos; and</PARA>
<PARA>3. Implement the decision of all State Attorneys-General to have the distribution of X-rated videos from the Australian Capital Territory outlawed.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children, from moral pollution and its harmful effects.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Australians believe in freedom and democracy for all people.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The annexation of the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to USSR is not recognised as lawful by Australia; these Baltic states were illegally occupied by USSR.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<TITLE>Disability Services Act</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Employee Advisory Committee of Aware Industries Ltd., 22 Maloney Drive, Wodonga, Victoria, representing 111 disabled employees in three facilities which provide supported employment for people with disabilities in the Albury and Wodonga area, hereby petition the Senate, and in particular the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, because we object to the direction of the Disability Services Act (1986) in the area of supported employment options owing to the withdrawal of the business factory model as an option.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department states that no disabled person will be disadvantaged by the changes, but many of our employees and their families are fearful that their employment status after June 1992 will be jeopardised as we cannot see all our co-employees finding places in the new models, even if they could be developed by then, or in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask that the Federal Parliament amend the Disability Services Act (1986) to include the business factory model as a choice of supported employment type. It is within the power of the Federal Government to amend the Act if sufficient support is demonstrated. We demand that our voice be heard.</PARA>

<PARA>REPORT NO. 4 OF 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The Selection of Bills Committee reports that it has considered the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 and the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 and has resolved that there would be merit in referring these Bills to a committee for further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> There are differing views within the committee about which committee would be most appropriate to examine the areas of particular concern contained in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee recommends that the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 should be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs forthwith, that is, before the Bills are read a second time. The committee should present its report to the Senate by 15 October 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My statement will be very brief. This report, the fourth from the Committee, is the first actual report in which the Committee registered disagreement about how we proceed in the referral of Bills to committee. At our Committee meeting last evening we determined that it would be better that debate around the disagreement should take place in the chamber rather than in the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, that is correct. There was disagreement among the Committee members on this matter. I wish to move the motion that has been circulated in my name, with the addition of the words at the end of paragraph (1), and that the balance of the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In talking briefly to this matter- there are four separate issues within it and the Opposition in principle supports all of them. But we have significant reservations about the manner in which the apparent proposals would operate and for that reason we consider it desirable that each of the issues be further examined by the relevant committee. We propose that clauses 9, 10, 11, 24, 37 to 42 relating to the tax file number be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and that the balance of the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> This would enable organisations such as the Australian Privacy Foundation, the Privacy Commission, the Australian Council of Civil Liberties and the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Welfare Rights Centre to address a range of issues such as the adequacy of the powers of the Privacy Commissioner to participate effectively in public debate so as to contribute to a better understanding of the implications of the proposal. It would enable the possibility and desirability of the extension of the tax file number system beyond the social security system to be discussed; the relationship of the tax file number system to proposals for parallel matching and enhanced computer matching facilities; the privacy implications of the provision of information transfer from the Department of Social Security database to other government agencies and departments; the extent to which the proposed extension of the tax file number system will contribute to savings to revenue; the basis for the Budget estimates and other ministerial pronouncements regarding the extent of revenue losses through fraud and overpayment; and the estimate of likely savings from the introduction of the proposed initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose, as I said, that clauses 9, 10, 11, 24, 37 to 42 go to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the balance of the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I refer to the motion moved by Senator McKiernan in relation to report No. 4 of the Selection of Bills Committee and move:</PARA>
<PARA> Omit all words after `That', substitute the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Clauses 9, 10, 11, 24 and 37 to 42 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, which relate to the proposed extension of the Tax File Number system, be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report by 6 November 1990, and that the remainder of the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report by 6 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report by 6 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Senate (Quorum) Bill 1989 [1990] not be referred to a committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are extremely concerned about the implications of clauses 9, 10, 11, 24, 37 and 42 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and believe, with the Opposition, that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is the appropriate committee to investigate those aspects of the legislation. Speaking as a former member of that Committee who has been involved in some of the ongoing work in that area, I particularly support that view. We are supporting this amendment by the Opposition because we believe particular scrutiny needs to be given with regard to the expertise of that Committee. We believe that the social welfare legislation also ought to go to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. We therefore support the Opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we develop this new committee system, it is important to ensure that Government business still manages to get through the Senate, and we need to ensure, in doing that, that particular committees are not overloaded when it is unnecessary to do so and that other committees can continue with their work so that Government legislation can be passed to enable start-up dates to be met. When one looks at the legislation that is referred to in Senator Reid's amendment, one sees that we now have a portion of this legislation going to Senator Cooney's Committee. Senator Reid, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats are well aware that Senator Cooney's Committee is also dealing with the privacy legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are going to find it very difficult, given that, to have Senator Cooney's Committee deal with all of that legislation-with privacy plus now aspects of this other legislative package. The Department of Social Security has to get ready for some 1 January start-up dates. There is considerable gearing up to be done for that. By doing what we are doing here this morning, on the assumption that the Opposition and the Democrats stick together, we are going to make it very difficult for those start-up dates to be met. We make that difficulty occur while all still having the certain knowledge that, no matter which committee the legislation is referred to, all of the same witnesses can appear, all of the same questions can be asked, and exactly the same amount of scrutiny of the legislation will take place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not about preventing that scrutiny, but it is about ensuring that the scrutiny can occur in a minimum period of time to enable the Senate to deal with the legislation, and then so enable those start-up dates to be met. Already one start-up date will not be met and will have to be altered. But to get legislation through the Senate in time for those start-up dates and to have all of that gearing up done by the Department that is necessary, we are now going to run a great risk. I still cannot understand why this course has been proposed because, if all the legislation is referred to the Committee of Senator Zakharov, all of the same questions will be asked and all of the same witnesses will be called. It is just that we will get it done more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that no-one in the Senate is simply about delaying tactics. I would hope that no-one here is seeking to delay for delay's sake. What we are all about is a quest for information. That search for information will be satisfied by sending all of the legislation to Senator Zakharov's Committee. The Government is determined to see that this new committee system is not used during the course of the next few months to frustrate the passage of Government legislation. Already we face serious problems. Already we now face an extra committee stage added to what we used to have, if the Opposition were to continue in the same vein that it did on the Maritime Museum Bill a few weeks ago. That is a matter of grave concern to us because, if that were to continue, there is no way that the Government's legislative program during this session can be met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that is one of the most astonishing presentations that I have heard in the nine years that I have been in this place. If there is a problem-and we are not sure as yet whether there is a problem-it is simply as a result of the mismanagement of the Government of its own business program. We knew at the end of the last parliamentary session that in all likelihood the credit provider provisions of the Privacy Amendment Bill would be referred to a committee. There were some of us who were of the view that the Bill should have been referred then so that in the months that this Parliament was up it could have been dealt with properly. That was not the Government's view, and so now only this week has it been referred to the appropriate committee for consideration and report. We have the totally unsatisfactory position that witnesses who are to be called before the Senate tomorrow still have not even been advised. As of last night, the relevant committee was still in the position of having to determine what witnesses it intended to call. How can the Senate be properly expected to conduct its business in a reasonably efficient way in those circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we get to the question of the second Bill, the tax file numbers Bill. I do not think Senator Richardson understands the legal consequences of these privacy matters. I do not know that he is even aware that already the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has dealt with the tax file system as it was first put into the Parliament. There was a very lengthy inquiry that Senator Powell, Senator Alston and I all participated in. There has been an expertise built up not only among senators but also in the staff of the Committee. These are very important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee is logically and sensibly the Committee to which the Bill should be referred if we are to produce the best quality legislative result. That is our responsibility. It is not our responsibility for the Government to get its program in order; that is what it must do. That is what it grossly failed to do in relation to this parliamentary session. Senator Richardson is quite wrong: there is an enormous bulge of legislation building up for later in this session. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, Mr President, you had to announce to the Senate that we could not get the Hansard printed because the Government was only introducing its legislation to the printers as of yesterday. It is a totally unsatisfactory situation. We have said that we will make this committee system work provided that we are able to make it work. That requires organisational competence on the part of the Government. We need to know what legislation is coming up. We need notice as to when it can be referred. We will provide senators on our committees to do the job properly. It has to go to the most appropriate committee, the committee that has the expertise, otherwise we are taking short cuts and we will end up with a poor quality result. That is not us meeting our responsibility. We intend to meet our responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> We still do not even know which is the priority of the two Bills which will be before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Which is the higher priority? Which Bill does the Government want the Committee to deal with first. Does the Government want us to deal first with the credit providers legislation, which has now been in this Parliament for about a year and has only reached this stage, or is Senator Richardson saying, because of the start-up dates, that the tax file number legislation is of the greater urgency? Is he asking the Senate to deal with that legislation first?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not even had the courtesy to tell us that. I suspect that it is not a question of courtesy, because the Government simply has not considered it. It has not worked out its priorities yet. So, before Senator Richardson tries to blame the Senate for the slow passage of legislation, it is important that the Government directs itself to its program and gets that in order, and then we will cooperate to ensure the orderly passage of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment moved by Senator Reid may not be entirely in order. What Senator Reid has said in support of her amendment is logical. Clauses 9, 10, 11, 24, 37 and 42 contain provisions about which, as has been agreed, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has developed an expertise. It is very important, as the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) has said, to address these questions of privacy and to do so against the background of the expertise that has been developed amongst the honourable senators on that Committee and amongst the remaining honourable senators-and I think that includes the lot of us-who have kept an eye on this privacy area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see nothing too much wrong with the amendment to place some sections of the legislation before one committee and some before the other. I do not agree with Senator Richardson that all of the questions will be asked again in each committee. The sections being referred are different. However, I foresee one problem. If these committees are to meet concurrently, for example, if I have, as I do, an interest in this piece of legislation, it will be impossible for me to sit in on both committees at the one time. I defy anybody to suggest how I could do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that point. But I raise the issue as to whether Senator Reid's amendment as it now stands is in order, because page 137 of the Senate Standing and Other Orders of the Senate, which details the orders of the Senate as at 5 December 1989, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a standing committee, to be known as the Selection of Bills Committee, be appointed to consider all bills introduced into the Senate or received from the House of Representatives, except bills which contain no provisions other than provisions appropriating revenue or moneys, and to report-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in respect of each such bill, whether the bill should be referred to a Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in respect of each bill recommended for referral to a standing committee:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the standing committee to which the bill should be referred-</PARA>
<PARA>not the standing committees-plural-to which the Bill should be referred but the standing committee to which it should be referred-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the stage in the consideration of the bill at which it should be referred to the standing committee, and</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the day which should be fixed for the standing committee to report on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The orders of the Senate do not suggest that a Bill should be referred to more than one standing committee. It is in the singular, not in the plural. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid's original motion was probably prepared with that in mind but, as the motion now stands, I am not too sure and I seek guidance as to whether it is in order. If it is in order, I would prefer, frankly, to vote for Senator Reid's original motion as it was circulated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with Senator Harradine's point first because I understand his concern. I think the Acts Interpretation Act is the starting point. That normally requires that the singular embraces the plural. It does that for the very simple reason that if we started saying `a committee' or `committees' in every situation, we would simply clutter up legislation. The classic example would be an omnibus Bill. Clearly there would be a desirable way of handling that, which would normally involve referring the legislation to the committees that might have direct relevance to certain parts. All that is contemplated here is that `a committee' allows us to refer it to a committee but, indeed, we can go further if necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal with the substance of Senator Richardson's comments. I find it extraordinary that jet lag still seems to be operating after four days and that he has the hide to come in here and to suggest that the chamber has plenty of work to deal with. We have already adjourned early on one occasion this week and frantic attempts have been made on a number of occasions to find enough work to keep us going. As Senator Newman has pointed out, three of the listed items under Government Business are committee reports. We are very short on legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important points of all is that Senator Richardson is somehow endeavouring to say that the Government's program ought to take priority over the business of the Senate. That is contemptuous of the parliamentary process. He talks about a deadline having been set by the Government on legislation, 1 January being the operative date. We all know that Senator Richardson's Department is very busy gearing up in a whole range of areas in anticipation of legislation coming into effect. Why the Government chose 1 January is a matter for the Government. It is certainly not something that should cause us to shrink and to throw in the towel simply to accommodate that convenience. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very revealing because it shows that Senator Richardson could not care less about the real privacy implications or, indeed, about the other political or social implications of these provisions. All he is concerned about is some flash timetable that he has worked out behind the scenes and that he wants to see put in place, come what may. That is why his Department will go ahead and do things as though legislation were already in place. I cannot believe that the Department will do nothing until 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing is that on the one hand, Senator Richardson professes concern for privacy, wrings his hands and says that he will do nothing to set up central data banks and all the rest of it, but on the other hand, the minute that we want to refer very technical aspects of legislation to the obviously most appropriate committee, Senator Cooney's committee-the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-he turns around and says, `No, it should go to the community services committee because otherwise we will have a whole series of duplications of questions and witnesses'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is preposterous nonsense. I do not know whether Senator Richardson means it seriously. By treating these matters discretely we are quarantining the tax file number legislation. We will have certain witnesses with expertise in that area-mainly civil liberties groups, such as the Australian Privacy Foundation, the Welfare Rights Centre and others, who may or may not have concerns in those other areas. One of those areas is the amnesty, and it has already expired. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not involve anything like the degree of rigorous legal scrutiny that the tax file number involves, particularly when we recall the sorts of downright lies that have clearly been told when we look back and see the promises and assurances that were given two years ago about the tax file number never being extended beyond the tax system. We now have Ministers quite blithely saying that it ought to be extended to the social security system and that this is what they propose to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand the logic of that extension but we cannot wear the hypocrisy of it. Therefore, it is terribly important to understand all those legal implications that may allow even further extensions down the track. I find this sort of hypocrisy and cant quite breathtaking. I hope that Senator Richardson will address himself to the seriousness of the issue and the way in which the committee system ought to operate. If we did not have the Senate Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills the Senate could still have chosen to refer it out, as it used to do, under the old system. That is not a matter of the Government's timetable any more than it ought to be now. It is a matter of the Senate getting it right and the community understanding what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether we are operating under the old system or the new system, we want to make sure that the Senate at least is fully appraised of the implications and not simply forced to rely on shoddy assurances of people like Senator Richardson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to speak about a particular concern of mine in relation to the referral of the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendments Bill to the standing committee on the issues of the Pharmaceutical Remunerations Benefits Tribunal (PRBT) and those sorts of issues, but I guess I have changed my mind because I see it as more important to discuss the amendment that Senator Reid has put. To have Senator Richardson stand here and accuse us or imply that we are going to hold up the legislation by this technique, is offensive. I find it offensive and I am sure my colleagues do. To argue that we will slow down the process by referring the Social Welfare Legislation Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) to two committees is a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that we are referring them to two committees will ensure that those two committees will speed up the process by having people who are knowledgable on those committees to deal with the issues, and to call witnesses who are knowledgeable. Senator Alston has already said and argued that, yet we have been accused of delaying the process. I believe this will facilitate the process; it will make the scrutiny of legislation much better; and it will mean that the committee process will work. I do not believe the Government wants this process to work because it does not want the tax file number and all the privacy issues to be put before the public. </PARA>

The Government is determined to make the system work, as has been proved with hours and hours of discussion that have gone across parties. We have done it. In only recent times we came out with an agreed procedure which has now been circulated within the parties for discussion. There are four elements in that package of how the Bills could be referred. We find today that we are now getting a fifth element injected into it. Within that fifth element we are splitting up the Bills on the grounds of expertise, so the argument goes. But there are financial implications in this Bill. Could the argument not be used that sections of the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration? There may be employment aspects of the Bill. Could elements of the Bill not be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training?

<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA> In his Budget speech the Treasurer announced a number of changes to the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, and one other I will introduce shortly, will amend the sales tax law to give effect to two of those changes which apply from 7.30 pm, 21 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the comments made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech, the details contained in Statement No. 4 of Budget Paper No. 1 and the explanatory memorandum being circulated to the honourable senators, I will do no more than outline briefly the changes proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the Bill will amend the Sales Tax Acts (Nos. 1-9) to provide for a more effective imposition of sales tax on luxury motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing arrangements, once the wholesale value of a vehicles exceeds $30,233, the rate of sales tax applying to the entire wholesale value increases from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. This results in a sudden increase in retail prices beyond that wholesale point. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation has encouraged wholesalers to adopt a number of undesirable practices to artificially reduce wholesale prices below the threshold level, in some cases by removing safety options from vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce these distortions, the Government has decided to introduce a marginal rate structure for such vehicles. Under the new arrangements, a rate of 30 per cent will apply to the wholesale value up to the threshold, and a rate of 75 per cent will apply to the amount in excess of that value. </PARA>
<PARA> At a wholesale value of $54,419, an average rate of tax of 50 per cent will apply. Vehicles with a wholesale value in excess of this value will be subject to a flat rate of tax of 50 per cent, as per current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this measure will be to provide a progressively increasing average rate of tax for vehicles in the wholesale value range of $30,234 to $54,418. This will remove the present discontinuity in the retail price of vehicles with a wholesale value just in excess of $30,233. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will also benefit those primary producers and others living in remote parts of Australia who use four-wheel drive vehicles that have a wholesale value in excess of the luxury car threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill will amend the Sales Tax Assessment Acts (Nos 1-3, 6 &amp;7) to ensure that otherwise taxable printed matter is not exempt from sales tax simply because it is inserted into an exempt publication, such as a newspaper or magazine, for delivery to the final consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> By these amendments printed matter inserts will be treated as goods separate from the exempt publication for sales tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The inserts will be subject to tax, unless they are specifically exempt, at the time of their final wholesale sale or deemed sale on a sale value equal to the sale value specified under the existing sales tax law for goods applied. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal will ensure that all printed promotional material is subject to sales tax irrespective of who prints it or how it is delivered to the final consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act with effect from 7.30 p.m. 21 August 1990 to ensure, in conjunction with amendments made by the Bill I have just introduced, that printed matter inserted into an exempt publication is only exempt from sales tax if, as goods separate from the exempt publication, it is specifically covered by an exemption item in the First Schedule to the Exemptions and Classifications Act. </PARA>

Why could the Estimates Committee not have met last night so it could have continued with its considerations, or why can it not meet, say, next Wednesday night or at another time that is convenient to honourable senators, rather than in effect take from honourable senators their legislative responsibilities as the Government, through its rather incompetent planning, is pressing with this program? I raise the issue at this time because I think it should be settled in the chamber as a whole. The Acting Manager of Government Business in the Senate is not here at the moment, but perhaps Senator Bolkus has been briefed on the matter and can tell us what the Government plans in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Committee's consideration of the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill was suspended last night the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who was at the table, was just about to respond to a point I had made about the numerous references in the Bill to `as soon as practicable'. I had explained that I had read the letter by Mr McInnis to the shadow Minister and how that dealt with the final part of the Bill for an internal body search. The Committee had been in the process of getting an explanation from the Minister at the table as to what would be a reasonable time for someone in the earlier subdivisions A and B where there is either a frisk search or an external search to be carried out. As I understood it, although I may be wrong-I have not yet seen the Hansard-the Minister rejected the suggestion that an interpretation of forthwith would be a reasonable interpretation. Therefore, on those grounds I would be interested to know the Government's latest position on interpreting what `as soon as practicable' means for a passenger coming through.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that on 17 August this year the Australian Customs Service did contact Mr Prosser, the shadow Minister for small business, housing and Customs. I am further informed that in its correspondence to him this point was canvassed. It is probably best for me to read out the relevant two paragraphs of that correspondence which does canvass advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The letter goes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As indicated at the meetings, the original draft Bill proposed an initial detention period for the internal search regime of a maximum of 4 hours within which a person must be taken before a magistrate or judge, and failure to do so would result in a reference of the matter to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is a sentence referring to the relevant provisions. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This was subsequently changed on the basis of advice from the Attorney General's Department. The relevant part of the advice states:</PARA>
<PARA> `The provisions which require a report to the Ombudsman where delay in seeking orders occurs (sub-clauses 219p (3) and 219r (9)) afford the detainee no real protection. The legislation which requires applications to be made without delay or, preferably the more usual formulation of as soon as practicable, will, where this requirement is not complied with, have potential affects on the admissibility of any evidence subsequently obtained under the principles laid down in Bunning v Cross.'</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Further, there is clear Judicial authority to show that the proposed formula would not allow any undue delay in extending the detention before making application before a magistrate or judge. In the High Court case of Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278, the Court had to construe section 34A(1) of the Justices Act 1959 (Tas) which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Where a person has been taken into custody for an offence, he shall, unless he has been released under section 34, be brought before a justice as soon as is practicable after he has been taken into custody.'</PARA>
<PARA>In essence therefore we are talking about the application of common law rules and principles which would ensure that the particular person involved would in the circumstances of the case be brought before a justice as soon as practicable. We are talking about a flexible provision which will allow judicial interpretation depending on the circumstances of the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the original copy of the letter. I understand that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) is in difficulty coming here not having knowledge of what transpired last night. A careful reading of the Hansard, when it appears, will show that this is not the point in dispute. What Mr McInnis is saying in his letter relates to an application to a magistrate or judge. That applies only in subdivision C. The third case is where a person is going to be detained or subjected to an internal search.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no difficulty with that and I accept all the common law arguments and the rest of it. But the point I made yesterday was that we are dealing with five million or seven million passengers a year coming through Australia. I am not interested in what someone's legal rights are to sue the Australian Customs Service afterwards for undue delay. I accept that recourse is there, but that is after the act. I am interested in getting some idea of the most likely cases, the numerical majority, which is the frisk search and the external search. How long does the Australian Customs Service or the Government see is a reasonable period, in hours, for which an external search or a pat-down can be made? That is the simple question I am asking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that, hopefully, judicial authorities-and I think they do-interpret the same words with the same meaning. Senator MacGibbon is right in saying that the context in which the advice is given is in a different set of circumstances. What, however, is consistent is that in proposed sections 219m, frisk search, and 219q (2), detention for external search, the term used is `as soon as practicable'. That is the precise term that is canvassed in the correspondence from Mr McInnis and it is contended-I think quite confidently contended-that judicial authorities would interpret that phrase in the same way in these particular provisions as they have in other cases. That is the basic principle of the law. I refer also in this context to another paragraph of the letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The decisions of the other judges support these views, and the authorities and precedents referred to illustrate that the formula of `as soon as practicable' is to be interpreted consistently with the common law, which places an onerous duty on the detaining authority to not extend the time-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If 2,000 passengers were at Sydney Airport at eight o'clock in the morning waiting to get through the barrier and a Customs officer decided to proceed, on the correct grounds, to carry out a frisk search would it be a reasonable assumption that that Customs officer would then proceed to carry out that frisk search straight away or would he ask the passengers to wait for an hour or two hours or three hours before the frisk search was carried out?

<PARA> When a frisk search, an external search or an internal search is carried out the Act defines that it shall be done by a person of the same sex. I am interested to know whether there is any intention to have two Customs officers present at the time the examination is made. An external search is a simple case but when a detainee is taken to a private area and required to remove his or her clothing in front of a Customs officer of the same sex is there any requirement that there be two officers present so that in the event of any dispute as to what actually occurred, there is corroboration?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why has the Government not conformed to what I understand is accepted medical practice in requiring written informed consent from the detainee rather than the written consent standard, given the great differences that exist  legally between those two states?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister is not familiar with the practice, in simple words I would say that in the case of written consent all that is required is that the examining officer says to the detainee, `Do I have your approval to conduct an examination?'. In the case of written informed consent the medical practitioner has to inform the patient in some detail-and the detail depends on the circumstances-as to what is proposed to be done and, in so far as is practicable and foreseeable, to outline the consequences and any complications that may take place in that examination. It is generally accepted in medical circles that a simple written consent form is of limited or no value because the patient can then come back and say to the medical practitioner, `I simply was not informed that that was a consequence of what you proposed to do'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Senator MacGibbon understands the context in which I am replying to him this morning. The distinction the Senator is drawing is between informed consent and the consent that is provided for in the Bill. The advice I am receiving is that throughout the Bill there is consistent provision for legal representation when an internal search is required. I am also advised that provisions also apply in the Bill for a person to be a protected person and to have someone look after that person's interests. I do not know whether those two provisions satisfy the concern that Senator MacGibbon raises. Judging by the way he is shaking his head, they do not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, that is a different issue. My simple point-and I will restate it-is that if a medical practitioner asks a patient for his or her approval to carry out a procedure and he or she agrees to that in writing, all that person has done is agree that the procedure be carried out. In the case of informed consent a practitioner is required to take the time to explain in adequate detail to the patient what he proposes to do and also explain any of the sequelae or consequences that might result. In other words, the patient is informed whereas in the other case, it is a blank cheque; the patient says, `Right, you can do it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the former case, under our legal practices the practitioner is open to a charge that the patient agreed to something the full consequences of which he or she did not understand. In this case this is important because there is obviously a degree of coercion in the situation. The passenger who is suspected of concealing drugs internally denies, in effect, that he or she has them, otherwise a declaration would have been made; when the Customs officer at the barrier had asked, `Do you have anything to declare?', the passenger would have said no. The Customs officer would then have said, `We wish to proceed through the various stages of these search procedures'. Implicit in this is the passenger's lack of cooperation with the authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, it becomes very much more important that the detainee be informed as to what will happen when a search or an examination takes place, in so far as it can be explained beforehand, and what the sequelae might be. For example, if the examination ruptures the packaging containing internally secreted narcotics, that can and does lead to instant or rapid death in certain circumstances. If patients are not cooperating, it becomes important that they be advised of the procedure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator MacGibbon elaborated on the situation in which medical practitioners conduct these sorts of tests. We expect that that procedure will continue. In that context, I refer Senator MacGibbon to clause 219v (11), which also gives judicial override in circumstances where a medical practitioner is not satisfied as to informed consent. In essence, the prerequisites that Senator MacGibbon wants to apply in these circumstances are those that we expect will apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, this matter was also raised by Senator Coulter, I think, during the second reading debate. A response was given to him in these terms: the question of a medical search on a non-consenting detainee in fact received quite a deal of attention in the drafting of the internal body search provisions. The Australian Medical Association, AMA, made the point, in discussion on the Bill in 1986-87, that doctors would not perform any examination of a person without that person's consent. This applied irrespective of whether the doctor was employed or performing professional services for an agency such as Customs or the police forces or was engaged in a more common doctor-patient relationship and irrespective of the fact that the order for the medical search of the detainee was in existence. </PARA>

<PARA> Many matters are left to the judgment of the medical practitioner, but there is a test that the practitioner must consider the procedure to be reasonably safe in the circumstances. We feel that this is the best protection to afford the persons who are being inspected.

I think that those two mechanisms together provide both a medical and a judicial protective structure to individuals who might be going through this process. </PARA>
<PARA> I think to go further than that and to try to limit in any more definite way the use of apparatus or to try to define the circumstances and to proscribe some and prescribe others would be quite impossible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed-and I agree with this-that the sort of proposal that Senator MacGibbon puts up is one that would be extremely difficult to prescribe in regulation or legislation, if he is talking about lists of medical practitioners who would be called upon. I am advised that it is the practice to have a defined group or a general group. It should be acknowledged that it is reasonable to expect some flexibility in this area. We might instance the cases of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane as major incoming ports, but there are places such as Cairns and Townsville, which Senator MacGibbon would know about, and other places-even Hobart. It should be acknowledged that, even though there is a practice of relying on a general well of practitioners, to be more prescriptive would impose difficulties. I think it is also fair to acknowledge that we do expect a person with a medical degree to have a certain amount of competence. I do not know whether this is disputed by the Chair, but we, as legislators, have to take cognisance of that and, accordingly, we have that further protection to fall back on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite astonished at that answer. Just dealing with the last point-the assumption that anyone with a medical degree would be qualified to carry out an internal body search-the fact is that such a person has to cope with the emergency consequences. What will happen if a condom ruptures internally? It requires a knowledge of pharmacology, the appropriate resuscitation procedures, and much else. It is quite reasonable to expect that that would be beyond the knowledge of an ordinary general practitioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to the first point, that of preparing a list. Given the numbers of medical practitioners now in places such as Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, where there is a pool of suitably qualified people available, I see no difficulty at all in calling for practitioners who have the ability to put their name forward so that they can be appointed on a consultant basis when the need arises. Quite clearly, these medical officers are not going to be employees of the Australian Customs Service or the Department of Community Services and Health, or engaged in any other Commonwealth full time employment. They will certainly be on an `as required' basis and, if it is on an `as required' basis, they will be there on a consultant basis. </PARA>

I also made mention of the fact that we do have lists of surgeons who are normally used to conduct these sorts of examinations. Given those two points, it could be reasonably expected that, if a judicial order is to be obtained before an internal search, there is protection in the court process to ensure, if anyone is concerned about the sort of medical practitioner who might be conducting the tests, that those concerns are taken into account at that particular point. As I said, in practice we do have lists of surgeons and they are used both by Customs and the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go back to the point I made earlier in response to this question; that is, the person would be detained to enable the authorities to obtain an order for detention from a judicial officer. As I mentioned earlier, in that process the question of the appropriate medical practitioner can be raised. It is not as easy as someone coming off the plane and an internal search being conducted by the time he leaves the Customs hall, for instance. There has to be that intervening process of judicial intervention. As I said earlier, given that time span and the judicial authority deciding that there should be an internal search, there is a general list that is used by the authorities on which the Customs officer can rely. One might find that half the surgeons are busy doing other operations and other sorts of things, but that pool is gone to in the first instance.</PARA></TALK.START>

By definition, that means that that person is being detained by either Customs or police. The first point is that the person is in detention, so a detaining officer must be present. At law it causes another problem if, further down the track, there is a dispute as to what has actually been found. The detaining officers-the law enforcement authorities-would then not be in any real position to be authoritative about periods of time when they may not have been present.

<PARA> It would be very simplistic for me to say whether I believe a medical practitioner would have the same credibility in a court of law as a detaining officer.

Senator MacGibbon maintains that might just be someone standing outside the door. I would argue, and courts have had it argued before them-sometimes successfully-that in circumstances such as these there needs to be closer detention, especially when the detainee is in contact with other people. As I say, my interpretation is irrelevant. We have to have legislation which can withstand those sorts of quirks of legal interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am unable to accept that interpretation, but I will let that matter pass. I will come to another two points in relation to detention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are qualities of detention, and I might use that description. There is the detention of someone who has been convicted of a crime-but we are not talking about that position here. We are talking about someone about whom some suspicion exists. To apply the same standards as those applied to someone who has been convicted of a crime like murder or theft is quite inappropriate in the circumstances, and the legislation ought to reflect that. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing is that a person who is detained even for the most horrendous crime is not subjected to the invasive nature of an internal body search. This is quite a different circumstance to taking someone's clothes off in a prison cell to see whether there are any weapons strapped to the body, or anything like that. This is a major procedure. I would have thought that any reasonable concern for the dignity of the detainee would have demanded that the people present at that time should be restricted to suitably qualified medical people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is anything more that I can add to what I have already said to Senator MacGibbon. Basically, the point is that legal authorities quite often can and do demand continuing custody. We are talking about a person being detained. The honourable senator makes a distinction between someone convicted of murder and someone suspected of murder, and I suppose in this instance between someone convicted of importing heroin and someone suspected of importing heroin. Unless we have both protections and powers in the first instance we may not get to the stage where someone is convicted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic point here is that we are talking about someone who is being detained for the purpose of assessment as to whether he or she should be further detained for an internal search, and someone who is the subject of an order by a judicial authority to have that search conducted. There is a reasonable case, therefore, to expect that that person should be both protected by the law and held under legislation which ensures that the detaining authorities have powers which are fair but potent. I think the honourable senator's distinction between a suspect and a convicted person is not really relevant in these circumstances, although it might be in others. </PARA>

<PARA> I move to the other part of proposed new section 219zh, which states that the law will require a medical practitioner in the course of the examination to discuss, in effect, what he is doing. To me it seems absurd to be placing a legal requirement on a medical practitioner to answer questions relating to whether an internal search of the detainee should be carried out, the manner in which such a search is being carried out or the results of such a search, and to answer those questions to the best of his or her ability. </PARA>

<PARA> The medical procedure is quite properly totally within the competence of the medical practitioner, and I do not think that he or she would be disrupted in undertaking that procedure by the asking of questions, but I think it is legitimate for the law enforcement officer to ask whether a particular procedure is being undertaken and what the results of that procedure are. That seems to me to be legitimate. I guess that there will be a working understanding which will enable the medical practitioner to be fully professionally competent in the undertaking of the medical examination, and the practitioner will certainly not be acting in some sort of disrupted way in accordance with whatever questions might be asked by a Customs or police officer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In looking at that proposed new section one has to see a working situation where somebody is accused of a serious offence. Obviously, the Customs and police officers have an interest in the outcome of the medical examination which is being undertaken, but the obligation on the medical practitioner is to answer the questions `to the best of his or her ability'.  I take it that that refers to the competence and professional expertise of the medical practitioner, but it must also carry a recognition that he or she will not be able to answer questions in the course of an examination. It would be quite wrong to think that it was within the ability of a practitioner both to concentrate on an intricate internal examination and to answer questions coming over the shoulder from some Customs officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure, as I say, that the working arrangement will make the latter part of proposed new section 219zh (1) work, and I am quite confident that, if any difficulties are experienced by the medical practitioners, they will bring that to the notice of their professional organisations and possibly even the judge. We should not forget that the medical practitioner has, as I understand it, to report to the judicial officer who authorised the examination on the result of that examination, and I believe that the medical practitioner could quite properly indicate either in that report or in some other appropriate forum some dissatisfaction concerning the disruption or interruption caused by a Customs or police officer asking questions. </PARA>

<PARA>Proceedings, other than proceedings concerning negligently causing injury, do not lie against a medical practitioner, or any person assisting or providing facilities to a medical practitioner, in respect of anything done by the medical practitioner under this Division. </PARA>

I must use the word `may' there; the person may be quite innocent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The law relating to negligence causing injury in relation to the carrying out of their responsibilities by medical practitioners is well regulated by the tort rule.

Obviously there is a whole body of understanding of how that particular standard of care is to be achieved by the person possessing or holding himself or herself out as possessing competence in a particular professional field, in this case medicine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am fairly confident that what is being done here is preserving the legal liability of the practitioner for acting in a way that does not accord with the duty of care which the person being examined is entitled to expect.

I believe that the community and the doctors themselves have a quite proper expectation that, should they fail in the ordinary way to exercise due care, they should be held liable.

But we are not talking about the general case here; we are talking about a very difficult particular case involving probably a non-cooperative detainee. There are risks in two dimensions: there is the risk from the actual invasive nature of an internal body search, of movement of the patient and great damage to the patient's body arising as a consequence of that if the patient becomes violent. The second dimension of risk is that we are dealing with lethal substances, and the rupture of one of the containers could lead to the death of the carrier of those substances, and has done so. The circumstances are very different. I would have thought that there was a very good argument to be made for the Commonwealth's picking up the responsibility for this, except in cases of gross negligence-I use that term in its legal sense-as opposed to the lesser charge of negligent practice.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I am informed by the officers, clause 219zj is the result of quite long discussions with the Australian Medical Association (AMA), which was concerned that its membership would not undertake these sorts of internal searches without some sort of legal protection, except in cases where the practitioner was negligent. Apparently, the AMA recognised that in the case of negligence, ordinary rules of legal liability should obtain. But the sorts of misgivings that Senator MacGibbon expresses, apparently on behalf of the medical profession, have been taken into account in consultation with the representative body of the medical profession. Clause 219zj is thought to be sufficient to allay the fears of those medical practitioners who might undertake these duties out of a sense of public duty, as Senator MacGibbon has said. This is part of a regime which is designed in particular to stop drug trafficking into Australia. If they wish to cooperate in that policy objective of the Government of stopping trafficking of drugs into Australia but may have some misgivings, I believe that this clause helps to allay some of those misgivings in a way which apparently has been thought to be satisfactory to the Australian Medical Association.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address my remarks on the Budget to road funding and the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report. I was surprised on Tuesday that the Cabinet meeting mentioned the new directions for road transport espoused by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and the Inter-State Commission. This subject has not received a lot of publicity and I doubt very much whether the average Australian even understands what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to go through some of the details and point out what will happen if this Inter-State Commission report becomes a fact of life. It is going to have devastating effects on the rural economy, and that economy is already battling against high costs and low commodity prices. Mr Brown seems to be going to use economic blackmail to force the States into agreeing with the proposals. Mr Brown has threatened to withhold $1.6 billion annual road funding from the States unless they agree to transfer their vehicle registration powers to the Commonwealth. Mr Brown is hoping to persuade the Premiers to give up all their vehicle registration power and their collection of local road funding, and he will do try to do this at a special Premiers Conference at the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA> It came as a breath of fresh air yesterday to see that the New South Wales Government will not hand its car registration over to Canberra. But Mr Brown has said that he believes he has powers under the Commonwealth Constitution to wrest the registration fees away from States. I suppose that that will be tested in a court, but I am very hopeful that it will not be able to happen. It is time that the whole of Australia realised what the Government is trying to do with the land transport system. The Inter-State Commission report recommendations mean much more than just a national vehicle registration scheme. Today, I want to point out to the Senate what they in fact will do. The ISC report recommends the end of the land transport system as we know it today. It recommends the end to the dominance of an efficient road transport system over the inefficient and, in many cases, non-existent rail in the inland areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This report means a complete change to Australians' land transport system: a national system of registration of all motor vehicles, including private cars; a national system for allocating road funds; and a national system of applying the user pays principle to all those who use Australian roads. Road transport will now become a Federal problem, not a State problem. Vehicles will be registered in Canberra; taxes and charges will be paid to Canberra; and funds for road maintenance will be allocated back to the States by Canberra. That means that road spending will be concentrated in the areas where most votes are. For the transport operators themselves, it means an increase in fuel taxes, an increase in costs to run their vehicles and an increase in paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be three components to the charges and the taxes that the operators of heavy vehicles are going to pay to the Government. Firstly, the registration fees: these are greatly reduced and will be around $50 to cover the cost of plate stickers and administration. That is the good news. The bad news is that mass distance charges are to be calculated according to the size and weight of the trailer plus the load, and each trailer is assessed and charged separately. For example, for a 40-foot freight trailer registered at, say, 34 tonnes, including the weight of the load and the weight of the trailer-and that is about the average size of the trailers used to shift about 70 per cent of the freight commodities around Australia-the annual mass distance charge will be $18,600. For a type 2 road train, the annual mass distance charge will be a massive $52,700, compared to the current Queensland registration fee of $6,200. The 40-foot trailer that I alluded to earlier has a registration in Queensland of about $2,500, and now that is going to be massively increased to $18,600. </PARA>
<PARA> A new schedule of charges for road trains and trailers permanently fitted with stock crates has been drawn up, and an average livestock transporter will be paying about $3,000 less in mass distance charges for a trailer than a general freight carrier. This is because there is a large amount of time that livestock operators travel empty. These charges will be payable quarterly and will be based on the average distance travelled. If an operator drives further than the average distance, then he will have to pay even more; and if he drives less, a rebate will be given at the end of the year. What that means is that transport operators will need to fit hubmeters onto their trailers to monitor the exact number of kilometres travelled. </PARA>
<PARA> One concession that the Inter-State Commission has made is that, in the first two years of the scheme, the operators will be charged only half of the mass distance charges to make the transition easier. From July 1992 to July 1994, operators will be paying about $9,300 annually to register a 40-foot trailer rather than $18,600. Then from July 1994 they will be paying the full $18,600.</PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the equation comes in terms of the Federal Government fuel excise. Currently, there is a 24.9c per litre Federal Government fuel excise and the original report proposed that this not change. However, in the latest report, the Commission has recommended that a further 6c per litre be added onto the cost of diesel fuel to compensate for the loss of revenue while the initial charges are being phased in. This is going to apply a massive increase to the cost of freight, particularly in the outback areas of Australia. In other words, while the Commission has accepted that the charges are going to be a big burden and need to be phased in, it has introduced another charge, this time on the cost of fuel, as compensation for it. It is hitting the transport industry both ways and, to use an old analogy, what it has decided to give on the swings it is getting back on the roundabout. </PARA>
<PARA> On current figures diesel fuel excise will rise to 30.9c a litre. Petrol has also been hit with a rise of 9.4c per litre in government tax, taking the amount of government excise on petrol from 24.9c to 34.3c per litre. This will increase the charges in all States. In New South Wales the increase will be 6c a litre because the Inter-State Commission recommends the reduction of all State fuel taxes. In Victoria it represents an increase of 5.3c a litre, in Queensland 9.5c a litre, in Western Australia 5.3c a litre, in South Australia 5c a litre, in Tasmania, which is affected less than most States, 3.2c a litre, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory will pay up to 6c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government goes along with the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission it will make fuel more expensive. It has also decided to abolish the diesel fuel excise for rail. The plan is to make rail cheaper and road freight more expensive in an effort to push more freight onto the rail system and off the roads. But we cannot make the rail system more efficient by making the road transport system less efficient. We cannot take Australia's freight task away from an efficient privately owned and operated system and put it into the hands of a government controlled monopoly. Senator Collins is at present trying to straighten out the inefficiencies that we have on the wharves. Now we have the acceptance by Mr Brown, the Minister for Land Transport, of the recommendations made to the Government, to place a barrier against road transport and to push the freight onto rail which is in the hands of a government controlled monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be very difficult for rural Australia and, for that matter, all parts of Australia. I do not believe there is a great future in this proposal. Some of the concessions that have been made include the recommendation to reduce sales tax on new trucks and tyres from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, the acknowledgment that transport operators, especially livestock carries, travel extensively on private roads, and provisions have been made for rebates on this type of freight. The Commission has recommended transferable and temporary licences for operators who find themselves with a job requiring a heavier trailer or more trailers than they have registered. </PARA>
<PARA> The inner city motorist who averages about 20,000 kilometres a year will be paying far less to maintain Australia's roads than those motorists in rural areas where long distances are the norm. Local councils and government vehicles, which currently enjoy concessional registration through the State government registration schemes, will also be affected by this scheme. All vehicles will be registered through the national scheme, costing about $50, and council cars will still be paying the Federal Government excise through the fuel pump. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was discussed by the State and Territory transport Ministers on 7= September and a fair amount of reservation was expressed. But Mr Bob Brown, the Minister, received an in-principle agreement on the concept of a national land transport system. Some State Ministers have objected, but the timetable has now been set in motion for the State and Federal legislation to be drawn up. Mr Brown will push for that in a meeting at the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the implications have to be examined. A great number of rural towns in Australia are not serviced by rail. A great number of rail lines that run from east to west do not service the adjoining towns that may run from north to south. The people of such areas will be heavily disadvantaged. Commodity prices to the consumer will increase dramatically. I have been told that the cost of bringing cattle in from a place such as Quilpie will increase to 40c a kilogram and that will be passed on to the consumer in the capital cities. Increases will also occur in the cost of a number of items that will be required in rural Australia. The cost of everything from Weetbix to cattle dip, any freight carried into rural Australia, will increase by 10 per cent. This will impact heavily on the people in the city because they will be paying an increased price for commodities- fruit and vegetables, meat, daily groceries. But it will impact even more heavily on rural Australia. Some rural towns will almost disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan went ahead in September with an in-principle agreement and the Minister wants to have it operating by July 1992. The Transport Minister, Mr Brown, is setting up an all-government task force to work on the establishment of a national vehicle registration scheme. The task force will examine the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report and the national uniform road charging principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gone into rural Australia and told people about this ISC report and it has caused them massive worry about the future of their towns and the cost that it will impose on their standard of living. Before the Government goes any further in trying to implement this ISC report, it should and must do a social impact study on the ways in which towns in rural Australia will be affected. All over rural Australia people are starting to understand what this means to them. They will lose their privately owned transport operators. A lot of freight will be forced onto rail. A number of transport operators will go broke. Some operators have told me privately, and publicly at meetings, that there is not much point in trying to carry on now-they are operating on only a 5 per cent margin-because increases in the cost of registration by up to 800 per cent will put them in an unworkable position. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will see reason on this proposal. A lot of people believed that it would not happen. When members of the press contacted Mr Brown, initially, when the first report came out, Mr Brown put them off by saying, `It is only a discussion paper; it will not happen for two years'. But now we find that there is a revised Inter-State Commission report and it is just as bad. The press is now running with a story that the recommendations of the report will be implemented very soon and that Mr Brown will invoke his constitutional powers to override the States. If that happens, it will be a matter of court judgment. But the Bill will have to pass through the Senate. I am relying on the Senate to have a deep sense of looking to the future of rural Australia and not imposing this threat on the country people. Not only rural Queensland will be affected; the whole of rural Australia is serviced by a road transport scheme and will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Interstate Road Commission is part of the Government's economic reform package. I do not believe it will result in a decrease in the cost of production. The recommendations state that it will force efficient, privately owned, operated and controlled road transport operators who are prepared to drive and work hard and long hours-road transport operations I believe carry 70 per cent of Australia's freight-into a government-owned and controlled monopoly. Anyone with any business sense will agree that those efficiencies of the road transport system will not be able to be obtained from the rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose in raising this very important issue today is to make the Senate aware of the situation. I see that Senator Kernot is present. It is her responsibility, as the person representing the Australian Democrats in the area of transport, to take into consideration the issues that I have raised today. I cannot state how important this matter is. The recommendations will mean an increase in the cost of freight considerably both to and from rural Australia. I cannot see how any benefits can be obtained for the consumer or the farmer if this Inter-State Commission report goes ahead, as Mr Brown seems determined that it will. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, if the Government is determined to push ahead with it, as it seems it will, then the least it can do is to conduct a social and economic impact study on how the changes will affect Australia's primary producers and people who live outside the metropolitan areas. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows -</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes a number of amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Health Insurance Act 1973, and the National Health Act 1953. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Child Care Act in this Bill give effect to the far reaching child care reforms promised by the Government during the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures promised during the election, and delivered in this year's Budget, build on a record of considerable achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came to office, there were only 46,000 funded childcare places in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are now 122,000. We have tripled the numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government came to office, there was no systematic means of fee relief to support affordable childcare. </PARA>
<PARA> An estimated 90,000 families using non-profit community based centres will benefit from a more generous, targeted fee relief system from 1 October this year, and a further 35,000 families using commercial centres will benefit from the beginning of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government came to office, there was no planning to support the ever growing need for more community childcare. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now implementing needs based planning for 80,000 new childcare places in the community based centres. </PARA>
<PARA> By any measure, these are significant achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> We have produced one of the best integrated childcare systems in the world-and done it in less than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> We have achieved this by pursuing three basic objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> - affordable care</PARA>
<PARA> - equity of access</PARA>
<PARA> - quality care</PARA>
<PARA> These three objectives are the basis of the Government's childcare policies. They lie at the heart of our election commitment on childcare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that a significant barrier to opening up opportunities for women has been, as the Treasurer said in the Budget Speech, `the lack of decent and affordable child care places'. </PARA>
<PARA> Our childcare policies are helping to breakdown that barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The main challenges facing the Government in the l990s in childcare are, therefore, to increase the supply of quality childcare places and to make sure that ordinary Australian families are able to afford care. The proposed amendments promote these objectives, and enable the introduction of fee relief arrangements that are equitable across the non-profit community based sector and commercial sector of the childcare industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be tackling these issues in cooperation with the States and local government, and will be encouraging all sectors of the childcare industry-commercial, community and employer-provided-to participate in providing new places. </PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of the childcare election commitments will see the number of places almost double by 1995, involving the largest expansion of childcare ever undertaken-some 108,000 places over the next five years. It is estimated that the extension of fee relief as proposed in the Bill before the Senate, and changes to the fringe benefits tax legislation, will lead to around 28,000 of these new places being established in the commercial and employer childcare sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> An improved fee relief system, as promised in the election campaign, will be introduced for non-profit childcare services now covered by the program of services for families with children on 1 October this year. This Bill extends the improved system to commercial, employer-provided and other non-profit childcare centres not currently covered by the program from 1 January 1991. Many thousands of families currently using these centres will become eligible for help with their fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of extending fee relief assistance to commercial centres and employer-provided childcare will be some $28m in 1990-91, increasing to about $105m in 1995-96 as more commercial childcare centres are established. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is also being taken to tighten provisions in the Act to protect the Government's interests in land, buildings and equipment acquired by sponsor bodies through grants made under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the Act provides for repayment of the whole or part of a grant if an agreement under the Act is breached. The amendment protects the Commonwealth's equity in its grant by providing for it to be repaid at an indexed rate if the agreement is breached, rather than at its original fixed rate. Without protection of this kind sponsors may be tempted to realise the value of capital assets, which have greatly increased over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> An associated amendment concerns power to approve transfers of land, buildings or equipment. The current provision is limited by a requirement that transfers only be approved on conditions set out in the original grants. The amendment will allow greater flexibility for transfers to be approved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act to change the maximum patient contribution under Medicare-that is the difference between the Medicare schedule fee and benefit from $20 to $26 from 1 January 1991. There has been no increase in the maximum patient contribution since the increase to $20 in November 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Further where a person reaches the safety net threshold of $150 in a financial year by accumulating maximum patient contributions, Medicare pays benefits equal to 100% of the schedule fee for services rendered during the remainder of that year. The Bill will also increase the Medicare safety net threshold from the current $150 to $240 from 1 January 1991. This will be the first increase to the threshold since the introduction of Medicare in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> In subsequent years, both patient gap payments, and the safety net threshold will increase automatically by CPI, in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also repeals section 21 of the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention that non-residents of Australia, whether they be Australian citizens residing abroad or long term visitors from overseas, should not have access to Medicare eligibility. The Government believes that only persons who actually reside in Australia legally should have Medicare entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the inception of Medicare in 1984, Australian residents have been able to claim Medicare benefits in respect of the cost of medical services incurred overseas while they are temporarily absent from Australia. Where there is an equivalent item in the Medicare benefits schedule, such medical services have to date attracted benefits at the Australian schedule fee rate. No financial assistance is available in respect of hospital costs incurred overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to discontinue the payment of Medicare benefits for medical treatment received overseas. In practice Medicare rebates are often very little more than token payments against the very high cost of medical treatment overseas. Indeed, Medicare rebates paid in respect of services rendered overseas often provide little more than a Commonwealth Government subsidy to the local insurance industry. The Government believes that a more appropriate and effective way of protecting Australian residents who travel overseas is to extend the network of reciprocal health care agreements with other countries. Such agreements provide Australian residents with access to both medical and hospital treatment on the same basis as residents of the host country. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is currently party to agreements with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Malta, Italy and Sweden. Negotiations are under way with a number of other European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great concern to me, and to my Ministerial colleagues, that many Australians undertake overseas travel without making appropriate arrangements concerning comprehensive travel insurance which includes a health insurance component in the event of illness overseas. Indeed, I am informed that less than 50 per cent of Australians travelling overseas take out adequate insurance with health insurance cover. Health costs overseas are often high, particularly in the United States of America where hospital charges in excess of $2,000 a day are not unusual. Thus, a 10-to 15-day stay in hospital can result in a devastating outlay of $20,000 to $30,000 for the patient. Very often people who incur these costs have no insurance whatsoever. The Government is unable to assist such persons, and nor should it. It is the responsibility of the individual to purchase adequate travel insurance cover, just as it is to make arrangements covering all other aspects of overseas travel such as obtaining travellers cheques, foreign currency, booking accommodation etc. The former availability of Medicare benefits may have provided a false impression in the minds of travellers that they were adequately protected against such costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Henceforth, from 1 January 1991 medical benefits will not be available for overseas medical treatment, and the Government will focus its efforts on further developing reciprocal arrangements with countries which have health care systems which are compatible with, and comparable to, Medicare. This amendment is expected to save approximately $5m a year in Medicare benefits from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> A further purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's structural reform of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces one of the key elements of the agreement between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia as it relates to restructure of the retail pharmacy industry. The Bill establishes the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority which is to be empowered to make recommendations to the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health for the payment of essential pharmacy allowances and on payments in respect of pharmacies that amalgamate with one or more other pharmacies, or close. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will also make recommendations on where new approvals to operate a pharmacy under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be granted. The Authority will cease its activities on or before 31 March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Government has been concerned that there were too many pharmacies approved to supply pharmaceutical benefits. In 1972 the Pharmacy Guild of Australia suggested, to a House of Representatives Select Committee, the establishment of a committee to regulate approvals under the PBS. Several of the inquires which have been conducted involving the PBS, eg. Ralph, BIE and IAC, have drawn attention to the high pharmacy to population ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal in calculating the remuneration to be paid to pharmacists has continued to use an average cost structure and not the most efficient cost structure, with the result that inefficient and marginal pharmacies have continued to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Expert Advisory Panel on Pharmacy Changes, a panel of pharmacists set up by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services last year to assist him, were convinced that controls and limitations were needed on all new approvals to supply pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted recommendations from these bodies that it is clearly in the best interests of all Australians, both as taxpayers and patients, that pharmacy numbers be reduced by encouraging pharmacists to either amalgamate or close to reduce the numbers of inefficient pharmacies who are a drain on the Government, and to strengthen those more viable pharmacies that remain. Where an amalgamation or closure payment has been made with respect to particular premises, no new approval for the use of these premises as a pharmacy under the PBS will be granted without the approval criteria being met. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly such proposals will be limited to those pharmacists where there is another approved pharmacy within a reasonable distance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very aware of its responsibility to continue to support the adequate provision of pharmaceutical services to all Australians, but this clearly must be within the resources at its disposal. The Government has, however, included in this Bill provisions to provide financial encouragement for those small isolated pharmacies which are providing an essential service. </PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority will be made up of Government and industry nominees with an independent Chairperson, all appointed by the Minister. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia will make four nominations, two of which will be appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will make its recommendations in accordance with guidelines to be determined by the Minister. These determinations are to be tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate, also amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 to extend the secrecy provisions of these Acts to persons in receipt of information obtained under the Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to reports in the media last year about police investigations into an arrangement between a mercantile agent and Commonwealth officers whereby personal information was unlawfully made available by officers to the agent. The reports indicated that the mercantile agent then sold the information to financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation exists, both in the Crimes Act and in specific Acts, which makes it an offence for a Commonwealth officer, without lawful authority, to disclose information obtained in the course of duty. The Crimes Act also contains a provision which would enable action to be taken against a person who aided, abetted or was directly concerned in the commission of the offence by the Commonwealth officer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern that while a Commonwealth officer, and a mercantile agent with whom that officer may have had an arrangement to supply information, may be subject to prosecution, there is no offence by the purchaser of the information from the agent where that person may have known that the information had been unlawfully obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation extends the prohibitions in the two Acts to cover the dissemination of confidential information to third persons where these persons know or reasonably ought to know that the information has been disclosed to them in contravention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment is proposed to the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953 to allow for the release of data pertaining to the sale of pharmaceutical benefit drugs in aggregate form, even though such a release would identify the manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA> The present provisions, as now interpreted, prevents the release of data that would identify the affairs of a manufacturer. This has meant that information pertaining to a brand of a drug cannot be released where there are less than three manufacturers of that drug. This affects several of the major drug groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the presentation of statistics pertaining to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are meaningless without the full data. This lack of data has hampered the management of this major high cost social welfare program, which requires continuous monitoring of drug usage to ensure that subsidised drugs are being used in ways which reflect both sound medical practice and cost effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent legal advice suggests that the current provisions prevent the release of such data, even to meet the accountability and information requirements of Parliament. The needs of external research have been severely handicapped by the prohibition on the release of some data on drug usage. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will allow the release of aggregate data pertaining to the sale of drugs listed as pharmaceutical benefits, but such statistics shall not be published in a manner that enables the identification of a patient or pharmacist or medical practitioner but will permit the release of data that identifies the manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 will make it clear that where a person is supported by a foreign government or company while in Australia that person is not entitled to a Health Care card. A decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal cast doubt on the existing provisions of the legislation and this amendment will make clear that persons in Australia and supported by an overseas government cannot have the benefits of Australia's social welfare programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity to announce to the Senate that from 1 December 1990 the existing provision of the National Health Act 1953, introduced on 1 July 1985, to allow for the continued listing of unique drugs, will provide the legislative framework to allow for the introduction of the minimum pricing policy. Under this scheme the Government will only fully subsidise the cost of the lowest priced brand of any drugs. With the costs of the PBS escalating at an ever increasing rate the Government has been forced to introduce such measures to reduce the actual and potential high cost of multi-brand drugs to the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision allows the Minister to determine, after the normal negotiating process with all manufacturers of that drug, the base price for the particular brand of a multi brand drug. This will become the 'approved price to pharmacists' which forms the base for the reimbursement price to pharmacists. Should medical practitioners prescribe a dearer brand of the same drug, patients, including those receiving drugs at the $2.50 rate or free, will all have to pay the difference between the base price and the higher manufacturer's price. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to announce that the Government is intending to extend the benefits of the concessional category to all persons in receipt of part Family Allowance Supplement. This is an important expansion of benefits as it takes account of the needs of families who are struggling to make ends meet. This move will go a long way to help these families. </PARA>
<PARA> The restructuring of the pharmacy industry is expected to produce net savings of $43.2m in 1990-91 and $93.5m in 1991-92, noting that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has offered to fund half of the closure and amalgamation packages which are a feature of restructuring the pharmacy industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of concessional status to persons in receipt of a Family Allowance Supplement will cost an estimated $2.50m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The new minimum pricing policy, while not an element of this Bill, will produce net saving of approximately $16m in 1990-91 and $47m in later years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990 and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. These are very different animals and I want to make clear that we oppose the first and essentially support the second. I will be moving a second reading speech amendment to the first Bill in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say that the politics of the legislation are quite transparent; they have been overtaken by the recent election. The only reason this Bill was ever introduced in late 1989 was to honour the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) given prior to the 1987 election that the Government would urgently reform this nightmarish legislation, as he described the Broadcasting Act. I think there has been heated agreement in the community that the Broadcasting Act has been a walking disaster for a long time. But the Government had consistently refused to do anything about it. It finally dredged up this Bill in a blatant attempt to pretend that somehow there was some activity going on.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation was supposedly primarily about giving the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) additional powers in the event that the High Court of Australia ultimately held that Bond Media and Mr Alan Bond were not fit and proper persons to hold television licences. In my judgment that has always been a beat-up. There was adequate power in the Tribunal to cope with that situation, either by way of simply adjourning the matter until other arrangements had been made or by way of securing undertakings from the licensee. </PARA>
<PARA>In the event, of course, that is not proven to be necessary with the disposal of Channel 9. But, certainly, we have taken the view that the Broadcasting Amendment Bill gives the Tribunal extremely wide and unnecessary powers and discretions which would enable it to intervene in virtually all aspects of the broadcasting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the spectre of mandatory revocation in the event of a finding that a licensee is not a fit and proper person is a sham. As the Federal Court of Australia made plain in the Bond case, the Tribunal does have a wide discretion to take into account all aspects of the public interest in deciding whether to suspend or revoke, to impose conditions or to accept undertakings. The Tribunal did not challenge that aspect of a full court ruling. The true situation was, therefore, markedly at odds with the second reading suggestion that the Tribunal was faced with extremely limited options in the event of any adverse finding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is also totally inconsistent with two basic propositions which have the support of all the major political parties and the broadcasting industry-in other words, the need for a fundamental overhaul of broadcasting legislation on a considered and not a piecemeal basis and, secondly, the need to reduce the present plethora of extensive and inefficient legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard this first Bill as nothing more than a smoke screen to disguise sustained inactivity over the last three years. It does not do anything to address the very real and continuing problems. It is in stark contrast, as my colleague Mr Brown pointed out in the House of Representatives during the debate on these Bills, to the second Bill, which does contain a number of extensive reforms and does attempt to sell itself as being in the business of substantial deregulation and refinement. But the first Bill is a token gesture that really does not add anything at all to the debate. We therefore take the view that it is quite unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, I might say, still a number of fundamental problems in the radio and television industries that neither Bill addresses. I think we can essentially characterise the Government's attitude under the new Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) as still fiddling while the industry burns. His predecessor might have been known as Rip Van Willis but I think the present Minister has probably simply been distracted in other areas. But he has made a very inauspicious beginning in terms of reforming the Broadcasting Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the rhetoric about deregulation and wanting to make the system operate more efficiently, we still have this determined refusal to ban the introduction of pay television. Indeed, I think probably one of the most extraordinary examples of standing by and watching the radio industry bleed to death is the way in which the AM and FM industries have been not just left to their own devices but put in regulatory straightjackets. This has meant that the only real extension of FM licences has been in the area of public broadcasting. The whole licence tendering fiasco that has taken place that saw licences changing hands for extraordinary sums of money only to be demonstrated to be worthless a matter of months later has meant that the Government has been marking time in that area because it has not been prepared to tackle the real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Weekend Australian of 6-7 October contained a fascinating article by Mark Day in which he talked about what he describes as yet another revolution that is likely to overtake FM broadcasting as well as AM-that is, digital audio-broadcasting. This involves music being placed on digital discs or digital audio tape and played through digital equipment. It would seem that this is able to be done much more quickly and much more cheaply than is the case with current technology. It is likely to cause a lot of people in the industry to quiver in their boots because current commercial values will be rendered, if not worthless, certainly very much in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no sign at all of the Government being aware of this latest technological revolution. Indeed, it is still bogged in the mire of the damage that it has done in relation to the sale of FM licences. I think there is tremendous scope for the Government, if it is serious about deregulation, to start addressing some of these difficulties. What they really show, I think in many respects, is that if we attempt by regulation to guide the direction of the industry we will inevitably fail because we will be overtaken by technological developments that are usually a long way ahead of the ability of lawyers and regulators to define where the boundary ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a classic lesson that is being learnt, or will be learnt I am sure, in the telecommunications industry where this Government has bent over backwards to ensure that Telecom Australia maintains its de facto monopoly of telecommunications by, on the one hand, pricing the potential entrant in such a way that there will be enormous start up costs and, on the other hand, imposing very serious limitations of movement. We will see, in effect, one monster competing against one small player with one arm tied behind its back. </PARA>
<PARA> That all comes about because of the Government's desire to draw boundary lines and to regulate the industry in a way that simply does not allow technological progress to take place. In the area of broadcasting, I think that is precisely what Mark Day is identifying. There we have the latest technology that the Government will have to confront and yet it still has not even satisfactorily resolved how it will address what might well be yesterday's technology in terms of AM and FM radio. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Bill that we are debating today is thoroughly inadequate in its ambit. It simply gives the Tribunal a whole range of discretions that seem to me to be verging on the extraordinary. It gives the Tribunal powers to impose conditions on third parties so that they have virtually no recourse and to make orders against foreigners in such a way that there will be serious interferences with their ordinary businesses. If these powers are taken at face value, the legislation will put the industry into a regulatory straitjacket. </PARA>
<PARA> I have enough confidence in the good sense of the Tribunal to believe that that will not take place, that there will be commonsense exercised. But before one gives someone such sweeping powers, one needs to demonstrate why it is necessary. There is very little on the public record to justify any of these extensions of power. We conclude that this first Bill will simply not tackle any of the serious reform issues but, rather, will put in place further labyrinthine hurdles in the way of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> One recent case study which has come to my attention deserves some consideration by the Government. I hope that, in view of the fact that this debate will not proceed beyond the second reading stage and that the committee stage will be taking place, at the earliest, next week, there will be ample opportunity for the Government to address this matter. I stand to be corrected if either of these Bills do in fact cure the defect to which I propose to refer, but it is my information that they do not. Therefore, I want to draw attention to a difficulty that I think is still alive and well in terms of prescribed interests. </PARA>
<PARA> As the world knows, Harlin Holdings is a company with extensive interests in Elders IXL Ltd. For some time this company has been anxious to reduce its debt burden by selling off a portion of its shares. What it has done recently-and I am simply going on what is in the newspapers-is effectively sell a proportion or a parcel of shares to a Japanese brewer by the name of Asahi. Asahi, by virtue of very complicated tracing provisions, ends up having a prescribed interest in Austereo Radio. That seems to be an extraordinary and unintended state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> My information is that if Asahi buys something of the order of 20 per cent of Harlin Holdings, which still has a 36 per cent, or thereabouts, interest in Elders and Elders owns 18.5 per cent, or thereabouts, in South Australian Brewing Co. Ltd, which owns more than 15 per cent of Austereo, which holds a number of radio licences, by virtue of this complicated chain that is in place Asahi is deemed to be in control of Austereo. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say-and I would be happy to be corrected-it seems to me that this is a legacy of what was presumably a quite well-founded concern in the old days to ensure that particularly foreign corporations were not able to acquire controlling interests in what was regarded as a fairly sensitive industry. But to apply those rules in such a rigid manner that actual control could be deemed with no let out does seem to be quite counterproductive. Yet, as I understand it, that is what happens in this instance and, I presume, others. </PARA>
<PARA> So Asahi's attempt to purchase and, indeed, Harlin's attempt to sell, could be injuncted by the ABT simply on the basis of what is technically a prescribed interest. I suppose it could also be that the Foreign Investment Review Board could come into the proceedings in the same way. I am indebted to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) for indicating that I seem to be on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the situation, there does seem to be one fairly straightforward way of dealing with the problem and that is to apply the discretion that applies in the area of companies legislation. Where there is a situation where someone had apparently unintentionally acquired an interest and the view was taken that the major concern was to get into another industry altogether, that there was no apparent level of expertise that might even justify thinking about getting an interest in that area, one would allow the relevant authority-and that is probably the ABT-to grant a waiver for technical non-compliance. But, as I understand it, there is no provision in respect of the Tribunal for that to occur and the Tribunal, in one sense, has no choice but simply to step in. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in the past-and this is why this whole regulatory imbroglio has been getting worse and worse over the years-is that the Tribunal effectively defers these sorts of decisions. It puts them in the too-hard basket until they are ultimately resolved by other means. That is what we have seen with Bond. I suppose the slow legal processes have contributed to the length of time from when someone first took the view that Mr Bond might have been not a fit and proper person until the High Court finally resolved the matter. But, nonetheless, it took the Tribunal quite a deal of time to get around to that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way, it has taken a great deal of time to get around to other issues. That can, in part, be, of course, because of scarce resources and one is not critical of the Tribunal for that. But, in effect, it is quite a legitimate tactic, if it shares the community concern that there ought to be a waiver or that it ought not be compelled to inflict what could be quite a devastating corporate outcome on a company for technical non-compliance, for it simply to adjourn the matter. And that, I think, is what has been happening to date. But it is not at all a satisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are percentage interest multipliers that can apply on the way down. So, if Asahi has 20 per cent and that is multiplied by the 15 per cent that Elders might have or that South Australian Brewing might have in Austereo, we end up with an effective figure that can be below the level of prescribed interest-the 5 per cent threshold. That can apply in a number of areas. But, again, my information is that we cannot apply that reducing multiplier in this area. So, once it is determined that at some stage in the chain someone is in excess of 15 per cent, that person is gone. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will take the opportunity of the time that will be available between the conclusion of the second reading debate and the committee stage to give some serious examination to this issue and, at the very least, to report to the Senate on what it proposes to do about situations such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the second Bill-the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. There will be, as there were in the House of Representatives, some amendments moved to this Bill at the committee stage. But, essentially, the so-called efficiency package which has finally been introduced by the Government does contain a number of desirable improvements along the path of deregulation and we, therefore, welcome those initiatives, belated though they are. I think the industry itself has had some involvement by way of consultation and, as a result, I think what we do see in this Bill is a worthwhile endeavour to free up the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly in the area of licence renewals there has been a crying need to reduce the number of unnecessary applications. The way it used to work-and I suppose it still does, in a sense, until this Bill comes in-is that we can have, as I recall the Chairman of the ABT, Deidre O'Connor saying, the same effective decisions made on 54 occasions simply by looking at the technical licence holders around Australia. One is dealing with the same issue. They may be simply regional licensees or suburban metropolitan licensees but all of them could be in the Channel Nine stable and applying the same rules and principles. The Tribunal is making essentially the same decision. Yet, technically it has been required to conduct all these separate licence renewal applications, to call for submissions and generally clog up the system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will reduce by something like 90 per cent the number of share transactions that currently have to be approved by the Tribunal. We think that is a very desirable state of affairs. It will also allow for licences to be held for a period of up to five years instead of the current three. As I recall, there have been maybe one or two instances where licences have been granted for less than three years. </PARA>
<PARA> My view would be that one could almost justify the granting of licences in perpetuity. If this happened, we would not need these automatic licence renewal hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> One would introduce much more flexibility into the system so that, if at any stage it was thought there was sufficient reason to justify the withdrawal or suspension of a licence, one would put the licensee on notice that it would have to show cause why its licence should not be revoked or suspended. That seems to me to be a much more sensible system than the one that we have in place at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will allow the three years to become five years and that is an improvement. But, nonetheless, I still think licensees will have to go through some hearing processes that will not be altogether necessary. Like it or not, hearings involve very serious preparation. One has to start with the presumption that, unless one satisfies the Tribunal and satisfies all the concerns and the interest groups that might pop out of the woodwork at the renewal hearings, one might not get one's licence renewed. That, in many ways, is a fiction but, technically speaking, that is the way the system operates. I do not think that is particularly satisfactory. I think there ought to be a strong presumption of renewal unless there is material to indicate that the licence might be in jeopardy or ought to be placed in some jeopardy. Therefore, I think, this is a step in the right direction but the system could be freed up even further. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a change to the prescribed interest test in the application to television licences but, as I understand it, it does not address the particular case that I have been adverting to. The prescribed interest threshold being raised from 5 per cent to 15 per cent does go some way in that regard. Nonetheless, as I have described it, we would still have the same problem that exists at the present time because each of those holdings exceeds 15 per cent, no matter how remote they might ultimately be. </PARA>
<PARA> There are improvements in the area of loan arrangements. But one of the serious anomalies in this area which has not yet been addressed by legislation but to which my colleague Mr Brown referred to in the earlier debate was that this Government, pursuing no doubt its ideological desire to pander to the left wing, has brought in this extraordinary limitation on foreign ownership. But it has not, at the same time, suggested that there should be the same level of limitation on loans. </PARA>
<PARA> So, as things stand at the present time, if and when that legislation finally surfaces, we are going to have this across the board limit of 20 per cent on both licensee and holding companies but we are not going to have a limit on loans from foreigners who could ultimately be regarded as being in effective control. That is a nonsense situation. No doubt the Government will ultimately get around to making that a 20 per cent limit and will claim consistency. All it will be is a classic overreaction because it thinks that there are a few votes in xenophobia. But it will do nothing for improving the quality of input from foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA> There is all the power in the world, as we know, for the Tribunal to investigate any situations where it thinks that there is an excess of control, be it foreign or otherwise. It is a regrettable state of affairs that the Government has simply taken the sort of classically political response that it has. At least I would hope that it will try to address the inconsistencies that currently operate between ownership and loan arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of other matters that are dealt with by the Bill. But I do not think I need to deal with them in any detail other than to say that we will oppose the amendment in relation to networking because, as it stands at the moment, what the Government is saying is that, by virtue of network agreements which are not quite exclusive arrangements but give rights of first refusal, we can effectively have regional operating stations as slaves of the metropolitan networks, or tied to the chariot wheels of the networks, as Mr Brown described it. If that is the case, the audience reach limitations have been breached. The Government is, in effect, by this amendment saying, `Let us ignore all that. Let us allow these networking agreements to override what otherwise would seem to be a strong limitation'. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not understand the rationale for 60 per cent any more than the Government does. We know how it came about but the fact remains that what the Government is doing by way of this amendment is to ignore its own theoretical limit of 60 per cent. At the very least, we believe that it should not have sought to change the rules in midstream whilst there was litigation in process. It is a very undesirable state of affairs, in effect, to take away people's existing rights by changing the law in this way. I think at the end of the day it will need to resolve that contradiction between network agreements and the appropriate limits of audience reach. But, at the moment, they are fundamentally incompatible and we, therefore, oppose that particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA> We do think the Government has simply allowed for renewed uncertainty surrounding the foreign ownership proposals. It is extraordinary that we end up with this 20 per cent deal in broadcasting. I am not sure what we will ultimately see in the legislation, but my reading of what passed for a debate in the Australian Labor Party was that at one stage Mr Beazley was prepared to allow unlimited foreign ownership levels in relation to the new entrant. That is not even something that most of the major overseas telecommunications companies were seeking. It seemed to be an extraordinary attempt somehow to demonstrate that the Government was bending over backwards to accommodate a second entrant. It is a classic overreaction in the sense that this is a classic underreaction. </PARA>
<PARA> We think the Government is wrong on both counts. We hope that ultimately sanity will prevail. I do not think anyone wants to see majority of foreign ownership in the telecommunications industry any more than they want to see majority of foreign ownership of radio and television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> But there has to be a much more sensible limit than the arbitrary 20 per cent figure that the Government has plucked out of the air. We do not believe that there have been terribly many problems in recent years that would have justified that happening in any event. Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish to move the amendment circulated in the name of the Opposition. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> ``, but the Senate deplores the Government's hasty and ill-conceived attempt to bestow a vast new range of unpredictable and unnecessary powers on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in a desperate attempt to divert attention from its total failure to introduce any meaningful reforms of broadcasting regulation despite the Prime Minister's unequivocal 1987 election promise to `urgently reform this nightmarish legislation' ''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the state of our economy, our exporters and their markets are indeed a matter of crucial public interest. They are not just important to our future -they are imperative. Australian exporters can and do have amazing successes. Just two weeks ago, for example, the British media carried a story that the viability of the much heralded channel tunnel of the future was now in doubt. This was not because of any downturn in the English Channel traffic. Quite the contrary. It was all because of an Australian export-a Tasmanian designed and built catamaran which can drastically cut both cost and time to the public between the United Kingdom and France, so much so that research has determined that the public would be much more likely to opt for the catamaran trip than the tunnel charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The huge success of the catamaran export out of a small, determined and tenacious Tasmanian boatyard is something all of us ought to be proud of. In fact, I am sure my colleagues across the chamber, not the least yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, would admit to feeling some pride at its success on the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> So it defies logic that during this session of Parliament we expect the Government to preside over a Bill-the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill-which will most definitely spell the death of many Australian export ventures similar to that of the Tasmanian catamaran. Even worse, the man presiding over the damning legislation is none other than Senator John Button. His determination, despite months of lobbying from exporters, to barge ahead with the legislation, based on the recommendations of the Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance-better known as the Hughes committee-is not easily understood. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, this sort of action is not expected from a Minister who professes to be so worried about the effect his Government's economic policies are having on our `good' manufacturing industry that he breaks ranks and says so to the media. How could he make such statements when his own actions, by ignoring the problems of the Hughes report, are themselves threatening to `wipe out'-to use his words-many small `good' Australian manufacturers fighting for a place in the world's export markets?</PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Hughes committee are so out of kilter that in my State, South Australia, we will have the crazy situation of small companies which have won prestigious State awards for their hard won export successes being denied any further aid from the export development grants scheme. In other words, in many cases, thanks to the Federal Government and the proposed legislation, it is unlikely that they will be able to stay competing in the export arena. Award winners, hard workers, are in effect finished. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button has already pointed out, many of these companies are already battered and bruised by the Government's high interest rate policies. So on the one hand he is apologising but on the other hand he clearly has no compunction about adding to the pain and the suffering of those industries. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is wrong with the Hughes report? South Australia illustrates exactly what is wrong with it. Either it ignores or it refuses to accept that it is not only big companies that are battling for our much needed export dollar. Its views and its recommendations are aimed at big companies with big dollars to spend chasing and maintaining export markets around the world. Also, its views and its recommendations seem not to take into consideration the difficulties companies encounter hanging on to the export market once they get a grip of it. Again, this applies much more to small companies with fewer dollars and less resources to fall back upon. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State it is not just big companies but, in fact, mainly small to medium companies that are battling away to carve a name for themselves, their State and their country by selling quality and innovative goods that the world market wants. But what does Senator Button, with his Hughes report and his legislation, say to them? He says, `You must spend more than $50,000 chasing the export market instead of $10,000 before we will help you'. He says, `Even when you do, we will now only help with 50 per cent of the costs, instead of 70 per cent and we will then tax the grant at the corporate tax rate of 39 per cent'. Then he says, `After we have helped you eight times, no more-you are on your own'. So the picture becomes somewhat clearer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, which has so crippled the domestic small business sector, the very engine room of our economy, strikes again. And again-no surprise-small companies are the ones that are principally suffering. The reality is that many small companies do not have $15,000 to spend chasing an overseas market, let alone having to find $50,000. That does not mean their quest for a market cannot be successful; often it is. But the Government is saying, `We will not help you unless you spend a lot of money you cannot afford to, given the current economic circumstances in this country. And once you have established your overseas markets and the locals there have decided they can make a cheap copy of your product, we will withdraw financial support just when you need it to fight to keep the market that you have established overseas'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we know that, especially in South East Asia, Australian firms are constantly fighting the cheap local copies which spring up in the marketplace usually some three to four years after the Australian product has accessed that market and has been introduced. That simply does not just halt after eight years of export grants. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's economic climate of adverse exchange rates and high interest rates, the Australian exporter is struggling continually to maintain competitiveness and stay in the marketplace. Maintaining markets is a costly and time consuming task. Exporters generally agree that that is even more expensive than to set up the markets in the first place. Having accessed the markets, maintaining and expanding those markets does require-and clearly, this is demonstrated-continual effort on behalf of exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Government seriously believe that this, too, just stops after eight years? And where is the consideration in the Hughes report that small to medium firms may also be using each grant to attract new business as well as maintain existing markets? There is none. If the committee and the Government had set out to find a way to discourage small companies from venturing into exporting and to encourage many firms to retire from exporting, it could not have tried harder or perhaps more successfully. Incentive is not an ugly word if used correctly. In today's economic climate it is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian exporters suffer far more than those in other countries. We have got geographical problems in that we are remote from export markets. Our geography also means that we have very high shipping costs and long lead times. We suffer waterfront delays and added costs because of inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Government is saying that it is going to address some of these matters and micro-economic reform. Senator Collins has indicated to the Senate publicly that if he does not achieve substantial reform by the end of this year he will resign. I will just remind him that he has only a few weeks to go to deliver on that key promise and statement that he has made publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope he achieves in that short timeframe the benchmark that he set publicly, not so much so that he can keep his ministerial post but for the people, the exporters and job opportunities for Australians. That is the more important reason why I hope that over the next few weeks he actually achieves some of the objectives that he has put down for himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Our inflation rate versus that of our competitors is also a problem. It lets us down at every turn. Of course, we have already canvassed the Government's monetary policy and the high interest rates which are crippling business. Through all this we expect our exporters to cope. We are encouraging them to go out to assist us with our balance of payments and the like. And now Senator Button wants to make it even more difficult and frustrating for them. For someone who is supposed to be aiming to reduce the balance of payments, he is instead going a long way to ensuring it worsens as companies give up the fight. And give up the fight they will because it will become impossible and too difficult for them. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia many national companies such as Wolf Blass Wines and ROH Industries, which has made a name for itself by exporting car wheels to both Japan and America, have made vocal protests about the damage the Hughes report and the subsequent legislation will cause to their companies' export programs. Last year's State Bank export award winner, Concraft (S.A.) Pty Ltd, a small company which has cornered the Japanese market in garden ornaments, would now find itself ineligible for the very grant which enabled it to venture into exporting. It would disqualify itself from the grant that enabled it to establish a market in Japan. Where is the logic in that?</PARA>
<PARA> Already it is estimated that some 50 per cent of companies that set up an export market fail or withdraw within three years. That figure can only increase if Senator Button will not listen to sense and if the Government is hell bent on proceeding with implementing major recommendations of the Hughes report and introducing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has had the courage-and I think that ought to be acknowledged-to own up to a number of the Government's mistakes and publicly acknowledge them. Only this week we have seen him publicly acknowledge how the high interest rate policy direction of this Government over a number of years is starting to bite to the point that many businesses are being forced into bankruptcy. Personal trauma is being inflicted on individuals throughout this country. Thousands upon thousands of people are losing their jobs in this country. And the Government will not turn that around in five minutes. The point is that we have on the agenda, over the course of the next few months, a piece of legislation that will only compound the problem in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button has had the courage to acknowledge the failings of the Government in another area, does he have the courage to own up to his own in this particular field in proceeding to legislate to implement the Hughes recommendations?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I still believe in honour, Senator. Given this fundamental belief, I would like to think that those things which are said by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hewson, can be believed. It is kind of hard sometimes as one's faith does tend to be broken and shattered when the Opposition walks away from all that Mr Hewson might say. I can recall listening to numerous interviews of Mr Hewson -that tough, hairy-chested dry-after the Budget was brought down when Mr Hewson said to us that he supported the measures that we had taken: the tightening that we had undertaken in the Budget on this issue, the tax file numbers and computer matching, which so many on the other side now seek to walk away from. I would have thought that honour might have been maintained. If there is a suggestion in what Senator Alston has to say that this will be a thing of the past, that that honour has now gone and that the Opposition intends to honour nothing of what Mr Hewson has had to say, then certainly I will have to make some other arrangements for my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not personally authorised the sending out of this form. It is very hard to authorise the sending out of the thousands of forms that are sent out by my Department.

I presume that the Minister is referring to Dr Hewson and is deliberately trying to downplay his credentials by calling him Mr Hewson. The real point of my objection is that we have now had about three minutes worth of everything but an answer to the question. Mr President, I invite you to direct the Minister's attention to the requirements for relevance.

It is necessary, when one has start up dates some months down the track for this change and for a number of others, to begin preparations as early as possible. We have to let the people of Australia know what is in store for them; they have to make plans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did briefly see the article referred to by Senator Beahan. While I have no objection at all-in fact, it may well play a positive role-to establishing a board to encourage investment in Australian hardwood plantations, when I first read the article I took it on its face to be some sort of plea for a taxation break rather than something designed in the interests of promoting plantations directly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot comment on the validity of the claims that have been made; that is, that there is not sufficient investment in plantations as such. I do not know which plantations were referred to in the article as the ones that had not succeeded. I do not know whether they did not succeed because people did not want to invest in them, they were not properly promoted or marketed, or their management was not regarded by would-be investors as being sound. Not knowing any of those things, it is inappropriate for me to comment on the conclusions drawn by the article: that a lack of taxation benefits is in itself a reason why people do not invest, or that their fear of not getting a significant return on their investment is a reason why they do not invest.</PARA>
<PARA> I say that because I know that in Western Australia there are commercially successful Australian hardwood plantations. I know of one scheme run by Bunnings, a major timber company in Western Australia, called a trees on farmland proposal by which that company agrees with farmers to utilise marginal farmland for plantation forestry and promises to buy back matured trees after a given number of years at a guaranteed rate. I understand that scheme operates reasonably successfully.</PARA>
<PARA> I know of a scheme, too, that the Western Australian Government was involved in promoting called the tree trust proposal, which was aimed at afforestating areas of the Darling Escarpment to help with soil and salinity problems-land degradation problems-and, as well, supply the timber industry with a forestry resource.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Plantations Advisory Committee, which is a committee set up within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, is investigating all factors associated with the promotion of plantations, and will soon be offering the Government advice on a national plantation strategy to encourage their development. The question of taxation concessions has been raised in its consideration and doubtless the Committee will report on it.</PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a real interest these days in timber industries and companies exploiting the possibilities for the development of Australian hardwood plantations in order to obtain a secure resource for their future needs, and to overcome doubts or concerns about the availability of natural forestry resources. I will do whatever I can to encourage, on a commercial basis, the development of those plantations to meet the timber industry's future needs. I think that if they are properly managed they can be very good investments.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I totally reject the last part of Senator Lees' question. She calls it `negotiating the maze'. I really do not believe that Australians will accept the continued payment of unemployment benefits to people if they are not making some efforts to get a job, or if they are not undergoing some training. The Government undertakes special programs for people to make sure they get some training. The heart of the Government's philosophy of targeting is to make sure that unemployment benefits do not become permanent payments; to try to give people some opportunity to gain employment. I think that is a laudable objective. The Government's introduction of those targeting measures-including the measures to help with training, and activity tests to ensure that people are actually out there in the marketplace having a go-is the kind of measure that Australians would expect from the Government as a minimum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think we have adopted a policy that says: `If you are not literate and you are not numerate, and you cannot get a job, we will not pay you the benefit'. The policies are designed to make sure that if people have weaknesses in terms of skills, the Government helps them to improve the skills and, as a result of that, at least attempts some form of monitoring of people's efforts to use those skills to get jobs. But the payments do not cease if people cannot get a job. Provided people are honouring the obligation to try, the payments continue; so I reject the last part of the question.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the first part-that no Australian in need has been affected-I guess it will always come down to a definition of need, to what it is. I suppose we could all have an argument and say that we would like to see all those on incomes of less than $30,000 given more because they will have some needs. I guess that everyone, even those on higher incomes, considers that he or she has needs. The Government's responsibility, however, cannot be directed to all of them but must be directed to those at the very bottom end of the scale.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have tried to do is eliminate some forms of middle-class welfare where people are on what we would consider to be reasonable incomes and do not actually need it, and make sure that we have maintained, and in many cases increased, with measures such as the family allowance supplement being paid to low income families, welfare to those who are most in need. To have been able to do that at a time when it has been necessary to cut Government expenditure has been one of the great achievements of the Hawke Government. Had we not done that, had we adopted the cut $3 billion approach, the only way to do that would have been to hack into those at the bottom end of the scale, and the Government just will not be in that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do that, but I point out to all honourable senators that one of the problems for Ministers in answering questions is that these days they are customarily multifaceted. If one is asked a whole series of questions it is very hard to contain oneself to a short period in seeking to answer them all. When one is asked a question with four or five parts, as is normal, it is very difficult to contain the length of the answer. I hope that we can get from honourable senators some shortening of their questions. Then they might get answers to what they have asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am asked about the non-government agencies. Of course, there is a big burden on non-government agencies. That has never been denied. Unfortunately, particularly with family break-up and some of the worst reasons for it, we have seen very heavy burdens placed upon non-government agencies. I do not believe that, in a society where that kind of break-up has been increasing, any government can promise that there will not be burdens placed on non-government agencies. We are attempting to make sure that the longer term needs of these people are worked out and, in so far as it is possible, to help them with their short term needs. There are provisions for those in desperate need, but there will be some who slip through the Government net and they, of course, will have to rely upon non-government agencies. I do not think any government has ever been able to stop that; I do not know of any government in the world that has stopped it. I just believe that this Government throughout its 7 1/2 years has maintained as its highest priority getting help to those in need, and being able to do it in times of cuts to government expenditure has been, I think, an extraordinary achievement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Aulich and other senators will be interested to know that the Government is implementing an education program for ethnic communities which is aimed at those people with poor or no English skills. It seeks to provide them with information to which the rest of the community has access, because its aim is to ensure equity in consumer protection for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently a survey was done in relation to three communities: the Greek-speaking, Arabic-speaking-mainly Lebanese- and the Vietnamese communities. It showed that many of these communities were experiencing difficulties in asserting and ensuring their rights in relation to their role in our society as consumers. This was particularly the case, for example, in relation to the purchase of a car, which is a fundamental necessity when the move is made to employment or just to take part in the ordinary social life of our community. House repairs was also another area of great concern. In fact, in the review of the Vietnamese community some were said to be so despondent, and even suicidal, because of their inability to assert their rights that they were feeling extremely isolated in not being able to insist on those matters to do with warranties and their entitlements as consumers which we all take for granted, if we have the capacity in English to make our protest and vindicate our rights.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result, only last week in both Sydney and Melbourne I was able to launch campaigns for those three communities as a precursor to a wider campaign among other language groups in our community to enable people to be informed of their rights as consumers and to point them in the direction of those agencies where they might get assistance to help vindicate those rights. Indeed, I believe that the attendance of community representatives at those launches indicated their very real concern and appreciation for this campaign, which will largely be undertaken through the media-the electronic media, the radio in particular, the Special Broadcasting Service and other ethnic affairs and public affairs radio services.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that together with the use of the ethnic print media we will be able to get the message across and enable these fellow Australians to talk about their rights, to become aware of their rights and to assert those rights in the same way as do other Australians in our community.</PARA>

As I think all honourable senators will recall, in answer to questions in the Senate on this initiative some time ago, I think in the first session of this year, I explained that the setting up of the child support agency was within the Australian Taxation Office. It must be remembered that I am not responsible there. It is within the Taxation Office and not my Department, but I am answering the question because it is important. In setting up that agency, the Government certainly underestimated the extraordinary response that we would have to it. That being the case, it simply did not have enough people. So the Government announced that it would be examining the needs of that agency.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, the delays have come down to eight weeks from very much higher figures, and by the end of the year they will come down much further still as all those new people are hired, trained and come on stream. The Government was aware of this problem some time ago and it has taken a series of steps which are proving to be very successful in eliminating those delays. It should be noted that the introduction of that scheme has meant that many more sole parents are now receiving some support from non-custodial parents that simply was not there before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Does the Government consider that the settlements reached in metals, in building, in transport and yesterday in oil are consistent with accord mark 6? If so, when are the results of those negotiations likely to flow to others? Would the Minister agree that, prior to the election, expectation was built up amongst worker voters that the accord would deliver benefits to all, including those who rely on the decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission and the various State industrial tribunals? Finally, could the Minister confirm that accord mark 6 said that the focal point of the wage system must continue to be the national wage case and that, in addition, it was considered that the national wage case would be in September of this year? That has not occurred. When does he expect that the national wage case will take place?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that settlements have occurred in the building, transport and oil industries. My advice is that there is no settlement in the metals industry and that negotiations are proceeding. In fact, this week there was scheduled to be a national 24-hour strike by metal workers. That strike was called off because of discussions between the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Metal Trades Federation of Unions, which met with the MTIA on Monday. While I have no progress report as to how those negotiations are proceeding, I have an optimistic expectation that they might be concluded without further disputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also asked me whether these settlements conform with the provisions of the accord mark VI. The provisions of accord mark VI are, of course, for the percentage increase in the September quarter consumer price index to be reflected in a percentage increase in all wages; for, six months later, a $12 per week wage increase to be paid; for a 3 per cent increase in superannuation to be allocated, commencing in annual instalments of one per cent from May next year; and, in the case of the public sector, for there to be a recognition of market rates adjustments in public sector wages.</PARA>
<PARA> Also within the framework of accord mark VI, we have recognised a need to decentralise wage fixing from a highly centralised system to some extent to the enterprise levels and approved that there be framework negotiations within industries to set up frameworks for enterprise negotiations on achieved productivity and profitability in those enterprises and on the understanding that there be no double-counting of increases awarded at that level with increases that are awarded at the national level.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot comment on the detail of the negotiations in the sectors in which there have been settlements. I think it is more appropriate that the national wage case bench do that, because the accord contemplates that the national wage case bench would set down the guidelines for that enterprise level bargaining. Until the bench meets, hears submissions and makes a determination, it is inappropriate for me to say whether those settlements conform with guidelines it is yet to proclaim.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also asked when the national wage case hearing will commence. I agree that normally it would have proceeded in September. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the normal applicant, decided not to apply for a hearing then but to support negotiations, as the ACTU terms it, in the field. While it is not unusual for there to be direct negotiations, if I am asked to speculate-it is only an opinion, and an opinion only as an observer of industrial relations-I would say that if there was a settlement in the metals area, it is probably likely then that there would be an application for a national wage case hearing based on settlements in other sectors. I would then anticipate that the national wage case bench would consider accord mark VI and decide whether to endorse it and whether to name an operative date for the increases that have been agreed in all of the other sectors Senator Harradine has referred to, bearing in mind always that there have been agreements to increases but no operative date set for those increases. The operative date has been reserved for the national wage case bench to decide. I think that just about covers this matter, because once the national wage case bench makes the decision, clearly it will be a decision which varies all awards elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>

On those occasions I would have to say that, while I do not make that decision and it is made by the Department, I have not yet had brought to my attention any allegation that that has been done capriciously.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And over the horizon indeed, as Senator Watson says. The question relates to the potential amalgamation of three organisations representing employees who are professional people; that is engineers, scientists and architects. The Government's vision in terms of union amalgamation is to encourage union amalgamation along industry lines rather than along professional or, if one wishes to term it from a tradesman's point of view, a craft line, as this type of amalgamation would seem to contemplate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the primary focus of our vision is to encourage there to be one bargaining unit or one organisation in the workplace to bargain on behalf of all employees in the workplace. I can only trust that if these organisations were to amalgamate, that would be a stepping stone which would be a more coherent industry focus to occur. However, I think it is inappropriate for me to make any further remarks about the potential amalgamation of these organisations. The Association of Professional Engineers Australia and the Association of Professional Scientists Australia are two organisations registered in the Federal Industrial Relations Commission. They have jointly filed an application for their amalgamation to be approved by the Commission. Since that matter is proceeding, it is inappropriate for me to enlarge further on the merits of their particular claim.</PARA>
<PARA> The Association of Architects of Australia, the third organisation mentioned by Senator Cooney, is not a registered industrial organisation within the meaning of the Act and, therefore, could not be embraced in an amalgamation of registered organisations unless it sought to be registered in its own right or unless, with its consent, the two aforementioned organisations decided to enlarge their constitutions and had that recognised by the Commission to incorporate them in an amalgamation.</PARA>

I do not think I would need to consult with the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to give that undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken a very hard line against the poisoning of young athletes, as the honourable senator so correctly put it, but I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that any coach we have ever used or might use from East Germany has been involved. I will ask Mrs Kelly to check with the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission to see whether there is any evidence available. As I said, without consulting I can give an undertaking that we will certainly not be using a coach who has been involved in anabolic steroids.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan gave me some notice of this question. It is not a matter on which I am an instant expert, but I was able to obtain some information relating to the point of his question. There have been media reports, of course, that the Chinese authorities contrived a riot in Lhasa in March this year which led to the killing of some 450 Tibetans and the disappearance of a further 354 people. There were reports quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 October, sourced from something called the Tibet Information Network, that the Chinese authorities quashed demonstrations in Lhasa on three dates in September 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 23 May this year the Asia Forum for Tibet, a Hong Kong based human rights information group, alleged that during the six months prior to 1 May 1990 up to 2,000 people were executed in Tibet. On 29 May 1990 a report by the United States based human rights monitoring organisation, Asia Watch, also made serious allegations concerning human rights violations in Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA> I am unable to verify these claims, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has asked the Australian Embassy in Beijing to look into this matter and, if true, human rights abuses of this scale would be a matter of the gravest concern to this Government. I must say that on 1 May 1990, when there was a lifting of martial law and reported easings on restrictions of travel by foreigners to Tibet, the Government welcomed that fact but took the view that the measures did not go far enough because there were still indications of repressive behaviour in Tibet by the Chinese authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, has indicated that the Government has continued to convey to China our deep concern over human rights issues in Tibet. In July 1988, Mr Hayden raised the issue of human rights in Tibet with senior Chinese leaders. On 21 November 1989 the Embassy made representations on behalf of a Tibetan prisoner of conscience and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has raised Australia's concerns three times: with the Foreign Minister, Mr Chee-en Chee Chen in July 1988 at the Paris Conference; in October 1989 at meetings in New York; and with the Minister for Metallurgical Industry, Mr Qi Yuanjing, in Canberra on 9 May 1990. Concerns were also raised with the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> Human rights issues were again raised during Dr Blewett's visits to China in early September when he sought responses from the Chinese Government on numerous cases of alleged human rights abuses. We have not had a response to those requests by Dr Blewett.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Powell asked me a question about Palestinian demonstrators. I seek leave to have a somewhat lengthy, up-to-date answer to that question incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The reply read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Powell asked several questions in relation to the deaths of more than 20 Palestinian demonstrators in East Jerusalem on 8 October. I took some aspects of these questions on notice and now provide detailed responses.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell asked why is it consistent to suspend ministerial contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation over its position on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while maintaining ministerial contact with the Israeli Government, in view of these killings and the systematic denial of basic rights to Palestinians in the occupied territories.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister made clear in a parliamentary answer on 22 August that Australia has been prepared to maintain a high level dialogue with the PLO when in our judgment that would contribute directly and constructively to the achievement of peace in the Middle East. The Prime Minister also made clear that were the PLO to undertake specific action, and in particular terrorist action, in support of Iraq this would obviously lead to an immediate reconsideration of our attitude to it. We do not rule out ministerial level dialogue with PLO officials if that might contribute to peace, but we have no plans for such meetings for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell asked does the Government accept that a failure by the United Nations Security Council to act decisively on the situation on the occupied territories will greatly undermine the credibility built up by the Council in its concerted response to Iraq's invasion.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made clear that there can be no linkage between the resolution of the Gulf crisis and the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The requirements for a resolution of the Gulf crisis are clearly stated in the United Nations Security Council resolutions:</PARA>
<PARA> The unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait;</PARA>
<PARA> The restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait;</PARA>
<PARA> The departure of all foreign nationals who wish to leave Iraq and Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> However, as United States Secretary of State Baker has said, and as Senator Evans noted on 17 September, an appropriate resolution of the Gulf conflict could be used as a 'spring board' for the achievement of more satisfactory security arrangements in the region, and indeed for the negotiation and resolution of such deep and bitter conflicts as the Arab-Israeli dispute. The Security Council is still considering its response to the tragic incident in East Jerusalem on 8 October.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell asked whether the Government will convey to the Bush Administration the need for such action-that is, decisive action following the deaths of Palestinian demonstrators in East Jerusalem on 8 October-including the sending of a UN mission to the occupied territories.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States itself is obviously seized of the importance of international action in response to this week's incident. The United States has, in fact, sponsored a resolution which envisages a UN mission to investigate the incident.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell asked whether the Government will resume ministerial contact with the PLO. This question is covered by my response to Senator Powell's first question.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Australia's policy towards the Middle East is based on two main premises: we are committed to Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised boundaries; we recognise the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, including their right, if they so choose, to independence and the possibility of their own independent state.</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation's business plan was prepared at the request of the Government. It represents the strategies which the Corporation proposes to implement as its response to the events in the wool market for the first three months of 1990-91. The business plan is a commercial in-confidence document and was considered by Cabinet on Monday of this week. As a result of Cabinet's consideration of the plan, certain aspects relating to the legislative changes have been announced by Mr Kerin. However, in relation to other elements of the plan, it is the prerogative of the Australian Wool Corporation to decide whether to release this information. As it contains detailed market analysis information, it is questionable whether the Australian Wool Corporation would consider releasing the plan to the public.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston asked me a question during Question Time on the sending out of a form. I have a response. Family allowances are payable under the Social Security Act on a calendar year basis. To be in a position to pay eligible families from the beginning of the 1991 entitlement year all reviews need to be completed by the middle of December 1990. To meet this deadline it is necessary to send out family allowance review forms by the end of September to enable sufficient time for return of forms and for processing by the Department of almost two million family allowance payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Budget it was announced that the Government proposed to legislate for an assets test to be effective for family allowance from 1 January 1991. The options for the Department were: firstly, to send out forms with no reference to an assets test so that when the assets test legislation was passed a further form would have to be sent to family allowance recipients at a cost of $400,000 in postage alone; or, secondly, to send out forms with a question on the proposed assets test at no additional cost to taxpayers and with considerable administrative savings.</PARA>
<PARA> In the latter case, if legislation was not passed those who indicated that they have affecting assets are easily identified and can be contacted to ensure family allowance is paid if they meet the income test. The mailing cost of this step, if it were necessary, would be about $33,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has attempted to save the Commonwealth several hundred thousands of dollars. Given the question in the Senate this week about the expenditure of $800, I think that is not unreasonable. I do, however, believe that there should have been a reference to the fact that legislation was not passed. I will certainly be informing the Department that I will insist on that reference at any future time when it seeks, for the right reasons, to have government money saved but fails to notify people that the legislation has not yet been passed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-To the extent that Senator Crowley has made reference to the resolution of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I put on the record that that resolution was not unanimous and did not have the support of slightly less than half the members of that particular Standing Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view, the Committee, under the chairmanship of then Senator John Black, did quite invaluable work with the terms of reference it undertook. Other than the Dubin Canadian inquiry that was set up by the Canadian Government following the Ben Johnson incident at the Seoul Games, there has been no report of the nature of the interim report and the second report that were tabled in the Senate as a result of the endeavours of that Committee. As a modest member of that Committee, it is my view that the contribution that that Committee has made has been quite invaluable in terms of probing some of the areas in sport in Australia, particularly relating to drug use. </PARA>
<PARA> It has not always been a popular committee, least of all amongst those who have most to lose as a result of its revelations. It has been required to confront the degree of use and abuse of drugs in sport in Australia, not only at elite level but even down to those who indulge themselves in sport at a social level at the weekends. The revelations have not been particularly attractive. They show that Australia is in main stream in terms of the level of abuse, and they demonstrate that a very significant number of elite sportsmen and sportswomen who have represented this country have, at one time or another, sought to enhance their performances by the use of performance enhancing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have looked to see what level of collusion and encouragement has been given to those athletes by their coaches, and what level of ignorance has been demonstrated by the administrators and sporting officials-the blazer brigade, as they are commonly known. It has not been a particularly attractive revelation. It seems to me that the vast majority of senior administrators have been more concerned to ensure that there is no embarrassment to sport in Australia by the detection of the use of drugs by athletes, rather than to exhibit a real, deep concern about the matter and a commitment to root out the evils of cheating in sport and the disgrace which that brings to the sport and, perhaps, consequentially, to the country that is represented. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to look at the diligence of successive governments in pursuit of this problem. We have focused to a degree on the Australia Institute of Sport as a result of evidence that has been given to us. It is no modest disappointment to me to see the number of athletes that came before us who, under oath, admitted to the use of drugs while being scholarship-holders at the Institute of Sport. Of course, that caused us to look at the efficacy of the drug testing regime at the institute. We were sad to discover that perhaps 90 per cent of the tests were found to be, by any measure, invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have, at least, put the issue on the agenda and forced those who are responsible to deal with it. For my part, I have been particularly encouraged by the enthusiasm and commitment of officials in professional sport to deal with the problem. We have seen it with rugby league in Sydney, where officials have been quite unrelenting in their pursuit of a clean sport, to the extent that they have even tested for recreational drugs. I believe they have done it because they want a good, clean, even playing field for their sport. I have not detected the same degree of enthusiasm about this matter among officials associated with what used to be described as amateur sport. They seem to me to be more concerned that things look right. We discovered that the Australian Olympic Federation gave our athletes six months notice before the Seoul Olympics that they were going to be tested, and that is hardly a way to ensure that the cheats get caught. What it does is give them fair notice that if they do not get off the gear-as it is called-they will get caught. For anabolic steroids, a fortnight is enough notice. When the pentathlete Alex Watson was detected as having used a drug- the one person who has been unfairly and harshly treated-they were so embarrassed with him that they were determined to bury him. Their attitude towards him was not one of seeking to clean up the problem; it was one of seeking to bury it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas that the Committee ought to be probing. It is a question of educating the community. There is an abysmal lack of knowledge and understanding of the diabolical effect that anabolic steroids and other performance enhancing drugs can have on the human body. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases where it is understood, elite sports men and women are saying that they would still risk death with that knowledge if it meant the prospect of winning a gold medal. That is a very real challenge for any government to overcome. We have taken evidence about children as young as 12 years of age being taken to doctors by their parents for the purpose of getting a prescription for anabolic steroids. One of the evils of anabolic steroids is that they stunt growth. They close the bone ends the moment they are taken. For these children who have not even gone through puberty, it was a grave effect upon their growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important area that the Committee has not addressed is the whole philosophic question of the use of drugs in sport. Whether we are concerned about health, about an even playing field or just about cheating, there seems to be confusion. When I asked the Australian Olympic Federation what its attitude would be towards the manufacture of a synthetic drug that showed no side effects, caused no ill- health and was freely available and therefore would create an even playing field, it was confused about the question. It had not addressed it. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the sorts of areas that we ought to be probing. They are the sorts of areas we have to learn to understand and for which we will have to develop a philosophic framework which at least gives us a proper sense of direction so that we understand the reasons why we do not believe that we should have drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other problems that have not been addressed. For instance, as I said yesterday, beta blockers are on the list of proscribed drugs compiled by the International Olympic Federation, yet diazepam, for instance, commonly known as valium, is not. Yet it has exactly the same effect-in a different way, as Senator Crowley would tell me but essentially the same. </PARA>

<PARA> It is now just on six months since this responsibility for Social Security was foisted upon a very reluctant Minister. We all know that he drew the short straw and that Senator Robert Ray managed to pick up the plum job.

Those who follow his actions and attitudes know that it goes a bit deeper than that.

He is clearly not interested in seeing the proper budgetary processes operate or indeed to participate sensibly in the economic expenditure committee with an open mind. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Richardson has expressed an interest in Senator Button's portfolio, if it becomes available; he has pontificated about why the Government managed to hold the green vote and why that was responsible for the election win; he has confirmed that the leadership of the Australian Labor Party is a live issue; he has said that Ministers should exercise restraint and not speak outside their portfolios, which I would have thought is the height of double standards. He attacks Senator Walsh for criticising Government decisions after leaving Cabinet. He shafted Mr Dawkins for bagging him to the media. He criticised Senator Button for speaking out against the Government. He claimed that if he had spoken out like other Ministers he would have been fired. I do not know what yesterday's effort deserved but we have not heard much from the Prime Minister on that. </PARA>
<PARA> He denied being involved in any attempt to oust Mr Willis from the ministry of Finance or indeed from the Cabinet, but I think Mr Willis's words on that were much more eloquent than Senator Richardson's denials. Of course, in recent times we have had these amazing little mickey mouse schemes of establishing some sort of trust arrangement to enable the proceeds of asset sales to be used for infrastructure projects. He supported, of course, the Beazley proposal on telecommunications, but unfortunately got rolled there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He supported the wrong one, of course. He supported the Beazley proposal for all the right factional reasons but for all the wrong national interest reasons. His having spent all his time in those areas, I think we can properly describe him-with thanks to Senator Peter Baume and apologies to the Mikado-as the Minister who dabbles in enthusiastic tone in every conceivable subject area and every portfolio but his own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I want to do is to actually look at some of the administrative efforts that Senator Richardson has presided over in the last six months. We heard him say today that maintenance payments under the child support scheme are now down to eight weeks. I have had recent information conveyed to my office of people who have been waiting not three months but six months. In one instance, a constituent applied to the Child Support Agency in March of 1990 and received no money or information until the day before she contacted the office of a member of parliament in sheer frustration. Then she received a letter telling her that she would not receive any maintenance for the month of July. In other words, from March to July she received not only no money but also no correspondence; and, of course, six months later she had still received no money. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other episode, someone who applied at the end of July, with the help of the Department of Social Security, simply received a notification that she had been put on the register on 4 September and that the first payment would come through on 7 October. I hope that Senator Richardson can explain why it takes a month between being put on the register and receiving one's first payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The next episode, which I am sure the Minister finds equally amusing, was the $848 worth of contracting out, and again I would have thought that that was a very serious matter. Mr Murphy said, as reported in Estimates Committee C Hansard on page 269:</PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that the letters which have been written in the Department, and there have been numerous drafts over the years, have been the subject of complaints by people who are representing clients. It was in order to get away from the departmental approach to writing letters of this sort that the decision was taken to go outside. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there are 16,000 employees in the Department of Social Security and none of them are capable of writing a letter, despite presumably having every opportunity to get advice from outside and to attend seminars, briefings, conferences and the like. So, rather than employing experts we have this absurd charade of contracting out. If it can be contracted out in that area, I would have thought there must be an enormous amount of other activities that could also be contracted out. </PARA>
<PARA> The third episode that I think is equally of concern to Senator Richardson, or ought to be, involves a decision relating to the payment of invalid pensions. My colleague Senator Herron will deal with this area in much more detail because he has a great degree of expert knowledge. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not profess to be an expert in this area, and it is quite clear from Senator Richardson's actions that he would not even have the hide to claim that either. Let me just give one example that was recently relayed to me. A person who applied for an invalid pension in 1987 happened to have come to the country on a temporary visa. Three days after the visa expired, she claimed to have injured her back whilst lifting her adult son. She was then granted an invalid pension and remained on that pension for three years before the Department realised that she had never been entitled to it in the first place because she was an illegal immigrant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department decided it would change this recipient over to special benefits. It sent a doctor to her premises on the basis that she claimed to have been bedridden. When she was not home, the Department decided to take some action. At that stage her son went to the office of a member of parliament and complained bitterly that she was getting a rough deal. Of course, the son complained to the wrong member of parliament. A staff member of that office rang the Department and was told:</PARA>
<PARA>She'll still get paid the $360 Invalid Pension benefit for the next fortnight as the computer records haven't been changed in time. Next fortnight she goes on to Special Benefits, and she will also get a $50 p.w. rent subsidy. She lives with her son in a Housing Commission low rent flat, but he claims she pays him this money. </PARA>
<PARA>The woman visits her country of origin regularly and her last absence from the country was for 19 months, during which time she received her invalid pension.</PARA>
<PARA> There are other examples that have come to my attention from officers within the Department from sheer frustration. In one instance we had information from an officer in a metropolitan regional area that at least nine transactions in three days had been processed for payment when they should have been further investigated, that there were no checks on personal data update, that many unemployment benefit forms are partially filled in and some questions referring to income are ignored, that payment is made with no follow-up interview, and even declared income is happily ignored and the computer records are often not amended for a considerable time. Again, this is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter referred to me is that oft-repeated claim that people cannot get unemployment benefits unless they personally attend the Department's office and hand in the form. The form says:</PARA>
<PARA>You MUST return the form ON the date shown. </PARA>
<PARA>My information is that one suburban office has a box in which the forms can be placed. So anyone can drop a form in and there is no attempt to verify that the claimant is returning a form. The form also says:</PARA>
<PARA>You must get the CES to stamp the form first unless you have been told otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, there are some classic outs in this area. Another matter of great concern, in view of the fact that Senator Richardson conceded the other day that the amnesty had come in well below estimates, is a letter from a national amnesty coordinator writing to regional officers advising that a person suspected of having received overpayments, irrespective of whether they might be ineligible due to deliberate fraud, had been receiving forms. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA>It has come to our attention that Regional Offices have been sending Amnesty Applications to clients that appear on Suspected Overpayment Facilities (SOF) listings without checking whether it is appropriate to do so in each case. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite that, of the estimated $55m we have only $40m. I seek leave to table the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter of particular concern relates to Senator Richardson's answer to the Senate today about the practice of the Department in paying moneys that have been ordered to be paid by the Social Security Administrative Tribunal. The guidelines in existence make it patently clear that the Department reserves to itself the right not to pay even when it has been ordered to pay. The best that Senator Richardson could do when making a meal of the answer was to suggest that the Department does not appeal as of course; it does so only when the Department considers a dangerous precedent might be set. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that according to the guidelines which have been made available to me, the Department takes the view that it does not have to pay even if it has not appealed and even where it has not sought a stay. Even if the Department seeks a stay, it nevertheless withholds payment. In one instance brought to my attention this week payments were cut off in June this year on the basis that the recipient was not serious about looking for work. He appealed and won and it is now two months since that decision was made. Yet, he has received no money because the Department says that it is appealing. Now, the Department will seek a stay. In other words, the Department has taken it upon itself not to pay, to ignore the ruling of the Tribunal. The guidelines say:</PARA>
<PARA>The position appears to be that where a decision awarding payments is made by the SSAT, that decision, unless otherwise specified, comes into force on the day the decision is made-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, the Department admits liability-</PARA>
<PARA>It creates a liability on the Secretary ... to make those payments to the claimant. If they are not made the claimant may take action in the courts to enforce that payment. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Department can choose not to pay and then it is up to the poor unfortunate recipient to take legal action in the courts to enforce payment. That is a preposterous proposal. I hope the Minister will acknowledge the absurdity and unfairness of that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that if that is the prevailing wisdom, the Department has lost the place. This bureaucratic zealousness sits extraordinarily against the level of over-payments that we have heard about recently, something of the order of $90m last year. The Department has waived payment of $5.8m where it says that moneys have been paid out in good faith and yet, against that background of something like $90m to $100m being paid out when it should not have been paid out, we have this penny-pinching attempt to somehow save a few extra dollars from people who have been found to be entitled to payment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that that would be the height of absurdity, and it is yet another example of what Senator Richardson has been missing in the last six months, and a good example of why he ought to take a lot more interest in proceedings than he has in recent times, apart from wandering around the world on unnecessary trips, talking about treaties that are entirely premature and, even in Australia, spending a lot more time doing other things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He had a lot of nice things to say that night. Members of the community were not at all impressed and did not see any need for Senator Richardson to wander off to Greece prior to these consultations having been properly concluded. I now turn to the form, and I note that at the very end of the supplementary answer that the Minister gave he acknowledged that it was improper for the Department not to have adverted to the fact that legislation has not been put in place. I ask him to advise the Senate on how many other occasions this has happened in the past, and to guarantee that it will not happen again under his tenure, because the form quite clearly says, `If the net market value of you or your partner's assets is less than $300,000, you will continue to get the family allowance'. It makes no mention at all of being contingent upon any legislation being passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter I advert to is again an extraordinary episode. Senator Richardson has been pretending for months and months that there have been no administrative problems; there are no high levels of overpayment. He described $20m last year as a phenomenal track record, and generally suggested that somehow there was nothing much that could be saved. All of a sudden we now find him sticking to this figure of $400m. I would like to know where he gets it from because his Budget initiatives providing measures to improve compliance and reviews, computer matching, amnesty, accelerated claimant matching, local review teams, review of files of pensioners overseas; that seems to be it. In my calculations that totals $863m over a three-year period, which is less than $300m a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is extraordinary. Senator Richardson has never said for a moment that we will be losing $400m from year four. He has said that we are currently losing $400m a year. I would be delighted if he would clear that up for us. Another matter I want to refer to, and perhaps I will leave the details of this for a later time, is a classic example of the low morale and the administrative problems that persist in the Department. I refer to some minutes of a meeting of Department of Social Security (DSS) officers this year. One of the officers reported that the area manager had said that staff should get used to providing a lower standard of service to clients, but the other officer said in his opinion a 2 1/2 hour counter wait was of a low enough standard and there was no need to cut back further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now move on to the extraordinary behaviour of the Minister's Department in circularising all senior officers of the Department about any attempts I might make to visit regional offices. I think the matter has already been publicly ventilated, but it was forwarded to me by a bemused DSS employee who said, `Presumably area managers are considered in Canberra to be as tactless and untrustworthy as regional office managers'. I find it extraordinary that when we are supposed to be saving money all these officers are being told that there have to be at least three people present at all times and all matters have to be relayed to the Minister and the Secretary as soon as I go anywhere near a departmental office. </PARA>
<PARA> That is based on extraordinary sensitivity arising from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald a few months back when a regional officer of the Darlinghurst office, writing in that newspaper, said that his regional office had been paying out something of the order of $40m a year. He said that at the end of the year a balance sheet would show that it had conceived of no plan for relief of local poverty, had developed no strategy on drug or alcohol abuse, had seen a rapid decline in the available accommodation for the poor in the area, had lost 75 per cent of its staff and had ended up with a highly unskilled work force. He said it was quite clear that the Department of Social Security was unable to meet the needs of those clients and yet $1.2m was being spent on paying the officials to run that office. I would be fascinated to hear the Minister explain what steps have been taken to cure the problem at the Darlinghurst office. I hope we will not hear that it is simply a disgruntled employee because it seems to me that it is a very poignant account by an obviously concerned and dedicated insider who has proposed a number of constructive ways in which the Department might be able to better spend its resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that what we have here is a litany of examples of maladministration about which Senator Richardson has shown absolutely no insight and certainly no concern. We will hear a few bits of political rhetoric, but I doubt very much whether we will see any effective action. If Senator Richardson cannot stomach social security, he ought to have the courage to go and tell the Prime Minister and move on to greener pastures. But if he is to stay in this area much longer, I can assure him that we will be expecting him to lift his game. </PARA>

<PARA> Turning to Senator Alston's attack-if that is what it can be laughingly called-the concentration of Senator Alston and the Opposition has always been, and will always be, upon the odd case that comes to light of some outrageous behaviour on the part of a social security client or social security officer. There are so many social security clients-we are looking at millions upon millions-that there will always be a fascinating case that we can point to of an overpayment or a fraud. We will never totally eliminate that from all those millions and millions of cases. However, the responsibility of administration is to make sure that those amounts are minimised. In a couple of ways that has been done and I will come to those during this contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say, however, on behalf of the 17,000 people who work in the Department of Social Security (DSS), that they are people who run a magnificent administration. They put in an enormous number of hours, often under great stress, and I resent any attack on them. I do not mind being fair game myself, but the only conclusion one could draw from Senator Alston's contribution was his attack upon employees as well. Those employees, I believe, do a magnificent job. </PARA>
<PARA> First off, let us go through what has happened in social security in recent years. We have seen phenomenal change. There has been an incredible amount of change during the last few years as during the life of the Hawke Government we have sought, for the first time in this country's history, to target welfare payments. Those advances in policy administration, in automatic data processing systems and in improving the integrity of the social security system have put us in advance of literally any other country. Judging from the number of people from other administrations around the world who are coming here to see how it is done-we are now seeing practices that we have adopted in the last few years adopted in other countries-it is obvious that informed people see Australia as a model for social security policy and administration.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some facts. DSS makes payments to nearly 4 1/2 million people, with expenditure in 1990-91 of $23.7 billion. That is an extraordinary amount of money. It represents more than a quarter of Commonwealth outlays. Of course, funds are also spent on behalf of other agencies and countries. The DSS client-based computing systems produce over 140 million payments a year and 35 million client advices each year. In spite of those 140 million payments and more than 35 million client advices, its administrative costs amount to 3 per cent of total outlays. One wonders how many companies in private industry in Australia can boast that kind of record. It is amazing. It is a tribute, I believe, not to myself-I certainly will not claim any credit for it-but to Don Grimes and Brian Howe who, in the periods of their administration, did so much to tighten up the administration of this Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only can the Department boast that 3 per cent record in administrative costs compared with outlays, but also it has managed to deliver that service in a highly decentralised form-over 300 offices around Australia delivering a service yet keeping costs down to what they are today. That I believe is an achievement that is unmatched by any other department in this Government. I do not know of any private companies which can do as well. </PARA>
<PARA> One must also look at our computing network. It is virtually the largest in the country. It is an integrated network of eight large Amdahl mainframe computers; 300 Wang mini-computers; and over 15,000 work stations. In excess of 99.9 per cent of DSS pensions, benefits and allowances are paid on time. In a situation when there are millions of decisions which are appealable, there are only about 6,000 appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal a year-around half the number of two years ago. Apparently, that is supposed to point to administrative problems-6,000 appeals out of millions upon millions of decisions. By the way, two-thirds of those appeals result in decisions in favour of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the enormous majority of our client population, people who do not appeal, see this as an efficient system. Of all those millions of payments, under 100 complaints are lodged with the Ombudsman each year about the social security administration, and yet I am supposed to address massive problems. Where the hell are they? As a proportion of gross domestic product, social security outlays have declined in recent years from 7.2 per cent in 1983 to 6 per cent now while, at the same time, virtually every payment has increased in real value.</PARA>
<PARA> We then have to look at the management of change, and this Government has been about change. There have been over 300 major policy and administrative changes in social security since 1986 alone. There is not the slightest doubt that the integrity of the system has been enhanced substantially because of the tightening of proof of identity, the requirement for personal lodgment of forms, the introduction of mobile review teams, automatic data processing systems, the introduction of matching of Department of Social Security data using new technology, and the tighter targeting of payments. What more can any administration be expected to do?</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time there has been a dramatic initiative in changing the Department of Social Security from being just a passive payment agency to being a key component in an active strategy to help people to overcome their disadvantages, become rehabilitated where necessary, or to obtain employment and be less reliant on social security in the future. This can be seen in programs such as jobs, education and training, new start, the job search allowance, child support and financial information services for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The retirement incomes policy announced in the 1989 Budget set a new direction for Australian society, and that is what the Department has been about doing all of these years. A great tribute must be paid to my two predecessors in this portfolio. In the area of family payments, we have seen massive increases in family allowances and the introduction of the family allowance supplement. For the first time they have been targeted because we have had real tests on income and we are about to have real tests on assets. It is worth noting, especially for Senator Lees, who has a legitimate and correct concern for all of these Australians at the bottom end of the scale, that we are looking now at just on 200,000 Australian families receiving the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously all of these changes-and there are just so many of them-added to the ones announced in the Budget, must impose strains on any administration. For the staff of the Department of Social Security, there is, of course, the added problem of dealing very often with people coming into the offices under stress, and that stress must transfer to those behind the counter. If one had walked into a DSS office after someone had brandished a knife one would know the kind of feelings that so many people on the staff must experience. Yet for all of that, the number of complaints against staff has dropped off dramatically because the staff is now well trained and well able to cope with all of these new strains. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned that I believe our staff has coped quite magnificently with all of those changes and the improvements in services to clients. At the same time as we have been coping with that, we have managed to spread the net of offices that supply those services to Australia. We now have offices right around the country. We now have a massive staff training scheme, with large increases in it announced in the course of the last few years. We have managed to improve administration and management every single year. As a result of the measures taken in this Budget, we are taking some further steps to do that once again. </PARA>
<PARA> With all of that splendid, marvellous record of improvements in administration, we have a matter of public importance raised by the Opposition to focus on a few minor blemishes which, as I said, can never and will never be eliminated. I cannot promise that out of millions of payments there will not be a mistake-of course there will- but what this Government is determined to do is to make sure that, where there is fraud, we find it; to make sure that, where there are overpayments, we find them and have them recovered. In the case of fraud, the Government will pursue those who have perpetrated the frauds. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the Senate Estimates committee process, one gets a fair idea of the kind of preoccupations of members of this Opposition. They spent more time in pursuing an $848 consultancy payment than on major programs involving the expenditure of more than $20 billion. The Opposition has a fixation with the minutiae of administration. It is more concerned with its own middle-class preoccupations, about bashing sole parents, about bashing unemployment beneficiaries, and about bashing invalid pensioners, than it is in ensuring that Australia provides an adequate payment to those who are in real need, than it is with the provision of sound administration, than it is with measures to ensure that the real cheats are caught by using modern technology for matching information about recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> For all of that, for this accusation of my failure to deal with administrative problems, I only wish I had the time today to go through all of the interviews and press releases that have been released by Senator Alston over time. I do not have the time, but I will just go through a couple. There was an interview between Senator Alston and Sonya Voumard of the Age on 1 August. There is a great quote out of this interview showing the depth of knowledge of the shadow Minister, who gets up and criticises me today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>At least 51 per cent of those clients granted the invalid pension in 1988-89 did not fulfil the requirement of 42.5 per cent impairment, as laid out in the Act. Further 16.6 per cent did not fulfil DSS' own internal directives that invalid pension beneficiaries have 30 per cent impairment. There is profound bunching around the 30 to 39 per cent category. </PARA>
<PARA>I assume, of course, that Senator Alston stands by all of that. Stunned silence we get from Senator Alston, not even so much as a nod. `Will I or won't I?', he thinks to himself. `Should I own up or should I not?'. The answer is, of course, that he should not. I really worry about the honourable senator First of all, there is not a mandatory requirement of 42.5 per cent impairment in the legislation. That is just plain wrong. What we do about it, I do not really know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is good. Senator Alston is now admitting that he believes there is a 42.5 per cent impairment threshold in the Act. Is that what he is saying? `Will I or won't I?'. Here we go again. What paragraph 27b does contain is a requirement that a person's incapacity for work must derive primarily from medical impairment. That, of course, is a qualitative judgment; it is not an impairment threshold. Senator Alston is confusing impairment and incapacity and has always seen them as synonymous. I did indicate in the Senate in the last few days where that can be different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing to point out about that silly interview is that the DSS policy manual does not require that all claims be rejected where the claimant has less than 30 per cent impairment. Thirty per cent impairment is used as a useful rule of thumb in the interests of good administration; it has never been and certainly is not any inflexible threshold. When one looks at the huffing and puffing from Senator Alston, one is startled sometimes at the level of ignorance. I have to say, by the way, to Senator Alston that this is still a democracy and he does have a right to be ignorant. What I really wish is that he would not demonstrate that ignorance so often. Senator Alston is militantly ignorant. If I were him I would be passively ignorant. I would try to keep this a bit of a secret; I would not try to let everybody know. But occasionally he does give us the opportunity of exposing just a little bit of it-never enough, just the odd bit. Senator Alston's extraordinary efforts in trying to look at overpayments have always worried me. He never quite understood the amount of money to be recovered that went back over 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wonder about his understanding of the difference between what we can recover now through sending out review teams to knock on doors and discover anomalies and what we can do when new technology is available. There is obviously a difference. When new technology becomes available-as it is now-whereby we can find out what goes wrong in payments, where people are double dipping and where they are claiming are too much, we have got a duty to the Australian taxpayer to use that technology and we will live up to every inch of that duty. We are not going to walk away from it-not now and not ever.</PARA>
<PARA> In this whole argument I hope it is remembered that those who seek to cheat the system have these extraordinary savings, hundreds of millions of dollars, in their pockets. Senator Alston claims that he wants to knock $3 billion off government expenditure. How will he do that? He will have his hand in the wallets and pockets of every poor person in this nation. We are here to stop him ever doing that. This Government has presided over the most comprehensive evaluation of social security policies and programs ever undertaken. It has supervised vast improvements in social security programs. It has boosted the integrity of the social security system, and it has done all of this while making savings of $8 billion in total in social security since 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders what more could be expected of any of the Ministers or of anyone else involved in the administration of social security. Those 17,000 people have done a magnificent job. They deserve the praise of everyone in the Senate-not the criticism. Ministers Grimes and Howe deserve the thanks and praise of the Australian people for finally targeting welfare to those most in need, for leading the world in the targeting of that welfare and for ensuring that all over the world governments find out how to do it. </PARA>

As Senator Richardson would well know, that is a rule of thumb that has been applied and, therefore, equates to what I have consistently said-that is, it is effectively a 42.5 per cent test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to comment on this matter of public importance raised by Senator Alston today. The administrative shortcomings of the Department of Social Security (DSS) and, indeed, the failure of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) to adequately address them have been of great concern to the Australian Democrats for quite some time. After all, it is the group of people most in need who are among the most disadvantaged by this Government's economic policies. I would add to this group only the farming sector and the small business communities, which have been as adversely affected. It is indicative of the Government's attitude towards them that their distress is further compounded by the continuing administrative difficulties and the indifference displayed by the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before continuing to specifically address the matter of public importance, I would like to make a comment on something Senator Richardson raised. He said that we were in advance of other countries because we spend so little on those in need. I argue that less is not better and that, in fact, we are well behind the majority of Western democracies, almost at the bottom, as far as our spending as a percentage of our gross domestic product is concerned. I hope that Senator Richardson is not suggesting that we should follow the track of America, which is, I think, the only country spending significantly less than we are. It has major problems of people living on the streets, drug abuse, crime, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I return specifically to the debate in hand. The Department has had an image problem for quite some time. Its procedures and practices have been subjected to a number of inquiries, none of which was mentioned by Senator Richardson. Honourable senators should be aware of the recent report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which looked at debt recovery under the Social Security Act. Last year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs conducted an extensive examination of the practices of the Department relating to its fairness, courtesy and efficiency. These investigations pointed out the great inadequacies in the Department's administrative procedures, and yet a serious, demonstrable commitment to improvement on the part of the Minister still has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs pointed out a range of problems in the Department's dealings with its clients. These included poor employment practices within the Department which led to queues and very long waiting times for assistance-in fact, in many cases people had to return over and over again-lack of consistency and accuracy in the information they were provided with when they were eventually seen and an unwillingness to volunteer information to clients: they needed to know exactly what they were in need of and how to ask for it. The Committee also mentioned major criticisms in relation to a reluctance on the part of field officers and mobile review teams to fully apprise clients of their rights and a generally unhelpful nature of many of the Department's routine letters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken only limited action on the recommendations of this very thorough report, and, indeed, it seems that very little, if anything, has changed since this report was tabled in May last year. Since taking over the responsibilities for the Democrats in this portfolio, I have spent quite a long time talking to a wide range of community groups across Australia. They all speak of ongoing problems with the Department's administrative procedures. They tell me of inadequate information being provided, of inaccurate and confusing advice being given and of a system so complex that not only the clients but also, in fact, the departmental staff find it increasingly difficult to fully and accurately access entitlements and people's rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Welfare Rights Unit in Melbourne, which is part of a national network of independent advice services for pensioners and beneficiaries, recently conducted a phone-in about problems within the Department. Over the day of the phone-in some 160 clients of the Department called the Unit. Their complaints reflected much of what the other investigations I have mentioned also found. Clients complained about not receiving adequate or accurate information; about the inadequacy of information about eligibility for pensions and benefits; about having their benefits cut off only to have them reinstated after very little investigation, as it was simply an error; about being unable to get information on incidental benefits from the Department because the officers themselves did not know the answers; about regional offices of the Department not having up-to-date information on the latest changes to the Act; about not taking up payments to which they were entitled because of misleading information being supplied by the Department; and about long delays, as has been mentioned previously, in receiving benefits and pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Other welfare rights groups have told me of the ongoing communication problem between the Department and the Commonwealth Employment Service, which has resulted in people being wrongly denied unemployment benefits, and of the continuing insensitivity and lack of respect for privacy shown by the Department in its investigation of sole parents. It seems to be quite the norm in some areas of Australia to simply go and check with the neighbours, to start by asking them questions before approaching the sole parent. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not new problems. Time and time again they are raised by clients and their advocates. Time and time again we hear about the hardship and suffering these problems are causing. The unwillingness or inability of the Department and the Minister to reform administrative procedures has seriously disadvantaged many clients of the Department. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs pointed out that the Department's clients included `the most disadvantaged, the most vulnerable in the community'. These people have great difficulty in understanding the provisions of this very complex Act and are often at risk of failing to comply with sections of the Act due to its complexity. </PARA>
<PARA> The results are that the already vulnerable are further disadvantaged because they lose their rights and entitlements, they lose their only source of income, and they are not among the group in the community which has a small nest egg put away somewhere for such emergencies. These people are turning more and more to the private sector, to the voluntary agencies in this country, for support and assistance. Not only the Department's immediate clients are affected, but also their families-their wives and their children or, in many cases, husbands and children. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to its continuing administrative problems, the Department appears to be increasingly reflecting the attitude of a government obsessed with reducing the number of pensioners and beneficiaries, regardless of the consequences to individuals and families and the community as a whole. I was recently advised by the Adelaide Central Mission that 10 per cent of the people coming to it off the streets are not accessing any government benefit at all. Some of these people living on the streets simply do not know what benefits are available-they have been unable to obtain the information- and it is therefore up to the Mission to provide the advocacy service necessary to help them through the maze that has been put in their way. It is quite clearly the poor and low income earners in this country who are now bearing the brunt of this Government's economic policies, and it is scandalous that the Department that should be providing them with adequate income support cannot get its act together sufficiently to do this job. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister commented earlier, I am quite prepared to acknowledge the inherent problems in operating such a complex system. There have been some 25 amending Bills to the Social Security Act in the past three years and it is a particularly complex and cumbersome piece of legislation. It seems fairly clear from all the available evidence that the departmental staff simply cannot keep up with the changes to their own legislation. However, it is up to the Minister to ensure that these problems do not adversely affect the Department's clients. </PARA>
<PARA> Alongside this rapid change there has been a decrease in overall departmental staff; as Senator Alston mentioned earlier, there is a very high turnover of staff, particularly of junior staff; and there have been cutbacks in the number of social workers available. In many offices the clients are not informed that a social worker is available if they have problems; they are also not always informed that a welfare rights centre is available if they have problems. All these difficulties clearly demonstrate the great value of a welfare rights service-an independent advice and advocacy service. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Department cannot conduct its affairs properly, it should at least be supportive of outside organisations which can offer accurate advice. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs in its report acknowledged that `agencies often act as a substitute for the Department where problems arise' and that `a substantial proportion of the workload of the agencies consists of assistance to DSS clients who are concerned to maintain or obtain their entitlements'. </PARA>
<PARA> But, once again, the attitude of the Government towards the Department's clients is all too obvious: no money was allocated in this year's Budget towards supporting the national welfare rights advocacy network, and many of the welfare rights centres have already had to cut back on the service they provide; indeed, some of these centres are threatened with closure before the end of the year unless support is given. If this occurs, even more clients of the Department will be disadvantaged and a significant crucial voice and advocate on behalf of pensioners and beneficiaries will be silenced. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Government wants to address this problem, because its primary motivation is to reduce expenditure and to reduce the numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries and it does not particularly care how it gets there. In order to provide a proper service for clients of the Department of Social Security, the Government obviously cannot continue to hack at the social security budget, as indeed the Minister himself has very recently recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> It disturbs me that it is already too late for the many social security recipients who have been adversely affected by both the Government's economic policies and the increasing lack of concern it shows towards pensioners and beneficiaries-a lack of concern that is reflected in the continuing failure of the Department of Social Security to provide adequate services. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite two examples of how much pressure is now being placed on private agencies and the services provided by a variety of non-government groups. The first group that contacted me today is the Hutt Street Centre in Adelaide, which provides meals and shelter. Last year it dealt with an increased number of 1,349 clients. This year, to date, it has already had 1,541 clients to its door. At least 25 per cent are young people under the age of 25. The centre is beginning to see families and people who already have shelter in their own homes but who do not have sufficient money left over to feed the children. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group that contacted me today is the Adelaide Central Mission, which runs Wright Court in the city. It has an ever increasing number of people seeking assistance. In just one day last month 171 people asked for its help. It is now averaging 131 people per day. Its clients are also getting younger. It recently estimated that there are now 350 homeless in Adelaide, of which 10 per cent receive no benefits, as I mentioned. These people have to rely on rubbish bins, on collecting cans and on charitable handouts. Unfortunately more and more are being forced into desperate situations where they are stealing. The Mission also finds that the mentally ill-it estimates nearly 40 per cent of those on the streets have some problem in that general direction-and the illiterate cannot get through the maze of paperwork that is now necessary to claim a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate picture that will emerge from this indifference is not one that the Australian Democrats believe the community can tolerate or afford. I recently talked at length with the superintendent of the Brisbane City Mission, the Reverend O'Connor. He made an observation about the inadequacies of our social security system which demonstrates the seriousness of the problem. He said, and I will conclude with this quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Brisbane City Mission having served in the Valley for the past one hundred and thirty-one years has now turned full cycle. Whereas in those early days we worked with convicts deported for stealing as little as a loaf of bread, we are today involved with children stealing food in order to survive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be frank, I believe that the wording of today's matter of public importance treats the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) rather too kindly. Certainly, he has failed to address the multitude of administrative problems currently besetting his Department, and his performance today gives me no comfort at all that he is going to change. Of even greater concern is the fact that in many cases the Minister has either brought the problems on the Department himself or is blissfully unaware that any problems even exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within three months we will witness in Australia the commencement of the most extensive computer data matching procedures ever to have occurred in our history. Social Security will be responsible for linking and comparing income, identity and tax file number information relating to the clients of every benefit-providing Federal government agency except the Health Insurance Commission. Given the document that was tabled by Senator Bishop, I even suspect that the Health Insurance Commission data might one day see its way to the Deakin centre. God forbid that it does.The responsible Minister has repeatedly stated that he will personally ensure that his Department will protect the privacy of all Australians. What are such assurances worth when he quite obviously had not even bothered-and it was evident yesterday in his answers to questions asked here by me-to find out how these new data matching procedures will work?</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a disturbing breakdown in communication between the Minister and his Department with regard to this matter, and the example I gave of not being able to answer my questions is the latest example of administrative and ministerial blundering that has beset this portfolio. The recent Social Security amnesty is a perfect example of what I am trying to describe. On 21 August the Minister had the gall to claim that the amnesty is not for people who have deliberately defrauded the system. He said, `The people the Government is trying to help with this amnesty are its basically honest clients'. To whom does this amnesty apply? It applies to anyone as long as the original claim for the benefit was honest. It does not matter that, after that, claimants have been ripping off the system ever since. As long as they were honest applicants when they applied, they can do whatever they like after that as far as the amnesty is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary of the Department of Social Security admitted in the Estimates committee that most people in the amnesty would be aware-because they had been told by letters from the Department-that they were giving the Department false information. These are our honest citizens that Senator Richardson was telling us we were abusing when we raised this issue. Another official admitted that people covered by the amnesty would have committed offences under the Social Security Act. I presume the real purpose of the amnesty was to clean out the Department's grossly inefficient benefits control branches before the onset of the new data matching processes. The Minister's claim that the amnesty would apply only to honest citizens who have not deliberately defrauded the system is not only untrue but also an affront to Australian taxpayers who finance Social Security's inability to control welfare fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated as, I have no doubt, many Australian people were, that the Social Security Department jumped on the politicising of the Public Service bandwagon, which has reached epidemic proportions under this Labor Government. Early in 1990 the Social Security Department was instructed by the Labor Government to conduct a $1.5m superannuation promotion. I do not need to remind honourable senators here that it was just weeks before a Federal election. When one goes back through the Budget Papers for last year one sees there is no mention of this item being budgeted for. The Department did not know it was going to happen. There is no indication it was coming, and that was admitted in Estimates. But it is not surprising that it was urgent-because the election was coming up. Now the urgency is over and the Department tells us in Estimates that there are no plans to follow up on this initiative. We have a blatant example of misuse and abuse of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> This one-off superannuation campaign pales into insignificance compared with the onslaught of political propaganda that arrives in pensioners' mailboxes every three months. It arrives in more than pensioners' mailboxes. My father, who is an endangered species-the last of the small manufacturers and exporters left in this country-was infuriated when he received a copy of Aged Pension News in his letterbox, as he most probably provides the pension for 30 to 40 citizens in this country. He is of the age to receive a pension but he still employs himself and 35 or so other people; yet he received it. Despite the fact that I am not one of his senators, he proceeded to lobby me and abuse me for this happening, so I decided to find out why he had received it. He received it because he happened to be eligible-he has never taken it-for Veterans' Affairs benefits; so he gets on the Social Security list. This wonderfully organised Department sends to a taxpayer the Pension News. He found it very interesting to find out how his money that he was supplying through his tax was being used, so I suppose there was some point in sending it to him. </PARA>
<PARA> What appears in this Pension News? There are massive headlines applauding Government initiatives, and a letters page devoted to self-congratulations-letter after letter from Mr P. of somewhere, Mr C. of somewhere else and Miss C. of somewhere else-congratulating the Government on what it has had done for them. It was quite interesting to note that one of my staff said to me, quite innocently, 'These don't look as if they have been written by old people'. I have asked the Department to supply me with copies of some of these letters just to show me that they are written by people out in the community. There are biased articles about Ministers who are, supposedly, concerned for the plight of pensioners but whose actions belie these claims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley will have her chance. The Department runs the jobs, education and training (JET) program. Only 4 per cent of eligible sole parents are taking advantage of that program. It is obvious that this will join the score or more of Labor employment initiatives that are heralded with great publicity and glossy brochures, and then thrown on the scrap heap. One of the reasons this one could end up on the scrap heap is that only 4 per cent of the sole parents that are the target for this program queue up for it. At least the Minister has recognised that there are poverty traps discouraging many sole parents from returning to the work force, but his continued reliance on a financial blunderbuss such as JET does not suggest he is sufficiently committed to eliminating these traps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not given to applauding the Government but I suppose one should give credit where credit is due. It has belatedly recognised the need to have more stringent eligibility tests for the invalid pension-soon to be called the disability support pension. There are very real reasons to doubt the efficacy of the research upon which these Budget announcements are based. During 1989-90 the Department conducted two research projects relating to methods of assessing invalid pension eligibility. The first was the Australian functional ability measure-known as AFAM. That cost the Department $200,000. It was an abject failure and produced no useable results. That was $200,000 down the drain. The second was the modified invalid pension project-referred to as MIPP-which produced some interim results that were passed on to the Government, but the final report has, as yet, not even been written up or assessed. I call on the Minister to allay my suspicions that the Government has announced these changes to invalid pension eligibility checking systems without first obtaining and assessing the necessary research results. It has tried but it has not been very successful. </PARA>
<PARA> To be gracious, the Department of Social Security has a very mediocre record as far as identifying and recouping overpayments is concerned. The current overpayment bill is $214m; it rises every year. Included in this figure are 19 examples of internal fraud. We are not talking about the single examples that Senator Alston gave-and they are very important, despite what the Minister says. We are now talking about internal fraud netting $671,000 of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General recently criticised the Department for its tardiness in raising overpayments. There is also overwhelming evidence that officers have not been paying proper attention to exception reports and the suspected overpayments facility. Departmental officials claim that considerable effort is being made to overcome these problems. But when it takes 18 months-and despite the Minister saying that the amount of $848 spent on a general overpayments letter written by someone outside the Department is minutiae-one begins to doubt whether the Department has either the desire or the ability to lift its game as the Auditor-General has demanded. </PARA>
<PARA> The overpayments have not been made only to the recipients of social security benefits. We discovered in the Estimates hearings and through the Auditor-General's report that the Department-the excuse was that it was changing to computers-had overpaid a supplier by $1.7m.

<PARA> All of these examples of administrative problems currently facing the Department of Social Security may well be pushed into the background come 1 January 1991. On that date, Social Security will become the central benefits control hub for the departments of Employment, Education and Training; Community Services and Health; and Veterans' Affairs. Each of these departments-I want this on the public record just so we know what is happening, because Senator Richardson does not seem to want to put it on the record very clearly --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave Senator Richardson a chance. Each of these departments will provide Social Security with family identifiers, tax file numbers and income information. The tax file numbers of these clients, who, I remind the Senate, are not necessarily Social Security clients, will then be given to the Australian Taxation Office, which will return them to Social Security with their accompanying Tax Office income information. The income information from the Tax Office and the income information supplied by the other departments will then be cross-matched, and if a possible incorrect payment is identified Social Security will notify the relevant department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister calls us scaremongers and claims that we do not know what we are talking about. He is the last one who should start throwing stones. It is the Minister who on 19 September claimed in this place-I may be stretching it to say that he misled the Parliament, so I will not say that-that Social Security would be giving to the Tax Office in this data matching procedure the tax files numbers of only its own clients. That is what he said. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Minister who on AM this morning told us that the information from other departments would be immediately destroyed if no discrepancy was found. This may be the case with the mainframe-it may eliminate the information if there is no mismatch-but it must be remembered that the information will also be stored on a tape or cartridge which has been received from the relevant department. That will be there for 90 days, then destroyed by the Department. The tapes will then be cleared and sent back to the relevant department. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Minister who informs us that the Privacy Commissioner has been continually consulted about this matter, but when I asked about this I was told-I would be pleased if this were not true, and I am quite prepared to be told that it is not true-that the Privacy Commissioner has not even visited the computer centre where all this matching will take place. I do not know whether that is true and I hope the Minister will be able to clarify it at some point, but that is what I was told. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Minister who tells us that every privacy requirement will be followed, when in fact these new initiatives have already rendered the latest tax file guidelines obsolete and Social Security is now tendering without even waiting for the Privacy Commissioner's data-matching guidelines to be finalised. The Minister says that consultations are taking place and that we have guidelines that are not even there. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another thing that concerned me. When we went to the computer centre we saw the large computer tapes that are now being used and the small cartridges that the Department of Social Security is moving to. When I asked what security arrangements were in place with regard to these small cartridges-they are about the size of two cigarette packs together and doubled; they are not very big-I said, `What is to stop somebody in the Department from walking out with one of these in his or her pocket?'. </PARA>
<PARA> These cartridges-containing all this data about people-can be used on any IBM-compatible machine. The person to whom I was speaking said to me, `Oh, Senator Patterson, we've never thought of that. What a good idea. We'll have to take it up'. I do not know whether that was a reference to helping people put the cartridges in their pockets-I do not think so-but the Department had not thought of how it would have control over internal fraud or tapes going out of the Department. That is appalling, and I rest my case. </PARA>

It is proper that, as shadow Minister for Social Security, he should look at those issues. He has opened up what he considers to be the problems. His view seems to be that, amongst other things, Senator Richardson has ambitions to be a Minister of some other portfolio. Senator Alston put forward that ambition as a reason for saying that there are administrative problems currently besetting the Minister's Department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston says that the Minister has his mind on other things and therefore cannot properly administer the Department. Senator Patterson has indicated the sorts of things that the Opposition is talking about. She has told us that some overpayments have not been collected to the value of $214m, that there has been some internal fraud costing $671,000, that a bill for $1,814 has been run up which should not have been, and that an amount of $1.7m has been overpaid to suppliers. Senator Patterson, together with Senator Alston, says that these things have come about because of the ambition of Senator Richardson. That seems to be what we have to infer from all that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Patterson said that a bill for $1,814 is an important matter, and of course it is. An overpayment that amounts to $214m is important too. But what concerns me about all of this is that, while the Department of Social Security, directed by governments of all colours-it was directed magnificently by former Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle-is meant to help people who are sick or lame, people who are desperate to stay alive, the shadow Minister should target out of all this some instances of problems in the administration. One might have hoped-indeed, might even have expected-that we would be debating whether or not the people that this Department is meant to help were being helped properly. Since that has not been introduced, the only conclusion we can draw from that is that the Opposition, in spite of its criticisms of Senator Richardson, concedes by the very terms of this matter of public importance that the recipients of social security benefits have been well treated. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what else we might say about Senator Richardson, we have to concede that the job he is in there to do-to provide the people with proper benefits; to provide the lame, the sick, the halt and the poorly-off and deprived in this community-he is doing magnificently. There has been not one criticism in this regard. I have listened to Senator Alston, an outstanding barrister, and to Senator Patterson, who has a great analytical mind, and neither of them has been able to give us any examples of how this Department has ill treated or treated other than in the best of ways the recipients of social security benefits-the very purpose of this system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to get up and say that there were some significant overpayments, a bill of $1,814 paid that should not have been paid, and $671,000 in internal fraud and so on. But what about the essential thrust of our policy and what this Department is all about? I refer to giving some sort of relief to the most vulnerable people in the community. On that prime test and judging by the way this case has been conducted by the Opposition, I believe that Senator Richardson comes out trumps, following the magnificent work done by Senator Grimes and by Mr Brian Howe in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the `maladministration' which Opposition senators talk about. They have come up with overpayments and internal fraud amounting to $671,000-that seems to be the figure. One would have thought that if a million dollars was all that was in the budget, a sum of $671,000 would be a significant figure. Opposition senators must have been talking about fairly limited figures. Therefore, one looks to a document referring to the Budget Papers to find out what the expenditure in 1989-90 was. It is estimated at $21 billion. While I am on this point, let me give some other figures. Some 16,500 staff are employed at more than 300 locations across Australia. So in respect of a department that has an outlay of $21 billion and a staff of some l6,500 employed at 300 locations, Senator Alston, who is an outstanding adornment to this chamber, and Senator Patterson, on whom we have to rely completely, come up with about four examples, as I understand it-it may be more, even up to 10- in support of their arguments. Senator Patterson rages, and properly so, that there is an internal fraud of $671,000 in a budget of $21 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Patterson-and we accept her figures because she is so outstanding-that that is the significant thing about the running of the Department of Social Security (DSS) in this country. The great and significant thing that Opposition members have got on to about the DSS and about the payments to people who are the most deprived and the most vulnerable in our community is that there have been overpayments of $214m and costs by way of fraudulent employees of $671,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the figures here today, rather than showing a lack of proper administration, show that it has been a pretty tight administration all round. One would have thought that more examples would have been dragged forward if the administration is as bad as the Opposition says it is, a lot more examples of maladministration and fraud than Opposition members have been able to gather and glean today. I understand that this is after days and days searching through this Department in the Estimates committee hearings by powerful figures on the other side of the chamber. They have had before them all the people from the Department that they wanted to see. Opposition senators had freedom to cross- examine those officials and to call before them whomever they wanted and to ask them whatever they wanted. In a budget of $21 billion with 16,500 staff employed at more than 300 locations around Australia, the best they can do is to come up with the miserable number of examples that they have quoted here today. </PARA>
<PARA> Those examples have to be seen in the context of Australia in hard economic times, where people are suffering because of the economic downturn. There are people who, through no fault of their own, rely on the invalid pension, unemployment benefits, age pensions, special benefits, and child allowances of various sorts. The needs of all those people and the sorts of things they must have in order to live a decent life are absolutely ignored by Opposition senators because they want to talk about half a dozen examples of bad administration in such a large department with such a large budget-if one accepts the examples they have given as bad administration. The case presented by the Opposition today is conclusive proof, given the examples that it has been able to quote, that this Minister has administered magnificently. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I wish to say something about the overpayments of $214m, which was the figure quoted by the Opposition and which I accept. Let us look at what overpayments are about. They occur when people are paid a particular pension or level of pension without entitlement to it. The Social Security Act provides means by which those sums can be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> I would point out that the provisions set out in the Act by which money can be recovered are fairly draconian. If honourable senators look at section 164 of the Act, they will understand what I mean. However, that sort of thing does not concern the Opposition. I can understand anybody with a heart saying, `Perhaps the way you are trying to collect these overpayments is a little stringent', but Opposition members do not say that. They say that the process should be even more stringent and oppressive in terms of the collection of overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of this Government has been quite different from that. It has said that it understands the distress, the denigration of people's dignity which poverty and sickness bring. It will set up a scheme-and the Minister has gone into this-not to fling some dollars at people who are in distress, not to set up soup kitchens and dole out some gruel to people who are desperate for dignity, but to create a whole new philosophy which is based on the proposition that people in distress should be helped, not simply in money terms but in being restored to the community as people who are able to walk where they could not walk before, able to earn where they could not earn before, able to cope with advancing age where they could not cope before. These schemes such as Jobs, Education and Training and Newstart, which have been denigrated in a most miserable fashion, are part of that program. They are part of a philosophy which cannot be worked out successfully overnight, but which has been begun successfully, brought forward, with modification, successfully and ultimately will lead to a new way of thinking in the community that will be beneficial to the most distressed people in it and, because of that, to the community as a whole. That is what this Government has done, and that is what this Minister represents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite mean of the Opposition to come in here and ignore that magnificent effort and the philosophy which was begun by Senator Grimes, continued by Mr Howe and is now being carried on by Senator Richardson. One hopes that the Opposition will continue that philosophy if ever it gets into power. </PARA>
<PARA> In the couple of minutes I have remaining to me in this debate let me say something about the appeal system that this Government has set up. It has set up on a statutory basis the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which previously existed at an administrative level. That has given scope for people who are dissatisfied with the way in which the Department has treated them to go to an independent body. That has been a success and indicates the way in which this Government has gone about things. I think that ought to be mentioned because it deserves great praise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two days ago I asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) whether it was a fact that persons with as little as 15 per cent medical impairment had been held to have 85 per cent incapacity for work for the purposes of obtaining an invalid pension. In his reply the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is possible that, in the past, 15 per cent levels of medical impairment have led to calculations of 85 per cent incapacity-that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make the point that it is occurring today; that is the criterion that is used. The criteria on which eligibility for invalid pension is based are quite imprecise. The Social Security Act requires that two tests need to be met:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the degree of the person's permanent incapacity for work is not less than 85 per cent; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) that permanent incapacity, or at least 50 per cent of that permanent incapacity, is directly caused by a permanent physical or mental impairment of the person. </PARA>
<PARA>In practice, a medical practitioners's assessment is regarded only as a broad indicator. The Department has decided that, in practice, if an impairment rating of 30 per cent or more is achieved, it should usually be accepted that persons meet the requirement of the Act.

As I have mentioned previously, some pensions have been granted on the basis of impairment levels down to 15 per cent. As a result of this, two quite dramatic and remarkable events have occurred in relation to this matter. The first is that surveys have shown that the peak impairment level is between 30 and 39 per cent. In fact, one-third of all recipients fall into this category and 16 per cent below it. I seek leave, Mr Deputy President, to table the document showing these facts.</PARA></TALK.START>

The second fact is that there has been a dramatic increase in the growth rate of entitlements to invalid pensions. Since 1983, there has been a 40 per cent increase in the growth rate of invalid pensions. There are now 412,552 invalid pension beneficiaries in our population of 17 million, and taxpayers' money amounting to $2,679,752,000 is involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to show a graph demonstrating that fact. That is what has happened in relation to the number of invalid pensions that have occurred in this country since 1983. The lower graph shows the growth of population in this country since 1983. The lower graph is population; the upper graph is the number of invalid pensioners. Something dramatic has happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a lot of knees and it is a lot of invalid pensioners. Suddenly something has happened in our society whereby we have got this dramatic increase: up to half a million of our population are now on invalid pensions. How has this occurred? The answer is fairly simple. The Department has decided that anybody who has got a 30 per cent incapacity to work now gets an invalid pension, on the Department's decision. What is the Minister going to do about it? These figures have been brought to his attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a review done a couple of years ago demonstrating that this sort of thing was going to occur. The Minister is going to review it. But what does the review show? It shows that the estimates are that about 2 per cent of the beneficiaries can be reviewed because of the people taking part in the review. All the present beneficiaries will continue as before. I might mention that we have already passed the point where there are more people receiving benefits in Australia than there are taxpayers, and that is going to increase because of the ageing population. Inevitably, that proportion will increase. We passed the halfway point a couple of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentions with pride that there are four million beneficiaries now and over $16 billion is administered by the Department of Social Security. He mentions that the Department of Social Security has got the largest computing network in the country. That is where we have reached in this country: the Department of Social Security has the largest computing network-not the Department of Defence, not the Department of Health, and not any other department, but the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the stage in this country where there are more beneficiaries than taxpayers, and that is what the Labor Party has led us to: no creation of wealth; just spend it; keep doling it out; do not control it; bring it down. And even Senator Crowley might reach the 15 per cent level if she keeps waving her hand at me. The Department has lost control of procedures, and the Minister has lost control of the granting of pensions. So he has lost control of his Department and his portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not expected the bonus early call. Today, we are actually dealing with a remarkable matter of public importance (MPI) that reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continuing failure of the Minister for Social Security to address the multitude of administrative problems currently besetting his Department. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I would think, is a monument to puerile and pathetic opposition. It is quite surprising that into this place comes a debate not about policy, not about the direction of the money, and not about the intention of the Opposition in social security. The best those opposite can say is that here and there-I think they gave collectively some 10 examples; maybe we are up to 20 examples by now-a little bit of administration is going wrong. They do not want to tell us what they will do under social security and the aims of their policy because it is clear they have not got anything to say. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the most puerile and pathetic MPI I think have ever heard brought in to this place since I have been here. At least in times past, the Opposition wanted to argue an alternative emphasis under social security. Today those opposite are down to whether or not administration is up to scratch. How absolutely pathetic are Opposition senators when that is the best that they can deliver as an MPI-no claims; no justification of where they would take cuts under social security to meet their $3 billion extra that they rushed around with during the last election; and no evidence at all of what they would do instead of what is currently in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that they said not too many months ago that they would want to take people off the dole-`Get rid of dole bludgers' was their claim-but they are not talking about that today. They have not the courage to tell us their social security policy; they have not got one. They want to come in here and carp about some administrative problems. One way they did this was to give us examples of people who had found it very difficult when they got to the Department. Do not go, Senator Alston. I have a case that should gratify the honourable senator: a man appeared in my office complaining bitterly at the Social Security Department's criteria for him to identify himself in order to be eligible for payments. I presumed him to be a bona fide constituent and took up his case with the Department. He was particularly upset when a payment was given to him that time but not the subsequent two weeks later. </PARA>
<PARA> He came back to my office saying, `It is outrageous; they are demanding further identification'. I discovered that he was out of gaol from a case of fraud. That man makes me very angry because he is the reason that the Department has to have very precise and tight requirements on all the just and honest citizens in this country who have to go to great pains to identify themselves because there are crooks and frauds such as this man around the place. Why did Senator Alston not tell us about similar examples to that? Or is it that those examples only come to my office?</PARA>
<PARA> There are people who are in trouble. From time to time, as the Minister acknowledged, things go a little less than perfectly. As far as I know, any time that I have ever contacted anybody in the Department or any of the Ministers in charge, they have immediately addressed the problem as quickly and as efficiently as they could. Senator Alston's matter of public importance does not give any balance at all to the amount of money outlaid on behalf of citizens of this country; as Senator Cooney said, on behalf of those people who are behind the eight ball, who are deserving of age pensions, who are single mothers looking for support, who are unemployed, who are invalided, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Before Senator Herron leaves the chamber, it is important to remind him about the definitions of impairment and invalidity. Senator Herron did not say when he claimed the definitions were vague that they were properly vague. I ask him: How would he measure schizophrenia, for example, as a case of impairment? Is it 15 per cent, 20 per cent, 39 per cent or 50 per cent? Are we up to 85 per cent? What figure could he possibly put on anybody with a mental illness in this country? He knows that the definition properly has to be vague. A person may have a very limited impairment but be enormously disadvantaged in terms of his or her capacity to work. If there is a problem-and the Minister said that he is reviewing it-I take that as bona fide that he will do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Herron knows-particularly as he is a doctor-that we cannot possibly define impairment too precisely. He would be the first to scream if people took away the medical profession's right to make its own medical assessment. Senator Herron also knows that the medical profession in times past has not exactly covered itself with glory on this matter. So, let us contribute to review, not come in here carping about invalid pensions and vague definitions. I think that Senator Herron has scored a cheap point and it does him no credit. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Herron's suggestion that we should have a bigger computer in the Department of Defence than in the Department of Social Security, I will have to make him remember that line for a long time to come: `The biggest computer is for the Department of Social Security. Why is it not in the Department of Defence?' Indeed, why is it not? It is because this Government has a priority that would rather pay dollars to people than put bullets and bombs around the country. That is a crazy claim, Senator. The Department of Social Security has a very big computer because those of us who have been around here for a long time know the effort which the Government has taken, under Ministers Grimes, Howe and now Richardson, to get that STRATPLAN computer in place. If Senator Herron knew his history, he would know how much more efficiently the Department is now administering all those payments. That is why it has administrative costs of 3 per cent. Senator Herron would also know how much more reliably pensions and payments are delivered to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crazy to claim the Department of Social Security has the biggest computer as though that is some liability. The Department has a computer sufficient to the task, at last. We no longer have the failure and breakdown of the payments system that we had in the past. The Government should be commended for getting that computer in place, because it is delivering the service to the people when they expect to get it and payments are not held up as they were-certainly as I recollect it-in the early 1980s before that STRATPLAN computer was in place. I have to say to Senator Herron that his argument is totally ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has assessed the `disaster' here and it will go in to bat on some millions of dollars and ignore the benefits of over $20 billion paid to deserving people who meet the criteria of eligibility to receive payments. The Opposition has its size and proportions wrong. It is a little similar to the way it argues about hospital waiting lists. Any minute now we will be able to prove the Opposition wrong on that, too. I have it from New South Wales that we can look at that State's waiting lists and say that 20,000 people per month are on the public hospital waiting list. We can also say that across the whole of New South Wales 98-plus per cent of public patients out of the one million people who seek attention are treated within a week and, if they are emergencies, within 24 hours. It just depends which way the emphasis is put. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to argue about minimal costs for administrative problems that it brings into this chamber and totally to ignore the benefit of the $20 billion-worth of payments properly going to the people who deserve them. By all means Senator Alston should raise his points, but he should not come in here saying that they have the substance for a serious matter of public importance; it is not such. It is a puerile, pathetic little example of the meanness of the Opposition's mind and nothing to boast about at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Before my time runs out I would like, for the record, to refute Senator Alston's claim that he has never mentioned in an interview the figure of 42.5 per cent. I quote from an interview from Richard Alston and Sonya Voumard of the Age-</PARA>

<PARA> I believe that Senator Lees was complaining that the Department of Social Security was not providing assistance to welfare rights groups. I would like to make it clear that the Department of Social Security is not in the business of funding organisations such as welfare rights groups. Many of those groups enjoy funding but they enjoy it under the auspices of the Department of Community Services and Health. In fact, the split between health and social security in the early 1980s, the early years of this Government, made it quite clear that the Department of Social Security was about the payment to people for income security, for pensions, benefits, and so on, and to invalids, and that those people would be entitled to income security. That is what the Department of Social Security is about. It is not a fair criticism of the Department to say that it is not funding welfare rights groups. That is not the Department's aim or the function. Indeed, just to put one point to rest, I know that some welfare rights groups-I cannot be sure of the ones Senator Lees mentioned-enjoy assistance but they enjoy it through a different department. </PARA>
<PARA> To my surprise Senator Herron is shocked that we should have such figures as have already been mentioned in this matter of public importance. Yes, indeed, four million people are being paid assistance by this Department and that amounts to more than $20 billion. The figures I have are over $23 billion. I think that figure, within $1 billion, is right. That represents about 25 per cent of Commonwealth outlays. I would also like to reinforce the point made by the Minister that since we came to office in 1983, the social security outlays have declined in recent years: from 7.2 per cent in 1983-84 to an estimated 6 per cent in 1990-91. At the same time, while the outlays have been reduced, the payments have all increased. I do not believe anybody looking at social security could possibly fail to acknowledge the great contribution that this Government has made through the increased payments under the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. Very importantly, they are now established as benchmark criteria so that they will never reduce. Those benchmark figures for payments on behalf of children have been set by the Department and they are now indexed. They will never fall below those benchmark figures as set. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, I would like to suggest that the role of the Department of Social Security in the child support legislation cannot be overlooked either, though for the record, Senator Alston may criticise the Child Support Agency, but strictly it is not the responsibility of the Department of Social Security. So if Senator Alston wants to complain about the Department of Social Security, he should stick to the parts that it is entirely responsible for, and if the honourable senator wants to tackle the Child Support Agency, he can bring in another scintillating matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Very importantly, too, this matter of public importance is complaining about poor administration. But, in closing, I would like to stress a point mentioned also by the Minister in his remarks that the Department has changed dramatically, not only in reducing its outlays, but also in increasing the payments to everybody eligible. Also, in terms of not being merely a post-box or a banking facility for these payments, its staff have become very actively involved in the care and concern for all those people eligible to receive payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have seriously noticed the changes under Newstart, under jobs, employment and training, under the requirements for long term unemployed, and so on, will know the charge against the departmental people is now much more demanding and requires much more skill and training than it did in times past. Indeed, if honourable senators read this review, `Reform of Social Security Policies and Administration 1983-1990', over the name of Brian Howe, Minister for Social Security, listing the achievements, they will see very early on specific mention of the need to introduce administrative reforms for greater effectiveness, efficiency and integrity. It is one of the five broad strategies of the Department, and it, of course, is looking always to improve the administration and delivery of its payments. As well as doing all that, it also has made sure that it has provided the money to train the staff members so that they are better able to do this very different requirement asked of them under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> People receiving benefits are not just getting money, they are getting evidence of the care and concern of government, which is, one, that they are probably eligible and, two, that they are properly assisted if they wish to use their payments as an interim before they move into full employment and other benefits. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a couple of matters in relation to the Advance to the Minister for Finance for September 1990 that I wish to raise. I do so in the context of the discussion that has taken place. I have raised this here on previous occasions, and also we have had some very lengthy discussions on this matter during the Senate Estimates Committee A hearings in recent weeks. I draw the attention of the Senate to the importance of these Advances to the Minister for Finance that are tabled on a regular basis in this chamber. They are very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Senate does not give as much attention to these as it should do, because we have seen examples in recent times, particularly in relation to the Advances to the Minister for Finance used in June of this year when there were three illegal payments made through the Advances to the Minister for Finance. They are supposed to be paid only when the payment is both unforeseen and urgent. Quite patently, the Government has been using it for purposes other than that to disguise the ability for proper scrutiny of some of these expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two points about the expenditures that I wish to refer to here. The first one is to note that in the Advance to the Minister for Finance for September, there is an amount of $319,700 which is said to be `required to cover an overspend' by the Australian Manufacturing Council. This relates to payments for consultancies used by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. According to the supporting applications to this Advance, this overspend of almost $320,000:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was caused by the unplanned for necessity for AMCS to make the final payment to the firm of Pappas, Carter and Coop, who were employed as consultants to produce a comprehensive report on the international competitiveness of Australian manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA>That report has received a very mixed reaction and reception in the wider community since its publication and, indeed, a considerable degree of criticism. The point I want to make is this: what does this explanation of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance mean? How can a final payment that had earlier been contracted for possibly be regarded as `unplanned'? I express very considerable concern about this because in the past year no less than $8.14m has been spent by Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce alone on external consultancies. That $8.14m includes a figure of about $1.2m on the multifunction polis, $500,000 on the Australian Manufacturing Council, $500,000 or thereabouts on the National Industry Extension Service and a host of others. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the consultancy company, Pappas Carter Evans and Koop Pty Ltd, has received in the 1989-1990 financial year, and to date in 1990-1991, $2.5m-the one consultancy alone-and that does not include a possible additional $81,650 for payments on which I need to seek clarification in Senate Estimates hearings tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I wish to raise in this context of the Advance to the Minister for Finance is to note with concern that the supporting applications for both the August and September Advances to the Minister for Finance do not include details of the date on which payments from the Advance were approved from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). I do not know why that is the case. I would hope for an explanation from the Minister for Finance for that because that stamp of approval indicates to the Senate and to the Parliament that the payment has in fact been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that those details are not there is contrary to the practice which has occurred with previous supporting applications for the Advance tabled in the Parliament and it is a matter of great concern that it is not there. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to take up a point by way of personal explanation against the comments made by Senator Crichton-Browne earlier in speaking to the drugs in sport reference. He did seem to suggest that I and our Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts had withdrawn the drugs in sport reference because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did not wish to be associated with heroes who had lost their sheen because they had been associated with the use of drugs. That is drawing a very long bow, and I find it particularly offensive to suggest that our Committee, in a majority vote, would be making decisions influenced by any such pressure at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, a most important point that I wish to put on the record, is that seven of the members of the Committee are new members and only Senator Crichton-Browne is there from a prior Parliament with any understanding of the content of the drugs in sport inquiry. As a very full inquiry report has already been tabled-indeed, two reports have been tabled-and as all but one senator is new to that Committee, they are the principal reasons why it was decided to conclude the reference. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to acknowledge the virtue of the drugs in sport inquiry and, I think, the very considerable contribution made in those two reports. I do not believe that anybody is in disagreement with that. I would accept Senator CrichtonBrowne's comments that the report from the Australian Senate is one of the very few volumes in the world canvassing as comprehensively as it has the issues involved in that very important area. If Senator Crichton-Browne wants to criticise the Committee on the ground that there is still more work to be done, that criticism should more properly pertain to the previous Committee or himself rather than the new incoming Committee. One would appreciate the difficulty that committee of inquiry had because there is no illegality to use-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on the Industry Commission's report on paper recycling. Previously Senator Watson has suggested that manufacturers should be left to use recycled fibres in the manner most suitable to them, their products and their clients' needs. While that sounds very plausible and actually relates to some of the thoughts in the report, in many ways what he said and what I have read in the report proves to me that manufacturers are committed to serving their own needs. Because of the investment that is only too evident in Australia-the investment in large mill infrastructures, large forestry concessions and large capital equipment-it is difficult for the paper industry to deviate from the status quo which applies to manufacturing processes and manufacturing style.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To suggest that such an industry could quickly respond to consumer demand for a different style of product, I think, reveals an ignorance of how this industry works. Taking it a little further, I think that to suggest that manufacturers would be falling over themselves to meet the demands of which recycled products, or indeed any products, consumers deemed suitable to demand, if manufacturers' interests were better served by maintaining the status quo, is quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems which were considered in the report have received a fair bit of public airing and should not be ignored or written off with the sort of implication made by Senator Watson, which was, `Leave the industry to its own devices; it knows what is best for the industry'. Of course it knows what is best for the industry but it is not necessarily best for the community, which has expressed considerable concern at what is happening. That is best illustrated at page 5 of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Makers and users of paper do not have to consider the full costs of waste disposal. Hence the present prices of paper products do not reflect the true societal and environmental costs of paper use. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it is quite true, and we know it, that this encourages overuse of paper and discourages recycling. I have before me a report from the Local Government Bulletin of March 1990 which presents this most perceptive observation:</PARA>
<PARA>Paper recycling is a hot issue. The most prominent material by weight in the waste stream is newsprint (including magazines). Over a million trees are cut down each year to supply Sydney with papers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is indicative of the concerns that are being expressed throughout the community. It is wise to note these concerns and not dismiss them. Although the report does note the concerns well, it does not go far enough in considering what we ought to be doing. It is an interim report. I hope that in the final analysis the final report will give us a little more guidance on how we might bring about matters which will satisfy the community concerns about how recycling can best be conducted. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fortuitous that the two Industry Commission reports come in close succession and support the contention that I wish to raise briefly. The Industry Commission report on pulp and paper contains a great amount of information and the information is presented clearly enough. But, as I understand the reference, the Commission was required only to present information. I am concerned that the information is simply presented. I am concerned that reports such as these are often presented in isolation from each other. With that in mind, we in this Parliament should ensure that we consider the reports and other information about pulp mills and paper manufacturing in totality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The processes involved in paper making are complicated, they are inter-related, and we should ensure that that information is in fact inter-related and cross-referenced. This particular report should, I believe, be read in conjunction with the Industry Commission report I just spoke on, the report on paper recycling. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation report to Ministers, Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection is also relevant on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reports and research papers which, before we can make enlightened expressions of opinion on these matters, we should take into account. The report which was prepared for the Tasmanian Government which is often referred to as the Simons report, Pulp and Paper Options for Northern Tasmania: Focus on fibre, markets and technology related to non-chlorine bleaching, makes sense of the report we are considering now. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is that the temptation is there for decision makers to accept the information one package at a time and not to see the inter-relationships which are so important. Sometimes inquiries are established in such a manner that cross-referencing is in fact difficult. I bring to the attention of the Senate a letter from the Industry Commission to the Treasurer of 10 July 1990 which is in the front of this very report. It says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission was not asked to report on the BEK -</PARA>
<PARA>that is, bleached eucalypt kraft-</PARA>
<PARA>pulp mill guidelines and has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I could speak for some time on the content of this actual report, my main concern today and the one I wish to bring to the notice of the Senate is that these reports can, if not carefully read, be seen in isolation and conclusions can be reached which are not relevant to the industry. They do not stand up to further cross-examination and consideration. The Senate was told, for example, even in the very introductory phases of this report on page 2:</PARA>
<PARA>The effects of organochlorine discharges on people and on natural ecological systems are not fully understood or quantified. Indeed, the effects of the effluents from bleached eucalypt kraft mills are largely unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it was the very duty of an inquiry, in a report of this nature, Pulp and Paper: Bleaching and the Environment, not just to admit that we do not know very much about these things, but to express concern about the fact that we do not know and to do something about it. If that is out of the scope of reference of this report, I would draw the attention of honourable senators to the existence of many other reports and, rather than just accept our ignorance, urge them to take measures and to conduct research which would alleviate that ignorance. I am pleased to see that on page 4 of this report we are told:</PARA>
<PARA>Producers and governments are responding to community concern and consumer demand for unbleached and non-chlorine bleached products is strengthening. </PARA>
<PARA> The sense of that is that the response to demand is strengthening. I am pleased to see that because in the previous report I referred to we were told that that demand was insignificant. When these reports are seen in conjunction, although they may seem to contradict each other in some ways, if we read them carefully we can at least gain some sense from them. I hope that the report is widely read and I support the motion to take note of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some reference to this report and highlight a few factors within it. If this report is adopted by Government, it effectively means that there will not be a comprehensive national drought policy but an individual farm drought policy. The main emphasis is on the farm. While I agree that it is important that there should be emphasis on the individual farm situation, and that has been the situation in the past, it is also important that there be a national approach to this and that drought relief measures in terms of sustained drought should not be taken from the natural disaster arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is very important and it was highlighted in the early 1980s when there was an extensive three or four year drought. It is important because there is a necessity in those times to maintain the national herd or flock and also to protect the environment and, in particular, to facilitate the current land care program. Therefore, there needs to be provisions under the natural disaster arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the report confuses the rural adjustment process with what should be specific drought measures. The rural adjustment process is something that should continue, and will continue, year in and year out, whereas drought measures are of a totally different nature. The report is notable for its motherhood statements, which stand for little. The recommendations on taxation measures are welcome and essential, and I hope the Government will at least move quickly in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to section 7.4 of the national drought policy, there should be a coordination of the various resources involved into research into the El Nino southern oscillation, water resources and other matters so that there is much greater knowledge in terms of the ability to understand those climatic changes which lead to drought and create a situation whereby we are able to predict, or have a much better idea of, what is coming along. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal with a number of specific points in the report. I turn first to page 7. I find the diagram that is there to be very offensive, particularly the comment with regard to `apathy'. I do not think that a national inquiry of this sort and the types of people on it should resort to that sort of language, particularly when they are dealing with an industry which, when we get to practical conservation measures through the land care program, which is an industry driven initiative, is a leader in this particular aspect. I want to bring that part of the report to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in my opening comments the rural adjustment guidelines. I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate once again chapter 5, Future Policy Directions, and emphasise the need for drought relief, even if it is administered through the rural adjustment system, which is, in fact, a separate and different operation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a reference on page 10 of the report to incentives for effective soil and water management. It states that they are appropriately delivered through soil conservation and not through drought relief measures. I am not aware that has ever been done and I think that is a misrepresentation of the situation. There is much work to be done in terms of this report. There is a need to keep the natural disaster arrangements in place, I believe. There is a need to identify the importance of maintaining the flock or the herd in the national interest, and it is worth noting that the measures that were taken by the Fraser Government in the early 1980s, which the Hawke Government was the beneficiary of, were able to maintain our export figures in terms of wool and cattle because on a national basis the flock and the herd were able to be moved around the States and from State to State. We saw a consistent growth factor in the value of those exports over the period from 1979-80 to 1988-89. Had that not been in place, I believe those figures would have been significantly lower and the effect would have been that our current account would have been significantly worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite a while, in fact, quite a few weeks, since I read the final report of the National Drought Policy Review Task Force. From what I can remember of it, the report seems to be out to prove that we do not need any more drought relief and that farmers should be relying on their own resources. I thoroughly agree that on a one-to-one farm basis all farms should conserve fodder and build up their water supplies-whether by reticulation or, preferably, by collecting one's own water in reserves if one can; but even under this Government, a certain amount of cash should be kept aside for harder times. It is a bit hard to say that that can be done for ever and a day, because in certain parts of Australia, namely, Queensland, there had been continual droughts for about 10 years in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could adopt Senator Walsh's idea that those areas were not viable in the first place and that the land should be left to become bush again. However, at this time the land in those marginal areas around Australia is developed, and there is too much infrastructure to let those areas go backwards. If there is a drought for only one year, most established farmers can cope with it, but if there is a long term drought-a drought that goes beyond one year-for example, in a grazing and wheat growing area, I believe that there should be some sort of national drought policy to overcome the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I read in this report, it seems that the Government's idea, whether it be on the back burner or somewhere else, is to vindicate itself, to absolve itself of all responsibility in drought situations. It is unfortunate if the Government has that idea. Hopefully, that is not its idea and would not totally implement it. I believe that most people in the Australian agricultural sector are educated to be self-reliant, and that is the way to go, but it would be a disaster if the Government did away completely with a national drought policy. As one from the agricultural field, I am prepared to cop the consequences of this or any future government's introducing a measure to do away with a national drought policy, but everyone else should be treated in the same way and so should other industries be treated in the same way. In a downturn, for example, manufacturing industries should not be helped out. That idea could be extended to a lot of other industries down the line. Whatever our field is in life, if we are in for a hard time because of a downturn, we would be on our own if this idea were to be adopted. People will have had the chance to build up resources, such as cash reserves, and they should cop the consequences of a downturn. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, things do not work that way, as we have seen in the case of some of the bail-outs around Australia in the last few years, such as the bail-out of W.A. Inc. and Victoria Inc. If we are going to make the agricultural and pastoral industries self-reliant, we have to see that this is done right across the board. I hope that the Government will take notice of the very short remarks I have made on the drought report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the Government's response to the philosophy behind the provision of aged care services in Australia. This is a response to two documents which have been tabled recently in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. The documents refer to an agreement and a contract that has been designed to protect residents' rights in nursing homes and hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> This side of the House is concerned about the rights of older Australians and the rights of those in nursing homes. There is no doubt that in some institutions in this country the rights of older people have been abused and that there was a need for this issue to be raised and addressed. However, I am surprised to see in the Government's response the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) state:</PARA>
<PARA>Today, I am pleased to introduce to the House the documents designed to underpin the reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>I am surprised that he said that he was pleased to introduce them because when we look at those two documents we see that they are a shambles and are poorly drafted. In fact, almost without exception the people who have come to my office in goodwill to talk to me about these two documents in an attempt to protect and extend the rights of older Australians, especially those in residential care, have mentioned the appalling draftsmanship. I do not believe that the parliamentary draftsmen drafted these documents, so I am not casting aspersions on them. However, it seems that somebody who is not a draftsman attempted to draft these documents, and there are all sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> One problem brought to my attention is that it would be very difficult for someone who is running a nursing home to actually close the nursing home. Once a contract has been signed with an individual or a group of individuals in the nursing home, it may be very difficult to get out of it. So we might find some people are out of nursing homes because proprietors are not prepared to go into that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always a problem when protecting the rights of one group that we deny the rights of another. There are implications with agreements and contracts. In essence, a contract says that a resident of a nursing home will not discriminate against another resident, a staff member or the proprietor on any basis and that residents within those nursing homes ought to have rights to engage in behaviour which, for some, may not be acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Catholic bishops have spoken to me. They said that two individuals of the opposite sex who are not married cohabiting in the same room would not be acceptable in a Catholic nursing home because it offends the belief of the people who fund and run that nursing home and it is contrary to their religious beliefs and their practice. The bishops said to me that the only alternative they would have would be to close down those nursing homes because they ought to raise money and not accept government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, if a proprietor does not sign a contract, he loses his funding. The nursing homes would not be kept open because the only people who would be able to afford to pay for them, if they cannot raise the money by charity, are rich people. That is not what the Little Sisters of the Poor or some Catholic groups and church groups are about. I also believe that I would be approached by the Rechabites, although I have not been approached yet. They have signed the pledge. They might feel that any restrictions placed on their nursing home may be so onerous that it would challenge their philosophy and their value and belief system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is strange that we cannot have rules up front before a person goes into a nursing home so that he knows what is there. I can understand if someone is in the nursing home and suddenly these rules are placed on him. I believe that the rights of individuals who want to share the remaining years of their life in a nursing home with people who share the same value system and culture are being denied and, therefore, everyone is brought down to the same common denominator. Of course, these issues will be debated when we raise them when affirmative resolution has to be taken and I will continue my remarks then. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes with concern the State Bank of South Australia's Rural Report for August 1990, which shows that gross farm income from 1989-90 to 1990-91 in South Australia is expected to plummet 49 per cent in relation to wheat, and 31 per cent in relation to both barley and wool;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the above calculations assume that the rate of exchange of $A/$US is $0.70, and that the current rate of exchange is in fact around $0.81, which means that gross farm incomes from wheat will drop 56 per cent, barley 40 per cent and wool 41 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) further notes that the United Farmers and Stockowners of S.A. Incorporated attributes the disastrous state of the South Australian rural economy to the Federal Government's monetary policy; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) calls on the Federal Government to adopt a monetary policy which will give Australian exporters a reasonable chance to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian farmers-as I was saying before that interjection from Senator Bolkus, who would know nothing about Australian farmers-are generally held in high regard throughout the world and South Australian farmers in particular are regarded as outstanding: outstanding for their economic efficiency and outstanding for their expertise in dry land farming, which has maximised the productive capacity of the driest State in the driest continent. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of this well deserved reputation, one would expect them to be reaping favourable economic rewards. Instead, we see our farmers plunged into the worst financial crisis since the Depression of the 1930s, a crisis which could well match that Depression as it continues to develop under this Government's inaction in its detrimental impact on farmers and rural communities but ultimately, and also importantly, in its detrimental impact on the whole Australian community. The whole Australian community will suffer if our farmers do, because farm production and farm income remain significant sources of wealth creation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike so many sectors of the Australian economy, of which the car industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industries are the most notable, Australian farmers are efficient and, when on a level playing field, internationally competitive. Being first and foremost exporters, they are price takers, not price setters as are industries which supply Australian domestic consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers have to meet the world market price for their commodities. By and large, they can do this and remain viable-even against the subsidised farm produce of Europe and America. By and large, they can remain viable despite having to carry around their necks the ravaging effects of periodic drought. By and large, they can remain viable, despite having to carry the cost of the excessive protection given to some sectors of Australian secondary industry around their necks, to the tune of about $8,000 per farm, as well as having to bear the cost of matching, under our centralised wages system, the wage levels which these protected industries are able to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Our farmers can cope with all of these disadvantages, but they cannot remain viable in the face of the long term economic mismanagement of this Hawke Labor Government. This economic mismanagement is most in evidence in its reliance on the single instrument of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers, not high interest rates, are Australia's best hope of overcoming our massive foreign debt, which grows monthly because we import more than we export. Certainly, over time, high interest rates have dampened demand for goods and services, including imports; but they have also destroyed Australia's productive capacity, especially that of our rural producers. Even with falling demand, accompanying falling production causes our trade deficit to remain, and so our foreign debt keeps escalating. We have all the pain and no gain. </PARA>
<PARA> The pain for South Australian farmers has been clearly spelt out in a recent letter from Don Pfitzner, the President of the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia, which is, of course, South Australia's peak rural group. He sent that letter to South Australian senators. The letter and the figures that other bodies have produced recently spell out the enormity of this crisis on the South Australian rural scene. The figures are disturbing and damning. The State Bank of South Australia, in its rural report of August 1990, has produced figures some of which are contained in the wording of the motion I read a few moments ago. These figures paint a shocking picture. The figures show that gross farm income this financial year is forecast to fall by 49 per cent from last year. </PARA>
<PARA> As the motion indicates, wheat, barley and wool incomes will be particularly hard hit, not to mention the loss of the live sheep trade to the Middle East. These massive falls in income will hit South Australian farmers-and, indeed, all South Australians-relatively harder than the rest of Australia, because although South Australia has only 9 per cent of Australia's population, we produce 19 per cent of Australia's wheat, 40 per cent of its barley, and 50 per cent of its live sheep exports, which are incorporated in South Australia producing 15 per cent of Australia's overall sheepmeat products. Because of that relatively higher proportion of Australia's production compared with our relatively lower proportion of Australia's population, this dramatic fall in income will have a much more severely detrimental effect on South Australia than on the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that these forecasts are based on an assumption that the rate of exchange between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar will be 70c. Today's rate is about 83c-with a rise of 2c even since this motion was drafted just a few weeks ago. That means gross income will drop even more. The State Bank now says that South Australia could lose $534m in earnings from wheat, barley and wool alone in this financial year. What is more important is that each of these gross figures is the sum of, and reflects, a decline in incomes for individual farms and farming families. The State Bank's Rural Banking Division predicts South Australian farmers will make no profit this financial year and will be forced to use savings or increase debt to maintain their operations. In other words, at best, South Australian farmers will have no income. That is what no profit means: no income; no wages for the farmer; having to live on past savings. It is not surprising, after reading this report, to also hear that farmers are angry and are taking action. How many trade unionists would work for a year for no wage?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;None at all, of course. They even want to be paid when they go out on strike. No wonder South Australian farmers have warned that they may join New South Wales to move to bring down the Hawke Government because of its gross mishandling of this economy. No wonder the United Farmers and Stockowners has said that the rural crisis in South Australia is the beginning of the 1990s depression. No wonder Don Pfitzner, in his letter to us, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The situation is deteriorating extremely fast, and I have very real fears for the future of many farmers and their families as well as the South Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote further from Mr Pfitzner's letter as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Even the `blue chip' farming areas of the State are suffering from the full impact of the collapse in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that a bank branch in one of the major regional centres of South Australia's south-eastern district-which is one of the State's most productive areas-has determined that 52 of its 76 rural clients are not viable under current commodity prices. It is estimated that each 1c rise in the value of the Australian dollar costs farm exporters $150m in total. Quite simply, the present excessively high value of the Australian dollar-a value which is unjustified by this country's wealth and productivity under this Hawke Labor Government's mismanagement-makes our produce uncompetitive in world markets and, therefore, the domestic market, in turn, is awash with primary produce and growers are receiving less than the cost of production for many commodities. Again, I quote from Mr Pfitzner's letter as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Across the whole range of commodities which we produce in our State-from grain to grapes, from citrus to wool-we are seeing our export markets deteriorate and our farm gate prices fall dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA>In the concluding paragraphs of Mr Pfitzner's letter are included damning indictments of this Hawke Labor Government as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We are convinced that the desperate state of South Australian agriculture has been brought about by the Federal Government's monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Federal Government's monetary policy has meant that farmers' debts have increased as they struggle to meet the repayments resulting from high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I request that you exercise all the influence you can upon the Federal Government and in particular the Treasurer, to introduce a monetary policy which will substantially improve the terms of trade for South Australian Farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion which I have moved on behalf of the coalition today is, in part, our way of fulfilling that request. We can only hope that it will not fall on deaf ears, but recent Government decisions give us little cause for hope. </PARA>
<PARA> In the August Budget this Government actually reduced the value of assets under which farmers or their children are eligible for Austudy, the family allowance supplement or the family allowance from the previous $600,000 to $400,000, $200,000 and $300,000 respectively. For those on salaries, $57,000 income is the cut-off point for family allowance, and it varies upwards if there are more children. There is no way that a $300,000 farm would generate $57,000 in income per year even in good times, let alone in the present parlous situation. Also, there is no concession allowed in terms of the assets test related to the number of children in a family. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government maintains a disadvantage of 10 to 15 per cent for Australian farmers compared with their American counterparts with regard to fuel prices. This Government continues its failure to reduce farm production costs by dragging the chain-as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) so aptly put it-on reducing protection, by failing to deregulate the labour market and failing to get rid of inefficiencies in rail transport, the wharves and coastal shipping. Most important of all, this Government refuses to budge from its reliance on high interest rates, despite their proven failure shown through theoretical analysis by experts such as Professor Ron Bewley and, most importantly, by their clearly demonstrated failure in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government should urgently introduce several measures to help alleviate the ills its policies have caused. These include immediate interest rate relief, the revision of taxation laws which disadvantage farmers, a drastic reassessment of welfare spending priorities, and a coordinated approach to reducing wage pressures. It should ease access to family benefits, especially Austudy benefits, for rural producers and their families who may be asset rich but are income poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian State Labor Government must also take positive initiatives. With a whole range of options open to it to provide producers with some relief, the Bannon Government failed dismally in its announcements yesterday after promising a package to deal with the crisis. All it has done is to increase to $150,000 from $100,000 the limit on loans available at 12 per cent interest under the rural adjustment scheme. But after three years these concessional rates revert to commercial rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that the Bannon Labor Government in South Australia has increased State taxation more than any other State this year-by a massive 18.2 per cent. These are taxes which, in the main, unlike income tax, farmers will have to pay irrespective of their financial situation and irrespective of their income. So, although national and overseas factors are largely to blame for the crisis, the State Government's response to the situation is quite inadequate. Furthermore, Mr Bannon, as Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, has failed to bring his influence to bear on his Federal colleagues in any effective way. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, the Liberal Party both nationally and in South Australia has the policies which will improve the lot of farmers. At the Federal level, a tighter fiscal policy, privatisation, tariff reform, tax changes and so-called micro-economic reform will markedly improve the economic climate for producers, in particular exporters. Our State colleagues in the Liberal Party have produced a five-point plan to alleviate the present rural crisis and are convening a crisis meeting of South Australian rural leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> But rural South Australia and, indeed, rural Australia, cannot wait for the next Federal and State elections, which will undoubtedly give us the opportunity to implement these initiatives. Urgent action is needed now. It is time for this Government to swallow its pride, admit that it is wrong and take up our proposals. Unless it does, rural Australia will simply not survive until we get the opportunity to do something for it after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the motion before the Senate, which has been moved by Senator Chapman and which quotes the United Farmers and Stockowners of SA Inc. and claims a disastrous situation in the South Australian rural economy. That is the gist of the motion. It goes on to claim that Federal Government monetary policy is somehow responsible for the decline in rural production values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is absolutely nothing in this motion about the prices of rural commodities. That is the first thing that has to be said. Of course, the prices of a number of rural products are down on world markets. There has been a worldwide reduction in commodity prices. The motion says absolutely nothing about world production levels for a number of commodities. Of course, at the moment agricultural production levels are very high. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion that is before us has more to do with the current state of conservative politics in South Australia than with the rural situation facing Australia. In fact, it is really about the rivalry and the battles going on on the conservative side of politics between the wets and the dries and between the city Liberals and the country Liberals. That is what this motion is all about. One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to work that out. </PARA>
<PARA> I get around South Australia very regularly. I am a regular visitor to many rural centres in South Australia, and I know that Senator Chapman is in great trouble in the Liberal Party over his stand on wheat deregulation. One does not have to go to too many towns in South Australia to find out that Senator Chapman's very vocal and strident position last year proposing deregulation of the wheat industry went down very badly in a host of country branches of the Liberal Party in South Australia. Senator Bolkus, the Minister in the chamber at present, knows very well that that is true-that the reason behind Senator Chapman's moving this motion tonight is that he is in deep trouble in his own branches in South Australia. </PARA>

There is no reference to the National Party's involvement in this document; he was talking purely about the position of the Liberal Party in South Australia on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I travel very regularly to the rural areas of South Australia. I know that, for example, the Liberal Party on the Eyre Peninsula is still licking its wounds after the drubbing it got in the Flinders electorate last year when Mr Peter Blacker, the National Party member for Flinders, whom the Liberals had great hopes of removing from office, triumphed yet again on the Eyre Peninsula. One of the Liberal Party's top drawer glamour candidates hit the fence in that election. </PARA>
<PARA> The moving of this motion in this Senate is really part of a drama that is being played out in South Australia between the big city Liberals and the country Liberals and between the Liberal Party and the National Party in the rural constituencies. That is what is going on and that is why this motion has been moved tonight. It does not talk about world commodity prices or world production levels; it has just been moved in here in an attempt to wave a flag saying, `We are the Liberals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Government is well aware of the falls in rural prices. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made a major speech in Parliament on Tuesday talking about the price falls in the wheat and wool components of the rural sector. We are well aware of and concerned about the falling values of production in those industries. But I will not on behalf of the Government support a motion of this type which has been moved as part of the continuing drama on the conservative side of politics in South Australia. We on the Government side are well aware that rural proceeds are down, particularly in the wheat and wool sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say that I am not in trouble in the wheat belt over my stand on wheat deregulation, but I know that Senator Chapman is in real trouble in the country branches of the South Australian Liberal Party. I get around. My sources in the Liberal Party keep me informed on what is going on in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The key problem facing farmers in Australia is that world production levels, particularly for cereals, are very high. There have been record harvests in the Northern Hemisphere and a very big harvest in the United States of America, one of the major producers of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite an article in this week's edition of the London Economist magazine, which is not a magazine from which I normally quote or read greatly. However, I did see in an article on United States farming a reference to `bumper harvests of corn and wheat'. There has been a major crop in the United States and big crops in the major producing countries, so prices are not very high. Australia, of course, is a price-taker; we cannot set world cereals prices, and consequently that has been a major reason for the fall in Australian prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to wool-and the wool component of the rural sector is the one that is causing the most concern at the moment-we all know the history of the wool industry in recent times. The fall in wool income colours the whole farm picture. It is estimated, according to information available to the Government, that some 58 per cent of the total loss of production in Australia's rural sector is due to the one industry's decline, and that is the wool industry. The current position in that industry does not reflect Government monetary policy or exchange rates specifically, as has been referred to. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me talk about some of the things that the Hawke Government has done for the rural sector, because they are very important. The conservative forces in Australia tend very conveniently to forget some of the major reforms that have occurred. For example, I can well remember a time in the early 1980s when double digit inflation faced Australia's farmers. There were double digit farm cost rises under the Fraser-Howard Government, and I well remember them. Under the Liberal Government in the early 1980s farmers were facing costs that were rising at 11, 12 and 13 per cent a year. We had inflationary costs at that level, which hit the farm sector. At the same time, as Senator Chapman pointed out, our farmers are price-takers for their products; their output prices are set by somebody else. But under the Liberal Government in the early 1980s, they were facing double digit cost rises, and that is a matter of record. We do not have double digit price rises in Australia now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not, and it is a fact. The Liberals would pretend that inflation is still at the levels they left the Australian farmers facing. We do not have 11, 12 and 13 per cent cost rises facing farmers now. In fact, when one looks at overall indexes of inflation, one sees that they are more like 7 to 8 per cent in terms of cost rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the other things that the Liberals very conveniently forget is Labor's enormous achievement in reducing disruptions to the shipping of farmers' products to markets. We had enormous problems in this country before the Hawke Government was elected in regard to industrial disputation. This afternoon I went and refreshed my memory as to the numbers of days lost due to industrial disputes under the Liberal-National administration. I thought the figure I had in my mind was right-two million days lost to industrial disputes in 1982-83 under a Liberal administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he was in Parliament. He was the member for Wills in the Federal Parliament at the time. But I would point out that we do not have a situation now in which two million days are being lost annually owing to industrial disputes, two million days which disrupted the movement of our wheat and our wool crops to world markets. I am sure Senator Panizza was complaining about those things as a farm activist in Western Australia. The number of days lost due to industrial disputes in the last year for which figures are available was not two million, but in fact had been cut by 35 per cent to 1.3 million. There is a very tangible achievement of the Hawke Labor Government in terms of keeping down the cost of shipping our farm products to export markets. Those are very important steps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to this motion moved by Senator Chapman, which is very critical of the exchange rate-the international parity of the Australian dollar-the Government is certainly aware of concerns in all sectors of the economy about the level of the Australian dollar. However, it is fact that the dollar is high at the moment. That in turn helps contain inflation. It is no accident, I think, that one of the reasons why it is helpful to have a relatively high dollar-and I do not want to see it continue permanently, I might say-is that it does help to contain inflationary pressures in a domestic market by helping to keep down the price of imports. That is a fact of life. Although that high dollar might not be helpful to farm incomes, it is certainly helping to contain the growth of costs. That is the other side of the coin. One cannot have it both ways and say that one is losing on both sides of the equation. I know, for example, that many of the pesticides and insecticides used in the farming sector are imported. I would like to have a look at some of the prices for them, but certainly, if one wants to push up their prices, one will have a low dollar rather than a high dollar. That is a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion also blames the Federal Government's monetary policy for the position in the South Australian agricultural sector. I presume that Senator Chapman is referring to interest rates. If he is, I agree that interest rates are high at the moment; but the Government has interest rates at current levels for very good reasons: to ensure that the total level of spending in the Australian community is brought more into line with total levels of production in Australia to stop an overflow, a spill-over of buying power into imported products. That is the reason interest rates are high. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that if interest rates were not at present levels we would have a bigger balance of payments deficit. What do those opposite want? If I can just ask a rhetorical question: what does Senator Chapman want? He wants to have lower interest rates, it would seem. Does he therefore want to have a bigger balance of payments deficit? That is one of the things I would like to ask him. Certainly it is a fact that the Liberal Party does hold the record for having the biggest balance of payments deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. That is the reality. The Liberals hold the record of having a deficit in 1981-82 of 5.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Does Senator Chapman want to repeat that? The Government has reduced interest rates on four occasions. This calendar year there have been four rounds of cuts in interest rates-major falls have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (d) of this motion calls for the introduction of an appropriate monetary policy to help us compete internationally. I am paraphrasing paragraph (d), but that is what it is really saying-we want an appropriate monetary policy to help us compete internationally. I presume that means that Senator Chapman wants an interest rate level which would help us reduce the value of the Australian dollar compared with other currencies and would therefore be a spur to exports. I presume that is the logic. A lower Australian dollar will probably raise the cost of production. Imported products will go up in price. It is voodoo economics to say those sorts of things. But I presume that Senator Chapman means that by lowering the interest rates one will lower the value of the dollar and therefore help exports. </PARA>
<PARA> That type of link is rather naive. I simply refer to the facts about this calendar year. There is no clear link between levels of interest rates and the level of the Australian dollar. At the beginning of this year the Australian dollar was worth US79c, and at the time cash interest rates were 18 per cent. So 18 per cent interest was in conjunction with a 79c dollar. But now we have got cash interest rates of 14 per cent, but the Australian dollar is not 79c; it is above 80c. So at the same time as interest rates have fallen by four percentage points from 18 per cent at the beginning of the year to 14 per cent now, the Australian dollar has not gone down; it has gone higher. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break this evening I was expressing concern about falling levels of production in the rural sector, particularly in the wheat and wool sectors, due to international factors, particularly the increase in world production levels and consequent falls in world prices, which I believe will have a more profound effect on the value of rural production than will interest rates, the subject of this motion tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am opposing this motion that has been moved by Senator Chapman. Senator Chapman is one of the most vocal deregulators in the Senate. He has been very strong in his support for the deregulation of the wheat market, and it is fair to say that he wishes to see market forces at work in other markets of the economy, including the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the part of this motion which refers to the rate of exchange-the value of the Australian dollar compared with other currencies. Over the years, those on the conservative side of politics have called repeatedly for a floating Australian dollar. That is what they have sought time and time again. They said that it would be appropriate for supply and demand to set the level of the Australian dollar. They have said that market forces should be used to set the value of the Australian dollar on the world exchanges. In other words, they did not want a pegged or fixed exchange rate for the Australian dollar. That was basically the view of those on the conservative side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all that rhetoric about deregulation and market forces, we find in this motion tonight that Senator Chapman does not want the particular level of the Australian dollar that applies at this time and place. He does not want an Australian dollar at the levels that we currently see. He is saying in moving this motion tonight on the farm sector that the current level of the Australian dollar is not suitable. But, as I have pointed out, conservative politicians for years called for the introduction of market forces, for supply and demand to set prices in markets-in other words, to set prices for a range of items, including the value of Australia's currency compared to other countries. We see in this motion moved this evening that conservative politicians do not want to see market forces being left to set the value of the Australian dollar as it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a number of other initiatives that the Hawke Government has taken in regard to the farm sector. We were the nation which instigated the so-called Cairns Group of traders, countries which are predominantly producers of commodities. We sponsored the formation of that Group to try to increase the bargaining power of those countries whose products hitherto had been set by international forces rather than by the countries themselves. By taking that action of convening the Cairns Group of producers, we were addressing the major problem of the rural sector, which is the levels of commodity prices and the fact that we have not been able to influence the levels of commodity prices faced by Australian producers. Also in convening the Cairns Group of countries, we were taking action to hit corrupted agricultural markets, to hit corrupted trading practices whereby particularly the European Community and the United States of America subsidised exports of commodities, especially agricultural commodities. We took action; we did not simply complain about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has also been heavily involved in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. We have been fairly central in having agricultural products put on the agenda for that round of trade negotiations, and seeing trade not simply as the movement of industrial products between countries but as including agricultural products as well. I might also refer again to that article in this week's Economist magazine from London headed up the `Wrath of America's Farmers'. It refers to threats by the United States of America to walk out of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. It is very interesting indeed to see that the United States seems to be becoming concerned at last about the effect and impact of subsidies in agricultural markets around the world. I quote that article:</PARA>
<PARA>America may not be bluffing when it threatens to walk out of the Uruguay Round of trade talks if there is no deal to cut farm subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly a very interesting quote. It is certainly very hopeful and maybe, at long last, after repeated efforts by the Australian Government, the United States Administration itself is getting the message about the harm done by subsidies for farming products on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major initiative of the Hawke Government has been the introduction of the first ever program at the Federal level for soil conservation. Many on this side of the House, I suspect, would say that the need for soil conservation because of the degrading of Australia's farmland is one of the major environmental problems facing this country. We were the first government in the history of this nation at the Federal level to provide funds for soil conservation. For decades the Liberals and the National Party did absolutely nothing about this very pressing problem. The soil blew away in our most fertile farming areas and it became a major environmental problem, but it took a Labor government to act on the question of soil conservation. </PARA>

That is the fact and that is the reality. Opposition senators can try to prove that I am wrong. I also point out that this Government introduced a full excise rebate on the use of diesel fuel on farms. We have provided for reductions in excise tax for those who use diesel fuel on farms-a major initiative by this Government for the farming sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this motion is about the record of the South Australian State Government in regard to the farming sector, I note that yesterday the State Minister for Agriculture, Mr Lynn Arnold, announced some measures to help remedy the situation in the rural sector. I note, for example, that he has increased the maximum lending limits for the rural adjustment scheme up to $50,000, and funds will be available at a 12 per cent interest rate for three years under that particular scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There we have it. The rural sector, which we all know is a very cyclical sector, has its troughs and its peaks. No doubt continuing striving by Australian farmers to produce efficiency will help protect them more against the cycles. It is most important that farmers continue to make efficiency gains on their properties. They have had a good track record and they will have to continue to look for efficiency gains. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some figures which show that returns from farmers vary enormously per hectare. That is something that ought to be looked at more closely. The figures suggest that returns per hectare are as low as $43 for some farms and as high as $245 for others. I presume that the farms are in similar climatic areas and that the samples chosen are of broadly similar areas. As a result, I think we ought to be focusing on making sure that those with the lowest returns per hectare come up closer to the average and improve beyond the average. That would seem to be one area where we can move for better returns for our farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, efficiency gains for farmers have been a key in the past. They have been achieved by Australia's farmers in the past and they certainly will be a key to future prosperity in the rural sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Hill's motion, moved by Senator Chapman, and to remind the Senate that, as someone who lives and works in rural Australia, I can tell honourable senators that it is hurting out there-far more so than most Australians living in the city realise. I speak as the wife of a farmer, the mother of a farmer, and a person who pays the bills for the farm workers on our property, so I know what I am talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have listened to Senator Maguire talking about what Labor has done. He has not mentioned the exorbitant interest rates that farmers have to put up with under the Labor Government. He has not talked about the big overseas debt that we have acquired under the Labor Government. He has not talked about the high fuel prices that we have under the Labor Government, which it does nothing to try to bring down. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion before us notes that gross farm income in South Australia is expected to plummet in relation to wheat, wool and barley. It also condemns the Federal Government for its adherence to a policy which means that Australia's commodities are uncompetitive in export markets, with every 1c rise in the value of the Australian dollar costing Australian farm exporters an estimated $150m. It also calls on the Government to adopt a monetary policy which will give Australian exporters a reasonable chance to compete internationally. I can tell honourable senators that it is not only in South Australia that farmers will be facing massive reductions in incomes. We are facing what is becoming quite commonly referred to in the press as our rural crisis all across the country. The profound shift in Australia's export earnings from farm product to other economic sectors has left primary producers with shrinking incomes. The far-reaching changes that this shift is engendering are by no means complete, although they are being speeded up by historically high interest rates and technology's impact on areas such as the fibre market. These changes mean that we cannot afford simply to sit back and wait for the farm sector to be virtually depopulated. It is in everyone's interest to control the process, to ameliorate its worst effects, and to approach the whole issue with a balance of sympathy and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that rural producers are suffering. They are hit by fuel pricing policies which might make a great deal of sense in bureaucratic compact Canberra but which add intolerably to the cost of living in remote parts of the country. These fuel pricing policies mean that the Federal Government Treasury coffers and the exchequers of States which impose fuel taxes are garnering rich profits from the crisis in the global oil market. This Government still believes that we need world parity pricing to demonstrate that we are fair dinkum about being part of the real world. Most people, in contrast, would argue that the national interest demands that we should seek to minimise the impact that Saddam Hussein can have on our pockets through petrol prices and their effects on other costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Today farmers are also being made to face financial risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Down the track some of them face virtual closure of their markets through changing demands and the advance of technology. Urban Australians-the great majority of this country's people-have very little grasp of the realities of making a living in the bush. To them, the country is a place to drive through on the way to a holiday. The problems of sheep farmers in the est, like those of Longreach grazier Ron Button, which were featured recently in the Courier-Mail, are gross and intractable. Mr Button runs 9,000 sheep on a 12,000 hectare property, a business his family has been in for a century. The next year will be very hard for him. Rising production and commodity prices, coupled with diving wool prices, are expected to reduce the family's income by 30 per cent. Imagine the hullabaloo if workers on award wages were to be told that their pay packets were to be slashed by nearly one third over the next 12 months. I can just imagine what honourable senators opposite would be saying about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Where it has not already fallen prey to agribusiness, the farm sector is very much a family affair. Yet such farms rarely make enough profit to pay each productive family member a living wage. To that extent farms are small businesses and should be seen as such by the tax man and the bureaucracy. Small wonder in these circumstances that farmers are getting restive. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the President of the Queensland Farmers Federation, they are also getting ready to take to the streets. Mr Lyndsay Hall, the President of the QFF, says that Queensland farmers will back a move by the National Farmers Federation (NFF) for direct action to highlight the fact that thousands of their colleagues are going broke. Yet we hear members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) saying that there is no rural crisis. An interview with the United Graziers Association president, Mr Bill Bonthrone, reported in a recent newspaper article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bonthrone told a UGA council meeting in Brisbane that the rural crisis was driving conservative, law-abiding citizens to call for militant action. </PARA>
<PARA> `The anger is now so deep that only the catalyst is needed for an emotional explosion from the family. It could be fuel prices and interest rates that provide it,' Mr Bonthrone said. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Lavarch, the honourable member for Fisher, the electorate that adjoins Wide Bay, the electorate in which I live, said the suggestion that the rural economy was going to collapse as a result of high interest rates was an oversimplification. Perhaps Mr Lavarch should speak to his Prime Minister, who only today finally admitted that his Government's high interest rate policy was causing undue hardship and damage. Also, there was an item in today's news where South Australian backbencher, Lloyd O'Neil, said that many farmers might be asset rich but income poor, particularly with this years rural downturn. He is certainly telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond doubt, the farm sector must live with the strictures that apply to all components of Australian society. Nationally, we are uncompetitive in world terms. We are paying for past delusions. We must, though, recognise the need to regulate the effects of fast moving change on sectors of the economy which impinge heavily on individual lives. Recently there was a letter in the Brisbane Courier-Mail and I will read some of it to honourable senators. It contains the comments of any ordinary Australian fed up with what is happening to his country, and it is a plea for the Government to finally recognise the mess we are in. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>I have had enough of watching the Australian Treasurer, Paul Keating, telling us his economic policies are working:</PARA>
<PARA>We have:</PARA>
<PARA>* Record current account deficits. </PARA>
<PARA>* The highest continuous interest rates historically, which are doing irreparable damage not only to small business, but to grazing and farming industries as well as the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>* The greatest number of small business collapses in our history outside the great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA>* An Australian dollar so high it has priced the export industries off world markets and dramatically reduced our opportunities to trade. </PARA>
<PARA>* A national debt which has, in only a few years, escalated out of all proportion to $140 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>* The nation's greatest single export earner-the wool industry-with its confidence shattered by the unbelievable government decision to reduce the floor price against the advice of the Australian Wool Corporation, Wool Council of Australia, the vast majority of processors around the world and 96 per cent of Queensland wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA>* A wheat industry about to receive the lowest first payment for many years. </PARA>
<PARA>* A beef industry struggling for survival, for although it has been receiving high prices (which are now falling fairly dramatically), it is being smothered by escalating costs and government charges. </PARA>
<PARA>* A desperate sell off of the Commonwealth Bank to prop up the incompetent financial performance of the Victorian Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If this rot doesn't stop, the nation will never recover. We will have lost the lucky country. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government cannot claim that the rural crisis has only just hit. It has been warned continuously for years, and the evidence to show just what is happening outside our major cities has been around for quite some time. As long ago as last year we read of disturbing figures which showed that farmers were losing money fast, with costs increasing at twice the rate of income. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics September quarter index last year showed an average of 1.2 per cent increase on prices received, or income, whereas this was heavily outweighed by a 2.1 per cent increase in prices paid. This is under a Labor government which then has the effrontery to claim that farmers are pleased with the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what criteria the Government would use for such a claim, but I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if your income is being steadily eroded at the rate where the costs to earn it are twice the rate of the actual income, then I am sure that if you are a thinking Australian, and I know that you are, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know that you were going backwards and you would not be too happy with that situation. Perhaps some honourable senators opposite would be happy to see their income eroding as quickly as that! There is not much point producing a product if it cannot be sold profitably. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, it is not much use to so rationalise our rural sector that we eventually see the demise of the family farmer-the person who spends unrecognised hours and efforts producing that end product. The Government has often made much of the fact that its major endeavours were to encourage the growth of an adaptable and efficient primary industries and energy sector. It is often when assessing the rural industries that we talk only in terms of how much they have contributed to Australia's growth and not the effort that has been made to achieve those exports. But it is here that I want to point out that in the goal to achieve these low cost internationally competitive industries the Government has to be aware that it could be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. </PARA>
<PARA> I am referring not only to some of the major decisions the Government has taken in the past few years which have had a direct impact on primary industries such as wool, wheat, sugar, and the fishing industries, but also to the policies which this Government is continuously maintaining, such as crippling high interest rates and excessive fuel costs which have had adverse effects on the man on the land. We never heard a word about those from Senator Maguire when he was speaking earlier. If in the process to achieve cost efficient industries we push the small family farmer off the land, in the long run we are serving no really good purpose for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be ever vigilant that we do not allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to misplace the needs of people. This is what is happening in many industries today, and it is at the expense of one of the most important sections of our community-the economic survival of the small family farmer. I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion that was moved earlier by Senator Chapman. </PARA>

Does that mean that the honourable senator is to range over the whole of that part of the portfolio area that remains? If that is so, clearly the Estimates will not be dealt with item by item as they arise and matters that may arise out of another senator's questions which could have been pursued-matters that may not have been known by the senator that has to leave to fit the Government's program elsewhere-may not be pursued. In my view, that is unsatisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why could there not have been orderly planning that allowed the standing committees to meet at a time that was convenient? As I asked this morning, why could the Estimates Committee not have met last Wednesday night or alternatively next Wednesday night so we did not have this doubling up? Unfortunately, no satisfactory answer has been given to the Senate tonight. I do not intend to hold up debate now because an important debate is taking place on the rural crisis that is being faced in this country, but I do express my disappointment and say that, in our view, the answer that the Minister has given is not satisfactory. It has simply flowed from the Government's inability to get its program in proper order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Estimates Committee C has been given a very heavy workload. It has had to consider the estimates for the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories; the Department of Social Security; the Department of Community Services and Health; and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We were given three days to complete that task and, of course, we were unable to do so. We were given an extra two days, but we were not given the same Minister. The Ministers that we normally have were unable to be present and we were shifted around from one Minister to another. Sometimes the Minister came in for an hour at a time. This was most unsatisfactory. It is not the fault of the Estimates Committee at all. The fault lies with the Government and the very heavy load that it gave the Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has said that it wants this new arrangement of sending Bills to standing committees to work. It seems to me that to date the Government has not given our committee even a full day to look at the Bill that is before us. There is no possibility of our task being accomplished in one day. The Government has taken away an hour and a half with its suggestion that the Estimates Committee sit prior to the sitting of the Senate standing committee. Estimates Committee C has been extremely cooperative as I am sure Senator Tate, if he were here, would acknowledge. With the Department of Veterans' Affairs we called only the Minister and four officers. I think we questioned the whole Department for only about 20 minutes. There were not a number of questions. We did not go through veterans' affairs in detail because we saw that we were unable to accomplish the task that the Government had set us in anywhere near the time allowed. We virtually scrubbed veterans' affairs from our agenda. As I say, the Committee has been particularly cooperative with the Government in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Acting Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Richardson), in all good faith at the moment: What is wrong with Estimates Committee C sitting on Wednesday night? It would at least give the Senate standing committee one full day, even though more time is required-and no doubt we will debate that some time later-and the standing committee would be able to start at 9 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister knows, the Government has run out of legislation. Indeed, all the legislation ceased last Tuesday night at two minutes past 10. The next day, Wednesday, all sorts of odd legislation was dredged up for us to be able to open the doors of the Senate. Now we have reached the stage where the Estimates are encroaching on the Friday that the Senate determined, with its numbers, should be put aside for the standing committees to sit on. The standing committees not sitting for the full day will make a difference to those senators who wish to, and have a right to, visit those committee sittings. It will also make a big difference to any senator who wishes to attend the Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the arrangements stop the Senate standing committees having any real input or being considered in a serious manner by the Government, and I protest very strongly. Again I ask the Minister if he will arrange for the Estimates committee to sit on Wednesday night instead of tomorrow morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The processes by which Bills will be sent off to the standing committees admittedly is one which is in the process of development. But I remind the Senate that there have been meetings between representatives of all parties, there have been a number of documents circulated and those documents-certainly in relation to the Australian Democrats' consideration-have been considered at some length. We were under the impression that a pattern of classification of Bills was agreed to and that the processes by which Bills would be dealt with had also been agreed to and this was the pattern towards which we were moving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the Selection of Bills Committee considered a number of pieces of legislation. The report which has just been tabled indicates that there are nine Bills which the Selection of Bills Committee, on which representatives of all parties sit, has agreed could go straight through the older type of processes in this chamber without being referred to a Standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two Bills which-I believe everybody in this chamber has known this for days-those of us in the Opposition and in the Democrats wanted to be dealt with under category C. If any senator in this chamber does not know what category C is, he or she has not been reading the literature that has been going around and has been substantially, I understood, agreed to. There are considerable controversial elements in both of those pieces of legislation and we certainly wish to have witnesses called and I understand that is the position of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, in a meeting with Senator Richardson in relation to those Bills, he pointed out, quite rightly, that some clauses need start-up dates for 1 November. I pointed out to him that the clauses would need amendment because there was no way witnesses could be called this Friday, that there was simply not enough notice given. He indicated to me, and I would like him to confirm this, that with respect to those clauses amendments could be made so that the 1 November start-up date-I am not referring to the 1 January start-up date-could be put back, so that witnesses could be called. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say to the Government that if it is not going to be fair in relation to the new system, if it is going to try to use its numbers in small committees to prevent the new system from working, as it was designed to work and as we understood it had been agreed it should work, I believe that we will simply come back into this chamber and we will send the Bills off to a committee. It will hold the old style committee hearings; there will be a calling for written submissions; the whole process will take months and the Government certainly will not get its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I put that on notice and I suggest that the Government start to consider this new process a little more considerately, particularly as it is not the fault of either the Democrats or the Opposition that we are running out of legislation. The Government controls legislation and it is the Government which has failed to bring legislation forward in adequate time. I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that the 1 November start-up clauses cannot be accommodated, that these Bills cannot be dealt with under category C, and that the calling of witnesses cannot be accommodated within the next few weeks so that the Government can have its legislation within this session?</PARA>

Senator Coulter early in his remarks said that a document had been circulated which indicated a coded procedure, A, B, C, D, for dealing with committees. That document is circulating. There is no final agreement about that document as yet. Nowhere in that document which is circulating in this chamber is there any mention of splitting a Bill and referring it to two or more committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is where the Government has been dry gulched. In recent hours we have been dry gulched on it. That is an offensive remark, and the honourable senator ought to take that on board and examine where he and his party are going in developing and making this new system work. No new system will work if it is modified at every turn as we move through it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address some remarks to what Senator Walters had to say about the Estimates committee and the difficulty that she had, as a member of that Estimates committee, and indeed that other senators may have who may be interested in the affairs of that Estimates committee and the relevant standing committee. It is accepted that there is a problem with the number of departments that are allocated to Estimates Committee C and I understand that the Government and the respective Ministers are going to look at that and attempt to ensure that that situation does not develop again. It is a very weighty committee in terms of its portfolio responsibility. But it should not be forgotten that the Committee has been examining its reports and has been undertaking its inquiries for four long days--</PARA>

That applied not only to Government senators but also to some Opposition senators. So it applied to each of us in turn. That extra sitting day had to be called off, but we did try to make some progress by sitting a little later on Tuesday night, 26 September. The Committee examined when it might meet again, remembering that 26 September was the first week of the two-week break that we had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We endeavoured to utilise the remainder of that week or the following week, which was a break from the Parliament, but unfortunately, because of commitments, among other things, that senators had to standing committees of the Parliament which were undertaking inquiries throughout Australia, we were unable to do so. A week and a half of available time was lost. We then looked at the possibility of sitting on Monday of last week but unfortunately the shadow Cabinet meets on that day and the whole day was ruled out as an option as well. It was suggested that we could have met last Wednesday night, but the Committee determined that we should not meet last night. </PARA>

So we are locked into that. We do have a reporting date determined by the Parliament. That reporting date is next Thursday.

<PARA> The question was asked: Why can the Committee not meet on Wednesday night of next week? The Government would have no problems with that if it was sure that the Committee would finish its deliberations by 10 a.m. on Thursday of next week, and there is no guarantee of that. I assure honourable senators opposite that it has not been Government senators asking all the questions. I know that the Committee has some concern because a number of honourable senators have not been able to ask questions in the Committee. We have tried to accommodate them. We have leaned over backwards to do so. </PARA>

We on this side of the chamber could give some guarantees, and we could then deliver them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I make a couple of comments in this debate on committees. The way things are going with the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, after our meeting that has just concluded, I really see no point in our meeting tomorrow. It may well be that this Estimates Committee can continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats and the Liberals attempted to get a set of standing orders for the Committee that would have permitted us to call witnesses. After all, the main reason we terminated the debate during its second reading, not letting it go to a vote, not letting everybody speak, was so that it could go to committee for a proper inquiry. In that Committee I moved a motion that all witnesses be called as required to provide written submissions or be asked to appear before the Committee. That was defeated. Therefore, that Committee has been set the task tomorrow of listening only to the Minister, possibly to the Department, and then only to any person whom we can ring at 9 o'clock in the morning demanding that that person attend, whether that person lives in Sydney or wherever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats had hoped that we would be able to make the system work. We wanted only three people. At our earlier meeting today we had hoped to get out the requests to those people for a written submission. The vast majority of those submissions could simply have been recorded in Hansard as received. The information could have been taken on board as we made our decisions. However, that was not to be. We have spent today in two meetings, making effectively no real decisions on recalling anybody. We have lost an excellent opportunity to get this off the ground next Friday. I recommend that the Estimates Committee continue to meet because there is very little point in the other Committee meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I make two points. First, the sort of procedure envisaged and foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats and the Opposition in discussion on this particular legislation has been covered in the document circulated, the spirit of which we were attempting to adhere to, both yesterday in other matters and today on this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to try to expedite that approach, Senator Lees developed a list of people whom she felt she would need to see to answer some of her concerns. Some of those people are not in Canberra. For whatever reason, the Committee was unable to accept that motion. It certainly was never up to the individual senator to make decisions about who would be called or whether anyone would be called. We certainly made an attempt to facilitate the work of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Another committee has been going through the same procedure of deciding what it will do tomorrow. Last night it made those decisions, established its procedures, called its witnesses and will go through its procedures tomorrow. Whether it finishes tomorrow or not depends on how the committee's work proceeds. We were involved as a party in that process. I think we had a perfect right on this legislation, although the appropriate committees had not yet reported, to be anticipating in the spirit of the document that has been circulated. It was always clear what type of inquiry we were looking for. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing that, although one committee can accept from our Party submissions on the witnesses it wants, can accept a different set of witnesses from the Opposition, can set up a timetable and can get it all done expeditiously and pretty efficiently, with negotiations between the parties and in the end the committee making the decision-which is exactly the process we were attempting to put in place with this piece of legislation; I have Senator Lees's list in front of me-unfortunately it has not worked in this case. As Senator Lees has said, we are of the view at this point that there really is not anything to be achieved in that committee tomorrow that would not be achieved in the chamber via the old system. </PARA>

<PARA> The other Bill that Senator Powell referred to is the Privacy Amendment Bill, which has passed its second reading and which will be dealt with by the relevant committee because there are large numbers of amendments-Government amendments and possible Opposition amendments-and, I gather, alternative suggestions from some of the witnesses. I suppose that is a way in which the Privacy Amendment Bill can fit more easily into the draft document that Senator Powell referred to and can be dealt with in the way that was being proposed. </PARA>

There was general agreement that it would not be finalised until Senator Ray returned as Manager of Government Business next week and let Senator Richardson resume his normal heart rate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope so; I can never be sure. There are a couple of crucial questions here. I suggest that the allegedly different versions are not what happened at the Committee earlier on tonight. Knowing the loquacious nature of some of the senators who sit on this Committee, I can understand that they would have all been talking at the same time, some of them even under wet cement. Nonetheless, I am faced with the task of explaining what the Government's attitude is on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first crucial question comes from Senator Walters, on the operations of Estimates Committee C. The Guinness Book of Records will be rewritten by Estimates Committee C and Estimates Committee A on this occasion. They are sitting for what all of us would acknowledge to be an extraordinary length of time. It does not matter whether one is a member of the Opposition or the Government, sitting for five days on an Estimates Committee is not normal. One wonders just how long these committees will go. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters asks why the Government is not prepared to have the committees sit next Wednesday evening. The Government is prepared to have Estimates Committee C sit next Wednesday evening. I told the chairperson, Senator Crowley, that that may well be necessary and that she ought to prepare her troops for yet another onslaught. If one realistically looks at what has happened at Estimates Committee C during those five days, one sees that there is no guarantee that it will finish tomorrow; in fact, I would have to say that the chances were less than 50:50. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then has a real problem, because we have a reporting date for Estimates committees of 18 October. If we have an 18 October reporting date, we will need tomorrow and we will probably need next Wednesday night to have them complete their business. So we do not have a choice about Estimates committees sitting tomorrow: it is simply not an option if we are to abide by those reporting dates. That is the first point on Estimates Committee C. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point about Estimates Committee C is that conditions are being offered by the Government tonight that I have not heard offered before in my 7 1/2 years in the chamber, and that is the absolute right of priority given to a particular senator to enable that particular senator to ask whatever questions that particular senator considers to be necessary. That, in so far as the operations of Estimates Committee C are concerned, surely covers all that has been said. More fundamental, more crucial to the operations of the Government, will be what occurs tomorrow at Senator Zakharov's committee on the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. There is some confusion in Senator Coulter's mind. We do not have a record of the proceedings of the meeting last night and I cannot be certain of exactly what words I used. I cannot guarantee, therefore, that I have finished the words exactly, but I will be very exact about it now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly the case that some start-up dates will have to be changed, but they are not start-up dates for the pharmaceutical benefits Bill. The start-up dates that I acknowledge have to be changed are in the social security legislation. They are concerned, in fact, with February Economic Statement start-up dates. We had start-up dates, I think, for sole parents and family allowances for tax file numbers of 1 November, and I indicated to Senator Coulter that already it was obvious that those particular start-up dates would have to be changed, and they will. Clearly, now, the Government envisages changing those 1 November start-up dates to 1 January. Obviously, that means some loss of revenue to the Government. That part of the loss of revenue to the Government is comparatively minor. So that the Senate can conduct what is an appropriate investigation, the Government will readily agree that those start-up dates can be put back. If I have misled Senator Coulter on this I apologise, although I certainly did not mean to and I thought he understood it referred to that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the pharmaceutical benefits Bill itself is concerned, the Government has not even considered the possibility of its start-up date being put back. That has massive implications for revenue. While I must concede that it has been a movable feast for all of us as to what would happen with these committees in the last couple of days, I was not made aware until today that there was any possibility that we were not likely to have that Bill coming back into the Senate for report next week, and then back to the House of Representatives. We regard that 1 November start-up date as very important to the integrity of the Budget, and I have never suggested that the Government would be happy or easy with delaying it. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to that, we face the problem now of Senator Cooney's committee tomorrow dealing with the privacy legislation on consumer credit and not with tax file numbers in the social security legislation, and the suggestion-I must admit, not made to me until today but probably it has been around for somewhat longer, maybe a couple of days-that some senators want a full-blown inquiry into that tax file number system. That would take us into next year and mean that start-up dates would be put back until April. </PARA>
<PARA> That, again, would be very serious indeed for the Government. The Government had operated-I think quite reasonably-in the expectation that that tax file number legislation, if it was to be passed, would be dealt with by the Senate in December at the latest-we were certainly hoping for November but, given that that looks impossible, at least by December-so that the 1 January start-up dates could be met. If those start-up dates were all to be put back until April-and that would be the earliest if we were going to have a full-blown inquiry and then report back when the Senate resumes next year; a 1 April start-up date would probably be optimistic-we are getting to somewhere between $70m and $100m lost to revenue from the Budget. The Government cannot just wipe away those sorts of massive sums easily. It was never suggested to me that that was likely to happen and the Government must resist that occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> In resisting it, I put it to honourable senators that it is not a matter of resisting the spirit or the letter of anything. I am as anxious as any senator here to make this committee system work. The Government will cooperate totally with it. We will be there, we will sit there and we will answer questions day in and day out. But what we are concerned about-and I think, especially in the light of events of the last 24 hours, quite reasonably so-is that, in particular, these Government Bills to do with the Budget, which involve considerable sums of money and the integrity of the Budget itself, get dealt with within a reasonable period. We are happy, as I said, to put some start-up dates back, but we cannot be expected to delay the whole of these Budget Bills until April or May next year. That would place far too great an impost on the Government and we cannot agree to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I must assert, especially to Senator Coulter, that we never did agree to that. In none of the negotiations conducted by Senator Ray or Senator Coates was that ever suggested. We do not want to break the spirit of that agreement. I am sure that when Senator Ray returns on Monday-and that cannot happen soon enough-we will complete the negotiations of the wording of that agreement and we can set it in concrete. I have to assert again that we have not set it in concrete yet. There are some changes which have not been put to Government senators. I do not know whether they have been put to Opposition senators, but there has certainly not been a meeting of the Government to address this question. So it requires a few more days. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, we will have to try to work our way through a new committee system that is causing some difficulties. The Government can put some start-up dates back for money Bills, on the assumption that they will be completed within a reasonable amount of time, but on the pharmaceutical benefits Bill we have never considered the possibility of doing away with its start-up date. When one then goes through the whole range of start-up dates in the social security legislation for tax file numbers, again, we are talking about very big losses to revenue, and that is not something the Government would be able to contemplate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was indeed startled by the attitude of the Government in this debate as exemplified earlier this evening by Senator Maguire in comments which I and many other senators on this side of the chamber found utterly contemptible and offensive. But that would not be inconsistent with the attitude of many senior members of the Government. In fact, it would not be inconsistent with the attitude of Mr Courtice, who happens to be the Chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force. Mr Courtice is on record as saying, `I certainly do not believe or agree that rural Australia is in crisis or about to collapse'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Courtice, the man whose job is supposed to be representing the electorate of Hinkler in the House of Representatives, the man whose job is supposed to be to represent all the farmers and other people dependent on primary industry in his electorate, has the audacity to come to Canberra and say that he does not believe that rural Australia is in a crisis. Maybe Mr Courtice has been in Canberra for too long. Maybe Senator Maguire has been in Canberra for too long. I can say, as, I am sure, can all of senators on this side of the chamber, that even the shortest trip into provincial Australia will reveal the depth of the crisis that is facing this country and all of our primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am yet further astounded by other claims by members of the Prime Minister's country task force, such as Mr Hulls, who does not seem to believe that there is a cause for concern because, according to him, the Government's economic policies are working, `albeit slower than a lot of people would like'. When things are going backwards they cannot go much more slowly. Mr Hulls is a very good representative-unfortunately not a good representative for the people of Kennedy in Canberra, but a damn good representative for the people of Canberra in Kennedy. Unfortunately, what we need here in Canberra is people who will tell the story as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst all the gloom and doom, I have pleasure in complimenting a backbencher from the Government, Mr O'Neil, who said today:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in many cases, people in rural areas will not be earning any income at all . . . I think this is a complete indictment of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason why it is an indictment of this Government is that this Government fails to understand the predicament of primary producers across this country-not just in South Australia but all over this country. One of the reasons why it fails to understand was pointed out very adroitly also by Mr O'Neil today when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the terrible tragedies in this House-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the House of Representatives-</PARA>
<PARA>is that we do not have somebody in the Ministry who lives in a country area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Yet again we have another example of the failure of the Government to understand exactly what is being said, except that this time, instead of failing to understand what we on this side of the chamber have been saying-and, goodness knows, we have been saying it for so long that even the most sleepy-headed member of the Government should have been able to listen to it and understand it by now-it has failed to understand what its own backbenchers are saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The groundswell has come. The people of provincial Australia are sick and tired of what this Government is doing to them. It is very obvious from Mr O'Neil's statements that even the Government's own backbenchers in rural areas-those of them who have a conscience-are not only sick and tired of what the Government is doing but also desperately afraid of what the electorate will do to them at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government still pays no attention to the plight facing rural Australia. Today we heard Senator Maguire come before the chamber and say, amongst other things, that the Australian Labor Party had done great things for people in country areas. He had the audacity to say that none of the problems that were afflicting the primary producers of this nation could be blamed upon the Government because it was all the result of market forces and, if it was not the result of market forces, it is because we had a free floating dollar and nothing could be done about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In that last comment we find the ultimate deception of this Government when it comes to talking about economic matters. Quite clearly, we do not have a free floating dollar. The value of the Australian dollar is totally unrealistic. What Senator Maguire neglected to say-and if I were Senator Maguire I would not want to talk about it either-is that the level of the Australian dollar has been maintained at its current high value not because of market forces but because of manipulation of the dollar by Mr Keating, the Mr Depression of the Australian economy, who has through high interest rates manipulated the Australian dollar upwards for his own ends but not for the advantage of primary producers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that, for every one cent rise in the value of the Australian dollar against the greenback, primary producers in this country lose $150m in annual earnings. That is the indictment of the Government, and that is the indictment of the economic policies of Treasurer Keating. Yet the Government believes that somehow it can hold up its hands and say, `Sorry; we are not responsible for the crisis that faces rural Australia'. That is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government fails to answer the criticisms that we on this side of the Senate have made of the high interest rate policy to which this Government has subjected the people of this country for the last two years. It has failed to address the fact that many farmers in this country will be forced off the land not because they are bad farmers, not even because of the bad seasons alone: the straw that will break the camel's back is the high interest policy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why many farmers will be forced to lose farms that have been in their families for 50, 60, 70 and in some cases 100 years is that they cannot pay the interest bill on their overdraft with the banks. Why can they not pay the interest bill? It is because the interest bill is too high as a result of this Government's monetary policy. That is a point of the motion that nobody on the Government side of the chamber has attempted to address tonight. Honourable senators opposite have failed to attempt to address it because they cannot. Simple economic facts have proven this Government to be wholly inadequate when it comes to protecting the fortunes of people in provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as this Government has been subjecting our farmers to all the vicissitudes of a high interest rate regime, Senator Maguire was saying that the solution to the problem confronting primary producers was to improve their efficiency. But primary producers in this country are the most cost efficient primary producers in the world. The only problem is that they cannot sell goods overseas because of the high value of the Australian dollar. That is a direct consequence of the Treasurer's monetary policy. Yet Senator Maguire continued to talk about so-called improvements in efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the Senate what will happen if the Government continues with this high interest policy, and if it continues to turn its back on people in provincial Australia. The consequence is very simple: all the very best farmers will be forced off the land. If the Government wants to see an improvement in efficiency in primary production in this country, it certainly will not be forthcoming as a consequence of what the Government is doing. We are not talking about the bad farmers now; we are not talking about pushing the bad farmers out of business-they went out of business years ago-we are talking about the very best of our farmers, those who have been able to survive for the past two years on the Government's high interest rate regime, those who have managed to struggle their way through floods, through droughts and through bad seasons. Yet this Government continues to talk about improving efficiency, when all its policies will achieve only one thing: declining efficiency in Australian primary production, declining efficiency in the farming sector, and ultimately a decline in the economy of this country as a whole. Yet the Government claims that there is no rural crisis. The Government claims that it is just the farmers and the National Farmers Federation bellyaching. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics (ABARE) produced figures earlier this year showing that average farm incomes in this country would decline by 51 per cent. At the same time as ABARE showed that drop, I was surprised the other week to hear Senator Cook in Question Time egging on his friends in the Australian Council of Trade Unions to ask for an 11 per cent pay rise. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not naive enough to believe that farmers always expect the level of their incomes to stay constant; that farmers are not willing to subject themselves to some of the vagaries of the market. But there is something essentially wrong in the morality of a government that lets one portion of the economy, one portion of the population, cop a 51 per cent reduction in income while at another time giving another portion of the population an 11 per cent pay rise. This is one country where we have all to pull one load, yet the Government does not seem to be interested. The sad truth is that whether or not the Government is interested now in what is happening in provincial Australia, it certainly will be interested in what is happening in six months time, because if it is not the farmers coming down to Canberra and having a mass protest outside Parliament House-and sometimes that might be necessary to wake up Ministers-it will be the wholesale decline of the Australian economy. Ultimately, the strength of the economy depends on what we can export. One of the largest areas of exports is primary production, yet the Government is willing to let that primary production slip away; it is willing to let the export dollars of this country slip away. It is willing to let the backbone of this country slowly decline. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire, for all his rhetoric, did not come up with one answer to the substance of tonight's motion. He turned his back on it all the way right from his opening comments, which showed that obviously he has factionalism on his brain. He seemed to believe that the whole purpose of this motion was something to do with a fight between the dries and the wets in the Liberal Party. He seemed to think that maybe there was some difference between the National Party and the Liberal Party and that we were putting this up as some sort of stunt. Maybe that is the way that Senator Maguire looks at the operations of this chamber, but that is not the way we operate on this side of the chamber. We are down here for one reason and for one reason alone: to represent the people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder why they hate farmers. I have been wondering that all the time. I thought that it was just an inability to comprehend what happens outside the capital cities, but at times I start to think that maybe they do hate farmers. This Government needs to take the opportunity to open its eyes, to travel outside the capital city, to talk to the real people of this country. When I was elected to this Senate I made only one promise, and that was to listen to what the people in Queensland had to say and be their voice in Canberra. It is very clear when one travels around Queensland that the people of provincial Queensland are heartily sick and tired of what this Government is doing to them-with its increases in excise charges; the higher sales tax on four-wheel drive vehicles; the increases in indirect taxation on such things as oils and lubricants, which hit the farmers very hard indeed. They are sick and tired, too, of Government documents like the national drought policy, which seems to suggest that drought should be neglected and that we should do absolutely nothing to assist farmers suffering from drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the press release issued on 15 August by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>Many of these issues will underpin our considerations on sustainable agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>The suggestion in the national drought policy that we should do nothing about drought, nothing to assist farmers through the hard years, signals a willingness on the part of this Government to write off farmers who suffer from a drought or from a couple of bad seasons. The Government is willing to write off the production of those farms as non-sustainable agriculture. Agriculture in this country is indeed sustainable if the country has a government with the intestinal fortitude to do something about it. Yet this Government has failed the people of provincial Australia, it has failed the farmers and it has failed the long term viability of our economy. That is why we on this side of the chamber have put forward this motion. That is why we on this side are so concerned at what the Government is doing. Once again I can only take the opportunity to agree with the courageous Mr O'Neil, who said that the great tragedy was that there were no Ministers in the Parliament who came from country areas. The sad truth is that the Government does not understand or care. It is time that it started to care before it is too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not my intention to enter this debate, but I thought to myself-after listening to Senator O'Chee say almost nothing in 30 minutes-that I should at least get up for a short time and say something. If Senator O'Chee had a brain it would be lonely; that is fairly obvious. If it is a short trip across my mental process, then it is a much shorter trip across his.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He talked about interest rates mostly and the value of the dollar. For many years people in the National Party, or the Country Party, as it used to be known, and the Liberal Party talked about deregulation and about the free market: let the market decide the value of the currency; let the market decide the value of commodities; that is the way to go-capitalism in its rawest form. They were vitriolic in their opposition to socialism or any sort of regulation that would guarantee markets, or any regulation that would mean that people who were in real need would not starve to death and their children would not get an education. Their attitude in the main has been: those who have money and the ability to exploit other people in the community will get their children educated and will have health care and other things. That has been their attitude. They have no concern at all for people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party did have the courage to float the dollar-something that the Opposition parties talked about for many years but never had the guts to do. Once the dollar is floated, then of course we are in the position where the market does decide the value of the dollar. It is true that there can be some intervention by the central bank whereby the currency can be bought and sold to bolster or to reduce the value of the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee also talked about interest rates. It is fairly obvious that, if we want to encourage capital to come into Australia and we want to maintain the capital inside the country in terms of its capacity to create investment opportunities and take advantage of those, then I guess we have got to reward people who are prepared to make that investment with reasonable levels of interest rates. But it is a well-known fact that, as interest rates come down in a particular country's fiscal or monetary situation, it is normal for the value of the currency to be reduced. But we had in Australia something quite contrary to that: interest rates have been reduced as far as possible in a way that will not introduce and encourage a further heating up of the economy and thus force a position where interest rates would have to go up again fairly quickly. We found ourselves in a position where the interest rate paid to those people who had their money invested in the banking system came down some 4 per cent, but at the same time the value of the dollar went up. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the many things that Senator O'Chee did not tell us was what the Opposition would do in these circumstances. He quite blithely ignored the many things that the Labor Government has done, beyond freeing up the dollar and beyond deregulating the banks to encourage banks to come into the country to make finance available in terms of investments so that we could generate wealth in this country through various business enterprises. This Government has done that in a way that no government has done for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The importation of various items of machinery and other capital goods into this country, which had been fairly heavily protected by tariffs over many years by the National Party that Senator O'Chee represents, had created a problem for the country people; and they have been very vocal about it for many years. But they wanted the right to buy machinery and other equipment from overseas which would be cheaper than the local product because of wage levels and, of course, protection by way of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has reduced tariffs consistently over recent years, and has a policy of continuing to do so. This Government has looked at the question of deregulation and allowing the market to operate. We have deregulated the wheat industry. We have eliminated total protection for the sugar industry by way of removing the embargo on the import of sugar. These are steps that one would have thought would have been taken by a Liberal-National coalition over time but were never taken, and so were taken by the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there are some very great and grave problems in the rural industry. There are many people within the Australian Labor Party, including Cabinet Ministers, who have freely indicated that that is the position. It would be stupid to say otherwise when one looks at the reduced price for grains and when one looks at the wool crisis, whereby most of the wool being offered for auction is being bought and retained in the stockpile. Of course, the wool industry operated for many years on the basis of a price that was offered at auction with no protection at all and no attempt to regulate it. But it was the Whitlam Government in its period of office between 1972 and 1975 which introduced the floor price for wool. Senator O'Chee does not make that point. I do: it was a Labor government in that period of time that established the floor price for wool. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the question of tariffs and the introduction of imported machinery at a price which enables those in the rural industry to operate much more efficiently; that is, their inputs are cheaper and therefore they are in a better economic position to get a return at the end of the day or at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has always been a problem in the area of manufacturing. There is no doubt that any farmer or anyone in the rural industry who had any brains at all-someone who would not reflect the sorts of views held by Senator O'Chee, for instance-would want to buy local goods on the basis that they would be quality goods, that they would be delivered on time, and that they would be at a competitive price. The back-up that comes as a result of a product being locally produced and of having people who can attend to problems and the availability of spare parts is a very desirable position for local people in the rural industry, as it is for other people in other industries such as transport. That has been stated by people in those industries over time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has set in train the sorts of plans which have enabled people in the various industries to begin to make progress in that direction. The steel industry plan of $500m turned the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) around from a company which publicly stated that its return on investment in the steel industry was 2 per cent, which gradually reduced its capacity to export, and which recognised itself in that particular area as being totally inefficient. That $500m grant, which was given not to BHP but to people who purchased BHP steel, to subsidise prices, was instrumental in turning BHP around to a stage where it now exports more steel than ever before in its history as a company. </PARA>
<PARA> It also gave BHP an opportunity to have a return on capital, which I have read and heard BHP people say is in the area of 15 per cent. It also indicates a situation where it is assisting the balance of payments-a particular area of economic activity and Government decision which is helpful to the whole nation in terms of the value of the currency and in terms of our reputation on the international market. It is only beginning, but it is continuing and BHP has shown confidence in regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years the trade union movement indicated that there were too many people in our car manufacturing industry. The Liberal-National Party Government was in power and took no notice at all. We continued to have too many car industry companies, too many products, too many models. It made it very impractical to produce a quality car at a given price. This Government set in train a car manufacturing plan whereby there was a rationalisation of the way in which cars were manufactured. There have been reductions in model numbers. That is all to the good and benefit of the community. It should lead to an industry that will have a future which is solid and ongoing rather than in crisis. Those are some of the things that we have done. </PARA>
<PARA> In other areas of general productivity and manufacturing, we have set about turning back the developments that were created and were ongoing when the coalition was in office: the gradual destruction of our car manufacturing industry, and the total faith that was pinned on the agricultural industry to produce the goods in terms of creating wealth and providing a balance of payments that was beneficial to us. Anybody who has studied the value of manufactured goods in terms of import replacements or the use of those goods inside this country and against our capacity to create wealth and earn income from other countries, again affecting the balance of payments, knows that were we able to produce a shipload of computers and export them or manufacture them and use them in this country as import replacements, that would have a very stark result compared with sending six shiploads of wheat to Iraq, for instance, or two shiploads of sheep, or three or four bulk carriers of coal. The added value of those particular commodities is tremendous and it is beneficial to us. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had in place a system where manufacturing companies have operated in the very worst way, where we have had traditional methods of production and management that could never in anyone's imagination be considered to be practical or efficient. People have attempted to lay a lot of blame at the door of the trade union movement about this in terms of demarcation disputes and awards that were way in advance in conditions and wages, which meant high labour costs. The trade union movement is looking at the attitude of people to their jobs as compared with people of other countries. Japan is a classic example of different attitudes to work. People are absolutely dedicated and committed, almost enslaved mentally, to a responsibility to their employer, quite often against the interest of their family. The trade union movement has also looked at how we deal with the problem of bad work practices and bad management practices. It was the trade union movement's initiative to look at restructuring in industry. Recently it introduced the proposition of neutral results in terms of wage increases. For instance, the second tier 4 per cent gave increases to people but the cost was neutral to industry because there had to be a trade off. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a lot to do with the crisis in Australia. I do not want for a moment to take the rural industry on its own and suggest that if we solve the problem in the rural industry, that will fix everything. The Opposition has chosen to use that argument; it has chosen to highlight the question of rural industry. But the things I am talking about impinge on the ability of the rural industry at the end of the day to make a profit, to get a result, and to provide a reasonable living standard for the people in that industry. It does not mean that because we get a high price for products, we automatically retain earnings. There are other ways. We can have a low price and a low input cost and do very well. We can have a high price and a high input cost and do very badly. We have to look at the whole picture. We cannot be mental pygmies, as some Opposition senators would demonstrate. These are some of the things that the Labor Government has done in terms of the whole picture, which has a very heavy influence on the ability of people in the community to compete and to create wealth, including in rural industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been many occasions over time as a result of some of these changes when people in the manufacturing industries in the cities have had a very bad experience of losing their jobs and never being able to be re-employed because they may be of an age at which they are no longer attractive to an employer. Again, the Labor Government has moved in the area of retraining, of broad training, so that people, having had their skills in a particular area supplemented by additional training, can go into other areas of endeavour in which they can be gainfully employed. Again, this is a saving and a real asset to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people have suffered very drastically, some of them never to be employed again. We have not heard too much from the other side of the chamber, nor have we had any great crisis meetings, about those problems. I guess those people just have to manage; that is their way of life. I suggest the rural people have to manage but, as a government, we have to do what we can to help them manage, as we have helped other workers. To suggest that the Labor Government is responsible for the price of rural commodities on the world market is absolutely ridiculous. This Labor Government, in a way in which the coalition has never done in its time, has gone out and battled for the free market in terms of world sales of agricultural commodities. We have had the successful talks in the Uruguay Round. Michael Duffy has worked so hard and so effectively to get together the Cairns Group. He argued like hell for our right to compete in a marketplace that was not distorted by the European Community's bounties to help its farmers to produce agricultural commodities that were not saleable or useful in terms of a proper undistorted market. The Americans brought into play their version of the bounty to compete against the European Common Market. We, as a small country, have very efficient farmers and, as I said and will repeat, will be assisted by all the machinations which have been put in place in terms of better facilities for them: cheaper imports and better quality goods internally. They have been very efficient; but efficiency will not answer the challenge of high bounties. We have gone out in the marketplace and Michael Duffy has done a tremendous job in that regard to seek those positions. </PARA>
<PARA> Government of the Labor Party persuasion, which very clearly represents workers, including those in the rural area, could be influenced by argument from trade unionists and other people about the need to maintain protection for the manufacturing industry. After all, the great bulk of jobs are in that industry. People talk about the flight of people out of the agricultural industry. People have been leaving the rural industry over the years in great numbers, not because of any particular problem of the price of the commodities on the market. The exit from the sugar industry was caused by the development, and correctly so, of the mechanical harvester, which destroyed the jobs of tens of thousands of sugar industry workers. It was the development of more efficient and effective ways in the pastoral industry generally which saw thousands of people leave the wool industry and the cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  All those things have occurred. The Government has done whatever possible in that area, but if we had listened and said, 'All right. Okay. Let us not only stop reducing protection but we will increase it somewhat', then we would have been in a position internationally where we would not have had any credibility to argue for the right of people in the rural industry to sell their goods on the international market at a competitive price, free of the distortions that are brought into the market by the use of bounties by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> So the people in the rural industry should understand-people on the other side of the House, I guess, never will because all they want to do is to make cheap political points-that the Labor Government has seen its constituency suffer because of the reduction of tariffs and the loss of jobs. It has seen the need to do something for the people in the rural industry and to make sure that we can create the best possible position to enable them to compete and get markets for their commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the wool industry is concerned, I believe it is fairly clear that at a time when it was decided to increase the floor price it was being greedy; the floor price was increased above what it should have been at the time. It is not a crime to be greedy; it is a lack of judgment. It is a wrong feeling to succumb to and, as a result of that, it had a problem where it could not sell its wool. The Government was forced, through the Minister, to make a decision to reduce the floor price. It was not something that the Government wanted to do. It knew what the situation was-that we could not forever sustain that floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could not continue to allow the levy to be increased. It could not allow the industry to borrow to protect what the industry felt was a fair price for wool, because anybody who understands anything about the industry knows that if the wool is not sold within a certain period of time it will be not only worthless but also will owe the woolgrowers money. The storage cannot go on forever and something has to be done. When we go amongst people in the industry, we find that they talk about the free market. They do not want protection. Of course, the free market is there when prices are good, and we want to keep all the profits. When prices are not good and we feel we need some assistance or protection from the Government, then suddenly the free market is a good idea but maybe we should distort it a bit. Well, we either have it or we do not. I personally have some problems with the free market, but as a Government our position is that we support it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a problem with wheat. We can hardly blame the Government for the problems in the Gulf, which are going to have some effect in terms of our market with Iraq. The Government cannot be blamed for the fact that there are people using bounties to destroy the proper value of commodities and making our position untenable. I believe that I have canvassed a number of issues, some of which may seem to those on the other side of the House not to be related to the rural issues. But in the Senate we cannot in isolation talk about the problems of one group of people in this community and truly represent people in the State that we come from. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that it is all interconnected. If we had a very prosperous rural industry and the manufacturing industry was destroyed, we would still be in awful trouble. We need to look at all the issues across the whole spectrum and at our endeavour and ability to create wealth. This is not only in the rural industry but also in the manufacturing areas, in the newly developed area of tourism- the area of services-in terms of our capacity to win contracts throughout the world such as in the area of telecommunications, and in areas where our skills are recognised and being taken advantage of. The Government realises that there is a problem in the rural industry. We will deal with it in a way which is fair and equitable and in any way that is open to us so that this country gets a benefit from it right across the spectrum of the Australian community. </PARA>

Whether it is the monetary policy or not is a matter of argument. We note the opinion and we agree with the motion that the opinion should be noted. But the whole of Australia has noticed that all Australian farming is in trouble. The question really is: What has this Government done? We saw here today that it legislated against drought.

An ethanol industry would bring stability to our sugar industry and increase opportunities for rural employment in Queensland and New South Wales. But what does this Government do? Yesterday while I was in Beenleigh seeing what these farmers were prepared to do and how they were prepared to help themselves, Senator Cook was in here ridiculing their efforts and whingeing about revenue loss to government. He gave no consideration to the benefits to this country that such an industry would bring, such as reduced imports, replacement of lead in super petrol, less polluting emissions and the invaluable strategic advantage of being able to be more self-reliant in motor fuel supplies. That advantage is invaluable. Whether it is economical to produce the stuff or not is irrelevant to the strategic advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Speaking of Queensland, recently Senator O'Chee gave the Senate an example of another enterprising Queenslander who made an effort to expand her market base. After successfully negotiating with overseas markets and developing a product, which I understand was packaged peanuts, what did the Government do? It slapped a bunch of inspection fees and charges, an export licence and other mumbo jumbo on that exporter. That effectively wiped out the meagre profit and destroyed the export opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I was in Dunalley near Hobart and I saw the initiative and enterprise involved in developing agro-forestry. Agro-forestry provides diversity and increases productivity in farms. This Government has removed funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's research into agro-forestry. All this demonstrates its shallow level of understanding of what rural Australia is all about. It demonstrates that this Government does not understand and does not care and that its actions are not beneficial to our primary producers. </PARA>

<PARA>INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Income Tax Act 1986 to formally impose the rates of income tax payable by individuals, and trustees generally, for 1990-91 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1991-92 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>It will also impose for the same period the rates of tax payable by companies, registered organisations and unit trusts treated as companies. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, it will impose rates of tax on superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. </PARA>
<PARA>The rates of tax to be imposed are those declared in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 as amended by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990 which I have just introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the Bill are explained in the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to impose the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1990-91 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1991-92 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic rate of the levy will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA>That has been the rate since 1 December 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also increase the low income thresholds below which people are not required to pay any levy. </PARA>
<PARA>For 1990-91, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,745, and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $19,045 will not be required to pay the levy. </PARA>
<PARA>The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will increase by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. For example, a married couple with two dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $23,245. </PARA>
<PARA>The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is $35 million in 1990-91 and $80 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>The new low income thresholds will be reflected in provisional tax raised for 1990-91 and tax instalment schedules from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Explanatory Memorandum on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990 about which I have just spoken contains an explanation of the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (RATES AND PROVISIONAL TAX) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will give effect to the reduction in the personal tax rates announced in the February 1990 Economic Statement, and to some other measures announced by the Treasurer in his Budget speech. </PARA>
<PARA>It will declare the general rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for 1990-91 and for 1991-92 and subsequent financial years.</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the reductions in the personal rates of tax, the Bill will also reduce the level of the rebate of tax available for payments of net medical expenses exceeding $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also amend the income tax law to provide a method of calculating provisional tax for 1990-91 and subsequent income years and to give effect to the Budget announcement requiring the payment of provisional tax on certain salary or wages. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now outline in more detail these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal tax rates</PARA>
<PARA>The reductions in the tax rates announced in the February 1990 Economic Statement have effect from 1 January 1991. At the lower end of the rate scale the level of the threshold at or below which tax is not payable is to be increased from $5,100 to $5,400. </PARA>
<PARA>The top of the first rate step is to be increased from $17,650 to $20,700 and the 29 per cent rate will be removed, so that the lowest marginal rate of 21 per cent applies in the income range $5,401 to $20,700. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will reduce the 39 per cent rate to 38 per cent, to apply in the income range $20,700 to $36,000. </PARA>
<PARA>A new rate of 46 per cent is to apply in the income range $36,000 to $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the existing top marginal rate of 47 per cent is to apply only to incomes over $50,000. As these changes apply from 1 January 1991 a composite rate scale will apply for the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>That scale will comprise a weighted average of one half of the present rate scale applying from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990 and one half of the new rate scale that is to apply from 1 January 1991 to 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>These tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay-as-you-earn deductions from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes will also be made to the rate scale for non-residents with the existing rate of 29 per cent to apply on incomes up to $20,700, and above that amount the reduced rates as for residents will apply. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts for residents is estimated at $1,230 million in 1990-91 and $2,585 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes with respect to non-residents is estimated to cost less that $0.5 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Rebate for medical expenses</PARA>
<PARA>As announced in the Budget, the level of the rebate of tax for net medical expenses exceeding $1,000 will be reduced from 29 per cent to 21 per cent for 1991-92 and subsequent income years consequent upon the removal of the 29 per cent marginal tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The level of the rebate for 1990-91 will be 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue savings from this measure are estimated at $7 million in 1991-92 and $15 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional tax for 1990-91 and subsequent years</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for 1990-91 provisional tax to be calculated on the basis of the 1989-90 taxable income increased by 10 per cent, and applying the 1990-91 rates of tax, Medicare levy and the increased low income thresholds for Medicare levy that are to apply in that year. </PARA>
<PARA>Subject to the exceptions I will announce, rebates and credits will be allowed in the provisional tax calculation at the levels allowed in the 1989-90 assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>Any rebate of tax allowed on franked dividends and any credits for foreign taxes will be uplifted by 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Concessional rebates claimed in 1989-90 for a dependent spouse, daughter-housekeeper, invalid relative, parent or parent-in-law or for a housekeeper and the sole parent rebate will be adjusted to reflect the new higher levels for 1990-91 as a consequence of indexation. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes will also be made to some claims for zone rebates and rebates for Defence Force members serving overseas or civilians serving with the United Nations. Provisional tax will be calculated after increasing any such rebate by 20 per cent of the adjustment made to the taxpayer's 1989-90 concessional rebate claim. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxpayers who estimate their taxable income for 1989-90 will increase by less than 10 per cent, or who consider that their rebates or credits will be at a higher level in 1990-91, will continue to have the right to ``self-assess'' and have the provisional tax for 1990-91 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>By this Bill the method of calculation of provisional tax using a factor to uplift income will be incorporated in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This course will obviate the need for the Parliament to consider each year the largely repetitious rules under which provisional tax is calculated. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Bill also provides that the uplift factor for subsequent years may be prescribed by regulation, up to a percentage not exceeding 12 per cent. Where a regulation is not in force the uplift factor will be 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Bill also gives effect to a Budget announcement to authorise the raising of provisional tax in respect of 1990-91 and subsequent years of income, where the assessable income of the taxpayer in the year preceding the year for which provisional tax is payable consists wholly of salary or wages. This will overcome the advantage that arises from the deferral of tax where sufficient tax instalments to cover liability are not deducted from salary or wages. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment by the Bill will apply only where two conditions are met in relation to the preceding year. The taxpayer has a balance of tax to pay on assessment of $3,000 or more, and the shortfall in tax instalment deductions from the salary or wages in the year is $3,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA>Where the two conditions are met, the existing method of calculating provisional tax payable, used by the Commissioner of Taxation to allow a reduction for the salary or wages content of assessable income, will be changed. The change will apply where the assessable income of a taxpayer consists wholly, or in part, of salary or wages. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduction for the salary or wages content of assessable income currently proceeds on the assumption that sufficient tax instalment deductions are made to cover the tax liability on that income. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the change the calculation will, in effect, take account of the actual shortfall in the tax instalment deductions of the taxpayer in the preceding year. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, taxpayers have the right to ``self-assess'' their provisional tax liability where they consider sufficient tax instalment deductions will be deducted from salary or wages in a year. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Arts, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 amends 8 Acts of my portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>It amends the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Act 1989 to rectify a minor error in the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973. The bill also makes a correction of the Canberra Water Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 via the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 will allow for the addition of one extra member to the Board of Directors of the Australian Tourist Commission, which will make it possible for a more broadly-based representation of persons with relevant skills, experience and background to be on the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the National Gallery Act 1975 will permit the introduction of flexible, workable and responsible disposal mechanisms for works of art from the National Collection, by removing the requirement from the Act that two independent experts be consulted as part of the disposal process. The requirement that all disposals require Ministerial approval will remain in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 4 of the bill will repeal section 67 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. Section 67 is concerned with the prosecution of offences committed against the Act or against the Regulations in force under the Act. It deals with the distinction between summary and indictable offences and provides protection against being punished more than once for the same offence. </PARA>
<PARA>Repeal of section 67 is appropriate because the Crimes Act 1914 already deals with these matters. They are covered by sections 4c, 4g and 4h of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Because the Crimes Act clearly defines the difference between summary offences and indictable offences, an unfortunate consequence of the present situation under section 67 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act will be eliminated. As it is currently worded, section 67 can operate in such a way that even a minor offence is prevented from being heard summarily and offenders can evade prosecution by failing to attend court. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new situation, where the Crimes Act applies instead of section 67 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act, any offence committed against the Regulations that are in force under the National Parks and Wildlife Act will automatically be defined as a summary offence. This is because the prescribed penalties under the Regulations are of a monetary nature only and do not involve imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>The normal situation in law is that a summary hearing can proceed even if the defendant fails to appear in court. This means, for example, that a person who commits an offence against the Regulations in Kakadu National Park and then returns home to another State cannot evade conviction simply by failing to appear when the case against him or her is heard in court in Darwin. The court will have the power to continue with the summary hearing despite the absence of the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 (the PMCH Act) are designed to overcome administrative difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the heritage export control scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment of section 10 of the Act will enable the principal public collecting institutions to apply for a general permit to loan material for the purpose of research, exhibition or similar purpose, without having to seek a permit on each occasion they wish to export objects. The amendment is appropriate because the collections are already controlled and protected by Acts of either the Commonwealth, State or Territory Parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA>A further amendment provides that an application for a permit to export a cultural heritage object must specify an address in Australia. There is also a provision to simplify the service of notices under sections 10 and 12 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment to section 14 of the Act will exempt completely from the operation of the Act all cultural heritage objects temporarily imported into Australia under a loan agreement with a foreign government or foreign collecting institution. This amendment will assist the import of international touring exhibitions visiting Australia that have been arranged by principal collecting institutions and specific exhibition coordinators. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment of section 17 of the PMCH Act is to provide for the nominee of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who is appointed to the National Cultural Heritage Committee to be an Aboriginal. Aboriginality is defined for the purpose of this section. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Public Lending Right Act 1985 will permit the Public Lending Right Committee to conduct its meetings by telephone conference, closed circuit television or other method of communication determined by the Committee, and will permit the Committee to exercise its powers without being affected by a vacancy in its membership. </PARA>
<PARA>The bill makes one last amendment to legislation covering self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. The Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910, which confers on the Governor-General the power to make Ordinances for the Territory on matters of retained Commonwealth responsibility, is amended to correct an error which appears to have caused the Ordinance-making power on some matters still retained, to expire on 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Back in November 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure completed an inquiry into the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In its tabled report, the so-called Saunderson Committee identified what it saw as desirable objectives of the broadcasting legislation. These objectives were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a) to maintain the viability of the broadcasting system;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) to maximise diversity of choice;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) to discourage concentration of media ownership and control;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) to restrict foreign ownership and prohibit foreign control of commercial broadcasting;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) to encourage Australian content;</PARA>
<PARA>(f) to provide services that are relevant and responsive to local needs;</PARA>
<PARA>(g) to improve quality; and</PARA>
<PARA>(h) to protect the public and particularly children from offensive material by the setting of appropriate standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats see the application of each and every one of these objectives as vital to a healthy broadcasting industry in this country. Unfortunately, however, the reality of Australian broadcasting has not always lived up to these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The current viability of Australia's television industry is looking very shaky indeed. We now have two television stations in receivership and the third recently being bought back by its previous owner for less than 50 per cent of the price he originally sold it for. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, acting in the public interest, needs to regulate the broadcasting industry in such a way that the industry as a whole remains profitable and that, in the public interest, those profits are returned to programming to increase diversity and Australian content amongst other things. </PARA>
<PARA> The concentration of media ownership in Australia, we believe, is at an alarmingly high level and this is a matter of great concern to the Australian Democrats. It is a worrying situation which has come about largely because of changes in media ownership laws since 1987 and it seems it is now impossible to go back and sort out this particular mess. </PARA>
<PARA> The diversity of Australian media is, to a large extent, determined by diversity in ownership and control. Overall, a lack of regulation and/or regulatory power on Australia's media has allowed this diversity to diminish significantly. Ownership of our print media, for example, is the most concentrated amongst developed nations and an American citizen now controls a large percentage of our print media- over 60 per cent. It was only through Australian Democrat action that ownership of radio stations was restricted to 16 stations Australia-wide. Perhaps of greatest concern, however, given its very influential power, is the fact that ownership of our television industry resides primarily with just three people, or their receivers. </PARA>
<PARA> For television broadcasting, we have audience reaches far in excess of those found in overseas countries. In the United States of America there is an audience reach limit of just 25 per cent and relationships between the major networks and their affiliates are very strictly controlled. By comparison, in Australia we now have a theoretical maximum audience reach of 60 per cent. Indeed, in the past the Opposition was supporting a 100 per cent audience reach limit. </PARA>
<PARA> The current 60 per cent limit means a single owner can hold commercial television licences in four of our five mainland metropolitan centres. Further, through networking agreements actual audience reach can be much greater. The Australian Democrats believe that the maximum audience reach limit should be set at 43 per cent. We believe this lower limit is essential for a number of reasons. Firstly, we believe it is necessary to restrict the social and political power that inevitably resides with licence owners. Secondly, a lower limit is vital in encouraging new entrants to the industry. Finally, it will serve to redress the power imbalance between the regional stations and the networks. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the foreign ownership of Australian media, we see that existing regulation is inconsistent and, since the infamous Murdoch amendments, we would say totally inadequate. We agree with the statement by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, in the other place that the situation whereby foreign owners, through elaborate corporate structures involving holding companies, are able to control up to 49 per cent of Australian television stations is totally unacceptable. The Australian Democrats look forward to legislation closing this loophole and, indeed, Senator Powell will be introducing a private member's Bill later in the year dealing precisely with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these difficulties in the current status of broadcasting in this country we believe it is clear that we do need a powerful and flexible regulatory body. This is especially true given that broadcasters are basically in the industry for the purpose of making money and not for the purpose of protecting the public good. Consequently, the Australian Democrats are working to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has sufficient resources and legislative support in order to perform its job of regulating this very strategic and influential industry and of attempting to implement the Saunderson Committee's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 14 years, the power of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has, I believe for purely short term political reasons, been weakened by successive governments, to the point where the previous chairperson of the Tribunal, Deidre O'Connor, made that now well-worn observation that the Tribunal is a `toothless tiger', an opinion recently endorsed by the acting chairperson of the Broadcasting Tribunal, Mr Peter Westerway. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have pledged, in our alternative budget, to increase funding to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by $1m in the first year. Of this, $364,000 will be used to conduct an inquiry into the effects of aggregation and the remaining funds will go to establishing a networked computer system at the Tribunal. At the moment, the Tribunal has around 100 Pcs but these machines are unable to access each other. So masses of information is being collected which is becoming increasingly less accessible. As one of the major functions of the Tribunal is to act as an information collection and dissemination service, the maintenance of an efficient database service is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills we have before us this evening will give the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal additional options in the exercising of its powers and will decrease the number of transactions requiring Australian Broadcasting Tribunal approval. These Bills are a stopgap measure only and need to be seen as such, as they do not address the major problems in this industry. The Australian Democrats welcome some aspects of these Bills but have strong reservations about others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has stated that a major reform package for the Broadcasting Act 1942 is expected later this year. We welcome that. However, the review of this legislation began three years ago and was meant to take just six months. What the industry, and indeed the viewing public, needs from the Government is a greater commitment to more rapid, yet comprehensive, reform of the broadcasting legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> With the many advances being made in information technology, our laws are becoming fast outdated and some services currently in operation in this country are broadcasting basically in an unregulated fashion. I speak, of course, of the so-called `narrowcast' services licensed under the Radiocommunications Act using video and audio entertainment and information services (VAEIS) provisions. Such services are currently in existence aiming at, for example, ethnic communities, doctors, tourists and hotel patrons-for example, the use of Sky Channel. </PARA>
<PARA> Our broadcasting legislation needs to be overhauled in such a way that it allows for the many technological developments that will undoubtedly occur in the industry but that does not encourage the type of legislative avoidance behaviour that has occurred in the past. The Democrats recognise that this is by no means a simple task but it is one that is essential and one that must be completed soon. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now specifically to the Bills before us, looking firstly at the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990. This Bill inserts in the legislation certain suitability requirements for the holders of radio and television licences. Further, the Bill provides the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with a number of options where it finds a television or radio licensee not to be a fit and proper person to hold a commercial licence or where it finds that person to be unable to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I will speak about the wonderful opportunity I was recently able to take up to visit the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) at the invitation of the Soviet Women's Committee with a group of women parliamentarians. Senator Crowley has already spoken about this. I will speak about slightly different aspects of our visit. No doubt, other people will talk about other aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a fantastic opportunity. We are very grateful to the Soviet Women's Committee for making that opportunity available to us. There is so much to say about it. In general terms, the impression that we picked up from the people about the market economy which is being thrust on the Soviet people was that they are very worried indeed, especially women, who feel that they will suffer first because they know that unemployment will be involved in the restructuring of perestroika. They feel very concerned about that, particularly at the moment as there is not an abundance of food in the shops in the Soviet Union. There is no shortage of food generally, but getting it to the right places for people to buy easily is not common. In fact, there are queues all over the place for basic food items. </PARA>
<PARA> People are very worried. Even though they are very interested in the political process that is unfolding, over and over again we heard that they are less concerned about the particular kind of political process that will flow from Mr Gorbachev's perestroika, or whether it be another model; they are more concerned about having food on the table for their children. Of course, that is what it comes down to when the pressure is great. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first things I noticed in my 12 days in the Soviet Union was an amazing resurgence of religious freedom and religious enthusiasm. In fact, the first night I was in Moscow I was wandering along getting a bit of fresh air and I came across an Orthodox church. It was very cold in the street, so I wandered into the church service. I was very interested to see that there were many younger people as well as older people very enthusiastically participating in this service. </PARA>
<PARA> We were taken to visit the Svyato-Danilov monastery-the home of the Russian Orthodox Church-by the Soviet Women's Committee. There is a huge restoration program going on here, as there is in many churches and cathedrals throughout the Soviet Union, which are decreasingly being seen as museums and increasingly being used as places of worship. That was one very pleasing first impression. </PARA>
<PARA> It was borne out by visits that we had to the wonderful cathedrals, some of which were in the Kremlin complex. I think that many people are unaware that there are cathedrals in the Kremlin. People think of the Kremlin as the seat of Soviet power. It is also full of Soviet history dating back to the twelfth century and it includes many wonderful cathedrals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of restoration work going on in Leningrad as well, again cathedrals taking pride of place. The Soviet Union could be a feast of cultural activities. I was very lucky to have an afternoon wandering around the Pushkin Gallery, which has a great collection. The whole delegation very much enjoyed a visit to the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also treated to an evening at the ballet, where we saw the Kirov and Minsk ballets and also a company from Prague. Another evening we were delighted with a folk dancing concert. </PARA>
<PARA> We also went to the first annual conference of religious music to be held in the Soviet Union. Again, that indicated the great interest in all things religious. Interestingly, an orthodox priest who had taken the initiative to get under way this first annual conference of religious music had barbarously been murdered a couple of weeks before the concert took place. So the concert was preceded by a religious service. It was not until the concert was over and we had stood through this very moving spectacle that we understood what it was actually all about. </PARA>
<PARA> We had some very interesting visits to all kinds of groups organised for us by the Committee. Senator Jocelyn Newman and I asked for a briefing by the military. I was very pleased, in Senator Newman's company, to speak with Major-General Anatolie Bolyatko, who is a Deputy Chief of the Soviet forces. This was a very interesting couple of hours. We had a really interesting time with him. He told us a lot about the Soviet military doctrine and how the old order is being replaced by a new order in the military also. </PARA>
<PARA> He talked about the system of universal prevention of war, the preparation for military actions and war for defence. He said that this was in contrast to the recent past, in which the main aim was conducting and winning warfare. The emphasis is now very much on prevention, especially since 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many practical steps to implement this new thinking in the military, such as the Soviet's very strong commitment never to start warfare and to fight only if attacked; never to use nuclear weapons first; not to engage in any territorial claims; and not to consider any country as an enemy.</PARA>
<PARA> The General was fascinating on many issues, particularly the changes that are taking place; the reduction in military expenditure; the reduction in military forces; and the decrease in military weapons production, particularly in nuclear weapons production. He gave us some figures for that. The production of nuclear weapons has been reduced by almost half in the last year from 2.3 billion roubles to 1.3 billion roubles, and it is still going down. This was all very encouraging. The 500,000 reduction in personnel has been under way since 1988. That will be completed by the end of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that there are many problems for the resettlement of Soviet military. For example, there are 25,000 officers' families-not individual conscripts, but families-to resettle. They will be added to the 75,000 servicemen who are already lacking housing in the Soviet Union. There is the big group coming back from the Warsaw Pact countries for which housing has to be found. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal of debate on the abolition of conscription in the Soviet Union at the moment. It was also interesting to note that there is now a committee on defence and State security, which until recently was hardly critical at all of defence forces in the Supreme Soviet or in the press. But now there is increasing criticism. The aim of the committee on defence and State security is to reduce the quantity of the Soviet armed forces but to improve the quality. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing the general did not tell us about is that there is a party in the Supreme Soviet of military democrats. That was a very interesting item of information that we picked up later. They are not strong in number but they are there in the Russian Federation and in the Supreme Soviet. They are seeking military reform. They are seeking to make the army professional, that is, to do away with conscription, to reduce the numbers, to separate the military from political policy, which of course would be a huge change for the military in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked to a number of people about the Gulf crisis. It was very interesting. We were quite thirsty for news about what was happening in the Gulf while we were in the Soviet Union. The General's view was that, although the United States of America is ready to go militarily, the fact that the Soviet Union had urged constraint on that and certainly was not ready to engage in military force usage may have helped push towards a diplomatic settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a big body of public opinion-and the general was talking about this; the Soviet Union now has public opinion surveys, which is very encouraging-strongly in favour of the return of the military technicians, 150 of whom are still in Iraq and who I believe are coming back right now. A public opinion survey in Moscow News, one of the many newspapers now quite critical of the CPSU, discovered that 64 per cent of people surveyed, out of 1,330 respondents from 24 centres in 11 regions of the USSR, were opposed to the deployment of Soviet warships in the Persian Gulf to help carry out the naval blockade. </PARA>
<PARA> This kind of information is really very interesting and very different from the kind of talk that there was when I was in the Soviet Union in 1976. The time with the general was very interesting indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited various enterprises, one being a shoe factory-a joint venture with West Germany. To engage in joint ventures is now a quite common practice in the Soviet Union. This was quite an up-market shoe factory intending to extend into a network of stores throughout the Soviet Union, but still there were queues. </PARA>
<PARA> People get invitations to go to a shoe shop on a certain day but, even with an invitation, they still have to queue up for some time outside. The workers in this joint enterprise were paid 400 roubles a month, which is quite a big incentive in itself to offer service to their customers. It is about twice the salary that teachers in the Soviet Union get-about five roubles to the dollar, which gives honourable senators an idea of the wages system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another enterprise that we visited was an oil cloth factory which had been going and nationalised since 1917; so it certainly was not one of the new ones. It was very interesting. I did not get the second name of the gentleman in charge, but his first name was Boris. He had a lot of very interesting things to say. One of his better quotes was that bitter truth is better than a sweet lie. We heard that repeated several times while we were in the Soviet Union. He also made a very interesting comment about life in the Soviet Union. He likened it to living in a glasshouse where the roof has been smashed in: previously the plants in the glasshouse lived in a protective environment, but suddenly the cold air is coming in and they are very worried about their survival. </PARA>
<PARA> At one stage when we asked how the market economy would affect his enterprise, he said: `Our system is very hard for foreigners to understand; in fact, we cannot grasp it ourselves', at which we all fell about laughing, including Boris. </PARA>
<PARA> The centralised market economy was on the agenda wherever we went and there were varying responses to it. This particular enterprise offers a great deal of social services to its workers. The people who work here are very lucky indeed because they have services provided at work, which means that they do not have to queue up, like most people do, for all goods that they want to buy. They have services such as dry cleaners, shoe repair, massage, opticians, household repairs, a shop where they can buy food, tickets to the theatre, travel service, tailor facilities, a day care centre provided and a gymnasium-all kinds of facilities were offered. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting, too, to learn from Boris that two of the workshops in this very large plastics factory mainly producing plastic tablecloths-that is what we saw anyway-had been closed on environmental grounds. That was a self-regulating process because there are environmental laws on the way but not in effect as yet. He knew that in a couple of years time the law would demand that these particular parts of his enterprise close down, so he did it ahead of time; and, of course, that was, to some degree, to protect the workers from very toxic chemicals. In fact, when we went into the factory itself where these tablecloths were being produced, we nearly got blown back outside by the fumes. It is very difficult for them to enforce worker health and safety even if safe work practices are available because there is not the attitude that people need to be careful, even with their own health. We heard this over and over again, particularly as far as women were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is very interesting to see the surveys in newspapers and hear people like the General quoting public opinion. The social barometer is in the Moscow Times each week. I want to read one particular part of it which was about consumer shortages. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Lately, consumer items have been disappearing from the shelves. WHAT WAS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF CIGARETTES, BREAD, ETC.?</PARA>
<PARA>the socialist plan economy-18</PARA>
<PARA>the so-called perestroika-12</PARA>
<PARA>sabotage by perestroika's opponents-33</PARA>
<PARA>the mafia in the trade sector-36</PARA>
<PARA>undecided-6</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very interesting list of options that people were given about why goods were not available in the shops. So there is quite a lot of opposition to the whole question of perestroika. In fact, Mr Gorbachev, who is so popular internationally, is not at all popular domestically. It is because people feel that the changes are being forced on them without them really understanding the full implications; and there are some people who obviously want perestroika to fail. It is interesting that the two highest percentages-36 and 33-were people considered to be committing sabotage; that is, the opponents of perestroika and the Mafia in the trade sector. I am afraid that it is very obvious that there is a lot of wheeling and dealing going on, but it is largely due to the general shortages of consumer products. I guess it is a bit of a chicken and egg situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other interesting people who were lined up by the Soviet Women's Committee included Yuri Drosov from the Soviet Peace Committee. I asked him about the situation of the Government's line on Iraq and how the Soviet Peace Committee felt about that. He was quite happy that the Government was not prepared to engage, at that stage anyway, in the military boycott. Interestingly, the Soviet Peace Committee had been in touch with the Peace and Solidarity Council in Iraq. It had made very plain to this Iraqi committee that it took a strong line calling for the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. It got a less than warm response from the Peace and Solidarity Council in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Peace Committee had also sent proposals for the resolution of the conflict to its own department of foreign affairs. We also talked about the Afghan veterans, many of whom are involved in the Soviet Peace Committee. It was Yuri Drosov's view that about 99 per cent of Soviet people believe that the whole Afghanistan exercise was a grave mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very interesting person we met was Valery Borschov, who is a Moscow City councillor and a member of the Helsinki Group. He worked with Sakharov on the committee which defended the rights of believers. This is before the thaw in relationships with people who maintained their belief in some religious system. They have obviously reached a breakthrough in attitudes towards believers, but all is far from right as far as human rights issues are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> He told us that in prison camp 35 there are many political prisoners still housed under article 64 of the criminal code relating to treachery; for example, illegal border crossings. The Helsinki Group has the names of all such prisoners. To the best of their knowledge, there are 120 people on that list. That is a very far cry from the thousands and thousands that there were until recently. So certainly the situation is improving. </PARA>
<PARA> The Helsinki Group also takes a position about conscientious objectors to conscription on religious grounds. The Moscow City Council, which is now dominated by democrats, has worked out a statement supporting alternative service for those who are opposed to conscription on religious grounds. There is still the death sentence on statute books in the Soviet Union, but it is seldom used. The Helsinki Group opposes this and is working to change it. Amnesty International also operates in the Soviet Union canvassing against the death penalty and is about to open an office for human rights organisations. So all of that was quite encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as psychiatric prisoners are concerned, there is still a problem. In the 1970s many believers found themselves in psychiatric hospitals, and when Valery Borschov cancelled his membership of the CPSU it was suggested that he go for psychiatric testing. He refused to do so. When we asked him how he got away with not showing up, he told us that it was because he was a well-known journalist and it probably would have been very publicly embarrassing for the authorities had he ended up in a psychiatric hospital. The Commission on Human Rights in the Moscow City Council is pressing for a check of all psychiatric institutions. It is not sure what it will find, but it is certainly trying to get to the bottom of that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Valery told us that there is still some reluctance, despite the much greater openness that is evident in the Soviet Union now, to be critical of the leadership. But at public rallies, where there is safety in numbers-and there have been numerous public rallies now-people have spoken out quite boldly. He also told us that racial and religious tolerance was generally fairly good in Moscow, but not so good in the provinces. The recent Moscow City Council election was very successful for the democratic bloc: 300 of the 476 deputies are from the democratic movement and only 70 to 80 deputies are from the CPSU.</PARA>
<PARA> He told us that it is very hard for them to learn democracy, and we heard this over and over again. They are not used to pluralism, and they are not used to many different groups having to make compromises and listen to each other. In fact, there are three kinds of democrats in the Moscow City Council-liberal democrats, social democrats and Christian democrats. So I think they are in for some fun. </PARA>
<PARA> We also met three deputies from the Supreme Soviet in the Kremlin, including two women who were on the Commission for Women's Issues. There are 26 major commissions in the Supreme Soviet and one of them is on women's issues. As with many other groups, we raised with them the issue of birth control because there is an appalling level of abortions-about eight to 12 abortions on average for Soviet women. It is the most commonly used form of birth control, which we found quite horrendous. There is little access to birth control. To the horror of Kim Yen Um, the male deputy who was present at this meeting, and to the surprise of the two women deputies, we asked about vasectomies. `Nyet' was the sharp response to that. We felt it was important to point out that men should take some responsibility for birth control but, obviously, it will be a long time before the attitudes change. </PARA>
<PARA> We also met members of the political club of the Soviet Women's Committee. That was a very interesting session during which we exchanged information. The six Australian MPs spoke about our political involvement, how we got involved and how it all operates in Australia, as a way of encouraging Soviet women to get involved in electoral politics. Until recently there has been a quota system so that women have had very big representation at all three levels of government in the Soviet Union, but recently, with the increased democratisation, the quota system has been dispensed with and women's representation has gone right down to about 6 to 8 per cent. We saw that in the Leningrad and Moscow city councils and in the Supreme Soviet as well. We were asking why that is so and encouraging women to take up the challenge to get involved in electoral politics and earn their places, because the places will not just be given to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very interesting person we met was Zoya Krylova, the editor of Rabotnitsa; she is also a deputy in the Supreme Soviet. She is the editor of this 86-year-old monthly magazine-so it pre-dates the revolution-with a circulation of 24 million and a much greater readership. It gets 150,000 letters a year, about a third of them from men. Although it is meant to be a women's magazine, it is very widely read by men as well. It has 17 people employed answering all the letters, so it has a very good gauge on public opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most interesting things that Zoya Krylova told us was that that magazine was the first to write about abortions in the general media. It published a letter from a Leningrad woman about the evils of abortion-just one letter in this magazine-and got 2,000 letters back. She invited gynaecologists to read these women's stories. They gave the letters to Raisa and Mikhail Gorbachev and then to the Minister for Health. Every letter was verified. All republic health Ministers met and discussed this issue and 40 million roubles were given to the Health Department to deal with this question three years ago. That started the process of change. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard very disturbing things about birth defects increasing, due, I think, to poor working conditions. According to Zoya Krylova, 30 million jobs have very bad working conditions below acceptable levels, and there are 700,000 jobs where people work with faulty equipment. According to her estimation-and this came from the Ecological Social Association-100 cities in the Soviet Union are called zones of ecological disaster, and Zoya thinks that there might be more than that. The magazine has a phone hot line for readers to phone in their environmental stories. These are obviously very important issues for people in the Soviet Union. That was a very fascinating visit indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important person we met was Alexander Gelman, who is a writer who resigned recently from the CPSU after he had been asked to be a member of the inner presidium by Mikhail Gorbachev. He is a personal friend of Gorbachev but, for various reasons, he was fed up with the Party and resigned. He is in there at the moment representing writers. He was very interesting, particularly when talking about the democrats. He is not actually aligned with any group.  There are a lot of people floating independently in the Supreme Soviet not quite sure which way to go and, of course, this is all part of the unfolding democracy which they are finding so challenging. He says that the new democrats are making many mistakes, and the differences between them can be exploited by the old guard. Many of the people who are speaking out know what they are up against, but they are often unclear about a positive program. This is very understandable, I think, given the fact that they have had a very strong bureaucratic influence for 70 years and, in fact, the military and the bureaucracy are going to be the most disaffected by the rapid changes. It is those two groups plus, perhaps, the fascists who are also emerging, or the republicans in the various areas of the Soviet Union, who could create a huge upset. </PARA>
<PARA> We also met with Anaida Bestavashriti, who is a refugee worker. She made an appeal through us to the Australian Government for people who are victims of the Armenian earthquake to be resettled in Australia. That was a very moving plea and I am not quite sure how it will be received. We also met with Titania Kaletskaya, who is head of the initiative group association Mutual Trust, who wants to set up an international institute in the Soviet Union which would deal with disasters on a global scale-not just after the event, but in anticipation of disasters which may occur. That was a very interesting idea. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall be able to send a lot of information to people that we met in the Soviet Union about some of the models that are already going in Australia-for example, the Commission for the Future material and information about some of our aid agencies which already do a lot of the things that people in the Soviet Union are looking for. That was very interesting too. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay tribute to the Soviet Women's Committee for its excellent organisation and, particularly, to Galina Negrustuyeva and Vera Soboleva, from the Soviet Women's Committee, who organised our program, and to Ellen Mitriaeva and Tania Anisimova, who were our interpreters and who did a great job for us. Also, the Australian Embassy helped us out on a couple of occasions and gave us a briefing-James Wise, Kyle Wilson, and Victoria, who also did some interpreting for us. We were very well cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly had very positive impressions overall, but I feel great concern about what the future holds for the Soviet Union, because its people are being thrust headlong into a system for which they are not really psychologically prepared. It will be a very challenging time indeed. Anything that the Australian Government can do to help will be welcomed, including a very sensible offer which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a couple of years ago-which has not been taken up yet-which was for young Soviets to come to Australia for three or six months for training programs in marketing, management and democratic processes. This is the very sensible kind of practical help which the Australian Government could give the Soviet Union. It is in our interests, of course-it is in the interests of the global community-to ensure that this transition that Mr Gorbachev has set under way occurs as calmly as possible without a massive revolution taking place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier tonight the Senate conducted a very important debate on the rural crisis. Such was the interest in the debate that many of us on this side who wished to make a contribution-particularly Senator Panizza, Senator Crane and myself-were unable to get the call in the time allowed. There were a number of matters that I wished to mention in that debate, but there will no doubt be opportunities later on for those matters. There was one matter, however, that I particularly wanted to mention and I will take only a few minutes of the Senate's time. It relates to an answer that Senator Cook gave yesterday in the Senate regarding ethanol. I want to briefly mention that as soon as possible in the hope that it may assist Senator Cook in his knowledge of just how important ethanol could be to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know who is advising Senator Cook as to his knowledge on ethanol, but it seems to me that the advice is sadly lacking. There are, in fact, contrary to what Senator Cook mentioned in his answer-and it seemed to be a prepared answer that ethanol was environmentally bad-certain environmental benefits in the use of ethanol, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 10 per cent if a 10 per cent ethanol-90 per cent petrol blend is used. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook also made yesterday what I consider to be a quite ridiculous comment about the waste from ethanol production turning rivers black. I think this shows a complete misunderstanding of the by-products of ethanol and how they are dealt with. Any by-products from ethanol and from the crushing of sugar are used and re-used, and they are a very much sought after soil additive and a fertiliser substitute. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an ethyl alcohol plant at Sarina in the Mackay area. The residue from the cane and molasses after the ethanol is taken from them is sought after in that area as a soil additive and is carted around the Mackay district. It does not pollute the rivers and streams in that area as Senator Cook seemed to suggest. </PARA>
<PARA> In a time when I thought the Government might be trying its very hardest to support the rural industries, Senator Cook seemed in a prepared answer to do nothing but denigrate one of the facets of primary industry that could assist the country and assist primary producers. The sugar industry is not in as bad a state as some other rural industries at present. Sugar prices have been reasonably good in the past year, but a decline is forecast for this year and the future is always very uncertain. But if ethanol were able to be produced cane production could be increased markedly, and this would allow a much better use of the enormous infrastructure and machinery costs that farmers and millers have to go to to crush cane at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook seemed to think that there was some problem in having a 10 per cent blend. He said that that would double the land used for cane farming in Australia to produce an efficient product and would increase pressure on marginal lands and on the environment. The Fraser Government a decade or so ago implemented the construction of the Burdekin Dam. A lot of Commonwealth money and Queensland Government money went into that project. With any investment made in that way, one must get a return on the money invested. Just now, so many years after the Fraser Government first implemented the initial stages to construct the Burdekin Dam, the Queensland Government is selling land that is benefited by the dam. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of types of primary production is being planned for that land, including the production of rice and other grain crops, but one of the things to which that land is very well suited is the production of sugar cane. The Queensland Labor Government has acknowledged this in giving away 80 hectare assignments on land which it recently sold in the Burdekin delta, which has been opened up as a result of the Burdekin Dam. </PARA>
<PARA> The doubling of cane farming land in Australia for the production of more cane for ethanol would mean a great boost for the Burdekin and Ingham areas, where spare land is available. As I mentioned, it would lead to a far more efficient use of the enormous capital costs that farmers and millers have to go to to produce the cane they now produce. The extra income they could get from ethanol would support employment in the farming areas surrounding those rural towns and in the milling areas. I would have thought that increasing employment opportunities, particularly in rural towns, was something that the Government would dearly want to encourage rather than denigrate as Senator Cook seemed to do yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> At a price in the mid-70 cents per litre, ethanol production from sugar cane becomes an economic proposition. The Queensland canegrowers organisation has been conducting trials with a 10 per cent ethanol and 90 per cent petrol blend. The Federal Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, has agreed that the Iraq-Kuwait situation highlights the need for Australia to give higher priority to finding other sources of fuel. It seems to me again that the Government should be encouraging rather than laughing at or denigrating proposals to use ethanol as a fuel substitute or as an additive to make fuels go further. The technology for the 10 per cent ethanol and 90 per cent petrol mix is tried and proven and it can be used without any modification of motor vehicle engines. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook mentioned that the experiment had not worked in Brazil. I do not think that information is correct either. The Brazil experiment used a complete ethanol component as a fuel rather than as the additive which we are looking at in Australia. But even in Brazil, where Senator Cook suggested the experiment had failed, I understand that the Brazilian President recently announced that he was going to buy an ethanol car because he thought that was the best way to go in view of the Middle East crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be right. Senator Cook may not think it is not a good idea, but his colleagues in the Queensland Labor Government support it. I think this is good. It is one of the few decisions that that Government has yet made. Most of the things that Government was put into power to do it referred to committees, pushing everything aside so that it did not have to make the hard decisions. But at least in this instance it agreed. The Townsville Bulletin this morning reported that the Government is pledging support for an ethanol plant to be built in north Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply say that, in these times of real crises in rural industry and real crises in employment in the rural areas of Australia, it behoves the Government to encourage anything that may assist rural industries, assist employment in rural areas and assist in giving us an alternative supply or source of fuel. The Government should be supporting very seriously proposals for investigations or further research into ethanol production, rather than denigrating them as Senator Cook appeared to do yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Macdonald has already indicated, a motion concerning the rural crisis was debated earlier this evening. The format for discussion was altered somewhat and, while we were privileged to hear an economic expose from the Government's resident mastermind on monetary matters, Senator Burns, it disrupted the agreed schedule of speakers. While I am very pleased to have heard Senator Macdonald espousing the advantages of ethanol-I honestly am pleased to have heard that and I endorse his comments-I am only saddened that they could not have been made as part of that debate, because that is where they rightly belonged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Burns in his contribution mentioned something about deregulation of the banks being a wonderful achievement in bringing banks into this country and making money available for investment. All we have seen as a result of that has been an escalation of interest rates, speculator investments, takeovers, share market manipulations and eventually bankruptcies and ballooning overseas debt. I did not hear in his contribution any justification of those events. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak very briefly about something I was unable to raise in the course of my contribution to the debate. This afternoon, not unusually but by a coincidence, I received one of the many contributions I have been receiving from people in Australia's country areas. The one I received this afternoon was a facsimile transmission from South Australia. It dealt with six case studies which would bring tears to the eyes of anybody who understands the country. </PARA>
<PARA> These case studies illustrate a variety of traditional, well-managed farms in reliable geographical locations. The farms have been well established and have well-established records of profitability. But all the case studies I received this afternoon revealed a sudden increase in liabilities and a sudden decrease in cash flow, which in many ways is the straw that has broken the camel's back. The sender of the fax to me asked in his covering note the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Sir, you can now take this factual information back to Canberra. The people here will ask,`What will you do with it? What will the Government do with it? Can we expect a reply?'</PARA>
<PARA>The feelings of hopelessness and failure accompany overwhelming stress of emotional and financial pressure, and are causing wives and families to leave husband and farm. Thus, the farmer is left to face the stress of desertion and depression all alone. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the covering letter, the sender says:</PARA>
<PARA>My plea to you, Sir, is that you will express to your Government the urgency of these matters. Country people and the community at large are running out of time. They wouldn't hesitate to say that your Government is also running out of time. </PARA>
<PARA> It saddens me that I have to bring this facsimile to this chamber. I cannot answer any of the concerns that have been expressed in it, because they are overwhelming in the magnitude of economic malaise. They are beyond answering from a person in my position. I was disappointed that I could not incorporate the facsimile in the debate which was originated by the Opposition. Like Senator Macdonald, I think that is where it rightly belongs. I wanted to take time to read into Hansard this plea from people in the country and to say, in honest sadness, that I am very sorry to have received this information and to have to put such a contribution into the record of this place. </PARA>
