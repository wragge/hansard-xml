<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will amend the Child Support (Registration and Collection ) Act 1988, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Family Law Act 1975 to give effect to some desirable improvements in the child support scheme and to update references in the Child Support legislation to the Family Law Act which was amended in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support scheme has now been operating for just over two years and in that time we have seen a substantial turnaround in the payment of maintenance for children who are living in single parent families. The collection of amounts payable under court orders has increased from around 30% prescheme to around 70% now and many more children can expect to benefit from the scheme as its coverage extends throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this Bill are minor but nevertheless important as they will free up certain restrictions that were included in the original Bills which, with the benefit of experience in the operation of the scheme, can now be relaxed. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important of the amendments is the one which will allow the Registrar to inform custodial parents of the progress of the recovery of amounts due to them and not fear any breach of the secrecy provisions. These people have a right to know what that position is and this amendment will ensure that can happen in future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment is aimed at clarifying the position of counsellors employed by the Family Court in relation to the secrecy provisions of the child support legislation. In providing counselling in disputes over custody, access or child support, Family Court counsellors sometimes become aware of allegations of child abuse. If that counselling is provided pursuant to child support legislation, the secrecy provisions of that legislation may prevent the reporting of suspected abuse to child welfare authorities. This Bill will free counsellors from the secrecy obligations of the child support legislation and leave the issue of counsellors' obligations of confidentiality to be determined by the provisions of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the Family Law Act in two important ways to further complement the operation of the child support scheme. Section 66BA was inserted in the Family Law Act to coincide with the introduction of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 to limit the actions that can be taken in the courts for the ongoing support of children when support could and should be sought from the Child Support Agency by way of application of the administrative formula. In practice this provision has not stopped non custodians from seeking an order from the court to pay before the custodian has lodged an application for assessment. This amendment will stop all persons from being able to circumvent the intended provisions of the Child Support (Assessment) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The other change to the Family Law Act will introduce a new condition under which a maintenance liability ordered by a court under the Family Law Act should cease. In the event that a custodian dies there is no provision for the Agency either in their own legislation or the Family Law Act to act in the best interests of the surviving children. The liability continues under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act but the person to whom the money is to be paid is deceased. This Bill will amend the Family Law Act to end the specific liability under a court order where the person entitled to the maintenance is deceased and the order makes no provision for the continuation of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change to be brought about by this Bill will remove the need for parties to private consent agreements and courts that make orders to depart from administrative assessments to state the amount of child support payable as an annual amount. This requirement was initially included to coincide with the annual outcomes of assessments made by the Agency but is out of touch with how child support is generally viewed by the community. As a result persons and courts will now be able to specify any periodicity in their agreements and orders and they will be acceptable to the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining changes introduced in this Bill are all of a machinery nature and update references only in the child support legislation to the new enforcement provisions of the Family Law Act which were included in the Family Law Amendment Act 1989. They were not able to be introduced with that Bill at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I would like to take up the question of the introduction of the legislation which creates the Australian Sports Drug Agency as a statutory body and sets up its board. I think Senator Michael Baume put it properly when he said, in response to something else that was said, that while the functions are being performed in a very efficient and effective way now by Mr Haynes and his group, the legislation will reinforce in the minds of the public the commitment of the Government, the commitment of the Parliament and the commitment of the community to pursue the policy that has been thus far implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there has been a change in attitude. I agree with what Senator Richardson said last night, that there has been a change in perceptions. I suspect, and I do not say this in a disrespectful way, that perhaps some of the officials have been a bit slower than the athletes. I believe that there has been a change in ethos amongst athletes. I suspect it is unfair to criticise athletes who used drugs four, five or six years ago in the same way that one might criticise them for using them now. I think the social mores have changed; I think the ethos has changed; and I think people's attitudes generally right through all levels of sport have changed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a great focus on this issue. There is a greater understanding by athletes that taking performance enhancing drugs in fact is a form of cheating. Before it was seen more as an aid. Frankly, I think this is not only because community attitudes have changed. We have had the Ben Johnson example and other examples. We now have a much more effective-not absolute-drug testing regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Athletes are now more likely to be detected if they use drugs. But this regime will not be absolute until such time as we can create proper profiles of athletes. At the moment one will not catch them all because the job is just too big. One has to actually test athletes within 14 days of the use of steroids before one can be certain that one is going to catch them and that is an enormous task which is beyond the funding of any government. So, in some respects a change of ethos is required. Greater discipline will result because of the risk of being caught. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, in my moments of glumness I have a sense of despair when I see that some of the attitudes of some of the bodies have not changed. The International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), for instance, chose in the Maurie Plant incident to hang its position simply on a legal argument that at the time Mr Plant solicited a urine sample from a young female Australian athlete for the purpose of allowing it to be substituted-or put crudely, to cheat-such action was not contrary to any International Olympic Committee (IOC) or Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) regulations and, therefore, technically there had been no breach. </PARA>
<PARA> The athlete, of course, as a scholarship holder at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), had to sign a code of conduct which not only applied in a technical sense to the laws but also imposed upon the athlete quite properly some moral standards. In my view, one cannot restrict oneself strictly to regulations in sporting competition of that nature. There are some moral encumbrances imposed upon athletes, officials and sporting bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAAF argued quite properly a technical and legal point that there was no regulation. There was no regulation because it had not been conceived in the minds of officials that that was a way of cheating. The taxation Act is regularly changed because lawyers, accountants and tax cheats find new ways of avoiding tax or, in some cases, evading tax. New skills are being applied to those areas. So governments as they uncover these schemes and loopholes change the laws to accommodate them. </PARA>
<PARA> When it was discovered that urine substitution was a form being used to avoid detection for positive samples, the laws were changed. But it has become even more sophisticated than that, as we know. It is not simply the substitution of the sample. As we now know, there has been a system whereby some athletes with empty bladders have had injected into their bladder somebody else's urine, which we might find absolutely horrific and bizarre, but that is the extent to which athletes will go to win. It is not without significance to note that in one of the surveys that a number of Olympic athletes around the world, not Australians, were asked the question, `If it meant winning a gold medal, would you risk your life by taking a performance enhancing drug?'. Without exception, the answer was yes. That is how important winning is. When one understands the involvement and commitment that athletes make to their endeavours, perhaps one can understand it, though none of us would agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it a bit reprehensible that the IAAF says, `Because technically Mr Plant did nothing wrong, we do not propose to scold him, to criticise him, to disengage him or to quarantine him from young athletes who might in future be subject to his seductive skills at extracting samples from athletes'. That is why from time to time I wonder at what pace those reforms are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no secret of the fact that the history of Mr Nebiolo is one, in my view, that has not necessarily been covered with glory. One has only to remember the activities in 1972 and 1973 in Rome when a competition was held up for an hour because their athlete had been disqualified for breaking twice. Ask Raylene Boyle about the pain of that. They invaded the track and had to be taken away by police. Then we had the incident at the world championships in Rome where, after much procrastination and cover-up, it was discovered that Rome officials were caught cheating in the long jump; they just extended the tape a bit. They are senior officials in the IAAF in world athletics. It was not without significance to those with some knowledge of these things that there was a general view that the Olympic Games should not go to Greece because they were seen as part of the Mediterranean mafia in sport. There is an area in sport that very respectable people still see as tainted because it has not cleaned up its act. Comments have been made in respect of the Dubin report. Although an enormous amount of work was done in that inquiry, it does not seem to have fundamentally changed the ethos and the attitude of the IAAF towards sport. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to ask Senator Richardson whether, in the event-and I know that we will do so subject to the sighting of the legislation-the Government will give a commitment to introduce the Bill and to have it passed so that it is on the statute books at the end of this session as a statement of commitment by the Parliament and the Government as to their attitude towards sport. Subject to the Bill being sighted, if it has enshrined in it those principles, which I understand to be the case, it will have a speedy, rapid and smooth passage from our side of politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before responding to Senator Crichton-Browne, I would like to raise two matters that arose yesterday. One was from Senator Michael Baume and the other from Senator Crichton-Browne and I might lead off with some clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of positive tests in powerlifting, the last positive test for the so-called Drug Free Powerlifting Association (DFPA) was June 1990, and the last test for the Australian powerlifting group which was positive was in July. So it will be difficult to distinguish which will seek to claim the perfect record, because the record does not look too flash. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne also made some comments about the Australian Weightlifting Federation. I said that I understood that the Weightlifting Federation had notified acceptance, but I was not sure whether we had yet received a letter. I am now advised that we have received that formal acceptance of the Australian Sports Commission's grant to the Weightlifting Federation. A quotation from its letter said, `. . . under the conditions specified in the ASC letter'. That includes adherence to the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) doping policy. I understand that the Weightlifting Federation is currently reviewing its own doping policy to ensure that the administration and the administrative arrangements that go with it comply with ASC requirements. It is, I am told, working closely with the ASC to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the comments made by Senator Crichton-Browne, certainly I would agree that we will need to keep ahead of the game if we are to ensure that our testing program means anything. There is no doubt that clever chemists and doctors will spend a great deal of time and money making sure that they invent newer, better, harder-to-detect drugs. We will have to make sure that Mr Haines's outfit is equipped with the capabilities to keep up with those developments and, hopefully, keep ahead of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we will ever get a perfect system; I do not think that will be possible. I would not want to set the Australian Sports Drugs Agency that kind of task. But so far as it is possible we will eliminate the use of drugs through this testing program. It is worth noting that, even if steroids were to go through the body in 14 days, some athletes will still be caught, and that will be the sanction, because athletes will not know who will be tested when. Of course, there is only a few hours notice for tests, so athletes who have been involved in taking them will get caught. They will not all get caught perhaps but the random nature of the tests-no one knows when the axe will fall-will act as a very strong deterrent or at least I hope so. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night in response to Senator Michael Baume I said that whether legislation goes through or not, the testing program will continue. But I agree with Senator Crichton-Browne's basic point that legislative force will help. Even before Senate committee reports and all the rest of it, I was urging that we should have the Drug Agency and its procedures subject to legislation so that the Parliament would have an oversight of its role. I cannot speak on behalf of the Government; I am but a humble Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pleased to receive the advice from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) about the weightlifters. I do not want to labour the point, but these things must be on the record. The Minister said last night, and I understand the reason for his response, that he had no knowledge of positive tests in weightlifting that had not been reported, or words roughly to that effect. May I refer the Minister to a letter signed by Bruce Walsh, the Executive Director of the Australian Weightlifting Federation who wrote to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further to my recent telephone conversation with yourself at 6.30pm on the 2nd April, I make the following submission to be taken as given in camera and under parliamentary privilege accorded to the Senate Inquiry into Drugs in Sport:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been recently brought to my attention that your Committee has made written inquiries to Mr. Sam Coffa concerning Nick Voukelatos and his withdrawal from the 1984 Olympic Games weightlifting team. I have not been consulted about the contents of Mr. Coffa's reply and, as I was involved in the matter, I wish to outline my knowledge of the situation -</PARA>
<PARA>After the selection of the weightlifting team to contest the 1984 Olympic Games, Nick Voukelatos was requested by the Australian Olympic Federation to submit to drug testing. As a result of this request I was contacted by Mr. Sam Coffa by telephone informing me that Voukelatos had appeared before Dr. Bill Webb or Dr. Brian Corrigan (I am not sure which one) and had informed the doctor that he would not be taking the test as he had been using anabolic steroids. I asked S. Coffa who had informed him of this information and was told that the source was a person from the A.O.F. He also requested me to contact Voukelatos and tell him to withdraw from the team due to injury or face the prospect of suspension. Shortly after I contacted Voukelatos. He was in a distraught state, alleging that he was affected by alcohol at the time of his admission to the A.O.F. doctor. I informed Voukelatos of S. Coffa's request-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that he withdraw-</PARA>
<PARA>and he subsequently withdrew from the team with an injured shoulder. My actions were as a result of a direction by my employer. </PARA>
<PARA>The employer was Mr Coffa. The doctor in question was Dr Fitch from Western Australia. I do not read that letter out to score any points but simply to show that there have been major problems with weightlifting in Australia and they have sadly been ignored by the administration for a very long time, and the Coffas particularly. As I say, the letter was signed by Mr Bruce Walsh, the Executive Director of the Australian Weightlifting Federation Inc. It shows that there have been very serious problems. My concern is that, while that was in 1984, the same administration is in place and nothing in its attitude has changed. What has changed is that the athletes will now be subject to random testing in and out of contest times and, if that is no inhibition on the use of drugs, I would be very surprised. I thank Senator Richardson for the commitment he made in respect to the legislation because I think it would be a very useful step for all of us. I want to touch quickly on a few more points. The Minister mentioned last night that I had had a few problems with one particular group of administrators who were new and inexperienced but vastly better than the last administrators. That is absolutely right; there have been some difficulties. I put it down to inexperience, which demonstrated itself during the period immediately prior to the Commonwealth Games in Auckland. I have sought not to be critical of them. I just hope that they understand that when I ask questions I am not being nosy or interfering, but simply need the facts. When I get correspondence back telling me that as far as they are concerned the matter is closed, that is not a satisfactory answer. As far as I am concerned, it is not closed. As long as they are getting hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, I think they have some responsibility to accommodate the requests that are made of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pursued very briefly the imbroglio last night as to which documents should or should not be tabled. I am no clearer now as to what the honourable senator was saying than I was last night. All I can say for the record is that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has a resolution which made the documents public; I did not. They are matters that have already been made public. That is the reason I was quite lost about the whole matter. Honourable senators will notice that I did not even bother to read the letters out. I would have been happy if they were not tabled. Just for the record, there is no doubt as to the status of the documents or the conduct of tabling them. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to table a document dated 22 August 1989, which I referred to last night, from Jeanette Brown, the Acting General Manager of the Australian Athletics Union. It sets out the only action taken by Athletics Australia in respect of the urine substitution incident so that it is on the record that, regrettably, during that time Athletics Australia did absolutely nothing about the particular matter in question. Mr Chairman, with your indulgence, I also seek leave to table a letter to me from the President of Athletics Australia Inc. and my response, which was simply just to remind it that there are further matters to be taken up from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one other matter. I made mention last night of a concern I had about pressure being put on members of the Confederation of Australian Sport. I mentioned that the name of one body had been given to me as having been spoken to with Athletics Australia. I should make it clear that that information did not come from Athletics Australia or anybody associated with it, to my memory. I mention that particularly because there is no point in me saying less than I know if I am to impart to the Minister information which gives him the opportunity to take the matter up. I will not seek leave to table that letter because I do not think it is particularly helpful. It mentions one particular official's name. It is an anonymous letter and I think it would be in terribly poor taste to be producing a document with that characteristic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will conclude on two matters. Firstly, I ask the Minister: What is the status of progress in respect of getting a clear definition of prohibited drugs? For instance, beta-blockers are banned, but valium, for instance, which has exactly the same effect, is not banned; it is not on the prohibited list. A pistol shooter or an archery contestant, whatever they are--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the last point raised by Senator Crichton-Browne, as far as I know, we totally rely on the International Olympic Commission (IOC) for this. I am not certain of the procedures which it adopts, but I understand that the list is under constant review. We have just accepted its list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is pretty difficult for us to undertake the same task, particularly when what we are about is equality among athletes and making sure that no-one has an advantage. So we really have to try to have the same list applied around the world. We are not trying to change the IOC's list at all; we are happy to abide by it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will comment on some of the matters that Senator Crichton-Browne raised on weightlifting and the incident in 1984. I have a couple of things to say about that. Firstly, 1984 was a long time ago. As we have acknowledged, the culture has changed dramatically since then. Part of the statement that I made earlier about weightlifting concerned the administrative body ensuring that its own policy and the administrative arrangements for that policy accord with the requirements of the Australian Sports Commission (ASC). It is not just abiding by an ASC policy; it is changing its own policies to fit in with it. I am not sure that there is much more we can ask of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Institute of Sport and the Sports Commission are still reviewing weightlifting's participation in their programs because it was suspended after allegations were made. I am aware of the letter that Senator Crichton-Browne has quoted from, but that is the view of one person and I do not know how Mr Coffa would respond. </PARA>

Nonetheless, I think we ought to be more concerned about arrangements for 1994 than those for 1984 and I want to make sure that, if weightlifting is back in the fold, it is back in the fold with the right doping policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the only relevance to 1984. My question about the International Olympic Committee (IOC) list relates to the fact that presumably members of the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) make a contribution to those deliberations. If I am not wrong, Dr Fitch is a member of the medical commission of the IOC. That is something Australia can make a contribution towards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will conclude on this note: one of the areas that has not yet properly been addressed by Australian society, sporting officials or the Australian Sports Commission and other bodies is the part recreational and social drugs play in the world of sport. I remember some part of the debate that took place when 10 rugby players were detected as having used marijuana. A very good argument can be mounted that it is inappropriate that athletes be tested for those drugs because they are not performance enhancing; they are drugs that relate to the personal performance of the athlete at the lower standard. In some cases these drugs are not on a ban list. In my view this issue has to be addressed by Australian society which, invariably in these matters, is led by governments and sporting officials who ultimately arrive at a conclusion as to whether consideration should be given to putting the drugs on a ban list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a dilemma because arguments can be put on both sides in terms of one's privacy and whether those sorts of drugs ought to be included. Alcohol, for instance, would fit into the same category. Should people be tested for alcohol when they are engaged in sports where alcohol is of absolutely no use? It is a dilemma for a sport for a number of reasons. I do not think it is a debate that has yet been addressed properly and a resolution has not begun to be developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The controversy in which rugby league found itself over the issue of testing for marijuana has done a lot to put the issue up in lights around Australia. Obviously, if we go back to that argument, within rugby league some fairly divergent opinions were expressed by a number of people. I hope that we can expand the debate and talk to all the sporting associations about their attitude. As I said, we are not testing for marijuana as a matter of course but only when requested to by an association. We ought to talk to associations about that. I am sure it will be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For what it is worth, my own view is that if we are going to kick off debates we may as well get some views on the table. I agree with the testing for marijuana. It is not performance enhancing; it is the opposite. The problem is that, if an organisation lays out lots of money to athletes-and it is not the case that one looks only at professional sports and says, `South Sydney will be interested because it is paying the player $80,000 a season'-and if the Government is giving thousands of dollars to individual athletes, they are entitled to believe that the athletes are doing their best. There is a fair bit of evidence that the athletes will not be if they are taking marijuana. As long as we are going to kick off a debate, my view will be that we ought to be--</PARA>

Initially, I shall refer to questions that my colleagues Senator Baume and Senator Archer raised. As honourable senators would know, I was not in Australia at the time matters concerning the Antarctica were considered. I would like some answers to some questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that at a late hour last night the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) pointed out how patient he had been in respect of the previous matters that had been raised. I can tell him that the patience also extends to this side of the chamber. On more than one occasion I have had the pleasure of listening to my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne, who certainly enlightened me about the drugs in sport issue. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister and his minders would probably know, I have for some time been pursuing some matters regarding the Antarctic supply vessel Aurora Australis. I preface my remarks by quoting from the mythical Sir Humphrey Appleby, who said that it is the Opposition's job to ask awkward questions and the Government's job not to answer them. The Government has answered quite a few questions but it has not done so to my satisfaction. This has been reinforced--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. This has been reinforced by the report of the Auditor-General entitled Antarctic Supply Vessel-chartering arrangements tabled in the Senate on Monday or Tuesday of this week. The Australian National Audit Office has raised some queries about some of the matters that occurred in respect of the contract. On 11 September Senator Baume asked a question about the extra amount being paid as against the original accepted price. He also asked whether it had changed much from the last time we had talked about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have asked similar questions to this and I have been given various reasons. I refer to part 4 of the Auditor-General's report where he noted matters affecting time charter negotiations. As I said, I read the report by the National Audit Office on the negotiation of the charter for the Aurora Australis. I think it is fair to say that this charter increased the payment to P and O by the Commonwealth, by my estimations-on today's prices anyway-by $25m above its tender offer. It is clear from the Audit Office report that the responsible department, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, has concealed critical facts from the Audit Office and the Attorney-General's Department, just as the previous Minister-Senator Richardson-and the Department have consistently concealed the facts from the Parliament. I refer to part 4.1 of the Auditor-General's report:</PARA>
<PARA> The audit disclosed that the negotiations over the time charter for the vessel were affected by-</PARA>
<PARA>the Auditor-General mentioned some negotiating power and the letter of intent-</PARA>
<PARA>the lack of a firm time charter on which the short-listed companies could base their bids. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, that is nonsense. A sample time charter was given to all the short-listed bidders but the final charter was far more favourable to P and O than the sample. This should have reduced the price to the Commonwealth, not increased it. Would Senator Richardson care to comment on that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The hire costs for 1990-91 are $11.1m. There will be an additional cost of $27,000 for the engagement of an ice pilot. If the vessel is not chartered for some other purpose during the off-season, the Commonwealth will be up for $164,000 for the part year between completion of the 1990-91 season and 30 June 1991. Those layout costs have been known right through. I cannot say I have read the Auditor-General's report to which Senator Calvert refers, but going back three or four years when this was all occurring, protracted negotiations went on and on with P and O. The Commonwealth did the very best it could. There were some design changes to enhance the vessel which meant, of course, a change in the cost. This was inevitable. If we seek to have some improvements, we have to pay for them. So there is a difference between what we originally calculated and the final payment. But none of that should come as a shock or a surprise. There was a quite normal period of difficult negotiation. Whenever millions of dollars are involved, both sides will accuse each other of all sorts of horrors during the negotiations. There is no question that P and O considers itself hard done by. Whether it was or not is something for history to judge. But, looking back on it, I cannot see any part of the negotiating process that I would seek to change.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I reiterate what I said earlier: there were certainly some differences in this particular charter arrangement with what happened before. I will refer later to the letter of intent, which was quite unusual. The fact that it was made known to the charterers 10 months before the contract was signed certainly had financial disadvantages for Australia. This was raised in the Auditor-General's report too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another reason put forward by the Department for the haste in the way this particular charter was carried out was that the ship was required for the 1989-90 season and therefore certain things were done which contributed to the rather large increase in costs. I would contend that the new ship was to be a big improvement over previous vessels and was also more costly. But there was no need for the ship to be ready for the 1989-90 season because the Department could have readily hired a cheaper ship. In fact, it had to do so because of the delay. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that, in the final analysis, the reason given for dramatically increasing the long term costs of the new ship being due to the time charter arrangements or the fact that it was needed in a hurry for the 1989-90 season is not a valid one. It had been planned for something like 10 years. Using those two reasons as an excuse for allowing the Commonwealth to be put in a position where it had to pay a quite large increase in the final costs by these unusual circumstances is not sufficient. It is rather irregular, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Australian Government Solicitor warned about this letter of intent. I know that the Minister is well aware of the letter of intent because I have raised this matter many times. I think that even one of his former ministerial colleagues, Senator Walsh, said, when he was chairing one of the Estimates committee meetings, that he found it rather unusual himself. The Australian Government Solicitor did warn the Department that this letter of intent could cause a problem and could prejudice the Commonwealth's position. But the Department then said it needed to give P and O the letter of intent so that it could take advantage of the 20 per cent shipbuilding bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend that this is not true also because in the letter of intent P and O had already advised the Department that it had arranged that, if selected for the final negotiations, it would arrange that sufficient work would be done to qualify for the 20 per cent bounty. I have some reference documents and I will explain that in greater detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department also stated that the approach it took was a result of its desire to have the vessel in service as soon as possible. That is also mentioned under 6.4 of the Auditor-General's report when, in his conclusions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The approach taken by the Department was in part a result of the desire to have the vessel built and available for service as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, and I will say it again, this is not true of the Department's approach. The Department originally had a plan which would have ensured a good ship in a reasonable time at the originally tendered price. But, under Senator Richardson's guidance, this plan was thrown out the window and the P and O plan was substituted, as the Minister would be well aware. P and O wrote the letter of intent in a way that was favourable to it and the Department signed it. From that point on, the Commonwealth had no legal legs to stand on. As predicted by the Australian Government Solicitor, and despite his office's best efforts to protect the Commonwealth, P and O led the way and took us to the cleaners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier, the bidding process for the ship was simply to establish the most competitive bidder. Surely the Minister would agree with that. This was all explained, as he would remember, in the tendering process document which was tabled in Parliament on 20 October 1988. I quote from that document:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>ANTDIV had intended to follow usual commercial practice and resolve qualifications in the preferred bidder's offer later, during the charter party negotiation... </PARA>
<PARA>That was in that great thick pink document tabled on 20 October 1988. It is not possible to resolve all points of the short-listed proposals, some of which are ambit bids outside the genuine negotiation process, but this plan was ruined by the signing of that letter of intent. </PARA>
<PARA> I get back to the point I raised earlier. I quote part of an answer that was given about the letter of intent:</PARA>
<PARA>To get the bounty that was involved the company concerned felt that it had to have a letter of intent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has agreed with that. Almost immediately after the Government decision was announced, the Deputy Director of the Antarctic Division, with the Minister's approval, signed the letter of intent. I think that Mr Tierney actually gave the approval. This letter of intent states:</PARA>
<PARA> This letter is provided to enable P &amp;O-Polar to act immediately, prior to the completion of the negotiation of the charter, to place an order for the construction of a vessel appropriate for the charter with an Australian shipyard so that construction of the vessel can commence before 31 December, 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that is not mentioned in the Auditor-General's report. As I said earlier, this letter was issued despite warnings from the Australian Government Solicitor. It certainly prejudices the Commonwealth's position. I quote the two reasons stated under paragraph 4.5 of the audit report:</PARA>
<PARA>1. A condition of the P &amp;O Polar proposal was that P &amp;O had to be able to enter into a contract for the construction of the vessel-</PARA>
<PARA>which I have just quoted from the letter of intent-</PARA>
<PARA>prior to 31 December 1987. This arrangement was designed to enable the ship builders to qualify for a bounty under the Ship Building Bounty Act 1982 which was only available at a particular rate until the end of December 1987. The availability of the bounty was taken into account in the tender price submitted by P &amp;O Polar. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that that reason is correct. In a memorandum of 20 August 1988 to the Deputy Director of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Director of Antarctic Division states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Alistair Baillie of P &amp;O-Polar had advised that the Shipbuilding Bounty of 20% would apply, as it was their intention, if they were selected for the final negotiations, to instruct a shipyard to commence the building of a ``Bounty'' section (e.g. a standard type tank section) before . . . 1987. He pointed out that, even if we were un- able to agree on a contract, the cost of starting a section of a vessel, less the residual value of the section, was relatively small compared to the amount they had already invested in the project. </PARA>
<PARA>This information was also given to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I put it to the Minister that the reason why the answer was given to Senator Michael Baume on 11 September and the reason the Minister has acknowledged that this letter of intent was sent was certainly not that it was necessary to get that bounty, because the Minister already had Mr Baillie from P and O saying that it would build a section to qualify. Why was the letter of intent signed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I must say at the start that I get a bit tired of answering the same questions time and time again. We have been up and down this charter many times. As each new senator and each new shadow Minister comes on, away we go. Everyone will be cleverer than the last person and find out something dastardly, except no-one does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is quite simple. I indicated that I wanted an Australian built and an Australian crewed ship. Given the fantastic result, I am glad that I did. If an overseas yard had been selected, the whole bounty question would not have arisen and we would not be having this discussion. But all of the tenderers who wanted to build in an Australian yard wanted to get the 20 per cent bounty. To get the 20 per cent bounty they had to place an order with an Australian shipyard and they had to get under way with construction. For them to do that, they needed a letter of intent. The Australian Government's legal advice was, `We wish you did not have to do it but we understand that you do'. In fact, the letter of intent was vetted by the advisers and included phrases composed by them. I would have thought that the correspondence Senator Calvert read concerning Alistair Baillie would have borne out the necessity for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Calvert talked about other tenderers not getting the same go as P and O. We selected P and O. That could not have been kept as some sort of secret. We could not have embarked on negotiations with three or four tenderers just so that P and O did not know that we had selected it. That is just ridiculous. We were anxious to get under way. Australia had spent all of those years hiring foreign ships. We were sick of it. We wanted an Australian ship. We were anxious to start. When I became the Minister and got hold of that process, I wanted it to be conducted as speedily as possible. We finally went forward with the recommendation to P and O. It then had to sit down with shipyards and negotiate which yard it would be. As Senator Calvert is aware, in the end there was quite a contest between a couple of yards for that right. But to get the bounty, they needed the letter of intent. The Australian Government legal advisers understood that that had to be done and had a hand in vetting it. They wished it did not have to be done; so did we all. But if we wanted the ship, we had to have the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> What has to be looked at is what is not said in the Auditor-General's report. What would have happened if P and O had not got the bounty? The price of the ship would have gone up dramatically. I would have gone back to Cabinet saying, `There's X million dollars here that you have to give me to make up for the loss of the bounty'. We are not talking about a win-win situation. That is not possible. It was a case of saying, `If they don't get the bounty, I am going to need extra money. We may as well get them the bounty and so we'll facilitate it'. The idea that the Department wrote some favourable letter to give P and O some sort of advantage in negotiations with the Commonwealth does not even bear commenting on; it is just too stupid. </PARA>

I have to say that, in looking back after all this time, if we had proceeded to build at another yard that was overseas and if Australians had not got this work, I do not believe Australia would be thankful to us at all. Australian shipbuilding got from the work a new skill that will serve us in good stead for decades to come and I am more than happy with that. I think the trend to believe that everything will be solved by going overseas is wrong. I still have faith in Australian industry and I would like to see more work such as this done in Australia. It must be remembered that one would have had to add to the costs of all the unsuccessful tenderers the cost of what would have happened if they too had had to go through the enhancement process that we went through in negotiations. That is not being done again, but that is because there is a predisposition not to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Audit Office has acknowledged that it is difficult to gauge the extent to which the issue of the letter of intent caused difficulties for the Commonwealth over and above that which might normally be expected in the negotiation of a charter of this kind.

So there would have been quite a substantial saving if the ship had been built overseas. As I have said before, it certainly was good for Australia for it to be built here, but my main argument is that, because of the way the contract was written and because of the delay in writing the contract, that $124m increased quite significantly. In his last answer the Minister mentioned the specification changes and the Auditor-General draws attention to those in paragraph 4.17 of his report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Another factor which contributed to the protracted negotiations was the decision by the Antarctic Division, within the scope of the Government's decision, to seek changes to the original specifications. </PARA>

In fact, the cost of the specifications was expected to be $200,000 per annum-that was back in 1988-but ended up becoming $450,000 per annum by April 1988. Would the Minister like to comment on why the Government changed its original decision that there be no specification changes that would substantially increase the cost of the ship when, in fact, the cost was increased by some $450,000 per year?</PARA>

The enhancement was very significant and the Commonwealth believed then, and believes now, that the enhancements were achieved at a very good price.

<PARA> Communications in the Soviet Union are not all that crash hot, but I think to expect them to put in a bid in three weeks or less, and a final bid I believe, was a bit unfortunate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several matters I wish to raise about the Arts portfolio. In particular, I want to ask on a matter that has arisen since the Estimates took place which will have a significant funding impact on the great bulk of the national arts bodies that are being funded through the Australia Council and indeed direct, such as the Australian Opera. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission made a decision very recently to double the touring allowance for actors, which I understand will cost something like an extra $60,000 a week to the Australian Opera. I have heard suggestions that the Australia Council probably needs at least $3.3m extra to cover this allowance if, in fact, it is going to offset the additional cost of this decision covering those people who receive Australia Council grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, this doubling of the touring allowance-and I am talking about the financial consequences of it, not the rights or wrongs of it-operates from now on. I think 75 per cent of the increase is to take place immediately with the rest starting early in the New Year, and it will affect those touring companies that have already entered into commitments to tour in keeping with the Government's desire to have these bodies as national bodies and therefore as touring bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> May I ask the Government's intentions in this matter? Will the Government in fact increase the allocations to these companies that are touring as part of really the Government's policy? If not, what is going to happen to these tours if they are cancelled because companies simply cannot afford them? Does that mean that these companies will lose their status as national companies and perhaps deprive the people in States other than their home states of their performances, particularly the Australian Opera? Has the Government yet addressed what is going to be a very serious problem?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not simply the Australian Opera. For example, Bell's Shakespearian theatre company is committed to touring and, as I understand it, with no extra warning it is going to be hit with an extra cost of $60,000. I wonder by the way whether the organisation that represents the managements has yet made a submission to the Government. If extra funding is required, will it appear out of the advance to the Minister for Finance or will there be some specific increases and a specific statement made about the need for increased Federal funding?</PARA>

In the talks that we have had over the past few years with the Australian Opera-to take an example-where we made quite a number of sizeable extra grants, the understanding was that at the end of that period the Australian Opera would be standing on its own two feet financially and be able to proceed. That, for any business, means that it is able to cope with paying the appropriate amounts of money, be it for travel or anything else, to its employees. So I do not think that we would accept that it is necessarily a Government responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have heard suggestions that some employers may be appealing the decision. I think that we ought also to await that. I do not think that I can undertake now that the Commonwealth would pick up the tab of $60,000 for this one or for that one. I think that to do so would give Mr Keating and Mr Willis palpitations, and I would not seek to do that. Obviously the Government, in the normal course of events, will consider any submissions that come forward from national bodies. We just have not received any yet. I shall endeavour to keep Senator Michael Baume informed as to these submissions, if and when they arrive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. Does this sort of situation, where costs keep rising and Government funding through the Australia Council to, say, the non-Australian opera areas is claimed by the Australia Council to have been diminished, bring some additional pressure-and, if so, what is the Government doing about it-for increased incentives through the tax system for private sector support for the arts?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask that question because, as I understand it from replies in Estimates Committee C, the Department has established a methodology to monitor revenue forgone in assisting the arts and, by the end of this calendar year, will be able to develop some kind of view of the amounts of revenue forgone so that it will be possible to include such a cost item in future annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Department reported that it had been consulting on business sponsorship under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act with the Australian Business Support for the Arts Group. I asked what state that negotiation had reached. The reply from Dr Daniels was:</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Support for the Arts Group has developed a proposal relating to a number of tax incentives of which the 150 per cent deduction is one. </PARA>
<PARA>It was developed by them through a consultancy, Duesbury's. I think that they put it forward to the Minister for consideration, but Dr Daniels did not know what stage it had reached. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a copy of that submission and the correspondence involved with it. What is most depressing about it is that I understand that, following a meeting in May or June, a formal submission was sent to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Hon. Ros Kelly, and no response of any kind has been received. It is now November. It concerns me deeply that here we have a situation where Government funding, at least on the Australia Council's claim, has been diminished because of the Australia Council having the Opera separated out from it. We have a situation where costs are rising substantially, particularly for those companies which are required in a sense to be national companies on tour if they are to have that status with the Commonwealth. We have the economic impact of recession making it much harder for theatrical companies and arts groups to get financial support, because there just is not that money around. In fact, some of the big sponsors of the arts have bitten the dust, so they will not be providing support. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a clear situation of developing crisis in the arts in terms of funding, but a seriously argued proposal, formally made in July, has not even had a response by November. I stress that it is in the context of a meeting of the arts and culture Ministers, State and Federal, which was held in May and at which, as I understand it, Mrs Kelly and Senator McMullan, as Parliamentary Secretary representing the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or Finance, agreed in general terms that there was merit in having this additional incentive approach. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly disturbing about this is that, as I understand the Duesbury submission, there is effectively no net cost to revenue in the tax incentive scheme that it proposed. There are some changes in timing, I understand. There is some delay, but it is claimed that it is relatively modest. Obviously there would be an impact on revenue, taken on a year by year basis. I want to know what the Government plans to do. Does it intend to do something speedily? Will it do nothing, as has been the case since July?</PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter particularly because there is no doubt that the reason that the present financial state of the arts is as good as it is depends heavily on the fact that there has been a 50 per cent increase in the past four years or so in private sector assistance to the arts. In the latest year it is up to about $47m. That means that, once adjustment has been made for inflation, between 1986 and 1989 there was something like 9 per cent per annum real growth. That is the sort of growth that Senator Richardson managed to get for sport in his time. I wish the same enthusiasm had taken place in the arts.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the private sector-and certainly our policy would be to encourage the private sector-has responded. The arts will face great difficulty with the private sector in the absence of the sort of incentive that the Australian Business Support for the Arts Group has put up. </PARA>
<PARA> It was fairly disappointing to me to hear in Senate Estimates that the Department did not know what stage the consideration had reached, and apparently is not being kept closely informed by the Minister or by the tax authorities about what this is all about. I would have thought that this would have been a matter of some urgency which would have fired the Department to a fair level of enthusiasm, but it does not seem to have done so. Perhaps we can find out why. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain of the date on which the submission to which Senator Michael Baume has referred was received but I do know that once it was received it was referred on to the Department of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office, that being the Department and the agency which will have to deal with this issue. They will control its destiny more so than the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My understanding of the situation is that the Tax Office has quite a few difficulties with the proposal and that is why there has been no swift Government response. I am not certain of Treasury's attitude or the attitude of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), given that he has displayed over time quite a passion for the arts. Without his support some of the newer initiatives, such as what we did in respect of films in the last few years, would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I will endeavour to find out where that is up to. I would not anticipate though there being an announcement very shortly-it might still take some time. Whenever we examine tax changes we find that the Tax Office will always take its time in trying to evaluate what precedents it might set and what the creation of a new loophole might mean. I have not asked Mrs Kelly but I will. I would imagine that it is difficult to see a financial response prior to the Budget process next year but that is no reason why correspondence cannot be replied to. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make sure that a letter is sent to Australian Business Support for the Arts (ABSA), at least letting it know where the matter is up to as we speak.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there has been some discussion and I would like to mention a couple of items from that letter in a minute. So that we are absolutely clear about what this is all about, I think it is important to stress that ABSA is not just a fly-by-night organisation. It is an organisation of some of Australia's major business leaders with the primary objective of encouraging the Australian business sector to become more involved in supporting the arts industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tax platform paper, which was prepared with the assistance of Duesburys, chartered accountants, would, in its view, have a tremendous impact on private sector support for the arts if it were adopted. Apart from the time delay, what concerns me is the fact, as I understand it, that the ABSA tax platform had the support of the Federal and State arts Ministers as well as the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. That is the impression I had from the May meeting. The tax platform has also been reviewed by the Australian Taxation Office which, as I understand it from the discussions, has found no technical problems with the issues raised. The Tax Office has raised a number of policy issues which, certainly in my view, and in the view of ASBA, can be addressed very satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental proposal of the ABSA tax platform is that the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to allow a 150 per cent deduction for contributions by business to non-profit arts bodies where those contributions are already deductible under section 51; that is, their normal business expenses. This proposal will have a minimal effect on revenue as the combination of the imputation system and the capital gains tax provisions will effectively ensure that tax not paid by a company is recouped in the hands of the company's shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> As we understand it, the main concern of the Australian Taxation Office was that it is government policy to finance via direct grants rather than via the use of taxation incentives. The platform recognises this concern but it emphasises that the proposals outlined should not be regarded as substitutes for government expenditure. After all, there is no net revenue loss anyway. As we have seen from the early report into the Australian National Gallery, it would simply be a disincentive for arts organisations to do what they can to raise private sector money if it simply meant that the Government's obligations were offset. What would be the motivation for the private sector to put in money if, in fact, it simply saved the government contribution?</PARA>
<PARA> It also illustrates the essentially revenue neutral effect of the section 51 deduction, which would be available only for expenditure that already satisfied the strict requirements of that section. I must say that I have great difficulty with this loophole problem. The letter dated 22 October to Senator McMullan, among other things, states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is perceived that the major problem confronting the implementation of the 150% incentive is that it is contrary to government policy to use the income tax system to encourage investment in particular areas. It is noted in particular, that in a paper released by the Department of the Treasury titled, `Economic and Regulatory Measures for Ecologically Sustainable Development Strategies', that there is a general presumption against using subsidies or general tax concessions to promote actions unless there is an overwhelming case for their use. This is because of the considerations of budgetary restraint and of limiting distortions to the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>My philosophic inclination is to avoid distortions to the tax system. I am certainly attracted to the idea of budgetary restraint. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It is ABSA's belief that in the case of the provision of incentives to help preserve the arts industry, there is an overwhelming case for the use of the tax system. In stating this, it is first essential to note that the Arts and Art related activities represent a $3 billion industry employing over 60,000 full time. As well as supporting the economy the Arts Industry creates and preserves Australia's cultural heritage and also helps shape the perception of Australia overseas. In fact it is a very potent tourism asset. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the government's support for the arts industry is via subsidies. There is also a limited tax incentive for taxpayers to contribute via Section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act (the ``ITAA''). ABSA do not want current subsidies to be removed or replaced by any tax incentive. It is not asking that government policy be amended. However, it would like it supplemented by the insertion in the ITAA of incentives for businesses to contribute to arts bodies. In this way, the most effective use can be made of government subsidies as they can then be diverted to those arts bodies most in need ie. new or fledgling arts bodies and those in the more obscure areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The considerations of budgetary restraint and distortions to the tax system are not applicable here. This is because the incentives identified by ABSA will have a minimum effect on the budget and are unlikely to distort the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> These considerations are looked at in detail in addressing the ATO's comments. </PARA>
<PARA>This is contained in a very lengthy submission and I certainly have no intention of reading it here. The summary states:</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, ABSA believes that the ATO comments do not detract in any way from the validity of its Tax Platform. . . . the proposals recognise the government policy and complement that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of the Tax Platform will help to ensure business support of the arts industry and as a result the community will benefit as the availability and accessibility of the Arts will be expanded to the population at large. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised those matters to demonstrate to the Minister that this is a matter of real urgency. It is a matter of major concern. Apart from drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that the correspondence has not been responded to since June, I remind her of what I understood to be a commitment to the concept by her, Mr Simmons, Senator McMullan and the State Ministers in May. This is not a matter which can or should properly be delayed for too long. A state of urgency is now developing in the arts area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I do not have with me any response which the Australian Tax Office may have given; therefore, I cannot comment on the difficulties it may have with the proposal. I will certainly endeavour to find out. When I had responsibility for this portfolio, while I might have had considerable success in getting extra Government money into environment, into sport, into films and into many other areas, I always found it very difficult to convince the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when it came to using the tax system. For all of the successes I had in putting money into the environment area, there were precious few when it came to tax incentives for conservation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for reminding us that today is Arts Advocacy Day. In my brief address to that gathering in the Main Committee Room today, I explained that it may be informative for these people to come to see this debate on the arts appropriations. Maybe they have more exciting things to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter I wanted to raise very briefly relates to the consequences of removal of the Australian Opera funding from the Australia Council. I do not want to canvass the matters raised in the Estimates Committee. I want to deal with the consequences of different answers given at different times, one when discussing this matter with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) and the other when discussing the matter with the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not new for a government to take the Australian Opera funding away from the Australia Council-the Fraser Government did it, together with the funding of the Australian Ballet. The view was that there was little merit in having an extra bureaucratic structure between the Government and the recipient particularly when the Government was providing instructions under polite expression requests to the Australia Council about what it should do with regard to the Australian Opera funding. A substantial inquiry had been held about the best way to fund the Australia Council. I have no problems with that funding going direct. I would be inclined to the Fraser Government's view that some other bodies could also be funded direct. What interested me was when I was asking the Department about what would now happen to the supervision of the Australian Opera as a result of its now being directly funded. I got what I thought were some fairly curious responses because Dr Daniels, for example, said that there had been no additional staff involved in the Department in having to look after the Australian Opera and as I understand it there had been no loss of staff on the Australia Council either or its having lost it. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently there is some reallocation of staffing activities. But that prompted me to ask further what was the level of that supervision anyway. The Department which is now in charge of looking after the Australian Opera said this:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what supervision the Council gave those bodies, but from our point of view both those bodies are in receipt of a grant from us-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Australia Council and I think the Ballet School-</PARA>
<PARA>They will get that grant under certain terms and conditions. We will be assessing their performance against those terms and conditions. We do not see it as our role in any way to look at their artistic ability. That is not the bureaucrat's role. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no problems with that but it appears to me that the Australia Council did look at artistic ability and the artistic outcome. Really what I want to ask the Minister is: Does the removal of that, if you like, peer group assessment within the Australia Council, mean that, no matter what the artistic outcome of the Australian Opera in its direct funding, there will be no `bureaucrat view' adopted? I must say that I have the greatest confidence in the Australian Opera. Mr Donald McDonald is probably one of Australia's most outstanding arts administrators. If the Government is taking the view, which I would support, that it should directly fund the Australian Opera, I am interested to know whether there is a need for assessment of artistic ability of many of the other mainstream bodies. If there is not, why not remove some others so that there is not a duplication of bureaucracy?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of duplication, which brings me to the May ministerial council meeting where there was agreement that there should be an avoidance of bureaucratic duplication. That, of course, brings to the fore the question of the Australia Council because I got not only a clear impression but also a specific answer from Mr Bourke of the Australia Council at the Senate Estimates Committee C hearing when I asked him whether the 549 individual artists and the 1,093 arts organisations which the Australia Council funded also got State or local government support. Mr Bourke said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are a large number of organisations which get both Federal and State funding and some local government funding. But now that we have a national system of cooperative decision making with all the States, I think wasteful duplication at least has been removed. But of those 1,093-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the arts organisations-</PARA>
<PARA>I would guess that probably half would get funds from the States as well. </PARA>
<PARA>I am wondering what position the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Minister are putting up on this matter where there is clearly duplication, but Mr Bourke said because one cooperates, or because the rival competitive governmental donors cooperate, it diminishes that duplication. But nonetheless there is a duplication of structures with half the people or half the organisations getting funding from both State and Federal bodies. I am wondering, following the Hawke-Greiner entente about the avoidance of wasteful duplication at the Premiers Conference, whether this Department, DASETT, has undertaken any serious studies of the extent to which this kind of duplication can be wiped out altogether and whether there is any case for a large number of these grants either being taken over entirely by the States or the States being encouraged to give them back to the Australia Council. But it is extraordinary to me that here we have, as Mr Bourke says, probably half of the bodies, the arts organisations, being funded by two separate bodies, two separate bureaucracies, and in a climate in which both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premier of New South Wales are repressing towards the removal of duplication. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all I refer to the Australian Opera. The memorandum of understanding which the Government has with the Opera does include requirements for things like Australian content and the Opera itself is setting up a body that will monitor artistic endeavour and merit. The Department will be represented on that body and obviously will be keeping a very close eye on it. I think the position with the Australia Opera is, that generally speaking the Government and the Australian opera lovers are happy with the artistic standards and I think the Australian Opera is doing very well indeed. I agree with the comments of the honourable senator about Donald McDonald. I think there has been a real change in the organisation in the last few years under his stewardship and it has been a change for the better. So we are happy with the current standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now, if there were to be a drop in artistic standards, if some poor performances were being put in, then we would not need the Australia Council looking at it, or the Department looking at it, to hear about it. There would be a flood of complaints. Whether it ought to be the case or not, I think the Australian Opera has more attention paid to it by a vocal group than perhaps any other artistic or sporting group in the country. We cannot avoid hearing about its artistic merit, or lack of it, depending upon the views of the people speaking to us. So I think a combination of public pressure and the Department's involvement in the committee which the Opera is setting up itself will ensure that we are well and truly aware of any drop in standard if it were to occur and we would then do something about it. But I do not actually think that is going to occur. I think the future for the Opera is a good one. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not quite certain of what Senator Michael Baume was getting at with the removal of peer assessment but there has not been peer assessment there for quite a while and I do not really believe that the Opera has suffered because of it. It is in that unique, exalted category, I think, where so many people fancy themselves as being peers, or at least as experts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose one could nominate a number of organisations and say that they might be in that category but I have not found complaints from the Australian Ballet about the way it is being treated. So I think we ought to address these things if there are problems, not seek to find them. The honourable senator's other question concerned the duplication of funds. This is half the 1,093 bodies. First off, I think the honourable senator will find that all those bodies are pretty happy about getting funding from three tiers of government if possible, two as the next best, and then one if they cannot get the other two. I am sure there would be no arts body that would want us to examine the funding of the arts in any way which would eliminate any tier of government from contributing. I think they all welcome funds from whatever source.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I think the Australia Council and the Department have been doing with the States, not just in the last few months but over the last few years, is that they have been working very hard to avoid groups of people in those tiers assessing them. I think they are more and more talking to each other about assessments to make sure that there is not a duplication of resources in the way in which it perhaps used to occur. I am not really aware of any great possibility for reductions in administrative costs at either end which could then be passed on to the arts community. I think we have got to the stage where there just really is not duplication of that kind and we rely upon each other, that is the Commonwealth and the States, in these assessments and cooperate very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I am not really aware of any flood of complaints from the arts community about duplication. Were it to occur then we would have a look at it. But I think cooperatively with the States we have been able to achieve it without the necessity for formalising a process via the Premiers conferences and I do not think this is an issue on the agenda for this round of discussions we are now having on the elimination of unnecessary duplication between the States and the Commonwealth. Mind you, I believe that process will go on for some years so I suppose we cannot rule it out. But, it is not there now and we do not see it as a priority. </PARA>

One point I want to make as a result of the mention of Arts Advocacy Day is to pass on some heavy pressuring from one group which emerges out of the discussion we had on the guidelines of assessing sales tax eligibility for works of arts, particularly Madam Chair, a matter you raised in Senate Estimates. That was the definition of the work of people in the craft area of the arts where their work is called craft and treated differently, for tax purposes, from works of art.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was an important decision made this year in regard to the Australian Taxation Office's definition of works of art. Previously this had been interpreted to include only paintings and the like and sculpture and the like and generally excluded items capable of utilitarian use-that is a good phrase-such as decorative pottery and ceramics even when produced in limited quantities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a series of court hearings which involved a potter from Braidwood in New South Wales who claimed exemption for sale of items of pottery on the grounds that they were works of art, although capable of being utilitarian, has resulted in an extension of the Tax Office's interpretation to include consideration of the intention of the artist in creating the work. Another recent development which has assisted craftspersons is the increase of the threshold for small manufacturers to $50,000 annual value of sales before sales tax applies. The threshold previously of $12,000 was increased in late 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I think we have moved to address some of these concerns and I would hope that if we can monitor the effects of the things that we have just mentioned, between now and the next Budget round, we will be able to see whether we need to do anything more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of brief questions. The Minister mentioned in a laudatory way his activities in the area of film. I wonder whether I could raise very briefly one matter that has emerged. It relates to the funding of a film, an Australian production, called Cotton. As I understand it, it is aimed at being a production under the general national interest head. I have been receiving substantial complaints, as I understand the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has also received complaints, that this film, a national interest production, is not, as appears so far, providing the docu-drama `fair approach' that its producer, when interviewed on a local radio station, suggested was its intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The film is designed to look at the controversial subject of chemical use in the agricultural industry. It is claimed by the producer that the cotton industry formed an ideal basis to look at both sides of the chemical debate. The producer, Ms William, said:</PARA>
<PARA>You hear from people who live in cotton growing areas who are concerned, real or perceived concerns, that are still there about chemicals. Of course, a lot of chemicals are used in cotton. You also have the opportunity of hearing from the other side. </PARA>
<PARA>There are concerns that this is shaping up not as a balanced `national interest' matter where the issues are fairly dealt with but one in which the people playing real live roles are in fact substantial activists who are strongly opposed to the cotton industry. I have no knowledge of the merits of the case. All I am saying is that there is concern and I wonder to what extent these productions, which are `national interest' productions, are subject to any kind of assessment within the Department and whether it is perceived to be `in the national interest`, as this is a national interest film, for this industry, which is one of the few actually earning any export income at the moment, to be subjected to what is expected to be by those people who have been involved in this as a pretty one-sided production. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Film Australia is currently making a docu-drama called Cotton, which addresses the use of chemicals in agriculture, which is of course an important contemporary issue. It has to be remembered that Film Australia is a government owned company which operates at arm's length from the Government. It has been contracted to produce films under the national interest program which will cover issues of national interest or which illustrate or interpret aspects of Australian society and the lives of Australian people. What it is actually going to make these films of national interest about, of course, is a matter for Film Australia and not the Government. One is always, I think, in a difficult area here of not wanting to be seen to do or actually to do something that could be interpreted as being censorious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This new program style of docu-drama is proving very popular. It is where one mixes actors and real persons in fictional stories in a tele-movie format. By doing it that way it is hoped one can reach a much broader audience than one might with just an old style documentary, and that way one might encourage community debate on issues. The kinds of issues that have been covered using this production style in the past are custody, prejudice, malpractice and mortgage. There have not been any complaints about the programs that Film Australia produced on those subjects. If one looks at some of them they are pretty controversial. One could imagine they are more controversial than the use of chemicals in agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the use of chemicals in agriculture is, as I said, an important contemporary issue from the health standpoint, certainly from an environment standpoint, and, one would imagine, it also is tied up with our new enlivened discussion on ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> Film Australia has assured the Minister that every effort is being made to show both sides of the argument in this docu-drama. If there are people who are concerned about the way this is proceeding then perhaps they ought to take up their complaints with Film Australia but I shall make sure that the Department seeks a further assurance from Film Australia that every consideration will be given to all those with a concern on the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Still on Arts, yes. It seemed the easy way to deal with the matter. It is the only matter I have in that area. The concerns emerge not because there is environmental concern about chemicals in cotton, but because it has been suggested to me that the matters being raised are really maintaining an unrepresentative environmental concern. In other words, a body has three of its strong supporters involved in real live roles in this film. I am referring to members of the Total Environment Centre (TEC). It has been put to me very strongly, and I repeat: they are unrepresentative of mainstream environmental concerns. On the contrary, they have consistently advocated an extremist view. The industry's problem is that, if their view is to be the dominant view and the only `environmentalist' view, this could do much to undo the work being done in trying to build public confidence in the industry. I also understand that there has been a significant improvement as a result of genuine environmental concerns about the use and abuse of chemicals in the production of cotton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To substantiate that, I think I should just mention it has been put to me that three people who are taking a real live role in the film are Dr Kate Short, an environmental activist from the Total Environmental Centre, who is, as I understand it, acting as a consultant to the producers on an almost full time basis and who is well known as having been aggressively agitating public opinion against the use of chemicals in cotton production for the last 18 months-I do not think Dr Short is a medical doctor, I think she has a PHD; Dr Mark Donohue, a Sydney based general practitioner, who actively endorses the anti-cotton industry stance of the TEC; and Ms Pat Jackson, a Mungindi resident responsible for coordinating the community opposition to the use of aerial applied chemicals in cotton production.</PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that concerns would be looked at, but I would hope that by raising the matter here I might be able to encourage the producers to be particularly careful to ensure that while it is a controversial film-and I hope it would be because it would be stimulating and interesting if it were controversial-it provides a fair view of what is a delicate matter, particularly when one recognises that really it is a government supported and government funded body. If a fair view does not emerge Film Australia might find an opportunity to make another docu-drama which presents the other side of the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I would not concur with the description of the Total Environment Centre as extremist. Obviously, as an active conservation group, it puts its views firmly. But I do not think I would classify its members as extremists. I know many people associated with the Total Environment Centre; some people in the Total Environment Centre are among my best friends, as they say. But I would not have thought one could say that they were extremist. I do not know Dr Kate Short, but it seems to me quite natural that, if one is going to present a matter of public interest like this, then one would go to those who have a view and involve them. One would also go to the other side of the argument and, perhaps, involve that other side as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These docu-dramas, by their very nature, evolve during their production. It is not like a movie with a set script that just has actors performing their set lines. I would strongly suggest to anyone in the industry who has a contrary view to Dr Short, or to the Mungindi resident to whom Senator Baume referred, to go along to Film Australia and put that view. I am sure that view will be accommodated and that Film Australia-which has a pretty good reputation for making sure that people are treated fairly-will do that. It is hard to imagine a more controversial subject than something like custody, and yet we have not had a flood of complaints from those involved in that issue about the handling of it. I would be surprised if, when this docu-drama finally comes out, there is cause for anyone to complain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I do not want to pursue that further, except that I do note his point that these things evolve. As I understand it, in the course of their evolving there was a suggestion put by the producers that the Bourke Shire Council should include actors and a film crew in a public meeting that it planned to have on this matter. The Council decided that maybe that was not the way it wanted this public meeting to evolve, let alone the way it wanted the film to evolve, and felt it should cancel the meeting if it was not going to be a fair dinkum meeting dealing in a fair dinkum way with this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter I want to raise very briefly, because we are running out of time, is: when will the Government be announcing a new Chairman for the Australia Council? As I understand Professor Horne's time runs out at the end of this year. Could I say that it does seem, in view of the present state of the Arts in Australia, that there is clearly a need for a chairman who has a practical appreciation of the broad spectrum of problems facing the arts. Without making any comments or reflecting in any way on past chairmen, I am wondering whether the tendency to have people with academic backgrounds is necessarily appropriate in the present circumstances of severe practical problems facing the Australia Council. </PARA>

My question relates to a report in the Australian newspaper of 5 November headlined `Gases threat may be hot air' and, in particular, a claim by Dr Brian O'Brien, former head of the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority. Is there any basis for Dr O'Brien's claim that widely accepted and dire assumptions about life on a planet choked by greenhouse gases are exaggerations, based partly on outdated scientific assumptions?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read the article that the honourable senator referred to, but I must say it does not surprise me that there is debate about the greenhouse effect and the implications of the greenhouse effect. That debate largely turns, I think, on questions of time, when the effects of climate change will be felt, and so on. The report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is still the best scientific advice that Government has, for that report quite properly emphasised the remaining uncertainties which qualified its conclusions. These uncertainties relate both to the greenhouse effect itself and to its consequences. There has been a debate both in Australia and very much so in the United States about these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The work on impacts proceeded in parallel with the IPCC's re-examination of the scientific aspects and so was obliged to draw on the best predictions of the rate of change available at the time. The same is true of the report of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I should emphasise that both reports take a very long term look at the consequences of the greenhouse effect. If the effect is slower than earlier predicted, those consequences would appear more slowly. But they would still appear, assuming we do nothing to prevent them.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me emphasise that we are doing something. Because of the scientific uncertainties I referred to earlier, we are moving carefully and deliberately, doing those things that it makes sense to do-first of all, things that have economic efficiency benefits as well as greenhouse benefits. When some of the current scientific uncertainties have been resolved, it may be time to think about further measures, and the Government continually has the question of further measures on its agenda.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no basis on which to change that answer. So far as criminal matters are concerned, I have further reinforcement for that position in the light of some information just given to me by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs on the basis of information conveyed to him this morning by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Senator Tate has been advised by the AFP that there was no evidence at all implicating Mr Brian Burke in its investigation of the Commonwealth offences which led to the prosecution and conviction of Mr Robert Smith. At least as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, that would appear to clean up any conceivable lingering doubts so far as that part of the scuttlebutt is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as the further events which have occurred in Western Australia are concerned and as to the contents of the rather mysterious statement made by the Ombudsman, all one can possibly say about that and all that I can say about that is that any question of the appropriateness of Mr Burke's appointment to Dublin, which is of course the only way in which I get involved in this, could arise only in the context of the Western Australian courts finding that there was a case to be answered or that there was some other kind of impropriety.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations been drawn to figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) relating to average weekly earnings?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics brought out its publication Average Weekly Earnings: Australia, August 1990. As honourable senators will know, the Australian Bureau of Statistics is independent of the Government; its opinions are its own. The survey results for this publication show that preliminary estimates of average weekly earnings released today by the ABS show that the Government's wages policy is on target. The figures indicate virtually no wages drift and a high level of compliance with and commitment to national wage case principles. The ABS information shows that the average weekly ordinary time earnings for full time adults increased by 1.4 per cent in the three months to August and by 6.5 per cent over the whole of the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This compares with a rise in the weekly award rates of pay index for full time adults of 6.4 per cent in the year to August, indicating a low wages drift and a high level of compliance with the national wage case principles. The growth in average weekly earnings has been influenced by the flow-through of the second increase delivered in the August 1989 national wage case decision. The decision allowed for a rise of $15 per week or 3 per cent, whichever was the greater, for skilled workers; $12.50 for semi-skilled workers; and $10 for unskilled workers. This means that the Labor Government's wages policy and our consensus approach-the accord approach-to wage fixation in this country is on track and that that accord approach makes it possible to achieve fundamental workplace reforms while maintaining a wide compliance on the wages front.</PARA>
<PARA> I note from reports that metal unions and metal employers are today in negotiation over wages. I hope that leads to a settlement of their negotiations in a way which will be within the parameters set down by the accord. I expect that that would be the case. Also, this morning I referred the matter of the 6 per cent claim for members of the Industrial Relations Commission to the Gleeson inquiry-the inquiry looking at salaries and conditions for the whole of the Federal Commission. That means that there is now no pressure on the wages system, other than the pressure exerted by excessive settlements for senior executives in this country and by senior executive remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA> I have tabled figures to show that senior executives are still obtaining wage increases which are well above those of the ordinary work force and I have called upon them to exercise the same restraint that ordinary wage and salary earners are required to exercise. I would appreciate it if the Opposition would give an uncontradictory and completely open endorsement of that call so that it can at least be bipartisan and we can see all sectors of the community complying with the restraint required in these times.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to the proposal to import apple fruit from New Zealand where the disease fireblight has been recorded in all production areas. I remind the Minister that fireblight of apples and pears is considered to be one of the most infectious and devastating diseases known to affect plants and that Australia is one of only four countries still free of the disease. I ask: Is the Minister aware of the devastation caused in other countries by this disease and of the deep concerns of Australian horticulturalists? Has the Government considered the report of its own Horticultural Policy Council, to which the Minister referred the proposal, which recommends a re-examination of the issue on the basis that the present proposal does not provide protection against the entry of fireblight disease into Australia?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My answer to the first part of that question is yes, I am aware of the damage that this disease can do and, indeed, that Australia is one of the few countries in the world free from it. That knowledge is not peculiar to me; it is knowledge shared by all of us in the Government. As a consequence, on this and other matters of this nature we provide for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS)-again, a body that is independent of government-to conduct scientific tests and run risk assessment models in order to assess what risk there would be if importation of particular fruit bearing this disease were allowed into Australia. We are aware of it. There is a mechanism through AQIS to scrutinise properly and scientifically what the risk factors are so that judgments can be made on real knowledge and not on political grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the other parts of the honourable senator's question, we have freely acknowledged-officially as the Government and through officials of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy-that we are considering the proposal to import apples from New Zealand. That is true. The application has been made and we acknowledge it. However, we think that the proper course is to undertake an assessment as to whether those apples would in fact bear the disease.</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Horticultural Policy Council which Senator Powell referred to was not commissioned by the Government; the Council itself initiated that. The recommendations of the Council are now being considered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service together with other responses to a discussion paper which AQIS itself published. It was prepared on the basis of being able to consult with other scientific opinion outside of the Service and to obtain the opinion of growers and others affected by the importation of this fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that AQIS has considered the responses that the Horticultural Council has made, that other scientists have made and that growers have made to its discussion paper. It is now preparing a report which it will finalise by the end of this month and, as a consequence of that report, there will be further consultation before action is decided upon.</PARA>

<PARA> Earlier this year we actually had an inspection of the bridge. I am always very careful when addressing local government groups-or, indeed, any other groups that are seeking funds-to indicate to them that I will seek to get funds for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer the Minister to questions asked previously concerning convicted Western Australian private investigator Robert Smith and the file referred to as the blue file. Now that the Western Australian Ombudsman has indicated that the blue file is of such consequence that he has demanded a Royal Commission, on what possible basis did the Minister, as the Minister for Justice, believe that further inquiry beyond simply delivering the file to the Western Australian Commissioner of Police was not warranted into matters at the Federal level?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a completely incredible, convoluted and confused question. It was not for me to pass a matter for investigation to the Commissioner of Police in Western Australia. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Mr Peter McAuley, took that decision having exhausted the investigation of the alleged telephone intercepts by Mr Smith. As honourable senators know, that particular investigation led to the conviction of Mr Smith. I think that is to be commended. Honourable senators will recall that on 26 February 1990 Mr Smith and another person were convicted in the Perth District Court of conspiring to commit offences against the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. He was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment and was released during the year after serving approximately five months of his sentence. Smith recently appeared in the Perth District Court on further counts of conspiring to intercept telephone conversations. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment with a 10-month non-parole period and directed to enter into a $15,000 recognisance on release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of that investigation I was briefed some six times. On none of those occasions was the name Burke ever mentioned in any of the briefs. Further, I am advised by Mr Peter McAuley, the Commissioner of the AFP, responding to my request this morning in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised there was no evidence at all implicating Mr Brian Burke in the AFP's investigation of the Commonwealth offences which led to the prosecution and conviction of Mr Robert Smith.</PARA>
<PARA>In that situation I think it was quite proper that that Commonwealth offences investigation having been properly concluded by the AFP, which is its particular responsibility, Mr Peter McAuley took the proper decision to hand materials over to Mr Brian Burke.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Beahan for his question because there has been some speculation about this issue in newspapers and elsewhere. First let me make the point that restructuring of the telecommunications infrastructure will provide a more efficient and responsive service to users, both domestic and business. There will, of course, be substantial benefits to business in all industry sectors, particularly those in which communications are a significant element of cost. I refer to industries such as tourism and banking, for example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The restructuring will also provide a major opportunity for Australian manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, and particularly for the providers of value-added services. Australia already has quite a well-developed communications equipment industry and is well placed to take advantage of increased market opportunities, and industry development activities will form an important element of the selection of the second carrier.</PARA>
<PARA> Without wishing to be prescriptive, it is likely that tenders for the second licence will be committed to activities such as local research and development, either by the carrier itself or by contracting out to local companies or research organisations; will be committed to local sourcing of major equipment either from existing or new suppliers; and hopefully will be committed to exports of locally developed products, again including and emphasising value-added services, network hardware or software, and management and design expertise. Specific opportunities for the telecommunications equipment industry generated by these activities will become apparent as the tendering process progresses.</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that what we are talking about is enlarging the size of the industry, and that will bring benefits. These commitments will, however, not be solely limited to the second carrier network licence. Licence agreements with both carriers will cover a number of things such as industry development activities. In all the reform processes announced by the Prime Minister there is opportunity for increased new private investment, an expansion of total jobs in the telecommunications sector, and the creation of substantial and enduring export opportunities for the telecommunications industry.</PARA>

I draw the Minister's attention to an article that appeared on 1 November in the Adelaide evening newspaper, the News, in which it was claimed by a Sydney University researcher, Ms Lydia Bennett, that health workers who care for people with AIDS are shunned by their colleagues and often suffer further prejudice outside of work from family and friends. With the realisation that the AIDS disease is one which will be around for some time, can the Minister outline what action, if any, is presently being directed towards this problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the advantage of Senator Foreman drawing my attention to the article in question, which quotes from recent statements by Sydney University researcher Ms Lydia Bennett. Certainly, if what she has to say is even half true, it is an indictment of the people who work with those who are nursing in the AIDS field. It is hard to comprehend how fellow health workers could out of ignorance, or malice perhaps, ostracise or add to the tensions and trauma experienced by those who are undertaking this particularly difficult type of nursing. The Government certainly recognises the need to provide additional training and support for groups such as nurses who are dealing with the AIDS epidemic on a day to day basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of its strategy, the Government has initiated the Commonwealth AIDS work force information, standards and exchange program. This program provides funding to employers, unions and professional groups to ensure that the work force has access to AIDS related information and resource materials, retraining and skills development programs, guidelines and standards. In fact, we are putting $1.59m into that program this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The researcher quoted in the article is involved in a study funded under that program-a 3-year prospective study of AIDS related burn-out-approved in August this year by the Minister for Community Services and Health. Some $60,000 has been devoted to that project. The fact is that burn-out and the battle fatigue induced by working in this area are such that quite often in this demanding job nursing may attract people for perhaps only a year or so and they then move to another area of nursing or out of the profession altogether. The trauma of seeing multiple deaths among young people is too much for them to take if they do not have the support of their colleagues in the nursing and other care professions.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that government funding for education and support programs for health care workers has been provided to a number of organisations, including the Australian Nursing Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Association of Social Workers and the Australian Community Health Association. I believe that those funded programs will help alleviate the sort of stress and distress experienced by those engaged in this particularly difficult form of nursing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I reply in two parts. First of all, the actual request made by Mr Freeman, the Ombudsman in Western Australia, for a royal commission-and I only have the front page of the West Australian to go by-seems to be somewhat confused. In fact, amongst other things, it is reported in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Freeman, who turned 63 today, said his successor would review the progress of the police investigation into the affair in three months. The investigation should proceed and nothing should be done to jeopardise it.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the sort of line of questioning and the public hysteria that has been generated about this matter would be designed in some part perhaps to influence the police investigation, and certainly may jeopardise it. I would have thought that if Mr Freeman is properly quoted there, the best thing that could be done is for those who believe in Mr Freeman's general integrity and who want to take note in a serious way of what he says should take note of that part of his statement also and allow the police investigation being conducted by Commissioner Bull to be concluded in a way which will be, as he says, under the constant surveillance of his successor.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I would also say that, of course, it is not my intention to look at any evidence seized by the Australian Federal Police in relation to an investigation which they have undertaken, which has led to the successful prosecution and sentencing of persons who were in breach of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. I believe that I can reiterate my utmost confidence in the handling of this matter by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Peter McAuley, who has advised me-and I rely on his advice absolutely and with no qualms whatsoever-that there was no evidence at all implicating Mr Brian Burke in the AFP's investigation of the Commonwealth offences which led to the prosecution and conviction of Mr Robert Smith. In that situation, I certainly would not indulge in anything that might have a colouring of political interference by seeking to look at the evidence which has led Mr Peter McAuley and his officers to that conclusion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do in fact recall the letter that Senator Devereux wrote to me and I must say that he has been much more productive than Senator Alston in respect of this issue. In the correspondence to me he suggested that a simple change to the specifications would see an immediate start to a transition from old growth regnans to regrowth forests. He also indicated that such an action would clearly signal to the community that the Government is continuing its support for a sustainable development strategy. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Devereux for raising this issue. The Department of Administrative Services is currently in the process of calling tenders to supply the Commonwealth with a range of commercial furniture, and I am pleased to announce that we have moved away from the strict adherence to the specifications that were previously used and those that Senator Devereux mentioned in his correspondence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Previously, 95 per cent of Commonwealth furniture was made with particle board covered by eucalyptus regnans veneer. I am pleased to say that we will now omit reference to straight grains in the tenders and, because of that, the changed veneer specification will now allow manufacturers to use veneers of different colours and grains. Essentially, that means that tenderers will not be required to use old growth forest timber to meet government orders.</PARA>
<PARA> The overall question of timbers used in government construction is still under review, but specifically in respect of old growth timbers I must say that very little use is made at the moment of eucalyptus regnans for the purpose of internal partitioning and executive fitouts of buildings. However, it is still used in some cases for built-in furniture but, because of the change in the specification, this should phase out in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I take this opportunity once again to thank Senator Devereux for raising this issue in a very constructive way. I hope that the changes I have just announced will contribute considerably to reduce the reliance on old growth timbers and start a transition to regrowth forests.</PARA>

I am quite sure that unless Mr Field, the Premier of Tasmania, or Mr White, the Tasmanian Minister for Health, was satisfied as to the long term financial or industrial relations matters being satisfactorily resolved as far as the State was concerned, those discussions would not prove fruitful. Nevertheless, I am quite confident that Mr Ben Humphreys, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, will allow them to understand the financial and industrial implications for the State and to satisfy their concerns in those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the general question of the wards that might be open at the Repatriation Hospital in Hobart as compared with wards that might be available at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Senator Newman should be aware that the geriatric rehabilitation unit has already moved from the Royal Hobart Hospital to the Repatriation Hospital and that this move has proved to be extremely successful. The move of that geriatric rehabilitation unit has allowed for space at the Royal Hobart Hospital to be found for the cardiac unit to be set up there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has provided, or is committed to providing, assistance of a variety of kinds to eastern Europe. There is, first of all, the capital subscriptions to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development of $45m over five years; there is a $5m food package to Poland-that was announced a number of months ago; there is a package of economic measures, including bilateral investment protection and double taxation agreements, to help Hungary and Poland in their trade relations with Australia; there is a $1m contribution that we have made to the stabilisation fund for Poland; and there is an emergency grant of $50,000 to the Red Cross for Romania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess the centrepiece of our assistance program is now the Australian program of training for eastern Europe-APTEE-which was announced by the Government in January this year, which will provide training for middle level managers from eastern Europe at a cost of $5m over three years. Applications for the first APTEE fellowships were received in October and fellows will arrive in Australia in early 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> APTEE is designed to respond directly to the needs of recipient countries and draws on areas of expertise in which Australia does have a comparative advantage. It comprises two complementary activities: first of all, small in-country training projects, for which discretionary funds have been provided to heads of mission, and secondly-more significantly-120 fellowships conducted in Australia providing academic courses and supervised placements in industry or commerce.</PARA>
<PARA> Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland will participate in APTEE in the first year. The inclusion of other eastern European countries and the Soviet Union in subsequent years will be considered. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau will manage APTEE through Australia's overseas missions and an in-Australia contractor. Seventy-two firms have expressed interest in managing it. Nineteen of those have submitted firm proposals. The Hawthorn Institute of Education has been selected to conduct the program and contracts should be signed this month.</PARA>

I ask the Minister when the review promised by the Prime Minister of the current system of tax zone rebates was conducted, and what was the outcome of the review. Will the Minister urge the Prime Minister to use the occasion of the Northern Forum in Mount Isa next weekend to announce a substantial and realistic increase in fixed dollar amount zone rebates for the people of remote Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give the honourable senator what information I have about this matter. It may be that I will need to obtain some more from the Treasurer. The review to which Senator Macdonald refers is completed. It examined over 100 submissions from interested parties and identified a number of anomalies in the current arrangements. As outlined in the Budget, the current zone arrangements have been extended to include King Island and the Furneaux Group in zone B, and Nhulunbuy, Northern Territory and Lord Howe Island in special zone A. The arrangements have been extended to increase the dependence component in the special zone B tax rebate to the same level as that applying in zone A. They extend eligibility for the remote area allowance to pensioners and beneficiaries resident in special zone B. Previously this allowance was payable only to pensioners and beneficiaries in zone A.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These changes remove some clear anomalies in the situation prior to the changes. They simplify the administration of the rebate arrangements for the special zone areas and represent some $4m per annum in additional assistance to Australians who reside in remote areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Aulich for his question. In doing so, I also note his interest in this area of disability. On 29 October, just a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to launch a tactual atlas, which had been produced by the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) in my Department in cooperation with the braille community as well as the private sector. The atlas is a very special product. It is a unique reference work which breaks new ground in the availability of information to braille readers. In fact, it has no equivalent anywhere else in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first volume of the atlas was released in 1987. That volume gave the braille community the best available resource on the shape of Australia and its States and Territories, and the location of Australia in relation to our neighbours and the rest of the world. The second volume, which was released quite recently, in fact two weeks ago, was entitled People and Industry. It provides a wealth of information about the distribution and characteristics of Australia's population. It also covers our agricultural, mining and manufacturing industries. As well, it includes maps of the European exploration of Australia and transport and communications. To accompany this atlas, there are a number of companion books to assist both parents and teachers.</PARA>

Is the Government aware that the draft report prepared by the panel of review of agricultural and related education, known as the McColl committee, recommends that there be only six recognised providers of agricultural education and training throughout Australia and that, as a result, the University of Tasmania, along with a number of other regional institutions, would be prevented from offering undergraduate courses in agricultural science? Is it true that the Committee's recommendation is in direct contrast to recent Federal Government policy and practice which have deliberately set about to link excellence in research to an effective undergraduate program through the introduction of cooperative research centres? Because of the catastrophic effect which this recommendation, if implemented, would have upon agricultural research and training opportunities in Tasmania, is the Minister prepared to give an assurance on behalf of the Government that the University of Tasmania will not be forced to axe its undergraduate course in agricultural science?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on the issue that Senator Calvert raised. Senator Calvert's question is prompted by one of the recommendations in a draft report circulated recently by the panel undertaking a discipline review of agriculture and related education on behalf of the Commonwealth. The document is, as its name suggests, a draft report. It has been circulated by the panel to higher education institutions offering agricultural and related education and to other interested parties as part of the input into the review process. Comments on the draft will be taken into account in the preparation of the final report which is expected to be completed sometime later this year-in fact, some time in December is the anticipated date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The relevant recommendation seeks to strengthen provisions in the disciplines concerned by designating certain higher education institutions as recognised providers of mainstream agricultural and related education. I am informed that the recommendation does not seek to exclude all other institutions currently in the field, as it is envisaged that these would continue to offer non-mainstream programs and would be encouraged to work closely with the recognised providers. The recommendations would clearly have implications for the structure and funding of higher education and would require careful consideration. However, the Commonwealth will need to await the final report of the discipline review before it would be appropriate to respond to any such proposal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The seventeenth annual report 1989-90 of the Pipeline Authority is an interesting document. It is interesting for a variety of reasons. The first reason relates to why the report is so late in being tabled in the Parliament. I think it was presented in the House of Representatives only yesterday despite the fact that the report is dated 16 October and, as I understand it, reached the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) on something like 17 or 18 October. So there has been a delay of several weeks in tabling this report, despite the fact that the Parliament has been sitting. One can draw only one possible conclusion from that and that is that it was hoped that this report would be tabled after the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill 1990 had been debated in the House of Representatives. In fact, that is the case. The report was not tabled in the House of Representatives until yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government got its timing slightly out of kilter because the debate on that Bill took place last night although the Bill had been introduced before that. That Bill of course went to the whole core of the future of the Pipeline Authority because the Bill was concerned with raising, by an amount of no less than 56 per cent, the haulage charges of the Pipeline Authority over a 12-month period between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 1992 to prepare for sale the assets of the Pipeline Authority. Of course the main asset is the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline. As we now know, the Government took that Bill through the House yesterday, but both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have said that they will be opposing that Bill in the Senate so presumably the sale will not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been the subject of considerable debate and, therefore, the future of the pipeline has been a matter of considerable debate in recent days. The Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, put out a statement yesterday following the Opposition's announced decision to oppose the increase in the haulage charges and, according to the Government-although it is not necessarily the case-thereby putting the end, for the time being, to the sale of the pipeline. He put out a statement yesterday which I find nothing short of extraordinary and which I wish to comment on briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reiterate that the Opposition's decision to oppose the sale of the major asset of the Pipeline Authority was a very simple decision. It was based on a very simple principle, that is, there is a basic requirement of governments to honour their legal contractual commitments. The Government's attempt to do two things- first of all, to break its contractual commitment arrangements so far as the haulage charges of the pipeline are concerned; and, secondly, to try to arrange the sale of the major asset of the Pipeline Authority in such a way as to circumvent a legal first right of refusal agreement that the Pipeline Authority had with the Australian Gas Light Co.-is nothing short of disgraceful. It brings into question the whole integrity of government. If governments are going to play funny games like that with the legal processes of this country, then how can anyone expect there to be confidence in the integrity of government? That is what this issue is all about. </PARA>

It is worth recounting the background to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators may be aware that back in about 1973, because of the discovery of gas up around the Moomba area, the Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL) moved to put a pipeline into Sydney. Of course, Sydney was the major potential user of gas. In stepped the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, the late Mr R. F. X. Connor, and nationalised the pipeline. How did he do it? What the Minister did was to go to AGL and the then Minister for Minerals in New South Wales, Mr Fife, who is in the other place these days, and said to him, `We are taking over the pipeline. We are going to do it by preventing AGL from bringing in pipe to pipe the gas'. </PARA>
<PARA> How does it all read? This was the great dream. I remind honourable senators that the late Mr Connor was the mentor of our current Treasurer, Mr Keating. In fact, Mr Keating has been described in various sectors of the media as being at the knee-I think that was the term used-of Mr Connor. </PARA>

<PARA>The first step involved construction of a pipeline linking...Sydney with the natural gas fields in the Cooper Basin in South Australia, with early extension through Wagga Wagga to Albury and Wodonga, and with ultimate extension-</PARA>
<PARA>listen to this for the wonderful dream; the Government was going to criss-cross Australia with pipelines at the expense of the taxpayers of Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>to Melbourne and the Bass Strait reserves. It was envisaged that the pipeline from the Cooper Basin would later be extended to the Palm Valley field in the Amadeus Basin of the Northern Territory. From there it was to continue to Dampier on the north-west coast of Australia where the resources of the North-west Shelf would be available, and to traverse and serve the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Also a spur was to serve the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I think my colleague, Senator Tambling, is still waiting for that spur line. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In the words of the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 was introduced for the purpose of establishing `an authority with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of Australia's natural resources available to the Australian people'. </PARA>
<PARA>I recount that because we may be seeing the end of something that started out as one of those great dreams-the Taj Mahal of Australia; the sort of socialist nonsense that pervaded the country in those days under the guise of nationalism. I draw that to the attention of honourable senators because moves are now afoot to sell it. As mentioned by my colleague, Senator Short, the method the Government wishes to use to sell it is to get the consumers of the gas to pay the subsidy on which they will collect the capital for the sale of that pipeline which should never have been nationalised in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of my colleagues Senator Short and Senator Parer concerning the now aborted proposed sale of the pipeline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting that Mr Heinrich of the assets sale unit appeared before Estimates Committee A. Indeed, over a long and protracted period, in an attempt to get answers from Mr Heinrich, it finally emerged that the idea that if one simply increased the haulage costs one could get a greater price for the pipeline had emanated from that source. The idea that the Government could sell the assets of the Authority and not the Authority itself was part of the overall scheme to avoid the legal responsibilities which the Authority had entered into when it took over the building of the pipeline from AGL back in 1974. That negotiation was renegotiated in 1985. The heads of agreement which were to constitute the pipeline system's deed-they have never been executed; nonetheless the parties have operated in pursuance of the heads of agreement as if the deed had gone ahead-meant that the intention of the legal rights which AGL has ought properly to be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> The cynical way in which the Government has created this scheme to bypass its legal obligations simply to produce artificially a higher price in no way took into consideration the sorts of things raised by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, such as the impact the increased cost of gas would have on production in New South Wales, and whether one of the major users of natural gas in New South Wales would continue to manufacture the product it uses the gas for in Australia or would look at the proposition of moving offshore. The Pipeline Authority purported to say that it had used the services of a consultant to determine that the increase in haulage prices would not result in a reduction in the volume of gas sold but as recently as today I received, as have some of my colleagues, a letter from Santos Ltd casting doubt over the ability of the consultant used to provide the sort of statistical information which the Pipeline Authority would have needed to work out its calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a sordid and sorry affair. It is probably not very usual that I would agree with a member of the lower House, Mr Frank Walker, on very many things. But on this occasion I think the words that he used-he described this exercise as grubby and said that he was ashamed to be associated with a government that would enter into such a grubby exercise-are sentiments with which I certainly can agree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Committee of Privileges into asbestos in Royal Australian Navy ships found that the Navy had not deliberately misled the Parliament. From the evidence which was given to the Committee and included in this report, it appears that is probably the case and I accept the Committee's finding. But the fact remains that the Parliament was misled, even though not perhaps deliberately. The Navy claims that its reply to my Estimates question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . was not inaccurate in any material respect; nor should the reply have led to any misleading conclusions being taken. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, that is an amazing statement, to say the least. The Navy told the Estimates Committee that it had introduced preventative measures in 1966 for asbestos, after research in the mid 1960s in the United Kingdom had pointed out the relationship between asbestos and certain diseases. What else was the Senate to assume-it could only be assumed that it was in the 1960s when the Navy first knew of this problem and thus took action. Yet its own submission to the Privileges Committee acknowledges that it has two files on the matter-apparently it could not find that until after I produced the documents to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> One file-file No. 177/51/39-was located in the Sydney regional office of the Navy. Another file-file No. N8411678-was found in the Canberra Navy Office. These files contained the documents that I presented to the Senate; that Senator Ray in this place told us did not exist in Navy files. The 1943 study at the Naval Dockyard, Williamstown in Victoria told us about the problems of inhaling asbestos dust, the danger, the need for ventilation and the need for respirators. It even talked about the possibility that one could get an asbestos related disease in a very short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was a 1972 letter from the Department of the Navy to the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union agreeing that there was a health risk in handling asbestos and that this had been recognised by the Department since at least 1943 when that study I previously referred to was undertaken in Victoria. The letter also acknowledged that the safety instructions in 1972 had their beginnings in that 1943 test, had been constantly under review and had been considered satisfactory. So clearly, the Navy had known of the dangers of asbestos since 1943. The fact that the sum of knowledge about asbestos had increased since 1943 is immaterial. Yet, part of the Navy submission is based on that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navy's submission to the Privileges Committee demonstrates that not only was the Senate misinformed; so also was the Chief of the Naval Staff. The submission quotes from a source document which had recently been prepared for the Chief of the Naval Staff. Unfortunately, the entire document was not tendered to the Privileges Committee. One wonders why? I put it publicly on the record now that I feel that the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) should make that document available to the Senate. It is suspicious that only parts of that document were quoted from before the Privileges Committee. One of the quotes was:</PARA>
<PARA>While the hazards of asbestosis were known in relation to continuous work with this material in asbestos factories and mines in 1943, the intermittent nature of the work with asbestos throughout the world was in 1943 considered essentially safe. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true because the documents I have referred to make it clear that they knew it was not essentially safe, certainly in the Williamstown dockyard. The Navy's own files demonstrated that. I cannot understand the answer they gave to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navy claims that the answer to the Estimates Committee was compiled in an hour. One has to ask why was such an important answer given such a short time to be compiled. But even putting that aside, the person who wrote the briefing note for the Chief of Naval Staff presumably had more than an hour, yet produced an inaccurate document. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a nit-picking exercise. It is an important issue, and a particularly important occupational health and safety matter for those who have served in the Royal Australian Navy. I suspect that the briefing note was done in response to the announcement by the late Sir David Martin of his doctor's diagnosis of mesothelioma. But many other people throughout this country who are much less well known than Sir David Martin have been affected.</PARA>
<PARA> The Navy's submission claims that the documents I produced do not support the claims that the Navy `knew about the dangers of asbestos prior to the 1960s' in so far as those dangers were relevant to dockyard workers, and this attempt to obscure the issue is quite unacceptable. In fact, I find that the letter from the Secretary to the Department and Vice-Admiral Hudson to the Committee is disappointing in that they have claimed that neither the Navy nor the Department misled the Parliament in any material respect. Their submission does not satisfy me. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are, first, that the Navy was aware of the health dangers from asbestos from at least 1943. Secondly, the Navy does have files on the subject which confirm this fact. Thirdly, the Navy did give the impression to the Senate that measures were introduced in the 1960s as a result of the knowledge that had come from the United Kingdom and in so doing gave the impression that this was the first time it became aware of the dangers. Fourthly, the Navy also misled its Chief of Naval Staff in its briefing note, and one wonders whether it has also misled the Government on this issue. Fifthly, the Navy claims that from 1968 it put preventive measures in place and enclosed them in the submission to the Privileges Committee. Yet I have statements here which make it quite clear that regardless of what safety precautions may or may not have been written-and they are here-as late as 1977-78, these precautions were not being followed at least on the refit of HMAS Brisbane. I quickly read some excerpts from statements I have received from former sailors. James Lawrence Kenna said:</PARA>
<PARA>During the course of the refit asbestos was stripped out of the ship. We used to wear masks and used plastic bags to put the asbestos in and the asbestos was then thrown in the rubbish. Other people would be in the area while we were getting the asbestos out doing their normal jobs and they would sometimes have a mask on and sometimes would not depending on what they were doing. The safety precautions in this regard were extremely cavalier. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I recall that we were sent for chest x-rays when we were all on the Brisbane at Garden Island Naval Dockyard and this was an unusual move. I assumed at the time it was something to do with the asbestos but I never really found out for sure. </PARA>
<PARA>Steven Thomas Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA>Asbestos was removed and no safety precautions were given to us at all for the removal of that asbestos except a small face mask. The persons actually removing the asbestos were given the face mask but there may have been 15 or 20 other men in the compartment and the dust was very very thick. They were given no protection at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Garry Roland Wilson said:</PARA>
<PARA>The asbestos was removed by naval personnel wearing masks but while this was being done the compartment was full of other sailors who had no protective gear whatsoever. The dust was extremely thick and lingered in the air for many days. The Garden Island Naval Dockyard personnel refused to work in the areas whilst delagging was being done and refused to remove the asbestos. They would actually leave the compartment while the asbestos was being removed. </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders whether those men, some of whom had an x-ray when they were doing the refit, were given the full plate chest x-rays annually that they were supposed to have been given after their exposure to asbestos. One wonders why some were working without respirators in confined spaces. One also wonders why the people were not kept to a minimum in compartments where asbestos was being stripped as required by the written regulations, and why some of the junior sailors were living on board the ship while asbestos was being removed from that ship, once again in contravention of those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Navy to take the whole issue of asbestos seriously enough, whether by the enforcing of its own regulations, by the information available to the Chief of the Naval Staff and possibly to the Government, by answer made to the Parliament and by the self-incriminatory submission made to the Privileges Committee, places the Navy in a disappointing light, to say the least. It does not seem to be too concerned for the operational health and safety of its members. Why has that refit not been investigated by the Government, as I have repeatedly requested? Why have these former naval personnel not been contacted? The issue is too serious to be smoothed over. It will not go away. The Parliament and the people are not being adequately informed; and they have a right to know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, for your benefit and for that of Senator Richardson, I do not know how long we will be. I do not intend to speak for nearly as long as Senator Richardson would expect me to. I know that Senator Crane will speak. Senator O'Chee will also speak-he says that he will also be brief. Therefore, this discussion may not take as long as might have been anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have only two aspects to query. I am not sure which I should deal with first but as they both come under environmental planning, I guess it does not matter. I will start with the one that Senator Richardson, no doubt, is expecting: the question of the grants and loans made to the Ravenshoe Mill to Plywoods and Plastics Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Estimates Committee and subsequently, Senator Richardson indicated that he had received a report from the receivers of Plywoods and Plastics Pty Ltd. Throughout the Estimates Committee hearing both Senator Richardson and his advisers indicated that they could not make any commitments, could not make any further statements or could not answer questions implicitly until they received this report. A lot of emphasis was placed on the fact that the answers we sought in the Estimates Committee C would not be available until this report was received. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was subsequently received. We have been given little pieces of it. Indications were given to the Estimates Committee-in fairness, I will say that it was not an absolute undertaking-that the report would be made available providing there was no commercial in confidence stuff in it or other things that would make it confidential. The Minister has indicated subsequently in answers to questions in this chamber and questions on notice that he has not been in a position to make that report publicly available because further actions were likely to come as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to raise with the Minister whether it is possible for us and the Committee of the Whole to look at that report at this stage. I also want to raise with the Minister the current state of the results that flow from that report. I understand from the Minister's answers that the matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department. That was several weeks, if not a month, ago. I know the Attorney-General's Department is very efficient. I wonder what progress has been made; where we have got to; and what action has been recommended, if any. Most importantly, I wonder whether a further inquiry might need to be instituted into events surrounding the giving of government moneys and loans to that mill; whether the moneys were used as they were supposed to be used; whether they were used at Ravenshoe as was intended or whether they have been used elsewhere; whether there were any criminal act or criminal actions engaged in by others; and what proceedings have resulted from those actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the same reasons that I did not release the report before, I still cannot. To do so would prejudice Commonwealth action. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories last corresponded with the Attorney-General's Department on this matter on 2 November. We do not have any response yet from the Attorney-General's Department, but clearly there is action contemplated. I have no problem with the eventual release of the report at a time when Attorney-General's tells us it is not likely to prejudice any action the Commonwealth might take. I am not in a position to give the honourable senator an idea of when that will be. I had hoped that we would get advice from the Attorney-General's Department shortly about what action it believes the Commonwealth should take, but we have not received that as yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Allegations have been made by many people that the money was not well spent at Ravenshoe and was, in fact, used in other places. Obviously that is, at least in part, covered by this report. That is what Attorney-General's is looking at now. We are just going to have to wait for that. We have asked the Attorney-General's Department to be as quick as it can in responding to us, and I would hope to have some sort of response within a matter of weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise another question with some hesitation because eventually I am going to get a definitive answer of no. But so far I have not and that leads me to live in hope that the matter is not yet completely closed. I again raise the matter which concerns me most, although the other things and the misspending of Government money are matters of concern in a very general way which we, as custodians of taxpayers' money, should be interested in, as I am. The thing that concerns me most-I am aware that it concerns Senator Richardson as well-is the money that was lent commercially by the business folk of Ravenshoe and elsewhere in north Queensland to the company in the expectation and on the understanding that, as a result of World Heritage listing, the Government was going to advance money to subsidise the company, to make grants for a 10-year period, to make sure that the mill was able to keep going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept that the Government did that in good faith, but I ask the Minister to accept-I think he does accept it-that in a non-legal but certainly very understandable way, the people of Ravenshoe gave credit to that mill because they believed that the Government would be funding it for the next 10 years. `Funding' is the wrong word, but I use it in a very broad sense. They did not even think that there would be problems in lending that money. The Government is not legally liable to pick up the bill-I acknowledge that-but I do say that these people have lost money by believing that the Government was going to be advancing money over a 10-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise the point that if some companies lose $30,000 or $40,000 they can pick it up; it is just bad luck and a part of commercial reality these days. But when a small businessman whose only livelihood is this one entity in town lends $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000-or gives credit to that extent expecting it to be paid in 30 days-and does not get it back, he never really recovers. As I have said many times-the Minister is probably getting sick of hearing it-there are 12 families whose lives have been shattered, not really through any fault of their own; just because they believed the Government was going to be there for 10 years. I do not blame the Government for not being there for 10 years. I understand what has happened but, by the same token, it is not the fault of these people. Their lives have been shattered and ruined. Their children go to school there and now they have to move away. They cannot sell their houses in Ravenshoe because there is no-one who would buy them at a realistic price. So this has been an enormously traumatic experience. </PARA>
<PARA> This happens everywhere and I acknowledge that the Government cannot pick up every bankrupt person who lent money unwisely, but I continue to emphasise that this is a particular one-off situation. It is unique and it is unusual. It arose out of a whole series of events. There is no point in going back over these, but they were world media events. Even in London people knew what was happening, as well as all over Australia. It all got tied up in the history of the time. This is a flow-on. It is one of those things where I think nobody is at fault but someone has suffered-some 12 or so families have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I ask the Minister whether the matter is still being looked at. Has a submission been made, as the Minister generously said he would, to the current Minister? I know that money is tight but, in the overall course of things, with a Budget of $38 billion the amount involved here seems fairly small, particularly when money is given away in what appears to be a liberal way elsewhere. Can the Minister tell me where that submission is at, where we are going, and whether the door is finally closed yet. </PARA>

After all those traumatic times, we sat down to draw up a package for north Queensland to ensure employment for people and obviously we had to rely upon the good will, indeed the good intent, upon the bona fides of those to whom we were giving money. It was always the case that we were going to give millions of dollars to that mill, and we relied upon the company to use it wisely and properly. If that has not occurred, Senator Macdonald is quite right in saying that, legally, the Commonwealth has no obligation. I might say that we never gave a hint, either, that we would be responsible for the company's operations. People may have interpreted it that way, but I think I can be certain in saying that all the Commonwealth ever did was say, `We will provide money to re-equip the mill, to retool it so that it can take on a pine resource and keep employing at least 40 people'. That was the real promise and we kept it. A funny thing happened on the way to the timber yard and it did not remain in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I probably agree with him that if we relive those days and if the person who threw the punch and almost hit the Minister had hit the Minister's companion, Mr Gayler, we might all have been better off. I am not a violent person, but I guess that the Minister and I are on very common ground on that aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take no issue with anything that the Minister said. I agree with all the points he has raised. If it is of assistance, I will try to find some words or some scheme which cannot let this be a precedent for the future. I fully understand that point. If it were treated as a precedent it would be a horrific one. I have tried to emphasise that this is a very special situation which evolved through a series of unique events that occurred over a period. It is different; it is not a usual situation; it is a one-off situation. There will never be another World Heritage listing battle of the type that went on in Ravenshoe nor will there ever be the sorts of compensation, packages, adjustments and government sympathy that followed from all of that. If I can find and use words that will not let that be a precedent, I will be only too happy to do so. If that will assist in the project, we will all be far better off. I will progress to the other matter I wish to raise very briefly. </PARA>

Has any representation been made to the Department about the possibility of creating a joint venture project or a cooperative project to run the mill and take it over from the receivers with the effect of the unsecured creditors of the mill becoming shareholders of the mill in some sort of joint venture project with the Commonwealth Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to ask the Minister any more questions about that at the moment. I accept his very generous undertaking to come back to me. I would like the opportunity to put a few comments on the record, perhaps for Senator Richardson and Mrs Kelly to consider during their deliberations on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has intimated that one of his concerns is the danger that giving the money to the unsecured creditors might create a precedent. It appears to me that the possibility of a joint venture scheme could alleviate that set of circumstances. It would not in effect mean that the Commonwealth was doling out money to unsecured creditors of a mill for which the Commonwealth claimed it has no responsibility. The unsecured creditors would be turned into shareholders of the mill at no expense to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it and as has been intimated to me, the scheme would involve some sort of equity injection by the Commonwealth. This would be in the form of money needed to purchase the mill at `for sale' value from the receivers should no other purchaser be found. I hasten to stress the words `should no other purchaser be found'. The idea is that this would be a scheme of last resort. That would mean that the Commonwealth would have not a second or third ranking mortgage debenture but a real equity stake in the scheme. The unsecured creditors would have their debts cleared as their debts would be turned into equity capital in the company as well. I understand that it is suggested that the amount of unsecured debt would be roughly 50 per cent of the total equity capital of the joint venture company. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this would have a very good chance of success at face value because all of the traditional suppliers of the mill would have a vested interest in ensuring that the mill was supplied with necessary raw materials at very competitive prices. Because the costings for the mill would be lower this would ultimately improve the possible viability of the mill over a long period. That is a very exciting prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> The other suggestion that has been made about this-I am not sure whether it has been included in the proposal-is the possibility that the Commonwealth's equity stake in the mill could be available for redemption, that is, purchased back by the company or be available for sale to other unsecured creditors in various tranches over a period. This would also ensure that the Commonwealth had some realistic prospect of getting back its equity stake. When the Commonwealth looks at it, that is also very important. The other suggestion raised-I am not sure whether it is included in the proposal-is that, under another variation on this scheme, some of the Commonwealth loan money might be repaid on the proviso that the Commonwealth continue under the provisions of the assistance package to make operational maintenance subsidies over a period. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress the point that nobody wants to see the mill close. It would be remiss of anybody to suggest that that was the case. We want the mill to continue to be a viable ongoing concern. If nobody else can be found to purchase the mill because of whatever circumstances, there is a corps of very dedicated and enthusiastic people there who have a very real stake in the future of Ravenshoe and in the future of the mill. The joint venture scheme, as it has been outlined to me, gives substantial possibilities for those creditors ultimately to recoup their money and have an ongoing interest. It gives the Commonwealth a very real chance to make good its pledges, along with the necessary new plantations as originally announced in 1987. All of these things combined would make both the mill and the town of Ravenshoe very viable concerns. I would be very grateful to the Minister for any representations he makes to the Minister responsible, Mrs Kelly, on behalf of the people of north Queensland and of Ravenshoe to see whether it is possible for the Commonwealth to take this up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not rule out what Senator O'Chee is saying. Obviously, it is very difficult to comment on a proposal that I have not seen. I do not know how viable the proposal is. I believe that the Commonwealth ought to look at anything that can possibly achieve two objectives. The first objective would be to make sure that the Commonwealth gets some return, if at all possible, and the second objective would be to keep the mill going. Given the trials and tribulations of Ravenshoe, the Commonwealth ought to do all in its power to make sure that it does. I will certainly be raising my voice and putting my weight behind it, not in any form of political thuggery but with gentle persuasion, to see whether--</PARA></TALK.START>

I will do my very best to bring the matter forward and I hope that we will find some solution along those lines. However, I cannot walk away from saying that the Commonwealth must guard against precedents which will open the doors for us and for future governments. We will be judged on that. So I must at least have that rider on it because I have not seen the proposal and I am not sure of its details. But we will see what we can do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I appreciate Senator Richardson's concerns about creating precedents. I reiterate that the Commonwealth would not be making any money available to unsecured creditors. Under a joint venture scheme, as I understand it, the Commonwealth would have a 50 per cent equity stake in the mill. That would alleviate the possibility of creating a precedent because, especially under one of the possibilities of the scheme that was outlined to me, that equity stake would be redeemable. Therefore, there is a possibility of the Commonwealth actually getting a return in addition to profits that accrue over a period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope I am not speaking out of turn on behalf of the people of Ravenshoe, but I am sure that everybody in Ravenshoe would accept the fact that, if the Commonwealth came to the party on a joint venture scheme, the people of Ravenshoe would be very much on their own and there would be no further recourse because, ultimately, the mill would then be in their hands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to move to another matter, but before doing that I want to say that, whilst I agree with Senator O'Chee that anything should be done that might help, we should not lose sight of the real issues concerning the Ravenshoe mill. One is, I think, to keep the mill operating in whatever way is possible. The other one concerns compensation for those people who have lost money as a credit. I have looked at some of the proposals that Senator O'Chee has raised. If they do not find favour with the Government, I would not like the Government to use a rejection there as a rejection of the real issue, which is continuing the mill and in some way finding a solution to the problem of providing compensation to those people who have lost their money. If the cooperative is the solution-I have some suspicions about cooperatives-well and good. But if it is not, it should not be used as an excuse for an overall rejection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other matter I wanted to raise came up on 18 September at an Estimates Committee hearing. It related generally to grants made by the Government to a series of organisations, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Environment Centre of the Northern Territory, the Conservation Council of the South-East Region and Canberra, the Tantawangalo Catchment Protection Group and others. I understood from the answers given in the Estimates Committee hearing that the Government makes a large series of grants every year to various groups in various fields, such as sport and the arts. At the time I was particularly interested in the ones in the environmental field. I asked quite a number of questions, most of which were answered, and I have received answers in writing from the Minister and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to most of the queries that I raised. </PARA>
<PARA> The point which I want to mention briefly in this Committee of the Whole relates to accountability for the grants that are made. An amount of $267,000 was given to the Australian Conservation Foundation last year-and I suspect that a lot of money has been given in other years. In passing, I might say that that $267,000 is more than is needed to save the 12 families at Ravenshoe, but that is an aside. I understand from the Estimates Committee hearings that this amount of money was given for education programs. I wonder whether those organisations are ever accountable to the Government for that money. I understood from the answers that I received at the Estimates Committee hearing-and perhaps I misunderstood them-that there really was not any accounting back. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I want to make sure of what that procedure is. I would think that, where large sums of money are given and granted to, in this case, voluntary organisations, we must make sure-as we found out in these other matters that I have been talking about-that those moneys are spent for the purposes for which they have been given. My query is: Do we get back some fairly extensive details of how these moneys are spent? Are those details justified? Do we get receipts, airline tickets, et cetera? If so, are those details available for public scrutiny by the Senate or anyone else?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The grants that we make are primarily for administrative costs-salaries, office accommodation, telephones, that kind of thing. Sometimes we make them so that we can help with conference attendance, legal advice or perhaps research projects but, whatever the purpose, there are a number of criteria which the organisation must fulfil. The organisation must be a non-profit organisation. It must be properly constituted and it must be open in membership to any interested person. Most importantly, it must provide audited accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as I am aware, the audited accounts of all of these organisations are public documents. They are available in the annual reports of those organisations. So we do make sure that whatever the Commonwealth has put in has been acquitted at the end of the day and I think we are satisfied that the money is being spent for the purposes for which it was given. It ought to be noted that, while $267,000 is a lot of money, it is only a fraction of what the Australian Conservation Foundation will spend and raise from its own membership and sponsors.  It is not as if we are the sole providers of funds for these organisations. They have methods of getting funding from other sources. Certainly, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is diligent in ensuring that audited accounts are provided. If an organisation could not provide them, it would not get any more money. So there is a fair incentive to keep up the audited accounts. </PARA>

The Department's performance is subject to political audit here and, if it was to fail, we would know all about it. The Auditor-General closely examines the Department's accounts and affairs, as we have seen today, and he would also take up the matter if the Department was slack in some way in this. I am not aware that we have ever had a complaint. Apparently, we have had a complaint on the cultural side with regard to grants, but not on the conservation side. I am sure that all of the reports that Senator Macdonald wants are available in the Parliamentary Library. If he has any difficulties in obtaining them, he should let me know and I will make them available.</PARA></TALK.START>

Two of my questions have been answered by the Minister's previous answer so I will not pursue them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I outlined in response to Senator Macdonald's question the kinds of things that these recurrent grants are given for-administrative costs, telephones, office accommodation et cetera. But from time to time the Government will make a grant to a conservation organisation for very different purposes. I can recall $100,000 being made available to conservation groups to help them present evidence to the Helsham inquiry. Recently, the Government made a decision to give grants to a number of conservation bodies-I am not sure whether this just involved the Australian Conservation Foundation; I suspect that there were more involved than just that group-to assist them in providing a case to the Resource Assessment Commission on Coronation Hill and the conservation zone in Kakadu. Those grants are for a very different purpose. They are not regular and sometimes they are quite large. But they are always announced; they have not been a secret. In fact, what I have just said turns out to be the answer. The $256,000 is payment for submissions to the Resource Assessment Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

If they are big campaigns, we call for expressions of interest from advertising agencies and then a ministerial committee interviews the interested agencies. At that point we make a decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reserved two matters from the Department of Community Services and Health for mention in the Committee of the Whole. I would like to raise them seriatim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first concerns the Medicare system. It is a very unusual system. Charges are raised by individual medical practitioners following consultations with individual patients, and the money is then paid by Government per the Health Insurance Commission. It obviously is predicated upon the honest operation of the system by the medical practitioners involved. Therefore, as a doctor, I am very sensitive to any information which comes my way which suggests that members of my profession-and it is a minority of people-are in any way misusing the system. I have become aware from an impeccable source, which is not appropriate to identify here, and also by reading some of the reports of medical board proceedings that some medical practitioners have been sleeping with their patients and then claiming a Medicare rebate for that attendance. That is highly unprofessional conduct but that is a question for the medical board. My concern is that as the law stands, if the attendance is one which is a professional attendance, as it is defined, given by a registered person, it is necessary that a Medicare benefit be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The present law is obviously defective in this small area. It has become apparent recently and it needs to change. A process has been put in train by the Department, a process with which I completely concur. I have had some very helpful letters from the First Assistant Secretary of the Health Care Access Division, Mr NcNeil, on this matter. It seems that the Department has set up some discussions between itself, the Health Insurance Commission and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in an attempt to settle some amendment to the relevant section of the Act to overcome this problem. The problem then is that it requires the redefinition of the words `professional service'. It may require their redefinition in a certain way, and the Department has proposed that they should be redefined in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a medical service to which an item relates, being any medical examination, treatment, or test that is appropriate and reasonably necessary for the adequate management of the patient's medical condition that is rendered by or on behalf of a medical practitioner . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That would add the extra test, as it were, that it was appropriate and reasonably necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that the AMA has had some concern about the implication of that change. The last letter I had from Mr McNeil dated 31 October included a letter from the Assistant Secretary General of the AMA, Mr W. Coote, to Mr Col Bailey of the Medicare Benefits Branch, in which he identified that the AMA had some continuing difficulties with the proposal as to what it might mean. But he did say this:</PARA>
<PARA>On the face of it, the proposal gives to the Health Insurance Commission the discretion to make a judgment that services are `appropriate', `reasonable', et cetera before paying Medicare benefits. This would appear to be a substantial departure from the existing presumed entitlement to the payment of Medicare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Although he was more or less cooperative in his approach, he said that the matter would have to be referred further to the AMA. </PARA>
<PARA> All I want from the Minister, who was present during the examinations so he knows the matter which I am talking about, is his agreement, if he is willing to give it, that the situation that is now revealed is really an unacceptable one, because it is quite clear that there is a weakness in it. I would like his agreement that it is desirable that we pursue that process of consultation-the one I have just described involving the three main parties-and that we achieve as a result of that consultation an amendment to the relevant section of the Act. That is what is really required. The third thing I hope the Minister can give us is a commitment that this will be achieved within a fairly rapid time, because I think this is a loophole that should be closed off quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Government is in favour of consultation, and I believe that the tripartite consultations that Senator Baume envisages would appeal to the Government. Indeed, I understand that consultations certainly with the Australian Medical Association (AMA) are under way in relation to this whole question. The further composition of the group which might engage in the consultations would, I am sure, commend itself to the Government and I can give an undertaking that that will be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether that will lead to an amendment, and certainly an amendment to be put through the Parliament in a reasonably short space of time, I am not sure that I can give that categorical undertaking but certainly if a matter is revealed which requires a legislative remedy, then it would be the Government's intention to pursue that remedy. I would myself have misgivings about giving undertakings as to the time in which that might be done because of the tremendous pressure on the legislative program. However, no doubt if it is as urgent a matter as Senator Baume indicates in raising it in the Committee of the Whole, I am sure that in itself would be a factor which would enable it to be argued in the parliamentary business committee that if the legislative remedy is required it be brought forward as soon as possible. I will bring Senator Baume's remarks to the attention of the Minister. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.33)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and I can really ask for no more than that. He will understand that the vast majority of members of the medical profession want to see a system that is absolutely above criticism if they are going to have to participate in it, and that many members of the profession would support the Government in action if it were taken in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I referred to in my letter of reservations was my concern about the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the Department of Community Services and Health. If the Commonwealth has determined that it will require certain steps to be undertaken by drug companies before they can market pharmaceuticals in Australia, if the Government has then laid down what those processes shall be, and as they are regarded as being among the most stringent in the world, it is incumbent upon the Government to assess those drugs, to assess the applications, to do it expeditiously and to meet its side of the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not meeting its side of the bargain and the Therapeutic Goods Administration is failing to discharge its duty. That is the difficulty. It is failing to give fair dealing to the pharmaceutical industry. If it wants to carry out its assessments and reject applications it may do so, but what we have had to deal with is a series of problems. The first is that the Therapeutic Goods Administration cannot recruit people to do its work, and at Estimates examination after Estimates examination, it was revealed to us that the establishment has many unfilled positions. If the Government cannot fill the positions, the Government must stand at fault. If it cannot pay market rates, it has got to find some other way to attract people to these jobs, because the Government has an obligation to carry out its side of the regulatory process. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three parts of the regulatory process. One of them relates to clinical assessment of whether the particular drugs are any good-whether they do anything; whether they are safe; whether there is evidence to support claims for their efficacy and so on. It is quite apparent that the Therapeutic Goods Administration is failing in this area and failing lamentably. I believe I am correct in saying that there was a very senior review of the whole Therapeutic Goods Administration area two or three years ago which recommended major changes to this part of the Department. They may have been implemented, but it still does not work. Not only that, but when we questioned the Therapeutic Goods Administration we discovered two other quite alarming matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that this country has entered into some arrangements with Sweden. The purpose of these arrangements was to allow us to use Swedish information and to allow the Swedish Government to use our information, thereby hopefully advancing and quickening the approval or non-approval of therapeutic drugs. It turns out that the Swedish Government has been using our assessments, but certainly in the area of clinical trials we have not been using the Swedish ones. The evidence we were given from the officers at the Estimates examination is that they do not regard the Swedish data as adequate for our purposes. That is simply not good enough. On the one hand they cannot get enough officers to assess and process the applications and on the other hand they have an agreement with Sweden which they will not use because they do not like Swedish standards. It is up to the Government as the policy making body to knock a few heads together and to give some instructions or possibly to reconstruct the whole division and the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing that alarmed me was that when at the Estimates meeting I asked some questions about the length of time which it took to process applications, I received an answer from the Department which was vastly different from the answer I received from the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (APMA). So being a reasonable person I then asked the officers to go away and try to reconcile the two sets of figures. I have received a very courteous letter from Mr Peter Pflaum, the National Manager of Therapeutic Goods Administration. By the way, when I was Minister of that Department, I had high regard for Mr Pflaum and I imagine I still do. It does not mean that the area over which he presides is operating well because it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> It turns out that the processing time which the officers gave was for a favourable three-month period during 1990, that they had omitted an unfavourable processing time over the summer of 1989-90, and that the APMA had been using the processing time for 272 drugs between 1981 and 1989. The differences between their figures were quite marked. The APMA believed that it took 14.4 weeks between the receipt of a general marketing application and a decision on its acceptability for further processing-not approval, but just its acceptability to go on to someone's desk to be approved. The average time between 1981 and 1989 was 14.4 weeks. If that were done in business, those concerned would be out of business. I could not obtain any kind of justification. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now says that the average time taken during a particular three-month period selected during this year was 36 working days. The only other comment there is that, when we asked about the target times which the Therapeutic Goods Administration had set, it turns out that not one of them is being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> First, let us congratulate the Therapeutic Goods Administration on setting some target times, times to which people will work, but let us acknowledge that it is not meeting one of them. How are companies supposed to operate in this country if they cannot even have their applications accepted or dealt with? I raise the case of one company which had its application sent back four times before it was accepted for further processing, and on each occasion for different reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is this: does the Government agree that there is an obligation, if we are to have a stringent system of evaluation for therapeutic goods, that the Government should deliver on its side? That means delivering on the processes and within reasonable time. If it is now clear that the Therapeutic Goods Administration is incapable, at least as to part of its administration, of delivering in this way, will the Government undertake to look at the matter and possibly to reform the whole area?</PARA>
</SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume has pointed to some real difficulties in the processing times achieved in the area of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. He has correctly pointed to the fact that one of the major impediments to the processing is the difficulty of recruiting suitably qualified medical officers. I believe that he has been given a paper setting out the vacancies position and the very great problems in attracting persons with sufficient qualifications with a real interest in this sort of area of medical practice. That has to be acknowledged and it is a real difficulty. I do not know whether it fluctuates with the marketplace for the services of properly qualified medical officers. I suppose that it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through the various Estimates committees one is aware as to how the market fluctuates. For example, in my own area it was quite clear a couple of years ago that it was proving extremely difficult for the National Companies and Securities Commission to attract properly qualified legal people and those with accounting expertise to the service of that Commission at a time when the marketplace was offering a huge differential and better salaries. Now that the downturn is under way, we are finding that we are able to hold and recruit very high quality people in those areas. It may be that there have been similar fluctuations in the marketplace in relation to suitably qualified medical officers. The Government is very aware of that problem and has attempted to make attractive offers within certain limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that I have to correct one impression that Senator Peter Baume unfortunately may have given. The figure of 14.4 weeks between lodgment and decision on acceptability of an application which was provided by the manufacturers was truly an average of experience with applications between 1981 and 1989. Senator Peter Baume then referred to the fact that he had been provided with figures which indicated that in the quarter March to May this year a figure of 7.1 weeks was the delay period. The choice of language by Senator Peter Baume may have given the impression that that had been somewhat arbitrarily selected by the Department as being a quarter which would produce the best figures. In fact, it is the latest quarter, I am advised, for which figures are available, and therefore gives a proper indication of the stage the Department area responsible had reached in the latest quarter for which statistics are available. Indeed, in the previous quarter there had been a more extensive delay, and that has been thought to be able to be attributed to the sudden influx in applications in anticipation of the introduction of fees. I think that is a good commonsense explanation, but I reiterate that the latest figures available indicate that 7.1 weeks is the delay period. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying that that means that everything is satisfactory. Indeed, I think that Senator Peter Baume has raised a point which I also think ought to be pursued, that is, the recognition of overseas clinical trials which are undertaken by a reputable authority whose certification, backed up possibly by the government of the country concerned, can be accepted as being a certification of sufficient integrity. In so far as that might be an aid or supplement to the work of the Australian authorities, I think it probably should be looked at. But it would be a matter for the policy Minister and to that extent it would be beyond my competence to give any undertakings as sought by Senator Peter Baume in relation to the recognition of those overseas trials, for example, in Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the matters Senator Peter Baume has raised are of concern to the Government. The Minister is very conscious of the delays. There is a partnership in this matter which has to be recognised. We hope that the sorts of figures which are emerging of an improved rate of dealing with applications will be continued into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national Aboriginal health strategy represents a new commitment to cooperation by all governments-Commonwealth, State and Territory-and Aboriginal communities to work together to address the unacceptably low level of health experience by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The recommendations contained in the strategy were considered by a development group established by Commonwealth and State Ministers to advise on structural arrangements for dealing with Aboriginal health matters recommended in the strategy and to develop areas for early action. That is a general description of the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am told that in relation to that strategy no decision has yet been taken on funding, and that is why one does not find an appropriation. The formal endorsement of the 21 major recommendations put forward by the development group occurred, I am advised, on 10 June 1990. That tripartite strategy between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and various governments-Commonwealth, States and Territories-is a matter of great concern. The parameters for implementing that strategy and the way in which it will require appropriations of moneys are matters still to be taken either in the supplementary Budget or the full Budget process next year. I understand that the national Aboriginal health strategy generally is intended to be funded on a 50:50 cost-shared basis.

I think the Department got my question a bit mixed up, or I may not have made it clear. What I really wanted to know was the difference between the March determination and the August determination. If we could have a copy of the March one, since we have a copy of the August one, we could do it ourselves. The August determination made pursuant to paragraph 98(C)(1)(b) of the National Health Act 1953 requires users of the compulsory transmission scheme to record an identifier for general patients. What I am interested to know is what is the compliance rate by pharmacists with regard to this requirement. Would failure to comply with this requirement mean that a pharmacist could be suspended from using the CTS system for six months? Would a suspension mean that a pharmacist would not be able to make claims?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to Senator Patterson's request to be provided with the determination of 16 March under section 98(C)(1)(b), that can be provided and will be provided as soon as it can be transmitted to her office. Secondly, she asked what is the compliance rate with the determination of 1 August and what consequences follow from non-compliance. Senator Patterson will be delighted to know that the officers here indicate that compliance has been 100 per cent and therefore the question she raised has not been a practical problem. But I certainly undertake to give her in writing an answer as to the consequences that could follow should there be non-compliance by a pharmacist. It is a proper question, but there is no urgency on the ground as compliance has apparently been very forthcoming.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the written answer to my question about changes to the determination it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>These rules (originally CTS rules) were a disallowable instrument. In due course they were examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which requested some changes. After the changes were made the Rules were not disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>It seemed to me that those original rules were brought in under section 99AAA of the National Health Act 1953. I may have got the sequence of this incorrectly and I would appreciate it if the Department could enlighten me, but the March set of determinations seemed to have been brought in under paragraph 98(C)(1)(b) which does not require those determinations to be tabled and under which they are not disallowable. At page 410 of Estimates Committee C hearings I asked Ms Ford about the August set of determinations, which revoked the March set, and how pharmacists were to know about them-I would like the Minister to look at these determinations because they have quite serious implications for pharmacists-and she replied:</PARA>
<PARA>The determinations that I sign are published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA>Then when I read the written answers from the Department they state:</PARA>
<PARA>The determination is neither gazetted or tabled as this is not required by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like the Department to clarify for me which of those is true. On the one hand, Ms Ford is telling me that they are gazetted and, on the other hand, the written answer is that they are not gazetted or tabled. As it is important that pharmacists know, I would like to know what really does happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two questions here: firstly, are the determinations required to be tabled; and, secondly, are they disallowable? It is my understanding that they are not. The Department tells me one thing in one breath and something else in another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was so concerned when I saw the Senate determinations that I actually asked for some legal advice on their status. If they are items or instruments that were to be tabled and disallowable, what sorts of comments could we have expected from senators? What sorts of comments would I have been able to make in that situation? I received the following legal advice on those determinations-and with the Minister's legal background, I know that he will be interested in this:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a considerable number of discretions exercisable under the Determination. Some are unimportant but others seem important. Under section 98c (2) of the Act, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal may be requested to make a report with respect to the matters dealt with in a Determination. In view of the number of discretions, it would be reasonable to ask if such a report had been made. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether such a report has been made, but I doubt it. The legal advice continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I noted discretions in paragraphs 5, 6 (a) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), (b) and (c), 23, 24, 25, 35, 37, 38 (f), 39, 40 (f) and (g), 41 and 42. No criteria are specified for the exercise of most of the discretions-</PARA>
<PARA>discretionary powers are given in each paragraph-</PARA>
<PARA>and in relation to many of them there may not need to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in paragraph 38 there are criteria specified which will render a computer system unacceptable to the General Manager. </PARA>
<PARA>They seem appropriate until paragraph 38 (f) which provides that a system may be unacceptable if ``the General Manager deems the system to be unacceptable''. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Minister and I both agree that that is pretty unacceptable in a set of determinations. Again, paragraph 40 provides criteria under which a claim may be of an unacceptable standard. Paragraph 40 (g) provides that it is unacceptable if the general manager deems a claim to be of an unacceptable standard. In both of these cases the result of the exercise of the general manager's discretion could be of significance. There is no requirement provided in the determination for the general manager to give reasons for the decision, nor any provisions for any independent review of the merits of the decisions. As far as I can see, there are no provisions for any independent review. </PARA>
<PARA> There are at least three further discretionary decisions that may affect livelihood. First, paragraph 37 provides that an approved pharmacist or approved medical practitioner whose computer system becomes unacceptable to the general manager cannot use the claims transmission system. Secondly, paragraph 39 provides that the pharmacist or medical practitioner may be suspended from using the claims transmission system. Either of these two could occur under the open-ended discretion, which I have referred to, given in paragraph 38 (f) or for other reasons. Thirdly, where a pharmacist or medical practitioner is suspended under paragraph 39, he or she shall not be reinstated until a period of at least six months has elapsed since the date of suspension. So we have a situation where a pharmacist might not be in receipt of remuneration from the Department. I think the Minister would agree that the serious consequences that could flow from the exercise of these discretions emphasise the importance of giving the reasons for the exercise of discretions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of even greater importance, there appears to be no provision for independent review of any of the discretions either in the determination or in the Act. There are provisions in the Act for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of some decisions made under the Act but those provisions do not cover the present discretions, the exercise of which would impact on the livelihood of pharmacists or medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> There is reference to possible powers of entry. Paragraphs 33 and 36 refer to `operational testing' and meeting `operational audit requirements'. It is not clear to me how these procedures would be carried out and whether they would possibly require entry onto premises or property. If so, there do not appear to be any protective provisions covering this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the provisions appear to raise privacy questions that may affect pharmacists, medical practitioners and patients. These questions would relate especially to unauthorised computer entry and to the integration of data. I have asked questions about the computer transmission system. We are talking about the system that goes through the telephone line, not the proposed one. The computer transmission system was to be compulsory by February. I stand to be corrected, but now it has been extended to June. I was told in Estimates that it is the most easy to get into system of all; the hackers can get into it. The fact that a senator in this place, a member of the House of Representatives, or a prominent business person is taking some particular drug, or whatever else, can go down the line. That just seems to me totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a set of determinations that do not require tabling and are not disallowable. I hope that the Minister will refer this matter to the Minister responsible and ask that he addresses and looks at, as I am doing, the National Health Act. He should look at various clauses concerned with the making of instruments in respect of which there is the likelihood that the rights of individuals could be denied-for example, the right of review of fairly serious decisions that have been made in a department. I hope that these issues will be addressed on both sides of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that Senator Patterson has raised a very worthwhile point for the consideration of the Senate Committee of the Whole. Perhaps it is particularly apt that it be raised in the Committee. However, I doubt whether the determination and the exercise of certain discretions by the general manager whereby the computer system could be unacceptable simply because it is deemed to be unacceptable by the general manager-if that is a correct reading of the paragraph 38 and the determination-would have survived scrutiny by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Patterson has raised some matters which I will certainly bring to the attention of the Minister, given the link between the determination or the exercise of the discretion by the general manager and the impact that could have. For example, with a six-month suspension of use of the claims transmission system the impact on the livelihood of the pharmacist and those dependent on him and his pharmacy is quite evident. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all linked back to the question which I am unable to answer as to the exact status for tabling or the nature of these particular determinations as disallowable instruments or, quite apart from that, the simple publicity which ought to be given to them, whether in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette or by some other means, in order to enable pharmacists to become aware of them. In that regard, though, I suppose if the answer I was previously able to give the honourable senator, as advised to me by officials, is correct, that the determination of 1 August has been complied with in all cases nationwide, it is clear that either the professional bodies of the pharmacists in their various guilds and associations, or the Department by perhaps direct contact with the pharmacies, is making the determination and its provisions available to pharmacies to enable them to comply. However, the question of the exercise of discretions which can have such a marked effect on livelihood is one of genuine interest to the Committee and I will certainly bring it to the attention of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise another issue with the Minister. It is quite obvious that one reason for compliance currently is that the people who are using the claims transmission system (CTS) are using it on a voluntary basis; it is not yet compulsory. One might find that the compliance rate is not quite as successful when it is compulsory. That might be one explanation for the current compliance rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Irrespective of that, if one person fails to comply-the Minister and I have drawn attention to this-and it is deemed by the manager that the system is not satisfactory, that is one too many who will not have the benefit of the process of review to put his case forward. The determination does not allow for that. That is what concerns me. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that concerns me is that we have seen the introduction of the computer transmission system through the use of a determination which, as far as I have been able to gather-and I have had people look at the legislation for me-was not tabled nor did it appear to be disallowable so we would come to the conclusion that that section of the Act does not require the instrument to be tabled or allow it to be disallowed. We have seen the introduction of the computer transmission system through the use of this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The interactive system, or the black box as it has come to be known, has caused quite a deal of concern in the community, especially among pharmacists. At the end of last year the original proposal was withdrawn on the basis of the disapproval by the Privacy Commissioner and the Pharmacy Guild of the system. I am concerned-I think I express the concerns of many of my colleagues on this side of the chamber-that there is no assurance, because of the way in which the CTS system has been introduced, that the interactive processing system will not be introduced in the same way, that is, by way of delegated legislation which is not subject to tabling or disallowance. That may be the very way in which the interactive processing system is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect the Minister to give me this assurance but I hope that the Minister responsible will give an assurance at some stage-the earlier the better-that the interactive processing system will not be introduced in a way that does not enable the instrument to be tabled or disallowed. It seems to me that that is a very sensitive issue. It has great privacy implications. It would only be appropriate that the Minister and the Department table that proposed delegated legislation before the Parliament and allowed adequate and proper scrutiny. </PARA>

The need for the Privacy Commissioner and the Pharmacy Guild to be thoroughly involved in the consultations is self-evident, given the experience to which Senator Patterson alluded last year. As far as the involvement of the Privacy Commissioner and the Pharmacy Guild are concerned, I can give an assurance that that will be undertaken. The Privacy Commissioner will be involved in establishing the guidelines under the legislation to be introduced in this area. Those guidelines will be authorised by Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner. I am unable to give an answer as to the status of those guidelines when published under the legislation. I will see whether drafting instructions have been issued which would indicate whether they are to be disallowable in the sense that it has been of concern to us this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that about 400 pharmacists use modems for the direct transmission of claims on a monthly basis. The claims transmission scheme is based on Telecom Australia's Austpac network. The only change seen by the pharmacists since the transfer of pharmaceutical claims processing to the Health Insurance Commission has been a new telephone number to redirect traffic to the Commission. Initially claims transmissions were processed by the former Department of Health's computer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to security, each pharmacist has a separate user ID and password that are checked by the system. There are two other security obstacles that need to be negotiated before access is granted. Once access is granted, it is only for one-way traffic, that is, for the pharmacist to lodge claims with the Commission. This data is checked before being accepted as a valid claim. At present no data is returned or can be obtained by the pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there are at least four security checks-user ID, password and two other checks-before a claim is received. In view of the stringent security conditions imposed, I think that Senator Patterson can see that an attempt has been made to allay the proper concerns that she has raised. Any extensions to the electronic communication will be with the authorisation of the Privacy Commissioner and the Pharmacy Guild. That terminology is stronger than the words that I used a moment ago when I said that the Privacy Commissioner and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia could be consulted. The briefing note I have uses that strong term `authorisation'. I believe that it indicates the concern of the Government to ensure that the Privacy Commissioner's assessment of the security and privacy safeguards that ought to be in place is observed. </PARA>

Will any attempt to access the system illegally be detected and recorded? How many people and what classes of people within the HIC will have password access to the information? In addition to detecting and recording any illegal access, will that access be tracked and, if so, how? I do not expect the Department to provide an answer now because the questions are quite complicated. Obviously this will come up in the first half of next year and I think that we should be as informed as possible about the development of this process so that we can fully examine the quite considerable privacy issues involved in that exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the two files mentioned by the honourable senator will be matched and, of course, that matching process will be one of the matters which the Privacy Commissioner will put under scrutiny. I further advise that, whilst a single entitlement database reflecting Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits scheme entitlements is proposed, the Commission has given assurances to the Privacy Commissioner that it is not prepared to match claims data from one program against claims data from the other program, meaning the passing of major portions of whole files against each other for the purpose of finding out information about an individual which might not otherwise be available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Merging of data is intended to occur only at an individual level where abuse is suspected and where there is reason to believe that the data of one program may be relevant to the explanation of the abuse or to the abuse occurring in the other program. I think that gives an indication of what triggers this process. To allay the honourable senator's major concerns, the answer is that no doubt the Privacy Commissioner has required certain assurances in this area and they have been given to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would appreciate it if the Department could give me some information about the Medicare enrolment file. Would pharmacists and their staff have access to it under the new system? When we have the interactive system, what will happen if the computer tells the pharmacist, when he sends the information down the line, that there has been a mismatch and the person is not eligible for the benefit? That person could be a pensioner and, instead of paying $2.50, he or she will be required to pay the higher price that you, Mr Chairman, or I would pay. Despite my confidence in the Department of Community Services and Health, there will be errors and there will be errors in the social security data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I kept saying in the Estimates committees, what this is all about is the clients at the other end-the patients in the pharmacy. What happens to those people? Will there be any leeway? Will the pharmacist be able to make a judgment about it and decide that, as he has known the person for a long time, he knows he will be reimbursed although the pharmacist bears the cost? What checks and balances will come into play to ensure that people are not left having to either pay out or go without the drug unless the pharmacist bears the cost?</PARA>
<PARA> A pharmacist I spoke to the other day told me that what sometimes happens, and what he believes will happen with the new minimum pricing policy, is that if he cannot find the doctor to get a scrip changed and he knows the person awfully well he bears the difference in the cost. Frankly, that is hopeless. Is that what we are forcing pharmacists to do because they have such a commitment to their patients? As one or two pharmacists have said to me, when they know people because they have been going to their pharmacy for 20 or 30 years and they are ill but they cannot get the doctor who has written a scrip for a drug which is not at the minimum price, they will be likely to give them the more expensive drug and bear the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> When we develop all these wonderful systems at the coalface-or, in this case, the pharmacyface-we see that things do not always come out smoothly. I have a picture of a pensioner standing in a pharmacy, there being a mismatch on the interactive system and his being told that he is not entitled to his benefit, despite the fact that the pharmacist knows that he is a pensioner and has known him for a long while. I suppose if the pharmacist does that he will be guaranteed his money, but he is going to slow it down. What is the cost to the pharmacist of the bureaucratic involvement he has to go through to ensure that he gets his remuneration in this case?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Patterson's first question in the series, I am advised that the pharmacist will only get confirmation of eligibility. As to her second question, it is true that errors may occur and that for some unfortunate reason advice may be received by a pharmacist that a particular person is not eligible for a reduced payment in regard to the pharmaceutical item and yet the pharmacist, knowing the person, may well understand that the person is indeed a pensioner, for example. I believe that in that situation a pharmacist can make the pharmaceutical item available as though the benefit was properly authorised. But in doing so, the pharmacist takes a certain risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that is not so much a hopeless situation as a very sensible human situation whereby the pharmacist, as the honourable senator says, having known a customer for a period of years-perhaps even decades-understands the situation and is prepared to bring in the human element to override the evident possibility of failure of the best advised machine or computer system. I believe that is a nice human element to which she has drawn our attention which keeps our society the civilised and compassionate society that it is. As to the same matter, more or less, arising between the pharmacist and the customer where there is a problem as to the doctor's authorisation in regard to a higher priced drug and there is a lesser priced drug available, that problem has already been a feature of pharmacy distribution and a modus vivendi has arisen in relation to its resolution. The main point I am trying to make is that there will be room in the guidelines as put forward to allow for the pharmacist to exercise proper discretion in these areas where he or she knows the situation well from experience with the particular customer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Minister will be pleased to know that this is my last question on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. What estimated annual savings will accrue from moving the dial-up system to the dedicated line system? The Department has worked out that the savings will be $25m per year under the Medicare card system and $10m per year under the claims transmission system. This is my reading of it and I would like to have it confirmed. I would like to know whether I am correct in saying that this is what the estimated annual savings will be. I ask whether these are net or gross estimates. Do they take into account the additional work for pharmacists? Do the estimated savings-in my estimation, $15m maximum-justify the privacy intrusion of a person possibly having his or her Medicare card swiped at a pharmacy-I think the Minister knows what I mean by `swiped'-and having pharmacy staff maybe having access to HIC files?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told by the officers that they stand by those savings estimates. Savings in benefits payments would be the best way to describe them. As I say, they stand by those figures. As to whether savings of whatever dimension, be they savings of $15m, $20m, $25m or whatever, are worth intrusion into privacy, it is an unfortunate fact that Australia is relying very heavily on fiscal discipline. I am sure that Senator Patterson's party room is very conscious of the need for this discipline; it keeps telling us that we should exercise a greater discipline in this regard, though that is an incredible burden to put on us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The savings are made up of the $15m, the $20m and the $25m. That is the arduous process that is undertaken by the Expenditure Review Committee, and it is very painful. It would be very easy if all the decisions taken were such that we got savings or achieved less expenditure in the many hundreds of millions. Unfortunately, as Ministers would know, that is not the case, except for some very big items. As I say, it is an accumulation of these sorts of savings of $15m here and $25m there that adds up to the surplus which has been such a beneficial feature of the Budgets presented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) over the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be worth it if the privacy intrusions were so gross as to bring down the wrath of the Privacy Commissioner on the head of the Government. That has been avoided by the process of consultation to which I have referred. Indeed, it will play a very key role in further development of the programs. </PARA>

Comparative figures between Australia and other countries are appalling. Australians take far too many drugs. I would like to see less intrusion into privacy and other methods of educating people. We seem not to do that. We like to legislate and regulate rather than let people make decisions and choices.

<PARA> The abuse of pharmaceuticals is a very real problem in our deliberations, along with the abuse of illegal drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Indeed, as I recall, a campaign that was authorised and shown on television early last year dealt precisely with the hoarding and overuse of drugs of a prescribed variety or which could be obtained through pharmacies. I agree with Senator Patterson that much more needs to be done on that score to try to reduce the incidence of unnecessary taking of drugs in our society. We are indeed a drug ridden society. If we could reduce that incidence it would not only help the health of the individuals concerned but also considerably reduce government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point about a number of drugs that have now been taken off freely accessible lists. I give the example of the drug Losec. Its pharmaceutical name is omeprazole. I am concerned about this drug, which is used for the treatment of ulcers. I understand that it is a relatively new drug. In fact, it was listed only on 1 August this year. Under the new scheme a pensioner can receive an eight-week supply of this drug, which I understand is two bottles, for $2.50 per bottle. A non-pensioner can receive the same at a cost of $15 per bottle. But after that, should it be necessary for a patient to receive this drug for life, it needs to be determined by a hospital consultant. A continuous supply can then be received from the hospital pharmacy. Is it correct that it must be determined by a hospital consultant? Why can it not be determined by a private specialist who would obviously do all the relevant tests to ensure that the patient needs the drug? Why is it necessary that the drug be dispensed by a hospital pharmacy instead of a private pharmacy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am unable to confirm that that is in fact the rule that prevails in this situation where there is an apparent requirement for a lifelong supply of a particular drug-in this case, a drug to do with the reduction, I suppose, or treatment of ulcers. I am not able to say whether in fact it requires a hospital consultant to make that assessment or whether it can be dispensed only through a hospital pharmacy. Therefore, obviously I am not able to say why that might be the case. The officers that I have with me are not specialists in that area. Whilst I can strive to get the answer for Senator Knowles, I doubt whether I can get it during this Committee's deliberations tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I understand from that answer that the Minister will certainly try to get me an answer. I should have said that the information I have came from the health insurance office. That is why I am seeking to clarify it; to make sure that there has not been some dreadful mistake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also been told that the Canberra panel-those are not my words; I am not too sure who the Canberra panel is but maybe it is the Drug Evaluation Committee-feels that an ulcer should have healed with this particular drug within eight weeks and then a patient can go back onto a cheaper drug such as Tagamet or something like that as a maintenance measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received quite clear evidence from patients that they become immune to Tagamet and they have been put onto this other drug. Therefore, it is causing extreme concern that they cannot continue to receive this drug without paying up to-I have been given various figures-either $105 or $150 per bottle per month. That applies to both pensioners and non-pensioners. Patients cannot cover this cost by claiming on their private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of concern about this in the community. I wonder what the Minister has to say about that? If that is so, how can we justify this measure in the light of the cost of hospitalisation? An occupied bed per day in the private sector, including medical costs, costs $245 and in the public sector it is $345-$100 more. Patients who are now achieving great results on this drug are worried that they will in fact be hospitalised. Not only will they incur greater costs but also we, as taxpayers, will have to incur greater costs as well if they are hospitalised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think perhaps we need the intervention of Senator Herron to help us with this. But I link this matter with the previous line of questioning from Senator Patterson because, as the good senator from Victoria pointed out, there is a danger in our society of people becoming attached to taking certain drugs beyond the properly indicated medical necessity. From what Senator Knowles has said, it would appear that the general rule in relation to this drug is thought to be that after eight weeks it should have achieved its purpose and then perhaps a different type of medication ought to be offered to the patient. In that situation it may be that the sort of assessment to be undertaken, as the honourable senator suggested, by the hospital consultant would be necessary, as much as anything, in order to protect the patient from becoming addicted to an unnecessary level of medication which might do other damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That restriction may be for the protection of the patient and for the company which produces the particular pharmaceutical, because its own clinical trials might have suggested that eight weeks was the optimum period. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know anything about it, as must be obvious, and I will seek proper information with regard to the honourable senator's questions. I am sure that it is in the interests of all of us that time spent in hospital be reduced to an absolute minimum-both from the point of view of taxpayers in the community and from the point of view of a large number of members of the community who are contributors to health benefit funds. We all have an interest in ensuring that pharmaceuticals, as prescribed by properly qualified medical practitioners, are used properly in a way which can exclude the necessity for the hospitalisation of a person suffering from a particular disease. But these comments are only generalisations. I will make proper inquiries in relation to the honourable senator's particular query concerning this drug, with the trade name Losec. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is a real concern at this stage about getting addicted to the drug because it is a fairly new drug. I understand from specialists that many of the patients who have been on Tagamet have ceased to get any benefit from it and therefore they have had to go back into hospital or have further tests-endoscopies and so on. Instead of patients becoming attached to a particular drug they in fact get rather detached to the drug that is no longer helping them. That is the reason I wish to clarify this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not doubting anything that the patients or the doctors are saying about this matter, or in fact anything that the Minister has said tonight in terms of finding out answers. This is but one example of a drug and I am equally concerned that there may be many other drugs that fall into this category, where people will be faced with a huge cost in order to obtain the drug or will be hospitalised as a consequence of not being able to afford it. I flag that issue with the Minister and I look forward to his answer in due course. </PARA>

Some honourable senators may be appreciative of the fact that, as opposed to Tagamet, when using omeprazole a person can continue to smoke cigarettes and have his ulcer healed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Harking back to the point which Senator Knowles raised, I am not clear as to the difference in restrictions between Tagamet and omeprazole. As the honourable senator said, it is a drug which is unique in its own field because of its peculiar physiological action acting on the cells that are responsible for acid production. It gets back to the problem of brand name, generic prescribing and the transfer of patients from a drug to which they have become accustomed-which had been effective but which has lost its effectiveness-to another drug, as in the case of Tagamet to omeprazole. That is probably the point that Senator Knowles was making. I, too, would appreciate a reply as to the restrictions on omeprazole as compared to Tagamet. </PARA>

In other words, if the 80 per cent transmission through heterosexual intercourse is true, it is clearly not a figure which corresponds with the situation as revealed in Australia. But that does not make the global picture inaccurate; it just means that Australia is not experiencing the same proportion of the various modes of transmission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the particular statistics transmitted to the World Health Organisation, if I heard the whispers correctly the Australian epidemiological centre sends material to the World Health Organisation under various categories and descriptions which have emanated from the Disease Control Centre in Atlanta.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister very much. It is recorded in Hansard that I asked the reason for Dr Blewett's statement in the White Paper that 1.6 per cent of reported AIDS cases in Australia resulted from heterosexual transmission, because that was not the figure, the Minister will remember from the discussion, that was given to us in any of the Australian HIV surveillance reports. I got an answer that I do not understand, and I will read it to the Minister. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At mid-1989 there were 23 cases of AIDS classified by the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research as having acquired their infection heterosexually. At the end of November, the National Centre revised the definition of ``heterosexually acquired'' to mean only those cases where the exposure category or HIV infection status of the sexual partner who infected the person was known. At this time, 10 cases who only reported heterosexual activity but for whom no relevant information on their partner was available were reclassified from ``heterosexual'' to ``other undetermined''. There are currently 16 cases of AIDS acquired heterosexually where the status of the partner was known. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister looks at the information we were given-and I refer to the 16 cases in the Australian HIV surveillance report-he will see heterosexual contact, 16. That is made up as follows: sex with an IV drug user, 1; sex with bisexual male, 5; sex with a person from a pattern II country, 6; sex with a pattern II country, 2; sex with transfusion recipient, 1; and sex with HIV infected person unknown transmission classification, 1. That makes up the 16. How can the answer that I was given be correct?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how the Minister is going to work this out. Unless I had the answer in front of me I could not have taken it all in.

The fact remains that the mode of transmission was heterosexual activity between the two parties, so the figures are not incompatible. Of course, heterosexual activity does not mean vaginal activity, as we determined in the Committee. Nevertheless, it is sexual activity involving the exchange of bodily fluids, I think is the phrase we use.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the parliamentary liaison group on AIDS and as the chair of one of the working panels which helped turn the Green Paper into a White Paper, I would like to contribute to this discussion. I understand the concern Senator Walters is raising. She wants to get the numbers precise and balanced. But there are certain things I would not wish to go unsaid in the Committee. Firstly, the AIDS sufferers we have seen represent infection that occurred some time ago. Included among those figures-and I am going on the Australian HIV surveillance report of October 1990-are quite a large number of women; that is, 63 females. Irrespective of how they acquired AIDS, they are 63 females who got AIDS. They are not just infected people; I will come to infected people in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know, Mr Temporary Chairman, whether you have seen anyone die of AIDS, but it is probably one of the worst ways of dying that there is. For each of those 63 people, only some of whom, by the way, were infected as a result of contaminated blood products, it really does not matter very much whether they acquired the virus from injecting, from heterosexual intercourse, as I understand that term, or in some other way. The fact is they got the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole range of approaches we must use to try to do something about this disease because it is untreatable once it is acquired. The only effective strategy open to us is prevention. It is interesting that Australia, almost alone among the nations of the world, can point to an effect upon new infections. New infections are dropping in this country. I suggest that that is related to the interventions which have been undertaken as part of the national AIDS strategy, which is regarded in many countries as a model document. It involves an eclectic approach; it involves, for example, the funding of those who would preach chastity and fidelity. Of course it does. I believe large amounts of Commonwealth money-perhaps up to $570,000-have gone to Christian groups to enable them to put their own views on chastity, celibacy, monogamy and fidelity. I applaud that. When I was doing consulting work for the World Health Organisation and went to Pacific countries, many church leaders in those countries, who are very influential in matters like this, were very keen that that should be part of the message WHO put. WHO said, `Of course. We will support that kind of message', as we are here. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look not at the AIDS sufferers who represent infection five to seven years ago, but to look at the infection rate and to look at the number of people infected with this virus, because we know that for those people the future is very clouded. I believe I am correct in saying that in Australia at the moment 457 women are known to be infected with the HI virus. If I look at the transmission categories of some of the most recent cases, I find that none of them got the disease from unsafe blood. Of course we all agree that securing the blood supply is the first absolute necessity, and Australia has done that. By the way, it was a disgrace that in some parts of the world it was delayed even by six or nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the other categories, of the 10 people who were reported with new HIV infection to 7 September 1990, and over the two previous calendar intervals, we find that five are said to have contracted it from heterosexual contact. The only plea I make is that we remember that with the national strategy we have achieved some results, and that the number of new infections, instead of rising by an exponential rate, as predicted, has flattened. If that happens, Australia is doing something useful. I hope the Parliament will support the strategy and the program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that the Department has in any way set out to mislead Senator Walters. In fact the material we have provided has been extremely extensive and the number of statistics, correlations, comparative tables and work undertaken is, I think, a measure of the attempt by the Department to provide the Committee with as much information as possible. In that instance, obviously the most expert epidemiologists and those involved themselves came to have misgivings and queries about, as Senator Walters would put it-I think properly-the substantiation of the self-claim of having been infected through heterosexual activity. If that sort of reassessment, and therefore the refiguring consequential upon it, has taken place, the Department may be forgiven for sometimes not always being abreast of the latest reassessment by the experts of the correct figuring. As a result of Senator Walters's persistence in this matter and as a result of what is available to this Committee of the Whole, we are now in a position where the Australian people are well-informed about the correct situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not ask the Minister to respond to this. I understand how the mistake occurred in respect of the 23 people, but I do not understand why a wrong answer was given to me by the Department in answer to a question I asked of it in the Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1985 Australia panicked and we had the situation where, with all the best intentions in the world, Dr Blewett said that by today 50,000 people in this country would be infected with AIDS. That has now been revised to 15,000, and has been cited by Professor Karmel as being a more accurate figure. I understand that. I have referred to a speech given by Dr Merson. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We estimate in 1990 about 60 per cent of HIV infections will be transmitted through vaginal sex and 15 per cent through anal intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that extremely hard to understand-just as hard as some of the claims that have been made here in Australia. The Minister will remember that I brought to his attention Professor Penny's letter to the Australian in which he made that silly claim that 121 Australians had contracted HIV through vaginal intercourse, which we have established now was totally incorrect. We get all this misinformation. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Health Organisation is saying that it is able to assess, in all the countries that it deals with, something that we in this country, with all our sophisticated technology and means of surveys, et cetera, cannot assess. Despite Professor Penny's claim, we know that the National Health and Medical Research Council tells us, `No, we have not got any figures at all in Australia on the transmission of AIDS by vaginal sex'. Yet we had the World Health Organisation saying that it can do it and that it estimates that 60 per cent of cases are transmitted in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are extenuating circumstances in Africa. I am well aware that South Africa is in a very bad position-particularly the women of Africa. We know that blood screening there came very late, and that women, due to their child-bearing, were the ones needing the hospital and medical centres and being given injections with dirty needles. We know that in many of those areas there is no concept of having a new needle every time an injection is given, and in many places dirty needles are used, with needles being kept and used until they break. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know that other sexually transmitted diseases are a rife area as a source of infection from vaginal intercourse with an HIV positive partner. We know that the women in Africa who have other sexually transmitted diseases to a large extent go untreated. We also know that, because of the African culture, homosexuality is not acknowledged in the same way as it is here, and so the majority of homosexuals in that country are bisexuals. In those areas, and indeed in some other similar countries, the same sorts of reasons occur. But we must not panic Australians in the same way by saying to them that the same thing could happen here. It was with that in mind that I asked Minister Tate-and he promised that he would-to bring to the attention of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that there are indeed other sexually transmitted diseases, and certainly cervical cancer, which are far more of a concern to young and promiscuous girls than AIDS will ever be. </PARA>
<PARA> As I gave Minister Tate the figures at that time, for a woman in Australia the risk of dying of AIDS is one in 591,569; whereas the risk of a woman dying of cervical cancer is one in 23,663. He promised to talk to the Education Minister, who will be going to that December meeting, and to ask that promiscuous young girls be given that sort of information along with the AIDS information. </PARA>
<PARA> Could the Minister also ask the Department whether Professor Karmel or Dr Kaldor now believes that AIDS has peaked, or is it again too early? I asked that in the Estimates, and was told that it was a bit too early to tell yet, but the latest statistics were not out then. Could the Minister tell me whether that belief is still the same or is it still too early? Or following the accumulation of this extra data-as Senator Baume said, the figures are going down-do we believe it has peaked?</PARA>

Nevertheless, the fact is that, rather than the 50,000 cases which were predicted apparently as being likely in 1990, there are now some 15,000 identified cases of such infection. I would have thought that it was proper to take some pride as Australians in the fact that, if the various programs to alert members of the community to this disease had not been undertaken, some 35,000 Australians might have been put at risk, in jeopardy, and ravaged by this disease and eventually might have died. It is the cumulative impact of the programs which has the effect of achieving the great reduction in the figures from the projections of 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether the latest figures would allow one to say that the rate of infection has plateaued-and I think that is what she was referring to-I will ask the Government's senior medical advisers to try to come to some interpretation and see whether the latest figures allow them to be more forthcoming in their description of the plateau or decline effect that might be gauged from the figures, as compared with when we met in the Estimates Committee only a matter of weeks ago.

Some of the tables are totally different. I ask the Minister whether table 1.5 as to July 1990 is at least the same as table 1.5 in October 1990. It is a different heading, but if it is read carefully I think they work out about the same. Could we please have the same tables? We have a list of tables relating to AIDS cases and deaths by sex and State or Territory. That is not the same in the other one at all. They are all different.

How much money, on the other hand, was provided for groups other than those groups which were involved in pushing the so-called safe sex line?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Harradine indicated, this arose out of an intervention by Senator Peter Baume when I think he indicated that he understood that some $570,000 had been provided to groups that were emphasising that their preferred method, style of life or ethos for avoiding the transmission of AIDS was to adopt celibate, chaste or monogamous sexual practices-presumably heterosexual monogamous sexual practices. My officers tell me that that is roughly correct-that it was something in excess of half a million dollars. As to how much is available for other groups to promote different methods for restricting, restraining or reducing the transmission of the HIV virus, the officers cannot immediately provide an answer to that except to say that, obviously, the figure is considerably in excess of that amount. The officers tell me that part of their difficulty is that much of the Budget is transmitted to the States or Territories which then make grants to various groups. The officers are not able to provide me with information as to the funding that those groups might provide by way of distribution from State or Territory jurisdictions concerned.

As a result of a series of questions at the Estimates Committee hearings, we dragged out of the Department-it is at page C331-that, of the cases of sexually transmitted AIDS, over 99 per cent had a homosexual cause.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I just raise two other aspects. I am hurriedly looking through the Estimates Committee Hansard, but I cannot find the page. However, I asked whether we could be provided with educational material which had been produced with the aid of the Commonwealth Government. I do not seem to have received that in the responses that I have had from the Department of Community Services and Health. My recollection is-I apologise if it is wrong-that at the hearings I asked for this material. As yet, I have not seen it come into my office. A lot of stuff comes into my office, but I am sure that it would have been drawn to my attention. I just wonder whether the Department could supply that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, is the plateauing, as it were, of the number of HIV infected persons in Australia considered by the Government to be a genuine plateauing, or are there some other reasons; for example, the reluctance of persons with suspected HIV in the high risk groups to present for testing? Does the Government perceive that there is a reluctance in Australia amongst high risk groups to present for testing?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the two matters raised by Senator Harradine, I understand that he apparently sought certain education materials that have been funded from the Commonwealth to be provided to him. I cannot quite recall the debate, but if it is the sort of material that is circulated in schools by education authorities and so on, I think that can be very readily obtained. If it has not been compiled for the honourable senator already, I will make sure that that is undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To supply information on the possibly 500 or so community groups that receive some sort of funding and use a portion of it for publications would be a much more onerous task. I do not know whether Senator Harradine understood that that would involve compiling a list of all the materials and literature that the various community groups might produce. In so far as the material can be put together, I will ask the Department to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the question of the plateau is concerned, I think in relation to the final questions from Senator Walters on this very topic I indicated that it was possibly too early to be any firmer than was able to be indicated at the meeting of the Senate Estimates Committee, I think by Dr Tony Adams, that the figures do not allow for a firm conclusion as to whether the plateau was real or an aberration. However, with the figures that have been produced since the Committee met, it may be possible to be more firm in one's conclusion as to the description of the rate of infection as plateauing or is declining or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that there has been an increase in the number of persons presenting themselves for testing, though it may be that this is in the category of suspected drug users, and they have been encouraged to seek treatment. In fact, I think the last campaign was to do with drug users. I not know whether it is the number of persons or the rate per 100,000 of the population, but I think the number presenting for testing is increasing rather than declining. It may be that that is a contradiction of what lay behind the honourable senator's question, which seemed to suggest that, in fact, there may have been a decrease in those presenting themselves for testing for various reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I thank the Minister. I do not want him to think that that is what was at the back of my mind. I was asking a straight question and I wanted the view of the Government. It appears that the Government considers that there is nothing at the moment which would provide a barrier making those in high risk groups reluctant to present for testing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other question, I did mean examples of material that has been produced with Commonwealth moneys either directly or indirectly. I would have thought that the Federal Government's responsibility was to see that Federal taxpayers' money that is paid to organisations in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) campaign was used in accordance with the purpose for which it was provided. I would have thought that the Department would receive regularly material that is produced with this money. </PARA>

<PARA> As I say, in so far as the Commonwealth provides money to community groups and some of that money is used for publications, then where it can be undertaken, we will try to provide the honourable senator with the examples of such material. I would only say that it might not be absolutely complete. However, an attempt will be made to provide him with the materials that are authorised for distribution within educational institutions and which are the sorts of messages which he has indicated that he wishes to get across to those young males who may be contemplating homosexual activity. </PARA>

How could a scheme such as this which has obviously been instituted in most of the States be policed? How can it be enforced with the use of taxpayers' money? I just do not understand how someone can be given $80 to $100 a week when he or she signs some little thing to say,`I am not going to indulge in sex because I am HIV infected'. Without having someone running around 24 hours a day after him or her, we will not know whether that is actually happening. I believe that this scheme is being run in all States. Would the Minister be kind enough to tell me whether it is a State or Federal funded scheme. If it is a State scheme, is it subsidised in any way by the Federal Government? The Minister can probably imagine my concern about this dubious hand-out after raising the issue earlier of drugs not being made freely available to patients at a reasonable cost.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I want to ask about funding for multipurpose centres. In February this year Minister Staples went around the country-and I am sure that he would say that it was not because an election was coming on. It was because I had pushed him to address the issue of developing a more flexible system for small rural nursing homes. I had taken a particular interest in this matter because, of the 118 small rural nursing homes in Australia, 48 happen to be in Victoria. One of the reasons for my taking such an interest was the number of them in Victoria. When the Department of Community Services and Health had this wildcat idea of merging any small rural nursing homes that were less than 250 kilometres apart, people went into a tailspin, and rightly so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the solutions and one of the things I kept asking for was a creative program to be developed to ensure that some of these centres would remain viable to enable older people to stay in and be cared for in their own communities. We on this side of the chamber, at least, think that that is the appropriate way for older people to be looked after: if they have lived in a community all their lives, they should be looked after in that community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) developed this concept of multipurpose centres and announced in February the establishment of multipurpose centres-appropriately, many of them in marginal seats. That was all very well. Some of the centres were told in February that they were approved. I know of one in particular that was told on 2 February that it would be an approved multipurpose centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Those centres were in regular contact with the Department about when they might see the colour of the money for these multipurpose centres. The centres were to get a smaller amount in the first instance to help them start up and until they reached the requirements for a multipurpose centre, when they would be entitled to $45,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee I asked whether funding had gone ahead because the explanatory notes stated that two rounds of funding had been completed. That seemed strange to me, because I had spoken to most of the multipurpose centres in my State and none had seen any money. I was told that, if the legal agreements governing the conditions of award that had been developed in conjunction with the legal services branch had been signed, the centres would be funded. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Murnane implied that the funding had gone ahead. After lunch she came to me and said that she was a little surprised to find that none of the centres had received any of their funding. I was not surprised because I had been told by the multipurpose centres that they had not received their funding. Anyway, what happened was this. I asked my question on 12 October in the Estimates Committee-and this will not be lost on the Minister because the dates are important. On 16 October, it was stated on page 2555 of the additional information that the cheques were dispatched to the four named centres-that is, Violet Town, Rainbow, Avoca and Lakes Entrance, which were the four towns that came off the top of my head when I was asked which four I was talking about-on 16 October 1990, four days after I had asked the question. The document then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Legal agreements governing the conditions of Award of Grant had to be developed in conjunction with the Legal Services Branch for each organisation and these conditions had to be accepted in writing by each organisation before payment of grants was made. Acceptance in writing of the Conditions of Awards of Grant were received from Violet Town, Rainbow, Avoca and Lakes Entrance on the following dates:</PARA>
<PARA>Violet Town...8 October 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Rainbow...17 September 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Avoca...14 September 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Lakes Entrance...21 September 1990</PARA>
<PARA>It might also interest the Minister to know that I had asked a question in the Senate about the funding of multipurpose centres just before that. Two of the centres, but one in particular, received their agreements on 14 September. That is the first discussion that they had had with the Department about the agreement. The wording in the answers makes it appear as though the centres were tardy in the negotiation of these agreements. That is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> The first the centres saw, or heard or had anything to do with the agreement was when they received documents saying that, if they signed, their funding would commence from the date of the signing of the agreement. This particular centre signed the agreement, waited a day or two, got some legal advice about the status of the agreement and sent it off. The centre got its cheque on 18 October. That seems to fit in, because we have been told in the additional information supplied to Estimates that the cheques were sent on 16 October. </PARA>
<PARA> The two points of interest are that the cheques were dated, as the centres were told, from the date the agreement was signed, 14 September, which is in this financial year. But we have been told in the explanatory notes that two rounds of funding had been completed. It was absolute nonsense. Two rounds of funding had not been completed. In fact, nobody had got funding. The other interesting thing relates to the cheque-I have a copy of it here-that the centre received. I wonder whether the Auditor-General or the Public Accounts Committee might be interested in this. It is a fascinating exercise. The cheque is dated 26 June 1990, but it was sent out on 18 October. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether that is an unusual occurrence or whether it is the practice of the Department of Community Services and Health. I hope it is not. Maybe the cheques were sitting in the Department waiting for the agreement to be signed and so on, but it seems strange to me that the funding is from 14 September, approved in February. What will happen? I will give an example of one of the centres. It got its set up money of $20,000 from 14 September. By 14 September next year the centre will not have quite made it to the status of a multipurpose centre. It is hoping to have its hostel beds built by February 1991. It then gets the next $20,000 in September. The question the centre would be interested to ask is: When it reaches the status of a multipurpose centre in February 1991, will it get a pro rata upgrading of that $20,000 to a pro rata of the $45,000 it was due for the rest of the financial year?</PARA>
<PARA> I think it would have been much more appropriate had the round of funding been completed, as it was stated, as at the date when it had been approved as a multipurpose centre. In effect, the centres will be $20,000 or more worse off than they would have been had they got their funding when approval had been given. It seems to me that the delay might have been in the legal services branch. Wherever the delay was, it was not in the centres. For the Department even to phrase the information in a way that would intimate that the centres were at fault for not signing their agreements or not engaging in negotiations-those centres rang and rang the Department-is erroneous. I was in constant contact with the centres. I had taken a particular interest in multipurpose centres. I believe it is the way to go. I believe that we need centres that can offer a number of services to the aged people in the community, and I believe that we can make them viable. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that they got their cheque in October-dated in June-is something that needs to be addressed. I do not know whether they were sitting there, waiting, or whether in fact somebody scurried around and wrote cheques dated 26 June so he could retrospectively have the explanatory notes somehow in accord with what was going on, but it does seem very odd. Perhaps the Minister should ask the Minister responsible to look at this. In fact, I hope the Auditor-General addresses it. I have raised it with one of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts because it does seem slightly irregular. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was taking shorthand notes, but I think the best course I can undertake is to provide the points raised by Senator Patterson to the Minister and try to see if there is any explanation for the disparity in the date of the cheque as opposed to the time that the payment was dispatched, which appears to be about 16 October in all the instances. I think that is a proper question for the Estimates process to have thrown up and no doubt it does require some sort of answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matters are of a more general character and I think the honourable senator would be pleased that in relation to the multipurpose centres some 13 of the 14 organisations had been sent letters of offer and conditions for the award of the multipurpose centres grant at the end of last month. I understand that eight letters of acceptance of the offer have been received and their annual grant payment has been forwarded to them. So the program is under way even though it has taken some time and, according to the material available to me, it is true that the formal offers were made about 10 September. These were dispatched and most of the eight organisations to receive funding certainly replied within a respectable period, given the advice that they would have sought. So those particular organisations cannot be blamed for the late receipt of the first payments dispatched on 16 October. </PARA>
<PARA> As always, these matters do require the fullest consideration of the proper structure of assessment and dispatch of these moneys. The agreements had to be drawn up and put in place in order precisely to satisfy the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance, and indeed the Department itself, as to the proper disposing of taxpayers' money. I have no doubt that there was some necessary delay in ensuring that all those matters of structure and process were taken care of, which explains the delay between the announcement of the grants and the date of the formal offer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Senator Tate may not be able to comment, but we were well into this financial year and the agreements had not even been sent out and they had to be signed and sent back. Then there was the situation of the cheques being sent on 18 October and dated 26 June. It does seem to be an unusual practice and I would appreciate it if the Minister could comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other question I ask the Minister is this: If the funding was in the 1989-90 Budget-we were told that two rounds of funding had been completed- why is it that those multipurpose centres did not receive their money as at the date they were approved? They were operating on that basis. They were setting themselves up as multipurpose centres and now a significant proportion of them will be up to $20,000 out of pocket, and that will be continuing. I would appreciate it if the Minister could ask the Minister responsible to address this to see why their funding was not started, as they believed was the case, from the date they were approved-subject to the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that the language is exactly accurate. I guess they were approved only when the formal offer was accepted and in a way which enabled the Department to say that an agreement was properly in place. It is true that the grants were announced earlier, but the process of approval, as I have indicated, took some time in getting the letters of formal offer out to the various organisations. There is a gap, I guess, between the expectation as to the payments from March or June, whenever the grant may have been announced in respect of a particular organisation, and the actual dispatch of payments in mid-October. At the moment I cannot indicate why it is that there was that lapse of time, but I hope that the grants that are approved for a period of two years will give some certainty to the boards of management of those organisations so that the necessary decisions can be taken to ensure that the multipurpose centres do operate in a way which, obviously, the honourable senator thought was important and beneficial to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -In the appendices of the report of Estimates Committee C, it will be noted that I made a number of reservations and referred to the subject matters about which I have made those reservations. I wish to deal with a number of those at this time. First of all, I will deal with the National Health and Medical Research Council grants. On 25 September I asked-and this appears at page C368 of the Estimates Committee Hansard-that details of the 1991 grants be provided to the Committee. This was agreed to by the Department. However, the departmental official mentioned that first they had to be approved by the Minister. The Minister announced details of the grants in a press statement dated 4 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> About 45 minutes before the Committee of the Whole commenced its deliberations of the report of Estimates Committee C-I think that was around 5 o'clock- I received a bundle about two inches thick giving details of medical research grants involving millions of taxpayers' dollars. Both Senator Walters and I referred to the perennial delay which occurs in the delivery of this material to Estimates each year. I am aware that one of the problems is that, whilst the estimates for these grants are contained in the Budget Papers and the explanatory notes that are prepared by the Department of Community Services and Health, the actual research for which the amounts are provided is for the calendar year. In other words, we have a problem of a financial year as far as we are concerned, and a calendar year as far as researchers and universities and other institutions are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, that means that the grants, which as I said amount to some millions of dollars, are not subjected to the proper scrutiny by the Parliament. I am so sore about this because I well recall the National Health and Medical Research Council making almost half a million dollars in grants, approximately $450,000 in medical research grants, to a group in the Monash Bioethics Centre-Professor Peter Singer, Helga Kuhse and such people-for the purposes of developing a philosophy, as it were, in favour of human embryo experimentation. That is what it boiled down to. They were given $450,000 of medical research grants, when there were many researchers with excellent research projects who were not funded but whose research projects were approved. They could not be funded for lack of money. That is why I am concerned that we do not have the knowledge of what is in this material. I have only just received it and, as I understand it, nobody else on the Committee or in the Committee of the Whole has received these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to the Department for making available the copies. I am not blaming the Department at all. I just point out to the Minister that it certainly does not enable members of parliament to exercise their proper audit and control functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people may say that the question of projects for medical research should be left to an organisation such as the National Health and Medical Research Council. I do not agree with that; nor does the Minister, because the Minister has to approve those grants. Because this involves such a large sum of money-even if it involved a small sum of money-we, as a committee, should be able to examine where the money is going. This is one area where that examination has closed off. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in the dying stages of the scrutiny process of Estimates and only a short while ago I was given this material. It is impossible for me, and for any other member of the Committee of the Whole, to make any comment about the amounts that have been provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council under the item in the budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make two comments. First, it is quite clear that the Committee of the Whole is asking the National Health and Medical Research Council to look to the cycle of its putting forward of the various grants in relation to the research which is funded from Commonwealth moneys. Even given the constraints and the difficulties of harmonising our budgetary process with the calendar year of tertiary research institutions and so on, it may be that the National Health and Medical Research Council should make a more determined effort to try to bring its publication of the proposed grants into a cycle which allows for some consideration by the Parliament during this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Department is to be commended, as I think Senator Harradine was doing. Despite the fact that publication setting out the grants approved is still being prepared and that it is still a week or two from being finalised, given Senator Harradine's request in the Estimates Committee, an interim list of the approved grants is being provided to Senator Harradine, though not in the most presentable format. Nevertheless, an attempt has been made by the Acting Principal Adviser in the Budget Management Branch. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department is to be commended for making that attempt, building on the late provision of these materials from the National Health and Medical Research Council. When I say late, it may be in accordance with the usual pattern. But clearly that is not entirely satisfactory from the point of view of enabling some examination of those grants to be incorporated into the process of the examination of the expenditure of Commonwealth moneys. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I re-emphasise that I certainly do not mean to reflect in any way on the Department. The Department has done an extremely good job in the very short time that it had to prepare the material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the new Medicare item for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), as I indicated I would in the reservation. With the new item for IVF-item No. 840, et cetera-there is a specific prohibition on surrogacy arrangements. The new item came into effect on 1 November. There does not appear to be any clear prohibition of government reimbursement for these items when they are used for purposes related to infertility. However, this year there have been suggestions that IVF procedures could be employed for genetic screening purposes. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 25 January 1990 entitled `IVF should be for everyone, doctors say' and written by Ruth Dewsbury, Medical Reporter, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian ethicists have called for fertile couples to have access to in vitro fertilisation, a program restricted in some States to the treatment of infertility. </PARA>
<PARA> IVF techniques could not only offer some fertile couples a better chance of a normal baby, argues Professor Peter Singer, director of the Centre for Human Bioethics, but the opportunity for women to delay having children more safely.</PARA>
<PARA> In this week's British Medical Journal, Professor Singer and a senior research officer, Dr Karen Dawson, put forward two scenarios for the use of IVF by fertile couples either for medical reasons or as a matter of choice for the woman. I will not continue with the article, but I would be happy to table it and show it to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been suggestions that IVF procedures could be employed for genetic screening purposes. In September a scientist from the United States suggested that genetic screening through IVF would become common practice within 10 years. That report has built on a report from another conference in the United States. But let us set aside the United States example. There have been discussions within this country about the possible use of IVF for that purpose. Indeed, the Minister will recall that the first submission opposing the Bill which I introduced to prevent destructive experiments on human embryos was from the Murdoch Institute for Research in Birth Defects. That submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985 opposed the Bill on the grounds that the Bill would prevent such a scheme being implemented. If it is appropriate, as I believe it is, to deny the Medicare rebate when surrogacy arrangements are involved, surely the same applies to these people who might enter the IVF program simply for the purpose of having their baby measured up to certain standards before it is slotted for either reprieve or destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not happy with the introduction of the Medicare item in any event but given the statement by the Minister that the rebate was related to infertile couples why is there not a provision in the details of the new medical benefit scheme item which were provided to the Committee? Why is there not some prohibition in them for persons who are using, or who are likely to use, the IVF programs in the way that is foreshadowed in the material that I have presented to the Committee of the Whole today?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that in the case of surrogacy arrangements there has been a definite exclusion in relation to the availability of the Medicare benefit for an in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure. With regard to the question of the availability of IVF procedures solely for the purpose of alleviating an infertility problem between the couple or the parties concerned, the question of the use of IVF procedures for the purpose of screening embryos for genetic or other abnormalities is a matter which, I understand, has been raised by Senator Harradine. For example, section 19(5) of the Health Insurance Act comes into play. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Unless the Minister otherwise directs, a medicare benefit is not payable in respect of a health screening service, that is to say, a professional service that is a medical examination or test that is not reasonably required for the management of the medical condition of the patient. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of whether this section would allow benefits to be paid in relation to the sorts of situations which Senator Harradine has raised, that is, where the IVF procedure is used simply to have the embryo available in-vitro in order to examine it for the possibility of abnormalities such as would lead the choice to be made that it should not be implanted in the womb, will be affected by an interpretation of section 19(5) of the Health Insurance Act. I understand that the Department of Community Services and Health has sought a legal opinion on the matter from the Attorney-General's Department. I think that may advance the matter of the proper interpretation of section 19(5) in the situation outlined by Senator Harradine. That is now being undertaken. </PARA>

<PARA>COMMONWEALTH FUNDS MANAGEMENT LIMITED BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill completes the new superannuation arrangements that apply to Commonwealth employees and, at the same time, represents a further step in the Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is twofold. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, the Bill provides for the transfer of SFIT's trustee function in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund to a joint employer/employee Board of Trustees. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, it provides for the conversion of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) into a wholly Commonwealth owned public company to be called Commonwealth Funds Management Limited (CFM). </PARA>
<PARA>SFIT was established in 1976 under the Superannuation Act 1976 as a statutory authority with trustee responsibility for the management and investment of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fund contains the contributions of the members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the income earned from SFIT's investment of those contributions, as well as, since 1 July 1990, employer 3 per cent productivity contributions. Management of the Fund and the investment performance of the Fund are important to both the members of the superannuation scheme and to the Government in its role as a responsible employer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's superannuation policy, expressed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards, is that responsibility and control for superannuation funds should be in the hands of joint employer/employee boards of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Public Sector Superannuation Scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990 is fully in accord with this policy. The Board of Trustees have full responsibility for the administration of the scheme and the investment of Fund moneys. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time the new Public Sector Superannuation Scheme was introduced, changes were made to the administration of the 1976 Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. A Commonwealth Superannuation Board was established with responsibilities for the invalidity retirement process and setting the interest rate to be allocated on members' contributions. The Commissioner for Superannuation, however, retained his statutory duties under the Superannuation Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill reconstitutes the Commonwealth Superannuation Board as the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 2. This joint employer/employee Board retains the responsibilities of the former Board and, in addition, will have responsibility for the management of the Superannuation Fund for the 1976 scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>With this amendment, administration of the two main superannuation schemes for public servants will be in line with the Occupational Superannuation Standards, private sector practice, and other new superannuation schemes in the Commonwealth sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the 1976 Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme now will have an appropriate say in the management of their superannuation fund through the trustees nominated by the ACTU to represent the members. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, changes that have been made to the Superannuation Act 1976 relating to the operations of SFIT since it was first established have placed SFIT on a fairly independent footing with the freedom and flexibility to manage and invest moneys of the Fund in a commercial manner. In 1986, restrictions on SFIT's investment powers were removed to enable it to compete with the private sector for investment opportunities. Further amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 1990, have provided SFIT with the power to provide investment services on a fee for service basis to a range of clients within the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>As investment manager of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, SFIT manages one of the largest portfolios in the country with over $5.8 billion under management. SFIT operates in all major domestic financial markets and has a portion of the Fund invested in international equities. Its performance over recent years has placed it among the top performing fund managers according to published surveys of comparable pooled superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom and Australia Post, and some other government business enterprises (GBEs), whose employees were previously members of the 1976 Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, have now established their own superannuation schemes. As a result, SFIT has lost its monopoly over the management and investment of those funds and is now required to compete with the private sector for their management. Any significant withdrawal of GBE funds would make it difficult for SFIT to maintain, without the changes I am introducing today, the rates of return it has achieved in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>To be able to compete successfully with the private sector for GBE funds, and attract new clients, SFIT needs to be allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise able to respond quickly in the market place free from day-to-day regulatory controls. Moreover, freeing SFIT from its trustee responsibilities has marketing advantages because it will no longer be seen by prospective clients as having to give priority to the management of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The reform package is therefore, a necessary step in the continued development of SFIT. The objective is to establish it as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the domestic and international market place. Conversion of SFIT into a wholly Commonwealth owned public company incorporated under the Companies Act 1981 will enable this objective to be achieved but at the same time provide for an organisation with the capacity to ensure the protection of the returns of members of the Commonwealth superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of important elements in the CFM reform package. Firstly, there will be new planning and accountability mechanisms for CFM. These will include the provision by CFM of a three-year corporate plan which will define the company's goals, financial targets and strategies to achieve those goals. Financial targets will be set and CFM will report annually giving an account of its performance against goals. </PARA>
<PARA>CFM's memorandum and articles of association will be registered, as with any public company, with the National Companies and Securities Commission. The Minister responsible for CFM will exercise control on behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. The proposed memorandum and articles of association will provide for the Minister responsible to have the power to appoint and dismiss the CFM board of directors. Also the Minister responsible for CFM will be able to issue guidelines to the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>With CFM's establishment as a general funds manager competing for the management of other funds, it will be important that Board members have suitable investment experience and business acumen. The Board will be appointed by the Minister from suitably qualified men and women in accordance with Government policy. Existing members of SFIT will be eligible for appointment to the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition CFM will be required to operate in accordance with the Companies Code. This will provide for the protection of the interests of the Commonwealth through its rights as a shareholder of the company. Under the Companies Code the company's directors have specific responsibilities to shareholders as well as other defined obligations. There will also be revised remuneration arrangements for the chief executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA>CFM will be expected to continue to comply with Government wages and industrial relations policies, in particular with those guidelines developed specifically for GBEs in March 1989. It is intended that CFM operate as a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements proposed for CFM are essentially the same as those already applying to other GBEs such as Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I now summarise the key elements of the Bill. The Bill provides for the conversion of SFIT from its current statutory authority status, to a public company incorporated under the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill comes into effect in several stages, on Royal Assent and through two proclamations. This is to facilitate the creation of the capital structure, incorporation of the new company, the transfer of SFIT's trustee role to the Board of Trustees and the repeal of sections of the Superannuation Act 1976 relating to the establishment of SFIT and its operations as a statutory authority. This also allows for the development of an appropriate memorandum and articles of association, an appropriate balance sheet, financial performance indicators and a strategic plan to enable the Minister responsible for CFM to undertake strategic oversight of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for all of the share capital of CFM to be issued to the Commonwealth or its nominees and, in view of the Commonwealth's ongoing interest in CFM, it provides that CFM shares cannot be transferred to non-Commonwealth interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill ensures the continuity of SFIT as a legal entity during the transition. Legally, continuity of the corporate entity dispenses with the need to transfer assets and liabilities from SFIT to a new body corporate. This means that all contracts, agreements and arrangements entered into by or on behalf of SFIT which are in force immediately before transition in respect of most of the assets and liabilities automatically apply to the new company. However, because of the need for some financial adjustments to be made between SFIT and the Board of Trustees, the Bill provides for the transfer of certain assets and liabilities of a non-trading nature. In addition, the assets and liabilities held by SFIT in its capacity as manager of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund will be transferred to the Board of Trustees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill ensures continuity of employment and staff conditions during the transition. Each staff member of SFIT will become an employee of the new company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the statutory authority. Accordingly there are provisions enabling current employees' accumulated entitlements, rights under Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 and rights of entry into the Australian Public Service to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the establishment of SFIT as an incorporated company limited by shares through the registration of the memorandum and articles of association for CFM with the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time SFIT's trustee function in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund is transferred to a joint employer/employee Board of Trustees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Board of Trustees becomes responsible for the management and investment of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund which is to be known as Commonwealth Superannuation Fund No. 2. The Bill provides for CFM to be retained as the sole investment manager of the Fund, and the Fund of the new Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, until at least 30 June 1995. After this date, it is proposed that CFM will have to compete, for the management of the Funds, with other fund managers. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now address the financial implications of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth. It does, however, provide that CFM be given a Commonwealth guarantee on initial borrowings of up to $20 million borrowed prior to 30 June 1995 for working capital purposes. As a wholly Commonwealth owned public company, CFM will be required to pay dividends to the Commonwealth. The Bill provides for exemptions from Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes on the transition to a company and transfer of assets, recognising that there has been no change in the beneficial ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVESTOCK (QUOTAS) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill and the associated Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 is to provide the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) with the power to implement and administer schemes to control the level of exports of Australian meat and livestock to particular markets where the Board of the AMLC considers such arrangements would be in the best interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Experience with the live sheep trade to the Middle East highlighted a deficiency in the AMLC's powers in respect of its ability to impose and administer schemes controlling the level of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>The AMLC, for many years, has had the power to administer quota schemes where limitations have been, or are considered likely to be, imposed by the Australian or foreign governments. This Bill will empower the AMLC to also introduce quotas on its own initiative where they are considered to be in the interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Because quota arrangements can, at times, result in windfall profits to exporters granted quota access it has been decided to empower the AMLC to sell quota entitlement by auction, tender or other means so that part of the price premium can be recouped for use for the benefit of the industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA>I would stress at this point that the AMLC will have the discretion to sell quota entitlement where it is considered appropriate. Where it is not necessary or appropriate it will continue to allocate quota without charge as it has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>To ensure all quota arrangements are equitable and seen to be equitable, the associated AMLC Amendment Bill has a clear requirement for all details of quota arrangements to be set out in the AMLC Corporate Plan which must have ministerial approval. These details must be available to all exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriate provisions are also included in the AMLC Bill to provide a right of appeal to the administrative appeals tribunal in respect of AMLC decisions regarding the period of validity of a quota and variations to quotas granted. The AMLC will also be required to publish details of all quotas sold or allocated in its annual report.This expansion of the AMLC's powers is in line with the Government's policy to encourage statutory marketing bodies to make the necessary commercial decisions to protect and foster the welfare of their respective industries. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMONWEALTH BANKS RESTRUCTURING BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill represents the completion of action by the Government which has resolved a developing crisis with the State Bank of Victoria. It will at the same time strengthen the Commonwealth Bank and enable it to develop further as a major national institution. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will create a new structure for the Commonwealth Bank as a public company, so that the additional capital it must have for the acquisition can be contributed by all Australians as joint shareholders with the Government. Grasping the opportunity to acquire the State Bank will secure the future of the Commonwealth Bank as a flourishing enterprise, and a central one in Australia's economy. The acquisition of the business of the State Bank will bring the Commonwealth Bank the substantial share of the banking market in Victoria which it has lacked until now, and will make it the largest Australian bank in terms of domestic assets. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Bank will become for the first time in its history a major institutional force. The purchase of the State Bank will enable it to mount a competitive challenge which the other major banks will have their work cut out to meet. The great strength of the State Bank of Victoria is as a retail banking business. </PARA>
<PARA>For a time earlier this year the losses sustained in Tricontinental Holdings, its merchant bank subsidiary, and losses in the State Bank itself, threatened to overwhelm it. If the public had come to doubt the ability of the Victorian Government to deal with the enormous financial consequences of Tricontinental's losses, confidence in the State Bank would have been undermined. It is Australia's fifth largest bank with extensive liabilities overseas, and a loss of confidence in it would have threatened the very stability of Australia's financial system. This was a situation which the Commonwealth Government could not allow to occur. Fortunately the Victorian Government for its part faced up to its responsibilities, and decided that given its own budget position, the only fully adequate way to deal with the situation was to offer the State Bank for sale. </PARA>
<PARA>That decision does the Victorian Government credit. </PARA>
<PARA>It offers a sharp contrast to the circumstances of the Commonwealth Bank's acquisition of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales in 1931, which are worth briefly recalling. </PARA>
<PARA>During 1930 a run on deposits in the Government Savings Bank had developed. It reached panic proportions in March and April of 1931, and culminated in the closing of the bank on 23 April 1931. Negotiations between the Commonwealth Bank and the NSW Government eventually led to the acquisition of the Government Savings Bank by the Commonwealth Bank, but not before great distress had been caused to the people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The tragedy of it was described by J.T. Scullin in another place on 16 October 1931:</PARA>
<PARA> Had the serious position of the State Savings Bank been firmly grappled with a few weeks before the bank closed, the business could have been taken over by the Commonwealth Bank as a going concern without financial loss to the Government or people of New South Wales'. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case, the State Bank of Victoria is being taken over as a going concern, and a valuable one now that Tricontinental has been separated from it. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the Commonwealth Bank it will continue to serve the people of Victoria. The Commonwealth Bank, after its due diligence review of the State Bank, signed on 8 November a contract to buy it for $1600 million. That price reflects the addition which will be made to the net earnings of the Commonwealth Bank when it has added and integrated the business of the State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will authorise the payment of an amount not exceeding $413 million as compensation to Victoria for the revenues forgone through the Victorian Government's sale of the State Bank and the tax losses it has agreed not to access after taking Tricontinental back into direct ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>The payment will be made in the near future, when an agreement is in place specifying the tax-related conditions and a mode of payment which involves debt redemption by the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The other main purpose of the Bill is to restructure the Commonwealth Bank and convert it into a public company, in order to raise from the public the additional capital necessary to fund the Bank's acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the value of the Commonwealth Bank as an institution, and the services which it provides to the community, which are paramount-and not whether it is exclusively Government owned. </PARA>
<PARA>The structure we are creating, with the Government as permanent majority shareholder and non-government shareholders as a substantial minority, will give the Commonwealth Bank access to additional capital while preserving its unique quality as a Government-owned major bank. The Commonwealth Bank as a Government-owned and Government-guaranteed bank has a vital place in our financial system. It represents an entirely secure place to deposit money, which is something that many customers throughout Australia value. </PARA>
<PARA>It represents a discipline on other banks in the kinds of credit risks they can assume, and so contributes to proper banking practice in the system as a whole. The Bank has established its track record as a commercial and profitable business under full Government ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>Under this Government the Commonwealth Bank has become more commercially oriented, more soundly managed, better equipped for the future, and more profitable. That strong record is a good basis from which the Commonwealth Bank's first offer of shares to the public can be launched. </PARA>
<PARA>The advent of non-government shareholders will not require the Government to become a passive shareholder and to disappear from the picture. The Government will be carrying the responsibility for the Government's guarantee of the liabilities of the Bank, which is not to be altered by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will also be carrying responsibility for the large investment of all citizens of the Commonwealth in the Bank, which will not have been diminished in any way by the issue of shares to additional shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends to know what policies are being followed by the Bank, and to see that it continues to be run wisely, efficiently and profitably. In this, the Government expects to be fully in accord with the Bank's other shareholders. With these continuing Government responsibilities in mind, the Bill will retain in the Commonwealth Banks Act a number of its existing provisions which help to define the Government's relationship with the Bank-in a few cases, with modifications to reflect the Bank's conversion to a public company. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 9, containing the Bank's``charter`` responsibilities to the people of Australia and the Australian economy, will remain. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 11, providing for an annual corporate plan to be prepared and given to the Treasurer, and containing a power for the Government ultimately to prevail in the circumstances of a formal difference of opinion, will remain. </PARA>
<PARA>A power will remain for the Treasurer to appoint the Secretary to the Treasury as a member of the Board of the Bank-which this Treasurer proposes to use. At the same time, the conversion of the Bank to a company and the issuing of shares to non-government shareholders will bring about other positive changes.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, with the conversion of the Commonwealth Bank to a share company there will be an opportunity for it to have an employee share ownership plan. The Government intends to see that there will be such a plan, established quickly, and integrated with the plan for the first issue of shares to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, part of the restructuring of the Bank done through this Bill is a change in the legal status of the Commonwealth Development Bank. It has until now been a separate Bank under the same ownership, the same Board and the same Managing Director. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will make it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, in the same way as the Commonwealth Savings Bank has been for a long time. The Development Bank's special charter will remain unaltered under its new status. It will continue to act as a specialised lender to, and financier of, small business. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the issue of shares to the public will introduce a new kind of market scrutiny of the Bank's performance. The Government intends that the Bank will be able to have its shares listed by the Australian Stock Exchange, which will maximise the tradability of the shares, and will also focus analysis on the Bank's performance relative to other listed banks. This market attention and analysis can be expected to add a further discipline and stimulus for the Bank's Board and management. </PARA>
<PARA>I now wish briefly to describe the features of the share structure of the Commonwealth Bank for which the Bill specifically provides. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreigners will be prohibited from subscribing to the first public issue of shares in the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of this restriction is to give priority to Australian residents in subscribing to shares in the Bank. However, foreigners will not be prevented from buying shares from subscribers and holding them thereafter. The wish of foreign persons to buy some of these shares in trading after the issue will add substantially to the effective demand for the shares, and hence to the prospects of success of the issue and to the market value of the new shares. </PARA>
<PARA>The proportion of voting shares to be held in aggregate by persons other than the Commonwealth will be limited to 30 per cent through the Commonwealth Banks Act. This will operate as a binding restriction on both the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>As a separate matter, the Commonwealth will be prohibited from selling any of its shares in the Bank. Through amendments which this Bill makes to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act, interests in voting shares in the Commonwealth Bank will be limited. </PARA>
<PARA>Domestic and foreign banks will not be permitted to have any interest, directly or through associate relationships, except that banks or entities within banking groups will be permitted to hold voting shares as managers or trustees on behalf of other beneficial owners. </PARA>
<PARA>No person (apart from the Commonwealth) is to have an interest exceeding five per cent of the voting shares in the Commonwealth Bank. In conclusion, the changes being made through this Bill are historic. </PARA>
<PARA>We shall have created from the existing Commonwealth Bank and State Bank of Victoria a whole new force in banking, while protecting the State Bank's depositors and the wider community of Victoria and averting a financial calamity. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE CORPORATION (SALE OF ASSETS AND ABOLITION) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1990 will provide legislative authority for the implementation of the Government's decision to sell the business of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC) and for certain staffing arrangements associated with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA>It will also provide for the abolition of the HLIC on a date to be proclaimed after the sale is completed. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed sale of the HLIC business was included amongst a number of major asset sales announced in the 1989-90 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Finance indicated on 30 October 1990 that the CIC Insurance Group has been identified as the preferred purchaser of elements of the HLIC business-and also as the proposed agent of the Commonwealth in carrying out the services required to be performed as a result of the consequential abolition of the HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA>Negotiations are currently under way with the CIC Insurance Group to finalise the detailed contract for that agency arrangement and to complete the sale of the HLIC business by 31 December 1990, if possible. </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated at the time the sale was announced, housing loan insurance is now widely available in Australia on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA>In these circumstances, there is insufficient justification for retaining the HLIC in public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, the Government has better uses for the assets which the Commonwealth now has invested in the HLIC, particularly at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>The HLIC was established in the public sector 25 years ago to meet a structural deficiency which existed in the highly-regulated finance environment of that time. </PARA>
<PARA>Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance from institutions which tended to allocate their then scarce housing funds on a least risk basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the establishment of the HLIC, a competitive private sector mortgage insurance industry has developed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with the finance industry reforms introduced by this Government, this has removed the old structural deficiency in the housing finance market. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the terms already agreed with the preferred purchaser, the CIC Insurance Group will continue the present mortgage insurance operations of the HLIC in a separately managed subsidiary, and will also act as agent for the Commonwealth in administering, under contract, the insurance obligations entered into by the HLIC before the sale comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>The CIC Insurance Group is Australia's fifth largest private general insurer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is jointly owned by the Norwich Insurance Group of the UK and the Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company, with a minority equity holding by the Chiyoda Insurance Company of Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>In its future mortgage insurance operations, the CIC Insurance Group will be required to satisfy the prudential and other requirements applied, under the Insurance Act 1973, to all private mortgage insurers by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC). </PARA>
<PARA>With its strong international backing, the CIC Insurance Group is expected to provide effective competition to the other existing private mortgage insurers, thereby helping to ensure that premiums are kept low. </PARA>
<PARA>The maintenance of competition in this industry, between firms operating on an equal footing, has been an important objective of the Government throughout this sale. </PARA>
<PARA>I am satisfied that the proposed sale arrangements will achieve that objective. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Bill explicitly continues for an indefinite period the Commonwealth guarantee on all insurance policies entered into by the HLIC prior to its abolition. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the proposed sale arrangements, the CIC Insurance Group will acquire the goodwill and physical assets of the HLIC and, having obtained a mortgage insurance licence from the ISC, will write new mortgage insurance policies on its own account in future. </PARA>
<PARA>The HLIC itself will be abolished after the sale is completed and its remaining assets and liabilities will then revert to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth will contract with the CIC Insurance Group to manage, as its agent, the administration of the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations entered into by the HLIC prior to its abolition. Moneys will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account established by the CIC Insurance Group, and replenished as and when necessary, to meet claims against the pre-sale insurance obligations of the HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA>To help it continue the business, the CIC Insurance Group will employ the bulk of the present HLIC management and staff on terms which, overall, are comparable to those they now enjoy. The HLIC has a staff of over 50. </PARA>
<PARA>Equitable treatment of the present HLIC employees, and their continued welfare, has been a major consideration for the Government in developing the staffing arrangements associated with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA>The great majority of the present HLIC staff and management will be able to continue their careers in mortgage insurance on terms as good as or better than at present. </PARA>
<PARA>Those few to whom the CIC Insurance Group decides not to offer equivalent employment will be made redundant by the HLIC prior to the sale completion date and will receive all of the Award and other entitlements due to them in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Since those who accept equivalent employment with the CIC Insurance Group would otherwise lose some accumulated entitlements, the Commonwealth will contract with the CIC Insurance Group for the re-instatement of certain redundancy benefits and sick leave credits. </PARA>
<PARA>HLIC employees transferring to the CIC Insurance Group will also have additional superannuation benefit options, over and above those normally provided on resignation. </PARA>
<PARA>Those benefits are being made available by Regulation under the authority of the new, recently enacted, section 155B of the Superannuation Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>In cases like this, where there is, in practice, an opportunity for continuity of employment when a Commonwealth business is sold into the private sector, it would be inappropriate for the Government to make all employees eligible for large redundancy payments and the associated lump-sum superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Bill deems to have resigned those HLIC employees who reject an offer of equivalent employment from the CIC Insurance Group. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar provision was included in the legislation enacted to implement the staffing arrangements, developed in conjunction with the ACTU, for the sale of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the HLIC to be abolished on a date to be proclaimed after the sale is completed. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of these arrangements, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of sale will be prepared by the HLIC. After being audited by the Auditor-General's Office, they will be tabled in the Parliament in due course. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the arrangements provided for in the Bill, all of the residual assets and liabilities of the HLIC will be transferred to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>These include both the outstanding insurance obligations of the HLIC and the investments underlying the provisions made by the HLIC to meet those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>The overall return to the Commonwealth from the sale, and the associated abolition of the HLIC, is estimated to be around $80m in net present value terms-after allowing for the costs to be incurred in future in administering the continuing pre-sale obligations of the HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA>More than $100m is expected to be credited to Consolidated Revenue in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The bulk of the return to Consolidated Revenue will come from the realisation of the investments held by the HLIC to under-pin its provisions for future claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Independent actuarial analysis suggests that these provisions by the HLIC are significantly in excess of the level required to meet claims that can be expected to arise in normal circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The final outcome will, of course, depend on the actual level of claims made against the HLIC's existing insurance obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>To a large extent, this will be determined by the state of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Any consideration of the down-side risk associated with the run down of the insurance policies in place prior to the HLIC's abolition needs to recognise that the Commonwealth is already exposed to that risk because of its statutory guarantee of the operations of the HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by pointing out to the Senate that the sale of the HLIC business is not the fire-sale of a failed operation-unlike some of the private sector asset sales we have seen recently. </PARA>
<PARA>Rather, it is the natural culmination of a successful public sector initiative which has met its original objective and, by so doing, has made it unnecessary for the Government to continue to be directly involved in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Unless the Parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the Constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries to Ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act which sets this sum, are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. The sum appropriated is to meet the cost of salaries and no more. While the Act covers the total cost of salaries it does not set the amount of individual salaries for Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, it is necessary to amend the Ministers of State Act to increase the limit on the annual sum appropriated to cover the increase in salaries as provided for in the Remuneration and Allowances Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the Remuneration and Allowances Act was to alter the commencement of several increases for all parliamentarians with increases being phased over several stages. The Act also provided for linking the basic salary level for parliamentarians to the top of the senior executive service band one in the public service. </PARA>
<PARA>In its 1989 review the Remuneration Tribunal in report No. 2 of 1990, recommended substantial increases in salary for Ministers (increases for senators and members of this Parliament were also recommended in subsequent determinations). </PARA>
<PARA>The immediate increase proposed for Ministers was disallowed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government had proposed in its submission to the Tribunal that in accordance with recent determinations for other groups in the Commonwealth sector, and consistent with the structural efficiency principle aim of simplification of salary structures, the Tribunal should incorporate expenses of office allowance for Ministers and parliamentary office holders into additional salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The principle of incorporating Ministers expenses of office allowance into salary is consistent with the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA>The increases for senators and members were for 6 per cent from 1 July 1990, 6 per cent from 1 January 1991 and for approximately 5 per cent from 1 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a similarly proportioned increase in the salaries of Ministers of State. That is Ministers' salaries are increasing in the same way that salaries of senators and members of the Parliament increase-that is from 6 per cent from 1 July 1990, by a further 6 per cent from January 1991, and by 4.8 per cent from July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>For consistency to be maintained with wage and salary movements in the community at large the Government did not adopt the full range of increases determined by the Tribunal. The national wage guidelines are completely met by the proposals adopted by the Government. With respect to ministerial salaries an ongoing link is established, as Ministers are to receive the same percentage increase in additional salaries as members of the Parliament and phased in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the costs are significantly less than would have been incurred had the Tribunal's determinations been implemented in full. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Tate) agreed to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been my practice over some years to bring occasionally before the Senate certain papers, certain pieces of writing, which I think are important and which are significant contributions to debate in Australia, and that is what I want to do tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three such papers. Two of them have been given within the context of the Liberal Party but are remarkably apolitical papers. One was given by Mr Brian Loton, the Chief Executive Officer of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. It was given to the Victorian division of the Liberal Party, Melbourne Branch, on 31 May 1990. It is a remarkably good analysis of some of the problems facing Australia and will be useful to people of all political persuasions wanting to know what is going on. It is remarkably non-party political. </PARA>
<PARA> The second paper is the Dorothy Peters Memorial Address delivered on 26 February 1990 by a State upper House member, Dr Marlene Goldsmith, MLC, entitled `Images, information, freedom and liberalism'. Again, it is a philosophical address about liberalism as she sees it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third paper is one which really attacks positions which I have taken publicly, but it has been written by Doctor Milton Luger, who is the Chief Executive of the Odyssey Foundation. Doctor Luger heads his paper, `Drug policy: Must we chose between harm minimisation or abstinence?'. It is not my intention to seek to have these incorporated in Hansard, but I do seek the leave of the Senate to table them, and I have mentioned the matter to Senator Tate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be relieved to know that I intend to be as brief as possible. I am, of course, returning once again to the theme of bank malpractice and corrupt practices which I have been advancing before the Senate for almost two years. Honourable senators will be aware of the fact that I have placed before the Senate in excess of 80 examples of what I consider to be bank malpractice and corrupt practices. They will also be aware of the fact that there is an inquiry in a committee of the other place to commence early in the new year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The very first case I tabled in the Senate two years ago related to one on Benson in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank. He has not yet resolved his dispute with the Commonwealth Bank. I will seek the leave of the Senate in a moment or two to table three documents which illustrate, for the consideration of honourable senators, the type of frustration that can be experienced by people who are in dispute with banks. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a couple of simple points about Benson's case, the details of which are known and available to interested honourable senators because I have tabled a series of affidavits previously. However, one of the things that occurred when I tabled that affidavit two years ago was that the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Don Sanders, replied to me, responding on behalf of the bank. I did not table that response because I had some doubts about aspects of it. It was tabled by Senator Stone, as he then was. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then I have, in fact, challenged other responses from Mr Don Sanders. Honourable senators will know that in one case-the Rigg case-I have actually accused Mr Sanders of what I called palpable mistruths. In another case I tabled an affidavit from one of the respondents that accused Mr Sanders of having lied to me in the Senate. On this occasion I am tabling a solicitor's letter on behalf of Mr Don Benson, who says that he believes that a third letter from the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank grossly misrepresents the realities and distorts the records contained within bank documents. I think it is very important that senators have access to the documents which I use to substantiate before the Senate very serious allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why I seek to table these documents is that attempts have been made for two years to get the Benson case before the courts to resolve it. The parties have been pursuing justice through the court avenue-which was the one that the Minister for Consumer Affairs and Justice (Senator Tate) suggested we should utilise two years ago-and have been frustrated by the banks. In fact, on four occasions the banks have refused to comply with court orders which would have allowed the case to proceed. Therefore, I seek leave to table the documents that will allow honourable senators to see what has happened in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly on what is not a major issue. The reason I rise is that I have just come fresh into the chamber from watching the evening television news. I just want to have a little bit of a grizzle about a particular item on the television news. I have very respectfully to make to the television channels a suggestion about this particular piece of news that I think it would be helpful if they adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that all honourable senators are well aware-and I know that you are, Mr Acting Deputy President-of the views that I have on censorship, and they are strongly held views. I am not suggesting that this is any form of censorship, but I think it will be helpful. A great deal of publicity has been given in recent times to the video footage of an incident staged on a Royal Australian Navy ship when sailors dressed as people from the Middle East, which incident-and I must say that I can perfectly well understand it; in fact, I do not think there would be any argument from either side of this chamber about it-has given considerable offence to the Muslim community. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not a Muslim; I am a practising Catholic. Despite that, every time I see that footage-and, regrettably, I continue to see it-I cringe. I find it offensive. I see other senators nodding. I do not think anyone would seriously argue that it was a substantial error of judgment, no doubt not considered at the time by the people concerned but certainly in the case of the people who released it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely; the honourable senator knows what I am going to say. I am glad Senator Knowles agrees with me. I have only just seen it on television again, which is why I raise it here, and I am glad to get support from the other side of the chamber on it. It was unnecessarily offensive. We now have direct substantiation of the offence this is giving to the Muslim community in Australia, who no doubt transmit this offence to their friends and relatives in Iraq. We now have direct representations from hostages who have thankfully returned to Australia that this footage has caused significant problems for the Australians who continue to be detained in Iraq.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I am saying to the television news people is that we have seen this footage enough. I find it very annoying-I think that is a mild word for it-that when they run stories, as they did again tonight, about statements the hostages themselves have made about the problems this film is still causing for our fellow Australians in Iraq, the television news bulletins accompanying these stories continue to run the most offensive sections of this videotape. They show them again and again. They did it again tonight. It adds nothing to the news story at all; it simply continues to give offence-and I understand why people are offended-to the Muslim community and obviously continues to exacerbate the very problem the news reader is commenting on while these sections are being shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I respectfully suggest to the television channels in this country that by all means they should continue quite properly to run these stories and continue to report the direct evidence we have from the returned hostages about the continuing problems this videotape is causing for our fellow Australians who are still, to the regret of us all, detained in Iraq, but they should stop continuing to screen in accompaniment to these stories the actual footage causing the offence. It may not be a major issue, but it might help a bit. </PARA>
