<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he agrees with the view expressed yesterday by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Fraser, that it is impossible for interest rate reductions to produce a big cut in inflation under the present wages policy. Does he agree that fundamental reform of the Government's wages policy is necessary if inflation is to be significantly reduced and on a sustainable basis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everybody else and I are aware of the Governor's view expressed in a speech last night. Let me say at the beginning that his views cannot, of course, be interpreted as the views of the Government or as having Government endorsement. I make the point that, in relation to the incomes accord, to date the Government has negotiated four wage-tax trade-offs with the trade union movement, most recently earlier this year when accord mark 6 was negotiated. The Government does not believe that it would be appropriate to renegotiate accord mark 6 at present or to consider a possible subsequent wage-tax trade-off at this time. The accord already provides for a substantial wage-tax trade-off. That was negotiated with an eye to preserving a substantial Budget surplus to assist with the transition to a more manageable current account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short well knows that Australia has a serious savings problem. The maintenance of substantial public savings is quite central to the Government's efforts to redress that savings imbalance. The Government is determined to protect, as far as possible, that surplus.</PARA>
<PARA> As it has always been fashionable in this chamber to draw analogies with other countries, it might be appropriate for me to draw an analogy with a country with which for five years-between 1983 and about 1987-those opposite burdened us. I refer of course to the analogy with Great Britain. The comparative outcome with Great Britain is that, while inflation is falling here, in Britain it is increasing quite sharply. At present it is around 10.5 to 11 per cent. It is too early to be speculating on what elements should be contained in Australia's next wages system. All these things have to be done with the right timing, and the Government does not believe that the timing is now.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of things in the Governor's speech which, I might say, are interesting views but which are not views accepted by the Government. I might say that the Governor's speech stands in sharp contrast, of course, to the views of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has frequently stated that fiscal policy should be tightened. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is arguing for a relaxation of fiscal policy at the same time as loosening monetary policy. Of course, everything the Governor has advocated is in the context of the Government's accord with the trade union movement. The Opposition has strenuously opposed that accord over a long period of time and has no mechanism for putting any incomes policy in this country into place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his response. Do I interpret the Minister's remarks correctly as meaning that he disagrees with the view implicit in the Governor's speech that, far from providing any solution to Australia's economic problems, Labor's accord with the trade unions has placed an unacceptably high floor under inflation which has rendered Australia increasingly uncompetitive as a trading nation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor's speech was quite wide ranging and Senator Short can draw any implications he likes from various sections of the speech. It is rather like Michael Porter's book The Competitive Advantage of Nations. All sorts of conclusions can be drawn from a book like that which serve to illustrate all sorts of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am saying by way of answer to Senator Short's question is that the Government's policy framework, set in place at the time of the Budget, will remain. There will always be people who are critical of that, and that does not matter. The Government has the responsibility of setting those policy frameworks in place and that is what we have done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can wait my turn. The Australian Government very warmly welcomes the award of the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize to President Gorbachev. Prime Minister Hawke will, of course, be writing to him to convey Australia's congratulations on the award of the Peace Prize. It is a very fitting recognition of President Gorbachev's quite invaluable contributions to bringing to an end the Cold War, which, as we all know, cast a pervasive shadow over international relations for more than 40 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we ought also to specifically acknowledge the particular role that President Gorbachev and his policies have played in bringing a much more cooperative atmosphere to bear in our own Asia-Pacific region. While not all regional problems have been resolved, the much more constructive Soviet policies that have been evident in respect of Cambodia, Afghanistan, China and the Korean Peninsular have unquestionably contributed to an easing of tensions in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA> Along with President Gorbachev's efforts in helping to build a new international order, it needs also to be said that his period in office has witnessed far-reaching changes domestically under the banners of perestroika and glasnost. I think it is fair to say that the Nobel Prize marks not only his contributions to creating a more peaceful environment internationally, but also his creation of a much greater openness and respect for human rights at home, which in turn has contributed much to the promotion of international trust. The Soviet Union today-I think even honourable senators opposite will be obliged to acknowledge-is a vastly different society from what it was just five years ago. Clearly, the changes that have been wrought-albeit not without a price-are, in very large part, due to Mr Gorbachev's vision of a more just and humane society.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me simply say that the Soviet people can be justly proud of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Gorbachev, which is a very fitting recognition of their country's positive contributions to creating a more secure and stable community of nations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade able to confirm the accuracy of widespread reports of abuses of human rights occurring in Kuwait at the hands of the Iraqi military and security forces, including accounts of murder, rape and torture? Has the Australian Government formed a view as to an appropriate response? Has the Australian Government had consultations with other nations, including our friends and allies, on this issue? Does the Australian Government believe that a coordinated initiative should be taken at the level of the United Nations, perhaps through the creation of an international criminal tribunal, in order to bring the perpetrators of such barbarities to justice? Can the Minister advise the Senate of the potential for appropriate international action to be taken?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3099" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was itself, as we all know, a grave and flagrant breach of international law. Similarly, Iraq's actions in holding foreign nationals, including Australians, as hostages continues to be a grave violation of the international law of both peace and war. The now well-documented-and it is well-documented- behaviour of the Iraqi forces in expelling the Kuwaitis from their country and systematically pillaging or destroying the country's assets and in raping, torturing and murdering Kuwait citizens unquestionably constitutes crimes of the kind that cry out for condemnation and punishment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia, in common with the rest of the civilised world, has made very clear through repeated public statements and bilateral demarches to the Iraqi authorities how much we deplore and condemn Iraq's behaviour. We have called repeatedly on Iraq to halt its present policies and practices, to withdraw from Kuwait, and to free all foreign nationals. We have strongly supported throughout the actions of the United Nations Security Council in condemning the invasion and the treatment of foreign nationals, and in putting in place an effective sanctions regime to secure these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> The time may now well be ripe for further action in the Security Council to address quite specifically the international accountability of the Iraqi authorities for their actions in relation to the invasion and occupation of Kuwait, including the question of reparations. An important element in any such accountability should in principle be the bringing to justice of those individuals responsible for war crimes or other grave breaches of international norms of behaviour. Just how this objective might be best advanced will need to be the subject of a good deal of international consultation. Difficult and sensitive questions are involved, and it is important that nothing be done which would prejudice the achievement of a speedy end to the present crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> I know from my own conversations of the last few days in New York and Washington that that consultation is occurring and Australia will continue to be part of it. Might I say, finally, that Australia will fully support any appropriate action that emerges from that consultative process. It is crucial that not just the Iraqi leadership but all those under it who are guilty of barbaric behaviour understand that they must expect to be held accountable for their individual actions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a whole series of questions and prognostications, opinions and suggestions included in that long running proposal. The first part, as I understand it, was: could I say what the price of oil is at the moment. The answer to that question is no, I cannot say that. But I can tell the honourable senator in rough order of range what the spot market says is the price of oil in the United States, in the Gulf areas and out of the North Sea. The last time I looked-which was not today-that was ranging somewhere between $34 and $37 a barrel. It went up to $40; it came down again. The price on the spot market is extraordinarily volatile reflecting any rumour that sweeps speculators in oil commodities about the possibility of conflict in the Middle East. It does not necessarily bear any relationship to what long term contract prices might be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind Senator Bell that we have based the year long average of prices in this Budget on $23 a barrel. We think that the short range volatility is by no means any indication of what the year run average will be. They are my observations as best I can to answer the first question. To go beyond that seems to me to suggest that I should enter a debate with the honourable senator about the economics of ethanol. I am quite happy to do that but I am not sure that Question Time is the right venue, and I am sure that the honourable senator would lose the debate because ethanol is universally regarded as uneconomic. Those countries that have got into ethanol production have massive subsidies imposed as costs on all taxpayers and not just on consumers of motor fuel, and as well they have incurred-Brazil being an example-massive environmental damage as areas of forest are cleared to make way for the necessary plantations to grow the cane to provide the ethanol base.</PARA>

I congratulate the Minister on his rare outburst of economic rationalism which has also been supported by many responsible commentators including Julian Disney on behalf of the Australian Council of Social Service. Is the Minister disappointed that the Treasurer is currently against this very sensible proposal on the grounds that it would be `difficult politically and industrially'-pure code which is easily translated as `Bill Kelty is against it.'?

I also said in the course of the same discussion that in any event what Senator Alston said was not at the heart of the debate. At the heart of the debate is the question of lump sums. The difficulty for any government in trying to move on that is the resolute opposition of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and employers. I do not know that that means that over the longer term it ought not be tackled. That is the real heart of the debate, if we are concerned about double dipping.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I am quite aware that a magistrate in Sydney criticised a senior officer-at least one senior officer-of my Department. No doubt the senior officer of my Department will take note of those criticisms. But, having said that, I do not know where that particularly takes us, if I might put it in those terms. I think the cost to the taxpayers of the litigation was established in the Estimates Committee. I cannot recall the precise figure, but we will have an opportunity to establish the cost anyway, because we undertook to provide the honourable senator with answers to questions of that kind during the Estimates Committee hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The burden of the failure of the case brought against Midford Paramount by the Australian Customs Service was that the Customs Service clearly did not know, in instructing the Director of Public Prosecutions, that there had been a secret agreement entered into between the Government and Malaysia relating to quotas on textiles and so on. I do not need to go to the substance of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable senator full well knows, the agreement was negotiated in 1977 by the Fraser Government. It was not much good usually in negotiating agreements, but it was pretty clever in negotiating this one because right from the beginning it was said to be a secret agreement, as I understand it, and it was secret. It was secret from me; it was secret from a whole range of people in the Department and in other departments. If a prosecution fails because there was a secret agreement negotiated by a government, I would have thought that was a very legitimate reason for a prosecution failing in the circumstances in which this one did.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop asked me whether I knew of the secret agreement and the answer is no. As I have said, I did not know of a secret agreement. It really worked. It really was a secret agreement. Of all the things I might say about the spiritual heirs in this place of honourable senators opposite in those days when they were in government, one thing I must say about them is that they clearly had a skill which I did not recognise until quite recently, that is, a capacity to negotiate secret agreements. I have not given them credit for all of that in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently Senator Bishop says that the agreement was referred to in the Australian newspaper, I think in 1989. I have no knowledge of that, Senator. I received notes at various times about Midford Paramount's alleged breaches of Customs regulations, but I did not receive any briefing about the secret agreement at that time because, as the honourable senator full well understands from her listening at the Estimates committee, officers of the Department were not aware of it either.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 March 1990, as part of the child and family services initiative, the Prime Minister announced an increase of about $15m over the next three years to assist agencies to extend marriage counselling, marriage education and family mediation programs to unserviced and underserviced districts, with particular emphasis on services to disadvantaged families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To complement the strengthening of these existing programs, my Department will also be implementing a pilot preventive program called family skills training, which will focus on developing parenting skills. The Government is aware that there are very few sources of sound advice on parenting.</PARA>
<PARA> This contributes to the difficulty parents experience in dealing with children and perpetuates the cycle of disadvantage when these children in turn become parents. Family skills training will attempt to address the isolation, sense of failure and loss of self-esteem that some parents experience in raising children.</PARA>
<PARA> The program will commence in January 1991 with a limited number of services in some States, and a total expenditure of $213,000 in 1990-91. It is anticipated that the program will be expanded to other States in later years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. The first part of the question relates to whether we have any plans to intervene in the oil dispute. To answer that question I should report to the Senate that last night there were negotiations between the unions and the companies involved. As a result of those negotiations, it is my understanding, confirmed today, that unions are putting proposals to their memberships. On that basis it seems to me to be inappropriate for the Government to take action because it seems, reasonably, that a process which could lead to a settlement is under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not say by those remarks that I make a judgment about the likely outcome of that process. But I do say that it is a sign that the normal negotiating processes are coming to a conclusion. On that basis we do not have a plan to take particular action. That is not in any way to be read as meaning that we are not concerned about the problems created for ordinary motorists, industry, and others who rely upon the oil industry. We are certainly concerned about that.</PARA>
<PARA> The best illustration of our concern was the involvement by the Prime Minister over the weekend in this matter. However, it is always a matter of quite delicate judgment as to the role of a government in an industrial dispute. In view of my report to the Senate, it is our judgment that we should wait for that process of reporting to meetings of members of unions to conclude before we say anything else on the subject.</PARA>

Does this report contain criticisms of the terms of the Government-Australian Council of Trade Unions accord and suggest that the Budget forecast for inflation, unemployment and wages growth will be significantly overshot? Can the Minister advise honourable senators whether Professor Blandy's criticisms are soundly based?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Adelaide Advertiser of 3 October reported on page 3 under the heading `Pay accord threatens disaster'. Because of the report I noted that the latest Bulletin of Labour of the National Institute of Labour Studies Inc., based at Flinders University and headed by Professor Richard Blandy, contains an article by the professor forecasting that we will overshoot our predictions in this Budget on inflation, unemployment and labour costs and do so quite significantly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I checked the actual bulletin for fear that maybe Professor Blandy was not being reported as accurately as possible. I must say that the report in the Adelaide Advertiser is a fair representation of the opinions Professor Blandy expressed in the bulletin. I might also say that in the bulletin Professor Blandy goes further and offers advice to employers to do things which bear a remarkable similarity to advice that the shadow spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard, offered employers the other day: to conduct direct negotiations and effectively to bypass the arbitration system.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Blandy is regarded by many as a national expert in labour economics. He has been for some time the head of a prestigious institute. He is frequently sought out for public comment. People in that situation can sometimes find themselves in the difficult situation of commenting as an academic, talking about matters based on study and scholarship. They can also be regarded as political players in the field and political commentators. In this case it is a risk that Professor Blandy ran and he has fallen into the second category.</PARA>
<PARA> The opinions he offers in his article are in no way related to events in the Gulf and do not affect the fundamental calculations in the Budget because of any issues arising from the Gulf. The trouble with what Professor Blandy has said is that his calculations contain a significant technical error, an error which, if committed by an undergraduate in economics, would result in that undergraduate failing. Because it is a technical error involving a long technical discussion, I table an explanation of that error. In colloquial terms it can be described as a statistical mistake in which the Government forecasts in the Budget are worked out on year average figures but Professor Blandy's forecasts are worked out on over the year figures, which means that his forecast is inflated by between 3 1/2 per cent and 4 per cent in the relevant places.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude the answer by saying that this is not the first time that the Bulletin or the Institute have been wrong in their forecasts on the economy. They have a tendency to dramatise and inflate their forecasts. They constantly ignore the record of the accord in delivering on the forecasts of wages growth; in fact, on this occasion they ignore the fact that last year wages growth was, in fact, half a per cent under what was forecast in the Budget. Sadly, it must be said, therefore, that the Institute and, indeed, Professor Blandy in this case, are not reliable economic witnesses or reliable in terms of their academic work on matters of this sort.

Is this accusation correct?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of this article and of the statement made by the National President of the RSL. I regret to inform the Senate that I am informed that the article is inaccurate and misleading and, no doubt, has caused quite a deal of distress to many veterans throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The President of the RSL neglected to do what other ex-service and widows' organisations have done-they have contacted the Department to clarify the issue-and, I am sure, had he done so the article would never have been written.</PARA>
<PARA> He would have found out that there are two distinct initiatives concerning tax file numbers which have an impact on pensioners. The first of these is the need to supply tax file numbers to banks and other financial institutions. This initiative affects every member of the community and is being administered by the Australian Taxation Office. The legislation that authorises these provisions was passed by the Parliament in 1988 and became effective in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> An extensive advertising campaign to inform the general public was undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office. Because the legislation exempts recipients of certain Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions, the Tax Office has sought separately to advise those pensioners of their status.</PARA>
<PARA> A special booklet was prepared for veterans by the Australian Taxation Office, and this was sent by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to all its pensioners accompanied by a letter specifying whether or not the individual was exempt. The letter and pamphlet also emphasised the requirement for those who are exempt to advise their bank or financial institution of their exempt status. Failure to advise of exemption could result in tax being deducted from their interest at the maximum marginal rate.</PARA>
<PARA> That is quite distinct from the second initiative which was announced in the 1990 Budget. This was to extend to all the recipients of benefits from the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and the recipients of payments under the first home owners scheme by the Department of Community Services and Health, the requirement to supply a tax file number to those departments. The legislation to enable this initiative to proceed in veterans affairs is still before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the letter in the booklet to veterans about the first initiative was being sent after the Budget announcement, a paragraph was added to the letter explaining that the requirement to supply tax file numbers to financial institutions had no connection with the recent Budget announcement. Reference to the second initiative in this letter was to reinforce the fact that the Department of Veterans' Affairs did not want pensioners to advise it of their tax file number at this time. It stated that the Department of Veterans' Affairs would contact pensioners when their tax file number was required by that Department. This will not happen prior to Parliament passing appropriate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I agree that this is a rather long and complex answer but it is necessary in order to try to make it clear to the National President of the RSL what the real situation is. I believe that he has confused two initiatives. As a result of his confusion, he has written an article for publication which will cause unwarranted stress and confusion in the veteran community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that between now and 1995, when we will see pensioners not paying tax, all of us ought very carefully to examine the consequences of that decision because it will mean that the effective marginal tax rate for those just above the payment of tax will be enormous. There will be an incentive for people to get down into that pension bracket so that they will gain the benefit of not having to pay tax. If we add fringe benefits to that, I think the incentives will be great indeed. So we ought to be looking at that question during the course of the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable senator would know, there is very considerable pressure from superannuants' organisations for the extension of fringe benefits to their members as well. I would hope that nothing I have said would suggest that we would be anxious for millionaires and the very rich to get these privileges, because we would not.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that in 1978 85 per cent of all of our pension age population was on the pension and that this proportion is now down to 77 per cent, and that the amounts that people are receiving in pension are tending to go down-and the trend downward occurs because more and more people are coming into retirement with some superannuation-I think we are going to see some savings coming forward that have hitherto not been given great consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> I would not seek to pre-empt debate on the way in which we should allocate those savings. But the Commonwealth would certainly be interested over the next few years in considering, as at least a first step, the extension of benefits to all those on the pension, even to those ones currently above the income levels. I think that numbers something like 300,000 or a little more. The cost would be comparatively minor for us to do that. But, of course, the cost to the States, when one takes into consideration council rates, registration and what have you, is certainly greater.</PARA>
<PARA> I saw Mr Greiner's estimate that we would be looking at costs of $200m for New South Wales alone. The Commonwealth's estimate would be somewhere between $100m and $200m for the whole of Australia. It is very difficult to put an absolute figure on it because there are no reliable statistics on the actual usage of some of those concessions. In any event, the concessions vary dramatically from State to State. So, I do not believe that anyone in the country can actually place a figure on it.</PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the Commonwealth has sent a paper to the States. No doubt there will be some discussion on it either at the meeting of the Premiers in the next few weeks or at the one after that. This suggests, at least as a first step-as far as some are concerned, no doubt it will be the last-that the Commonwealth would like to extend benefits to those on pensions who are not receiving them. But we have not decided to do that in isolation. Had we done so, it would have placed a burden on the States and we are anxious to avoid doing that.</PARA>

They are industries where women of non-English speaking background are concentrated; where the jobs, in the main, are unskilled; and where there is a low proportion of female workers who are unionised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is: were there any conditions placed on the miners that related to the military use of that training area, bearing in mind the fact that safety ranges and safety distances for the use of munitions are increasing? Given the fact that this is an area of about 17,000 or 18,000 acres which is going to be excised from the training area, has the Government any right to cancel the leases at a future time if it finds it needs that to operate the training area in its proper manner?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit that I am a bit surprised at this question coming from Senator MacGibbon. He does, however, quite rightly give me responsibility for the land in question, at Shoalwater Bay in central Queensland. He is also quite right when he says that the Cabinet last night considered the application for mining leases for 21 years over the area sought by the company involved, Murphyores Inc. Pty Ltd, which is a subsidiary of the Pivot Group Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government in coming to its decisions took three considerations into account. One, of course, was the economic nature of the proposal. Secondly and most importantly, we took into account the environmental value of the area-the fact that the area is recognised as having immense environmental value. Thirdly, and also most importantly, the Government took into account the fact that the Department of Defence uses this part of the east coast as an important staging post for exercises. In fact, amphibious exercises are conducted at Shoalwater Bay.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon is quite right when he says that 21 conditions pertaining to environmental matters have been applied with respect to the granting of the leases. I think it is fair to say that those conditions all up amount to an extremely stringent and protective regime of conditions to ensure that environmental concerns are protected.</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the Government's decision was to recognise that the Defence Department has had and still has a continuing interest in the area. The Government decided in granting the leases that the exercise of the mining leases shall be subject to the satisfactory conclusion of a memorandum of understanding and standard operating procedures between the proponent company and the Department of Defence. We feel that this precondition to the exercising of the leases, which will ensure that a memorandum of understanding is in place, will protect the defence interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time yesterday Senator Chapman asked me a question concerning Australia Post's Selectmail service and the brochure advertising the service, which states that lists Australia Post establishes will not be recorded or copied by any supplier of goods and services. Senator Chapman expressed concern that Selectmail lists would be hired out to advertising agencies to facilitate the distribution of advertising material and that such a practice directly contravened the privacy of individuals. I gave an undertaking to Senator Chapman that I would provide him with information additional to that which I had provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I explained yesterday, Australia Post operates as a list broker in the same way as other organisations in the area of direct mail.

Australia Post complies with accepted industry list rental practices to ensure confidentiality of list details and to maintain the integrity of its lists.</PARA>
<PARA> The conditions of rental are: renters do not view list details; copies of names and addresses are not made available to the renter; and the list is generally supplied to a mailing house which addresses and dispatches the mailing packages supplied by the renter and then returns the list to the owner. The mailing house must be a member of the Direct Marketing Association. The Selectmail lists will be held and managed on behalf of Australia Post by South Australian Database Pty Ltd.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday 11 October following a report in the Telegraph-Mirror on the admission by Professor Hermann Buhl about the use of anabolic steroids in East German sports training programs for almost 20 years, I was asked a question by Senator Michael Baume concerning the appointment of East German coaches by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC). I undertook to seek Mrs Kelly's advice. I have now done so and provide the following information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Five East German coaches are currently, or are soon to be, involved in programs funded by the ASC. The programs are the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) residential programs of cycling and rowing and the State based intensive training centre programs in cycling and rowing. The coaches concerned are: Michael Hubner, an AIS cycling coach, who will undertake a 10-week contract commencing in November 1990; Theo Korner, an AIS rowing coach, currently on a six-month contract which will conclude in November; Heiko Salzwedel, a coach with the intensive training centre in cycling; and Stefan Muelberg and Harrald Jahling, both with the intensive training centre in rowing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Commission is unaware of any information or allegations which would lead it to believe that any of these coaches have been, are, or are likely to be, involved in providing anabolic steroids to Australian athletes or promoting their use. However, the ASC will undertake a thorough investigation of this matter and report its findings to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and after that report I will happily pass it on to the Senate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked a number of questions from Senator Macdonald, Senator O'Chee and Senator Boswell on the operations of the Ravenshoe Mill. I have a very lengthy answer which has just been handed to me that the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has been working on. I am happy to have that incorporated in Hansard. I seek to make just a few preliminary points from it. They are: in terms of whether negative covenants should have been included, it should be noted that the agreement itself was drawn up by the Attorney-General's Department, and given that we had a list of things upon which the money could be spent we did not seek to canvass what it could not be spent on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The company was not required to provide quarterly reports. Senator O'Chee suggested it should have been. It is not normal commercial practice on a 10-year loan for quarterly reports to be provided and so they were not. But even had they been, particularly in the light of subsequent events, there is no guarantee that they would have shown up anything at all that would have led the Commonwealth to take any earlier action.</PARA>
<PARA> Any suggestion that the Commonwealth could have sought to have a charge over assets that placed it in front of Westpac Banking Corporation would, of course, have meant that we could have provided no assistance. Westpac was never going to agree to that. Placer Pacific Ltd, which was also in front of us, discharged its obligations in December 1988, and after that the Commonwealth was placed second in the queue. But any suggestion from the National Party that we should have come first would have meant, of course, that the town of Ravenshoe and the mill would have been provided with nothing. I seek leave to incorporate this very long answer.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Wet Tropics of Queensland was inscribed on the World Heritage List in December 1988, following its nomination on 11 December 1987. In April 1988 the Commonwealth Government announced a three year $75.3 million package of adjustment assistance measures for adversely affected businesses and individuals. This package sought to minimise the socioeconomic impact of the cessation of commercial forestry operations within the Wet Tropics on the North Queensland timber industry and its former employees. The elements of the package include:</PARA>
<PARA> - provision of compensation to substantially and directly affected timber and closely related businesses;</PARA>
<PARA> - provision of labour adjustment assistance for eligible retrenched timber industry workers, including dislocation allowances, retraining, relocation, wage subsidy and early retirement components; and</PARA>
<PARA> - provision of employment for eligible retrenched timber industry workers in the areas of reforestation, management of the World Heritage Area, public works to develop regional infrastructure and by providing seed funding for private and community initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>To date, 97 businesses closely associated with the sawmill industry have applied for compensation and 70 have received compensation offers. Payments have been made to 60 businesses. There have been 27 rejections and the remaining applications are currently being assessed. Compensation offers are based on commercial assessments of the value of the business made by an independent firm of accountants.</PARA>
<PARA>The package demonstrated the Commonwealth was ready with the jobs and money to honour its commitment that the listing would not disadvantage the people of North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision to assist the APS sawmill at Ravenshoe was based on the Government's commitment to minimise the impact of World Heritage Listing by retaining the sawmill as the major employer in Ravenshoe.</PARA>
<PARA>The APS sawmill is owned by Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd division of National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd (NAP) trading under the name Timbertech.</PARA>
<PARA>APS operated a veneer and sawn timber mill in Ravenshoe (population 2079), where it has been the principal employer. By its payments of wages and employment of contractors the sawmill contributed about $3m annually to the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Until World Heritage listing the sawmill had an entitlement to about 12.5% of the Crown rainforest timber quota in North Queensland. A small volume of logs from private sources was also processed.</PARA>
<PARA>Before negotiations began to provide assistance to APS, ACIL Australia Pty Ltd and Price Waterhouse and Co. were commissioned to evaluate probable impacts of World Heritage nomination on APS and to recommend appropriate compensation or alternative measures which might allow the company to continue to operate.</PARA>
<PARA>Two options were available:</PARA>
<PARA>a- to allow the company to close down and provide compensation to the owners on the same terms as the other timber companies; and additionally, provide alternative employment for up to three years for redundant APS employees;</PARA>
<PARA> b- to provide financial assistance to the company to enable it to shift to processing a mature plantation timber resource which was available from the Atherton Tableland region, and retain as many jobs as possible for employees who would have been made redundant by closure of the sawmill.</PARA>
<PARA>The provision of assistance depended on successful negotiations with the Queensland Government for 16,000 cubic metres of pine timber per annum to be made available to APS during the next 20 years. Moreover, the decision to make the resource available had to be made speedily so that the Ravenshoe mill could be readied to handle the plantation softwood as soon as existing hardwood log stocks were exhausted in mid-1988.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government decided to provide financial assistance to enable the sawmill at Ravenshoe to continue its operations because this was the most effective way to help secure the future of the town of Ravenshoe-assistance which the former Queensland Government was completely remiss in not providing in 1986 when it made a significant cut in the rainforest timber quota.</PARA>
<PARA>The conifer plantation resource on the Atherton Tablelands consists primarily of hoop pine and Caribbea (correct) pine, together with minor quantities of bunya, kauri, loblolly, patula and slash pines.</PARA>
<PARA>Veneer, mouldings and structural timber were to be produced by the company.</PARA>
<PARA>The assistance package was to benefit not only the sawmill but the Ravenshoe community and all North Queenslanders.</PARA>
<PARA>The assistance agreement between the Commonwealth and Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd for the sawmill comprised;</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an interest free loan of $4.5 million repayable over 10 years; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an annual subsidy totalling $2,125,000 in each year to be paid in each of the years 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the terms of the agreement the amounts of the loan and subsidy were to be used to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) continue its operations at the mill except where reasonably prevented from so doing by events beyond its control, which events shall, without limiting the generality of that expression, include strikes, equipment failures and cyclones;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) maintain a work force of at least forty persons;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) carry out its operations at the mill in accordance with good mill practice;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) carry out its timber extraction operations so as to minimise environmental impacts;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) make good operating losses;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) equip the mill to enable it to operate with respect to timber, other than timber obtained from within the World Heritage region; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) pay any stamp duty under any law of Australia on this Agreement and the charge.</PARA>
<PARA>It was recognised at the time that the company would have to meet whatever taxation liabilities were incurred in relation to the agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator O'Chee has raised the question of whether negative covenants should have been included in the agreement drawn up between the Commonwealth and the company. In essence the agreement was a list of the things that the money provided by the Commonwealth could be spent on-it did not canvass the possible things that the money should not be spent on. I am advised that such an agreement is not unusual and that the company in negotiating this agreement was fully aware that the list was meant to be limiting and that expenditure beyond that list were not acceptable under the terms of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the agreement the company was required to deliver to the Secretary of DASETT a copy of its audited balance sheet and annual report each year as soon as they were completed. The company was not required to provide the quarterly reports Senator O'Chee has suggested. The provision of these would not be normal commercial practice and not normally expected over a ten year loan.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time the Commonwealth began negotiating with Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd on an assistance agreement, that company's assets were already subject to two charges, the first given to Westpac, the second to Placer Pacific Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>Before negotiations began, the Government had decided that the assistance would be by way of a non-repayable subsidy of $8 million, (net present value). In the course of negotiation the concept became changed to a loan repayable over 10 years and four annual subsidy payments. (With a net present value of $7.6 million).</PARA>
<PARA>Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd was required to grant the Commonwealth a security, for repayment of the loan, and repayment of any portions of the subsidy which could become repayable in the event of breach of the assistance agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>Both Westpac and Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd insisted that the existing priority of the Westpac charge and Placer Pacific Ltd charge should not be changed as a result of the agreement with the Commonwealth; that is, any security the Commonwealth took would rank third. This was judged to be the best security in all the circumstances if the assistance agreement were to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth therefore took a charge on the assets of Plywood and Plastic, which ranked third after Westpac's and Placer Pacific charges. As noted above the agreement would not have gone ahead unless existing charges were recognised.</PARA>
<PARA>In the event the charge held by Placer Pacific was finalised in late 1988 and the Commonwealth then ranked second. The granting of further securities by Plywood and Plastic was prohibited without the Commonwealth's consent. This is consistent with normal commercial practice. The only other feasible alternative was not to provide any assistance at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Price Waterhouse was requested to advise on a fair and reasonable valuation of timber processing activities at APS Ravenshoe based on company records of two years trading prior to January 1988. The financial report from Price Waterhouse showed the company had been trading profitably and was in a sound financial position at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>The first audited financial report from the holding company, Plywood and Plastic was received by the Commonwealth in June 1989. On the 30 June 1988 the operating profit of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, which owned and operated the APS sawmill at Ravenshoe, according to its audited and publicly available financial report for the financial year 1987-88 after tax was $861,980. At 30 June 1988 it owed $2,335,719 to related companies in the Timbertech Group and in turn it was owed $752,957.</PARA>
<PARA>Like any good business manager the Commonwealth did not let its loan go unwatched. Officers of the Department regularly telephoned the manager of the mill to seek information on progress with the retooling. The mill was visited by representatives on several occasions. The Department's financial advisers on this issue, Price Waterhouse also monitored the operations of the mill.</PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the agreement, the Commonwealth sought from the company a copy of its audited financial reports for the financial year 1988-89 in December 1989 and again early in 1990. There was no indication at this time that there was any financial difficulty in the mill or the holding company.</PARA>
<PARA>Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd's draft set of financial accounts for the financial year 1988-89 reported a profit of $368,083. These financial statements show the company was solvent as the equity of shareholders was $2,328,474 after taking all liabilities, including its debt of $4.2 million to the Commonwealth, into account. Related companies in the Timbertech Group owed Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd $1,235,266, an increase of $482,309.</PARA>
<PARA>Advice from our accounting advisers suggests that the APS sawmill at Ravenshoe was operating at an overall profit during the entire period of the Commonwealth Government's assistance agreement from 1 July 1988 until the Timbertech Group, including Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, went into receivership.</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, the Department (as part of a mid-term evaluation of the implementation of the Wet Tropics Structural Adjustment Package) wrote to the company earlier this year, before the company advised the Government that it was seeking a buyer and before receivers were appointed to the company, to tell them that the Department's accounting advisers would be conducting a review of holding company's expenditure on the APS sawmill. However, before the review could be completed, the holding company was placed in the hands of the Receiver/Manager.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department was advised that the Receivers/Managers were appointed by Westpac Bank, the major creditors of the holding company on 20 April 1990. When the Commonwealth met the Receiver/Managers later in April 1990, the Receiver/Managers advised the Commonwealth that they intended to keep the APS sawmill operating for the foreseeable future while they attempted to sell the mill as a going concern. This included maintaining a workforce at the sawmill of at least 40 employees.</PARA>
<PARA>The financial difficulties were not discovered earlier because:</PARA>
<PARA> - the re-tooling took longer and cost more than was forecast when the financial assistance agreement was developed;</PARA>
<PARA> - the sawmill workforce has remained above forty all the time and expanded during 1990;</PARA>
<PARA> - the first loan re-payment was made on time; and</PARA>
<PARA> - the first financial report by the holding company did not reveal any financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>On 4 July 1990 the Acting Minister wrote to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd formally terminating the original 1988 agreement as of 20 April 1990 because the company had failed to meet its obligations and had gone into receivership.Pursuant to the June 1988 loan security given by Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd to the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Government required immediate repayment of the loan.</PARA>
<PARA>It is understood that Westpac Bank which holds the first charge over the company's assets will not receive full repayment of its outstanding loans even if all assets of group companies are sold.</PARA>
<PARA>Local businesses in Ravenshoe claim they are owed $500,000 in unsecured debts. I understand the core debt to unsecured creditors in Ravenshoe is in fact somewhere between $122,000 to $150,000. These debts occurred because of the commercial failure by the holding company and are not due to the World Heritage listing. They are a matter for resolution between the Receivers/Managers and the unsecured creditors.</PARA>
<PARA>On 25 June 1990 the Minister advised unsecured creditors who made representations to her that they were unlikely to receive their funds until Westpac had recovered its debts. She also said that the Government's first priority was to try to assist to keep the sawmill operating.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition approximately $1.2 million has been paid in compensation to Ravenshoe businesses that have been directly and substantially affected by the World Heritage listing. At least twenty retrenched timber industry workers in Ravenshoe have received assistance from the Commonwealth Government under the Wet Tropics Structural Adjustment Package.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have indicated, the Government decided that the best prospect for the future of Ravenshoe was to provide temporary assistance to keep the sawmill operating pending its sale as a going concern. Temporary assistance was offered for this purpose on 9 October 1990 subject to a satisfactory agreement with the Receiver/Managers, and Westpac Bank being reached. The Government is awaiting a response from the Receiver/Manager on whether this offer is acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure of moneys paid by the Commonwealth to Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd under the previous agreement has yet to be satisfactorily resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>The report to the Commonwealth by the Receivers/Managers on the 25 September 1990 indicate that there is some question about whether the loan and subsidy assistance have been applied in accordance with the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is referring the matter to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to investigate whether the Commonwealth can take legal action with respect to the moneys unaccounted for. It is not possible to release that report now, for two reasons: firstly, it is commercial-in-confidence and, secondly, possible Commonwealth legal actions should not be prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore twisted logic to blame the Government as Mike Seccombe did today in the Sydney Morning Herald ``for the mismanagement of the compensation and restructuring package.''</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the Federal Government that has done the wrong thing.</PARA>
<PARA>We have delivered our promises to the people of Ravenshoe. We provided the money in good faith and with the appropriate controls to re-tool the mill.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Party at the time was screaming for adequate financing for Ravenshoe and other towns. By any standards the amount we provided was adequate.</PARA>
<PARA>It is great 20/20 hindsight by the Nationals who are trying to stay relevant. At the time all they said was``give them the money''.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary I note that:</PARA>
<PARA> - at the time of negotiating the agreement, all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the security of the Commonwealth loan;</PARA>
<PARA> - the monitoring procedures followed were consistent with commercial practice for long term loans;</PARA>
<PARA> - the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Company was drawn up by the Attorney-General's Department. It was therefore prepared with legal advice;</PARA>
<PARA> - the financial difficulties experienced by APS, Ravenshoe are a result of difficulties elsewhere in the group and were not caused by World Heritage listing; and</PARA>
<PARA> - the Government has been and is attempting to find out exactly what went wrong. That is why this issue is being referred to the Attorney General's Department to ensure that all legal implications and avenues of redress are fully explored.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator O'Chee remarked that the 1988 agreement required only annual financial statements, not quarterly reports. On examining the material of the company's finances provided since the company went into receivership in April, there is no evidence that even full quarterly reports would have given any earlier indication of financial problems, most of which were not related to the Ravenshoe sawmill.</PARA>
<PARA>The action taken by the Federal Government is in contrast to the complete lack of assistance to businesses and employees by the former National Party Government in Queensland when it substantially reduced timber quotas and provided no realistic alternatives to logging rainforests. I believe the Commonwealth has demonstrated its commitment to assist the people of North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>We can all work wonders with hindsight. By attempting to politicise this issue, Senators O'Chee, Boswell and Macdonald have only put at risk the temporary assistance agreement recently offered by the Commonwealth. They are only using the people of Ravenshoe for their own spurious political gains.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA>The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>

<PARA>The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance which is brought before the Senate today addresses two parts of the administration of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce; namely, the part concerning the administration by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in a responsible way of his own Department and, secondly, the manner in which his Department or ministry has failed, in the eight years over which he has presided, to produce industry policy which has benefited Australia. I think it is timely to present an overview of the failure of the portfolio and the Minister in his responsibility in that over the last seven years there has been a systematic failure of Senator Button's industry policy to bring about any revitalisation of Australian industry. Whether it be through sectoral plans, the bounty and grants schemes, procurement and offsets policies, partnerships for development, which began life as a different creature, the management and investment company scheme, or the performance of the Australian Customs Service and Austrade, the Minister's Department has failed to bring about any tangible benefits for Australian manufacturers, exporters or consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a veritable mountain of documentation in the form of government and industry reports, press articles and transcripts of public statements by many an industry which demonstrate the failure of the Minister's approach. We have seen introduced several famous plans, for cars, steel and for other industry. Let us begin by looking at the car plan. The Button car plan has been a dismal failure. The Minister on various occasions in Estimates and other committees has claimed that it has been a success, but in 1984 we were told that they were bold promises; that there would be three carmakers producing no more than six models at cheaper real prices at the end of the plan. Instead, there are still five makers operating in four manufacturing groups, making eight models at greatly increased real prices. Productivity remains poor, so that it takes longer to build a car in Australia than in virtually any other country. The only export growth that has been achieved is the result of substantial subsidies to manufacturers rather than any underlying improvement in efficiency. Consumers are subsidising the industry to the tune of $1.6 billion, or $25,000 for every worker employed in the auto industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The textile, clothing and footwear industry is a sunset industry under the Button plan. We are subsidising each job in the footwear industry to the tune of a massive $70,000 a year. Effective rates of protection exceed 200 per cent in some parts of the industry, and this means that ordinary Australians pay an average of 67 per cent more for clothes, 63 per cent more for shoes and 25 per cent more for textiles than they would if there were no barriers to imports. Protection for the industry is costing $1 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good question. I will tell Senator Teague where Senator Button is; he is away preparing for the statement that he intends to make after the matter of public importance, concerning the plight of the textile, clothing and footwear industry. He will tell the Senate in his own words, in a dressed up manner, that somehow it is all the industry's fault that it has not taken the great benefits of his plan and produced a thriving and healthy industry. That is why he is not now in the chamber, Senator Teague. Nonetheless, protectionism for the industry is costing $1 billion a year, which translates into a consumption tax equivalent of about 40 per cent for consumers. Despite this massive protection, the industry appears in terminal decline.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is extraordinarily kind of the Minister. I think I can manage without reading a speech. I think I have in the past; I think I will in the future. However, it will be necessary to refer to a lot of documentation that will simply deal with transcripts, affidavits and so on when we come to a different part, addressing specific indications of the way in which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has simply not been in command of his own Department. Subsequent to the failure of his own Department, he finally decided to move some of the officers of whose advice he has previously taken note and indeed depended upon; they have finally been removed. It took a court case of some magnitude and a waste of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in order to see this accomplished. The organisation, discipline and responsible oversighting of the Department in no way came from the Minister himself. It was foisted upon him by events outside his control. We will look at those, and I will indeed read from affidavits on that occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have dealt with the textile, clothing and footwear plan and wanted to say a few things about the steel plan, which is in the same parlous state as the other two. One could say that all we have seen as a result of the steel plan is a massive subsidy paid across over a period when there were other factors at work which caused the steel industry to see some improvement. Indeed, the late Mr Holmes a'Court could perhaps take some credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the very specific examples. The first one I mention relates to one that I raised in Question Time dealing with the Midford Paramount case brought by Customs. Honourable senators would note that the answer given by the Minister at Question Time, to put it mildly, was a very cavalier answer not addressing the specific questions asked. It is important to outline just what the Minister refused to answer. The basis of this question and this case is simply this: if a Minister were exercising responsible control over his department, there is no way that a prosecution could have been laid against a company and associates alleging $4.75m worth of fraud against the Commonwealth when the fatal flaw in that case was the fact that there was in existence an agreement between the Australian Government and the Malaysian Government and that agreement was relied upon in the way in which that company conducted its business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in the Estimates Committee C hearings, tried in a rather pathetic way to have evidence brought forward. The head of Customs, Mr Kelly, sat there for the best part of an hour and, in answer to every question asked, simply said: `I do not know; I cannot remember; I have not got the information with me; I will get it for you, Senator'. Yet this very case had been reported in the press the previous Sunday and the Minister had been sufficiently concerned, on my information, to summon Mr Kelly to see him and to brief him on the case. </PARA>
<PARA> When I asked Mr Kelly whether he was aware that this matter would be raised in the Estimates hearing, he answered, `Yes'. I asked him whether he had done any preparation. He said `Yes'. I said, `Please tell me what area in which you have done that in order that I can try to find a question to ask you'. He thought that might be a fishing expedition. I thought it might be very small pond in which to fish because, quite clearly, we were conducting an exercise in obfuscation. </PARA>

Then we might look at the recommendation from the Law Council of Australia concerning the behaviour of the Australian Customs Service, and then we look at the way in which the Minister has simply shown that he has no interest, no concern, not even a glimmer of regret that he has seen his Department simply mishandle a particular case. There are others in the pipeline as well, but the history of this one will suffice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1977 an agreement was entered into between the Australian Government and Malaysia granting concessions to members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. In October 1987 Midford offices were raided in relation to a fraud investigation undertaken by Customs agents concerning documents which led to a new investigation. On 4 January 1988, Customs asked the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to consider prosecution. On 6 January 1988 search warrants were executed against Cramb Tariff Services (NSW) Pty Ltd and the proprietor of that firm. In an affidavit provided by the DPP, it was said that she met with representatives of Customs and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC) in the months leading up to the trial in 1988 to discuss available evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 January 1988 a raid was conducted on the offices and home of Mr Rodger and documents were removed. On 7 March, Midford Paramount was advised that investigations by a prosecution solicitor were under way. Between that time and the beginning of a prosecution, employees of Mr Rodger were rung up by members of Customs and were told that he would be going to gaol and that a prosecution was being brought. They were generally harassed and he lost staff.</PARA>
<PARA> In April 1988 DITAC, in the person of one Dr Fitzpatrick, a First Assistant Secretary upon whose advice and information the Minister has relied and whom the Minister has defended over a number of years in various hearings, was asked to present a brief concerning the background of the way in which these quotas were exercised. Indeed, there is sufficient evidence to say that the DPP decided to bring the prosecution based on that brief prepared by Dr Fitzpatrick. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fitzpatrick, in that particular brief, and in his own affidavit, having outlined the history of the way in which quotas were granted in various categories to people who were manufacturing offshore, asserted that for quotas that were granted, first, via the anomalies register and, second, by a scheme that replaced it in 1982, it was necessary for the garments that were being imported to be manufactured in a company controlled by the person who held the quota. On page 7 of his own affidavit, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Once Midford (Malaysia) ceased manufacturing on behalf of Midford, Midford would no longer have met the criteria for offshore quota.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in a document where he begins by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I am aware that if I sign this statement, and any part of this statement is untrue to my knowledge, I may be liable for punishment. </PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is DITAC's invariable practise to advise the Australian Customs Service to withdraw quota once it has been advised of circumstances which altered an importer's eligibility for quota. </PARA>
<PARA>In cross-examination, Dr Fitzpatrick had to admit that there was no such precedent, that he did not know of any such quota which had been withdrawn in this way, and that he had only been aware of a quota which had been handed back. He admitted that that was not part of the responsibility of his Department within DITAC, but merely the responsibility of Customs. This was a document which was relied upon by the DPP to bring this particular prosecution, which reliable investigation will show has cost the taxpayer anything up to $1m, and yet the magistrate said of Dr Fitzpatrick and Mr Petering:</PARA>
<PARA>The two principal witnesses, Mr Fitzpatrick and Petering at least the principal witnesses at this stage were called to prove the conditions. I have no doubt whatsoever that they were never in a position to prove the conditions and it is an inescapable conclusion and one that I find without hesitation but either these two gentlemen misled the prosecution or the department officers selectively provided information to their superiors on the basis of these conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>As was disclosed from the Cabinet papers and other confidential papers-I might say that those Cabinet papers were subpoenaed by Midford-the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Cabinet Office sought to have those records kept off the public record and if it had been successful, then the prosecution would have proceeded and possibly conceded to a successful conclusion by the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> The magistrate had the good sense to overrule the intervention by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and said, quite frankly, that DITAC had misled the prosecution, that the prosecution had been badly prepared and that the proper evidence was not prepared. His final conclusions about the evidence presented was that DITAC was totally discredited. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is my strong opinion that there was a duty cast upon those whose responsibility it was to prepare the statements for the prosecution, to have done so objectively and with no other motive than to disclose facts which were a fair representation of those facts. In my opinion, this was not done. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister seems to think that it is quite satisfactory for him to stand aside and to say that it is not his problem. Under our system of government, when this sort of thing has been going on for over a 12-month period, for the Minister to say that he was not aware of any of this impropriety, nor of the agreement itself until he read about it in an article by Bruce Jones in the Sun-Herald the Sunday before last, is simply not acceptable. There were articles that were published in 1988 that were clearly leaked by Customs, and there were articles published in 1989, and still the Minister did not bother. This is only one example. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look again at the way in which the offsets and partnerships in development schemes have been administered. We are asked by the Minister time and time again to trust the statements that he makes which say that partnership in development agreements are being honoured and that we are all benefiting from them. To disclose the particulars would mean very simply that he would be disclosing commercial-in-confidence material and he could not possibly do that. </PARA>
<PARA> This is only one example. We should look again at the way in which the offsets and partnerships in development schemes have been administered. We are told by the Minister time and again that we have to trust the statements that he makes that partnerships in development agreements are being honoured and that we are all benefiting from them. To disclose the particulars would mean very simply that he would be disclosing commercial in confidence material and he could not possibly do that. </PARA>
<PARA> But that did not prevent him back in 1989 from publishing a press release which said that nine of these wonderful people who are in partnerships in development had been performing well. The only trouble was that a minute from one of his departmental advisers-one Mr Constable, who works for Dr Fitzpatrick who has been moved-advised the Minister that if he couched his press release in particular terms he would camouflage the fact that three of those partnerships in development were not meeting their targets. </PARA>
<PARA> One of those partnerships was Hewlett-Packard. And guess what? The Minister is now threatening at this stage to cancel the agreement with Hewlett-Packard because it is not meeting its targets. This has been known for over 12 months. Yet, there was in effect an attempt to cover that up too. Now we see that several members of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce are about to go off to the United States of America and have a quick chat with Hewlett-Packard to see whether anything can be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that 20 minutes is a very short time in which to go through the sorts of things where opportunity has been wasted. Senator Button has garnered for himself a reputation as a Minister, it has been said, who is prepared to speak the truth. Indeed, he has meddled in other people's departments, much to the chagrin of the Treasurer, who has put his thoughts on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> But the point is this: if this country is to get out of its malaise, if we are to see an improvement in our manufacturing sector, we have to have policy developed in a sensible way in which we see the implementation of the Garnaut report and the phasing out of protection. We do not want the sort of statement that appears in today's Sydney Morning Herald where the Minister says, `What we need is a more sophisticated debate on protectionism that neither Garnaut nor the Pappas-Carter report has offered in terms of a final solution'. That will not do either. But fundamentally we have to have a Minister who is in control of his own department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said in answer to a question today that we had spent four hours on the Midford case. It was 2 1/2 hours. But three quarters of an hour was spent just trying to elicit some information. I suggest that if the Minister could take four hours out and spend it in his Department getting on top of the way things are administered, perhaps we would not have to spend so long trying to get the answers to questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Minister is not here, we are going to hear from Senator Walsh. Senator Walsh will no doubt tell us in his own inimitable way that this is an unwarranted attack. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the question has been raised, I should acknowledge that Senator Button is not here for this debate. It is true that there is a convention of long standing that if a matter of public importance is proposed or a motion critical of a Minister is moved by a member of the Opposition front bench, the Minister replies. There is no such convention that a Minister is obliged to reply to a matter of public importance raised or a motion moved by a backbencher-by any backbencher at all, let alone by a third rate Rumpole of old Riley Street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop said in her introductory remarks that this matter of public importance fell into two parts, the first part being critical of Senator Button's administration of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the second part being critical of the policy outcomes over the last seven years. That is about the only thing she got right. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Bishop is not knifing one of her colleagues, such as Senator Puplick, or making unfounded allegations about electoral fraud and roll stacking, she gives free rein to her conspiracy theories. She has a head full of conspiracy theories worthy of the Logos Foundation or the League of Rights. Quite clearly, she sees herself as the scourge of the Public Service and the nemesis of the Labor Government. She pursues these theories relentlessly in Estimates committees or she believes that she does. Her favourite conspiracy theory is that every second public servant has a Swiss bank account into which he is directing misappropriated public money. She wastes literally hours and hours of Senate Estimates committee time chasing every one of her conspiracy theories up a blind alley. Now she has decided to come in and do it in the Senate as well. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Childs, who has the misfortune of being the Chairman of the Committee and is therefore obliged to listen to Senator Bishop all of the time. As Senator Childs was there all the time, he will be replying in detail to a number of the groundless allegations that Senator Bishop has made. I have had the misfortune of listening to Senator Bishop in Estimates committees for a shorter period, but for long enough to realise that if one is to take Senator Bishop seriously, one would have to believe that about every second public servant has a Swiss bank account. </PARA>

When Senator Bishop does not see herself as the scourge of the Public Service flushing out all sorts of maladministration and misfeasance, she sees herself as somebody who is saving the taxpayers' hard earned money which is being wasted in administration. At one of the Estimates committees I sat through most of her pursuit of an alleged waste of $20,000. It was suggested to me afterwards, possibly almost correctly, that the time of the senior public servants that she had wasted in pursuing this alleged waste of $20,000 in public administration probably cost $20,000 anyway. As well as that, this pursuit of waste, as in the pursuit of her conspiracy theories, is intermingled with slurs upon public servants without any evidence whatsoever being produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop's conviction-we will give her the benefit of the doubt and say that it is a conviction-that there is maladministration of all sorts floating around this Government can probably be traced to her own experiences and her knowledge of the present coalition Government in New South Wales and the previous coalition Government in Canberra, both of which, of course, had to carry the lead deadweight of the National Party of Australia in their saddlebags. </PARA>

<PARA>Let me recite a few facts. When Senator Button became the Minister, steel production averaged 175 tonnes per steel industry worker a year. By 1988-89 it had doubled to 350 tonnes. Are we to believe that there are no net economic benefits to Australia in the doubling of labour productivity in the steel industry? Moreover-and the source of this is the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, which some people might think is suspect-in a press release issued a few months ago, BHP said that the company was on track for an output of 500 tonnes per year per employee, in 1990-91 at Port Kembla and the following year at Newcastle and Whyalla. Are there to be no economic benefits to Australia from almost trebling steel production per worker in a period of less than 10 years?</PARA>
<PARA> Growth in manufacturing output for the seven years preceding Senator Button's occupancy of this ministry averaged a paltry one per cent. Since then, it has averaged 3.4 per cent. Senator Bishop would have us believe that there are no economic benefits to Australia in more than trebling the rate of growth in manufacturing output. As to the average employment growth-positive or negative-in manufacturing: it was negative in the seven preceding years at 1.2 per cent; and it was positive-0.8 per cent-in the seven years since Senator Button became the Minister. There are no economic benefits to Australia in that, Senator Bishop would have us believe. In the seven preceding years total employment in manufacturing fell by more than 120,000; it has since increased by 65,000. There are no economic benefits in that, Senator Bishop would have us believe. Investment in manufacturing industry, annual real growth rate--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see that Senator Baume is keen to continue the tactics of the last few moments. The matter before us is one with which in some respects we can certainly agree: there has been an abject failure on the part of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in relation to the achievement of his policies and the achievement of real economic benefits. But we must point out that we have great difficulty in separating the patterns of Senator Button's progress from those of the Government of which he is a member. Quite clearly, both Mr Hawke and Mr Keating in that triumvirate of a disaster have a great deal to share in relation to the consequences which Australia now bears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our foreign debt has grown to some $8,000 per person-man, woman and child-higher than it has ever been; our interest rates are still high and remain high; contrary to the figures which Senator Walsh used a few moments ago, there is at present growing unemployment; and the degree of foreign ownership is growing apace and this Government and indeed the Opposition seem little concerned as to either the degree or the nature of that foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen as a direct consequence of government policy, a deregulatory policy, that in just the last few weeks some $6 billion has been lost by the Bond and Elliott group of companies, adding very significantly to our foreign debt. I draw attention to the fact that those losses resulted substantially in the loss of assets which had been owned by Australians for well over 100 years. I refer to the breweries. As a consequence of those losses, which again relate to the deregulatory, laissez faire policies of this Government, those assets have substantially passed into foreign hands. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic assumptions on which the Government is operating, and on which the Opposition would operate if it were the Government, are deeply flawed. We in the Australian Democrats find little difference, except in the frills and trimmings around the edges, between the basic attitudes of the Government and the Opposition. They are in favour of a deregulated market system and leaving it to the market to get the economic job done. It is manifestly obvious that that process will not get the job done, either in the important social environment sense, of which I will speak later, or even in the conventional economic sense, and I have mentioned that a number of the indices of economic welfare have indicated how poorly this Government has performed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said previously in this chamber, it should be quite obvious to anybody who thinks for a moment that the market system will not serve the interests of a society. It surprised me that for so long the idea of Adam Smith's invisible hand guiding the operation of competitive greed towards the serving of the the common good should have received even a modicum of attention and respectability, yet it appears in most textbooks in economics and clearly lies behind the attitudes to market systems of the Government and particularly the Opposition, which we hear from more often to the effect that the market system will serve the common good. There is, of course, no a priori reason whatsoever why the operation of competitive greed should serve the common good. A moment's reflection would indicate that that is a self-evident truth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also quite clear that the market which is so vaunted by the Government and the Opposition depends absolutely on perfect and instantaneous knowledge of the factors which go into that market being available universally. That, clearly, is a condition which is not met and cannot be met in any normal human society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also possible to model the market system mathematically. When one does that one can show quite explicitly that the so-called perfect market is indeed at its most unstable when it operates in that ideal form, and that it will quite rapidly hunt towards a monopoly situation. In practice, markets hunt vary rapidly towards monopoly situations. When one looks at the operation of market systems in Australia, that is precisely what one observes. As the Government has deregulated and left things more to the market, we have seen the paper shufflers move in and obtain monopoly positions in so many markets, with disastrous consequences for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that, while we agree with the basic proposition which the Opposition is putting, we do not find it any better than the Government and we believe that it may be a great deal worse than the Government. There are still a few remnant restraining forces in the Government that prevent the complete collapse of responsibility towards the operation of a laissez faire market system. </PARA>
<PARA> Market systems, of course, do efficiently allocate resources, but that is not to say that they do it equitably. One need only consider for a moment the provision of useful goods and services to the poor and useless goods and services to the rich. The operation of the market will always allocate resources to the provision of those useless goods and services to the rich, because they can afford to pay for them. So, while the market system is efficient, it is not equitable-a point which seems to have been overlooked by both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, there is no mechanism from within the market itself by which the optimal size of any particular market can be judged. Markets have a tendency to grow, and growth, as I have pointed out on many other occasions, is itself a very damaging phenomenon when markets grow beyond the optimum size, beyond the size required by society or beyond the size which is sustainable by the environment which must necessarily supply the basic resources which go into the provision of those goods and services and must absorb the pollution which flows from the production of those goods and services. So there are obvious and provable deficiencies in the market system which seem to have been overlooked entirely by the Government and by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks to the economy in the way in which we are this afternoon, reflecting on the efficiency or otherwise with which Senator Button has administered his portfolio, one must have some perception of the sort of future we will inevitably move into 15 or 20 years down the track or what sort of society we would like to create 15 or 20 years down the track. I am one who believes that, rather than simply letting the future happen, one should attempt to design the future that one wants and then move industry, move legislation, move societies and move the economic parameters towards that optimal view. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, a number of approaches that one can take. One can take the utopian approach: invent a future and make it happen willy-nilly. That, of course, is precisely what we have seen attempted to be imposed throughout eastern Europe. It was thought that one could impose a pattern from on high and that somehow by that process one could make it happen. We have seen exactly what happens in those circumstances-utopians very rapidly descend into bloody revolution and the suppression of individual freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> One can use the pragmatic approach. This is precisely the approach which is used by the Government and which would be used by the Opposition; that is, look at the system as it is, turn whatever seems to be advantageous in the short term to advantage, and then to hell with the long term consequences. There is no conception whatsoever of the sort of society in which we would like to live 20, 30 or 40 years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> We may, of course, also adopt a problem-solving approach to the future, one which takes a pragmatic view but attempts, using some criterion of social benefit, to sort out the discontinuities as they arise, or one may take the approach which the Democrats would strongly recommend; that is, a comprehensive approach which seeks to take all the best advice from all sources and out of that design a future. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, however, has made it impossible to use that latter approach because it has surrounded itself quite clearly by a group of sycophantic, philosophical clones of itself. Those are the sorts of people from whom it is getting the advice. Needless to say, that advice reflects its own prejudices and it is caught in a spiral from which it is incapable of escaping. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the determinants of the world of tomorrow if the Minister is really going to address his portfolio responsibilities with an eye to the world in which we would like to live? The most fundamental change which needs to be made is a change in the attitude which we bear in our relationship to our environment; the environment which supplies the resources on which industry itself is based. It has become quite clear, and I think even the Government is now dimly aware through its publication of a sustainable economy draft paper, that we do need to change the attitude which we have to the environment. It is the environment after all which makes available resources on which industry is ultimately based and without which industry could not function at all. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the way in which industry in recent years has used the environment, we find such problems as massive ozone depletion. This situation has arisen because we thought that we could use these new chemicals-chlorofluorocarbons-in the 1930s; we continued to expand their use throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s without thinking for a moment what happens to the environment as a consequence of their release. We now know that we have locked ourselves into a situation-Montreal protocol notwithstanding and the very best intentions in the world-where ozone depletion will continue to grow throughout probably most of the years of the next century, with quite unknown but probably quite disastrous consequences on a whole range of industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government itself has recognised that greenhouse is the most important environment problem of our time, and yet we find that Senator Button, who controls a lot of industry which has to do with greenhouse emitting industries, has studiously avoided intruding any consideration of greenhouse in such things as the much vaunted Button car plan. Indeed, just last week when I asked Senator Button a question specifically on this, he seemed to have difficulty in seeing the connection between motor vehicle efficiency in terms of fuel efficiency, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and economic efficiency in terms of the benefits which would flow to Australia by going down the greater efficiency road. Moreover, he went on and pointed out that it really was not his responsibility to do anything about carbon dioxide emissions by motor vehicles and that this was really a State responsibility. Without having any further time, Mr Acting Deputy President, I point out that this is just one indication on the inefficiency of this Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing as we do, the failure of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to responsibly oversee the administration of his portfolio, and in addressing the abject failure of his industry policy to achieve real economic benefits for Australia, what we are really debating today is the future prosperity of this country. Therefore, it would be remiss of me not to comment at the outset on some of Senator Coulter's remarks over the last 15 minutes, because I think they are really quite extraordinary. I think that both sides of the chamber would take umbrage at some of the things he has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has spoken of the market expanding beyond what he describes as an optimal size. What Senator Coulter really means by the market expanding beyond an optimal size is the economy expanding beyond an optimal size. If we are looking at the continued growth of population both in Australia and in the world as a whole, then the logical consequence of Senator Coulter's remarks is that this man advocates negative growth. He advocates at least stabilising the level of production, if not reducing it over a period of time. What that means is that for each and every Australian there will be less of the cake to go around. </PARA>
<PARA> It means that for the next generation of Australians there will be fewer of the advantages of life; there will be fewer of the comforts; and there will be fewer of the things that we take for granted. What it will mean-if we follow Senator Coulter down the rosy path that he so frequently advocates here in this chamber-is selling short the next generation of Australians, selling short some of the people who sit in this gallery today, and saying to them, `No, you cannot have a job', because Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats do not believe we should allow the productive capacity of this country to expand beyond what they consider to be an optimal size. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finally Senator Coulter has chipped in with the words `the environment dictates it'. Well fine, let us talk about the mining industry and let us talk about the environment. Frankly, I have been sitting in this chamber now since May listening to what Senator Coulter has said, and finally I get the opportunity to address some of the claptrap that he has been talking about in all that period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are going to talk about the mining industry and the environment, let us just get one fact straight, that is, the total area of Australia's land mass which is disturbed by the mining industry is half of the area that is covered by Australia's national highway. If one thinks about that four- or five-metre strip of bitumen that runs along the coast, one thinks what a tiny insignificant area of the Australian landscape that is, and if one then takes half of that, that is the area of Australia's land mass that Senator Coulter says dictates that the next generation of Australians should be without jobs because it suits his idea about optimal production. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that the next generation of Australians does not agree with Senator Coulter, and more than that, the generation after it and the generation after it do not agree either, because ultimately my generation and those which follow me will have to pay the bill for the failed policies that Senator Coulter advocated here, if he ever gets the chance to put them into effect. I am pleased to say that the people of Australia will hopefully have the good sense not to let Senator Coulter put his plans into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> But unfortunately, the people of Australia have given Senator Button seven years to attempt to put a policy together. What we have failed to see from Senator Button in all of his seven years is any responsible administration of his portfolio, and what we have failed to see is one benefit from an industry policy from the Minister, who is so conspicuously absent from the chamber this afternoon when we are discussing his performance over the last seven years. We are reviewing the last seven years of his supposed performance, and he does not even have the good grace or the courtesy to be present in the chamber for at least the slightest period of time. That shows the degree of regard that Senator Button has for the criticisms that come from this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I have got to remark on some of the things that Senator Walsh said. Most of it was vitriol and I do not intend to deign Senator Walsh's vitriol with comment, but he did bring up a couple of points. The one point that he did manage to make was that in the period from 1983 until now, steel capacity production has increased from 175 tonnes per worker to 350 tonnes per worker. But if that is the case, we still fall well short of the level of production that exists in Taiwan, where steel workers every year produce on average in excess of 500 tonnes of steel production. So, I do not think that Senator Button can exactly write home about the enormous success of his steel plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we assume that there has been an improvement in the level of steel production in this country, I do not believe that it is fair for the Senate to say that Senator Button or his policies were responsible for that increase in steel production. In fact, the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) found quite the opposite. It said, in a review of the steel plan in 1989, that the $117m of bounty payments made to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in that year had, `little effect', on the recovery of the steel industry. The BIE went on to conclude that rather than the plan, the improved industry performance was due much more to a recovery in world steel markets and a depreciation of the Australian dollar. I do not think Senator Button, for all of the miracles that that side of the chamber may vest in him-and goodness gracious, the Government has to find one Minister on that side of the chamber who has the tiniest bit of credibility-in spite of all the miraculous powers that may be claimed for Senator Button, I do not think it could be claimed that he is responsible for the recovery in world steel markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) also says that the steel industry's recovery was a result of the depreciation of the dollar and strong growth in world economies rather than the steel plan. In all the 20 minutes that Senator Walsh had, he came up with only one area where he thought that Senator Button might be responsible for some improvement in Australia's economic performance-and goodness gracious, we have found that that is false as well. That does not bode terribly well for the case that that side of the chamber is going to make out today. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem that the Government has was so ably exemplified by Senator Walsh because he took us back, as Senator Button would do, to the Fraser years. I would like to take the opportunity of pointing out to Senator Walsh and Senator Button-hopefully he will read Hansard tomorrow-and to everybody else in this chamber, that I was in primary school during the Fraser years and the mindset that afflicts that side of the chamber, this perpetual harping back to the Fraser years, this desire to blame everything including the current high interest rates on the Fraser years, is the problem which is afflicting this country. What the Government is failing to do eight years on from the Fraser period is to start to address the problems that this country has. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect I agree with Senator Coulter that the high interest rate policy that that side of the chamber has inflicted upon the Australian people for the last two years has been the reason why we have seen an enormous growth in Australia's foreign debt, why we have seen so many manufacturing industries go down the chute, and why we have seen so many cheap imports come flooding into this country. Finally, we may be seeing some sort of improvement in interest rates. But no matter how far the Government has brought the interest rates back in the 10 months of this year-and let us not be deceived-there is still a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> In Estimates Committee A, as Senator Childs well knows, we heard from the officials in the Treasury Department that interest rates in Australia remain 8, 9 or 10 per cent above comparable interest rates in the United States. If we are going to talk about economic efficiency, if we are going to be talking about the efficiency of the manufacturing sector, we have to look at the cost of funding and it is very clear that Australian companies cannot compete with American companies when it costs an Australian company 9 or 10 per cent more every year to run its overdraft. That is really the reason why the manufacturing sector has declined under this Government and under this Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go through the much vaunted Button car plan. First perhaps we ought to talk about Senator Button's scuffle with Minister Kelly. Senator Button said quite recently that he was hoping profoundly that, `We are hanging on to the best, but there will be some good ones'- he was talking about businesses-`that will disappear. There is no doubt about that, and that concerns me'. Thank goodness for that. If it did not concern Senator Button, I would be even more worried. Minister Kelly came back to him and said, in tones rather reminiscent of Senator Coulter:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there may have been reasons why projects have been stalled at the moment. A lot has to do with economic factors rather than environmental factors. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button on that side tried to bring in some industry leaders to blame the failure of his industry policy on Minister Kelly. This is great teamwork, is it not? He tried to blame it on Minister Kelly. In fact, Minister Kelly came back and gave him a big slap across the face. It is interesting to note that the Garnaut report said that Australia should have a natural competitive advantage in so much as resources are very cheap, but that high transport costs, unreliability of supplies, poor quality, and a lack of marketing effort mean ultimately that Australia has very high production costs and ultimately that Australia is uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move on to the car plan; let us move on to some of the things that Senator Button is supposed to have given this country in the last couple of years; let us talk about the production of cars in this country. Does the Senate realise that in this country it takes on average 40 hours of labour to build a car? In Japan in 1989 they turned out car after car after car not at 40 hours per car, not at 30 hours per car, not at 20 hours per car, but at 17 hours per car. It is believed that this year the Japanese will be able to turn out cars at the rate of 11 labour hours per car. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder, therefore, that Australia is uncompetitive in international terms? Is it any wonder that the price of cars in this country between 1985 and 1989 rose by 50 per cent when the consumer price index rose by only 36 per cent and when the average wage rose by only 31 per cent? That is why it takes more weeks of our labour, of our effort to buy a car now than it did in 1983. That is how the Minister has swindled us, that is how the Minister has diddled the Australian population, and that is why the much vaunted Button car plan is an abject failure, a total and utter failure, as is the case with so many aspects of the Minister's portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has gone through Estimates, it has seen so many of the absurdities of this Minister's portfolio. For example, there was the idea that consultants be paid in excess of $38,635 to produce a strategy against fraud. I asked, `Has the Department been victim to fraud before?' and the answer was, `No.' I asked, `Why did you commission the survey?' and the answer was that they wanted to prevent fraud. I said, `Okay, what have you done? I said:</PARA>
<PARA>What do we actually have? Do we actually have any changed procedures yet in place?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was no, that they were looking at it but that they have not done anything about it yet. Senator Button has had seven years to look at the economic and industrial malaise of this country, and the fact that he has failed to produce any substantial improvement is the result of his term card and that is why his ministry has been an abject failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Bishop:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to responsibly oversee the Minister's portfolio and the abject failure of his industry policy to achieve real economic benefits for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a significant debate, or should have been. I thought it was rather audacious of Senator Bishop to propose this matter of public importance because automatically she was going to face a comparison between the last Liberal-National Government and this Government. I believe that the very issues she has raised today will highlight the difference between those two governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop has, in proposing this matter of public importance, attacked one of the most respected Ministers in the Government and, I suggest, one of the most respected Ministers of any government in this portfolio. He has gained that respect because of his application of the way in which he sought to persuade people to change the way they were doing things. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee has made some ill-founded statements about the steel plan. He has tried to denigrate the role that Senator Button played in that steel plan. I remember very well that it was Senator Button who cajoled Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. (BHP) and the steel unions to change the structure in this country. The structure in BHP-for example, in Wollongong-has changed qualitatively and dramatically. It is a different world from the one that existed in the Fraser years. That is just one plan and, seeing as Senator O'Chee wants to mention it, it is an example of how this Government has achieved change. Indeed the plan has finished now. It has achieved its purpose of modernising the steel industry and allowing the people in that industry to have a different, better and more productive relationship in the future. That is the ans- wer to Senator O'Chee when he criticises that particular plan, because it will be there forever as an epitaph to the work of Senator John Button as the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate very quickly became one where the comparison had to be made between our Government and the previous Government. I thought we were going to have a pretty heavy program so I brought a lot of material into the chamber. But the only point that Senator Bishop raised was an article in the Sun-Herald of last Sunday week. We were told in that article that there was a secret deal made by the previous Liberal Party Leader heading the previous Government. He made a secret trade deal in 1979 in which that particular issue that Senator Bishop is so concerned about arose. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that was like leading with one's chin because basically this issue arises because of the way the LiberalNational Party ran government in the past. Those parties did not have an effective industry policy. They had fixes and deals-in this case a deal made with hidden concessions to members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. It is no wonder the Government, when it had the choice of revealing this, according to Senator Bishop, was hesitant to divulge to other countries the way in which Australian governments have behaved in the past. This is at a time when we are trying worldwide to prevent the protectionism that envelops the world and trying to persuade people at the Uruguay rounds that in that world context we should have a better world where trade will be more free. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on that basis that we find the comparison is made. I would have thought that the last basis on which we should have a comparison in this country was when the Liberal Party was trying to bury its past, the memory of the Fraser Government and the fact that the Fraser Government did not have a cohesive policy. Whoever got to the Minister for industry or the Prime Minister last, because often they were in conflict, was the person who would get the policy. There was no vision, no plan, no national perspective. If there is one person in industry who since 1983 has been associated with a perspective of change for industry, it is Senator John Button. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the staffing ratio of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce is leaner and is coming down. I looked at the figures for the Department and found that actual staffing is down from 1,175 people in August 1987 to 849 people at present. There has also been a scaling down in the portfolio generally from 16,648 people to 15,801. It is a more efficient, leaner department, and I believe it does not deserve the unfounded criticism that Senator Bishop is continually making. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the overall issue, Senator Bishop and Senator O'Chee have simply thrown in a couple of sections for discussion. Senator Bishop in her own obsessional way continues to burrow away hoping that she will find something in some obscure issue such as this mistake of the Fraser Government. That, of course, has been exposed in a court case but it is not significant in the overall position that the Australian industry faces today. I want to point out to Senator O'Chee, who said that there were no benefits from Senator Button's ministry, the many benefits and to make a comparison with the situation under the coalition Government. While Senator O'Chee pleads youth, he has got to learn. I am sure that he is concerned with history. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what any examination shows us: under the coalition Government from 1976-77 to 1982-83, real annual average growth in manufacturing output was one per cent and this compares 3.4 per cent under the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labor Government from 1983-84 to 1989-90. Similarly, the annual employment growth in manufacturing has gone from minus 1.2 per cent under the Liberal-National Party Government to more than 0.8 per cent under the present Government with John Button as the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparing the number of jobs created or destroyed in manufacturing in the first year compared with seven years in office, in the period of the Fraser Government the figure was minus 122,000 and more than 65,000 in the period of the Hawke Government. The real annual average growth of manufacturing investment was 4.6 per cent in the Liberal period. It is now 8.2 per cent. The real annual average growth of manufacturing exports has doubled from 3.2 per cent to 7.6 per cent. I am sure that if one individual is responsible for that it is Senator John Button who has constantly gone around this country, talking with people and encouraging people to increase manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports, as a percentage of manufacturing output-as an average over the period-was 14 per cent under the Liberal Government and 17 per cent under the Labor Government. The growth of manufacturing output prices was 10.7 per cent under the Fraser Government and 6.2 per cent under the Labor Government. The number and percentage of manufacturing work force unemployed, at the end of seven years in office, was 131,300 in February 1983, or 11.5 per cent, and 51,800, or 4.2 per cent, in December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Research and development in manufacturing as a percentage of manufacturing value added was 0.8 per cent under the Fraser Government. It is now 1.3 per cent. Industrial disputes in manufacturing; working days lost per 1,000 employees-perhaps the most critical and dramatic comparison between the two governments-on an annual calendar year average over the seven-year period, in mixed manufacturing was 915 under the Liberal Government and 262 under the Labor Government. In metals engineering it has come down from 1,297 to 341 under the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> You cannot have it any other way. Senator O'Chee lays the challenge to us. What I am saying is that on all that criteria Senator John Button is a successful Minister. He has those achievements as his primary responsibility and there is great credit to him for the work he has done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop, in dealing with the company in Malaysia, felt that she should have more information, as she has on a number of occasions. Mr Kelly, the senior officer in the Australian Customs Service, did not give her the answers that she wanted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was the officer in overall charge, but the important point I want to make about this case-and I do not think that it is worth going into the great detail that Senator Bishop, with her obsessional interest, is inclined to give the matter-is that the Australian Customs Service had carriage of the case until it put the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I think that it is best summed up in the transcript of the proceedings of Estimates Committee A in a simple statement made by the Minister, Senator Button. This comment came after Senator Button was asked continual questions, and indeed the same question in a number of different ways:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As you have already pointed out, Customs conducted an investigation into this matter and the Director of Public Prosecutions instituted the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that Senator Bishop's attack on the Customs Service is misplaced, because it is the Director of Public Prosecutions who has carriage of the legal issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, cases are lost. The Commonwealth is continually taking cases which in various degrees are right or wrong. A percentage of them might sometimes be unfair, but I think that it is wrong to say that Customs has persecuted somebody.

I believe that they act only when they have carefully sifted the information and brought it to the appropriate tribunal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate, as the Deputy President said earlier, has ranged far and wide, but Government speakers have yet to provide any concrete evidence to rebut our proposition that Senator Button has failed to responsibly oversee the administration of his portfolio. They have failed to provide any evidence that his industry policy has achieved any real economic benefits for Australia. I will go on to describe why that is the case a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important for everyone to understand that if one has an industry policy or indeed a policy in any area of government, one should have some objectives. Indeed, if the objectives of this Government and of Senator John Button's industry policy are clear to someone else, they are certainly not clear to me. If I were looking at industry policy, I would be looking firstly to broaden our manufacturing and industrial base; to establish-to use one of the Minister's favourite cliches-an export culture; to reduce reliance on government, that is, to reduce featherbedding; and basically to make industry more self-reliant. Obviously, as well, I would seek import substitution so that Australian manufacturers produce things that we can consume within our own borders and therefore help our trade balance problems, and, on the human scale, where it really counts, to increase employment opportunities and, furthermore, employment options in order to broaden the places where young Australians can be employed. I think those are a fairly good set of broad objectives. I am not sure what the Government's industry policy objectives are, and perhaps the next Government speaker will enlighten us. </PARA>
<PARA> One would then look to the modus operandi by which one would achieve those sorts of objectives. I would have thought that an important way of going about that is to have a coherent and consistent policy-and of course that is one thing that this Government has not achieved. Indeed, if one looks through the reams and reams of media commentary on this Government's industry policy, one sees that consistency is certainly one thing that will not be found. Every day in the newspapers one sees article after article trying to figure out what tariff policy will be, what protection policy we are to have, what interest rate policy there will be, which industry is to be bailed out next-will it be Kodak or someone else? The question is also asked whether the car companies are to be given another billion dollars next month. Certainly consistency and coherency are not part of this Government's policy and of its modus operandi in achieving those national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Childs said earlier that Senator Button was a respected Minister and had a great national perspective. But I would like the next Government speaker to say what that national perspective is. If Senator Button does have a national perspective, his achievement of that national perspective or national vision has certainly not been made evident. As I have said, I shall get on to that a little later. Senator Childs-and I thank him for doing so-has at least given some statistical evidence of what has happened in the past seven years, and I shall refer to those statistics later. </PARA>
<PARA> The other modus operandi that I would suggest as a good idea is to have a fair policy and a policy that does not pick winners. As the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said in this morning's Australian:</PARA>
<PARA>I've never been in the winner-picking business. I don't think governments are good at it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that he is quite right. Certainly the winners that he has been trying to pick have been coming home at the back of the field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that was a good shot. That certainly is part of the policy that should be applauded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of picking winners, the Government has picked the car industry and given it a lot of support. We are still debating what that support level will be after 1992, and no doubt in November we will probably have some indication of that. My colleague Senator O'Chee has already gone through the failure of the car plan. It has failed to achieve all the objectives that Senator Button set out for it in 1984 in terms of price, quality and affordability. I notice that neither Senator Walsh nor Senator Childs referred to that. They both referred to the steel plan and a few other things. Perhaps the next Government speaker will wish to discuss what he sees as the success of the car plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The car plan does have some successes because it gave another photo opportunity for Senator Button. If there is one thing that he is very successful at achieving, it is photo opportunities. None of us will forget his appearing with models. I imagine he will be appearing with rock and roll stars now as they send off their albums to the Soviet Union. We remember Senator Button sitting in a Capri car without his seat belt on. Whenever an Australian product actually gets through the mire of government red tape and regulation, environmental inquiries, taxation matters and everything else that poor Australian manufacturers have to get through to get their product out and down to the wharf and, if they are lucky, off the wharf and out through the harbour mouth, there is one thing one can be assured of: there will be one person down at the wharf to say goodbye to the product, be it a Ford Capri, a dress or a record, and it will be Senator Button. He is very good at turning up when a product actually gets through that forest of government- imposed impediments to exporting. He will always be down there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does it well. That is the great achievement of the Button industry policy. He would have the public believe-not even the Treasurer, Mr Keating, believes it is true-that he has been successful and that he is a respected Minister. The facts belie the achievement. That is the whole reason we are debating this matter today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing we would have is a micro- and macro-economic policy that complemented the industry plan. Anyone who follows industry policy will realise that those people involved in manufacturing, in Australian industry, continue to decry this Government's promises on micro-economic reform. The Government's last term in government was supposed to be the era of micro-economic reform. We are now promised that this one will be. We will not hold our breath. The other part is macro-economic policy. It is hard to reduce tariffs, it is hard to reduce protection, when we have high interest rates, a high dollar and all the impediments in the transport sector, the waterfront and all the other areas which make it difficult to be competitive in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The achievements we have heard of to date are in the steel plan. My colleague Senator O'Chee has effectively debunked any success that the Government can claim in steel exports. The Executive General Manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd was reported in this morning's paper-I think it was the Australian-as criticising Government policy. He is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Stop-start policies have had the impact of moving resources in search of speculative rewards and away from competitive pressures associated with the opening up of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>He was quite pessimistic about the outlook for steel production and said that the productivity gains in the steel industry, which Senator Walsh referred to, do not match international competitive pressures. It is an important point to make that, in so many of the measures to which Senator Walsh and Senator Childs referred, we have marginal gains, tiny gains-in most cases less than one per cent-be it in productivity or competitiveness, but that the field is moving and that we are competing against a world that is racing ahead of us. David Kearns, Chairman of the Xerox Corporation, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>We realise we are in a race without a finish line. As we improve, so does our competition. Five years ago, we would have found that disheartening. Today we find it invigorating . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is good to find someone who is invigorated about this race. For example, whereas we have found productivity gains of less than one per cent across manufacturing industry, our competitors in Europe achieve gains of 3 per cent and 3.8 per cent per annum and our competitors in Japan and South East Asia are achieving productivity gains of 5.8 per cent. Every year we are falling behind 3 per cent or 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants to claim that as an achievement of Senator Button's industry ministry and as economic benefits for Australia, that is fine. I guess that we are creeping ahead, but it is similar to rowing flat out up the middle of a river in the tide and making headway of one inch every couple of hours while one's competitor is rowing alongside the river bank where there is no tide and racing ahead. Within a few short years that competitor will be 10 miles ahead. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what has happened in Australia. As Senator Patterson has just said, Australia is losing the race. If our criteria of achievement in productivity and competitiveness are to be measured against the figure of zero per cent, we are achieving: we are getting figures of about one per cent productivity and a little competitiveness here and a bit there. Meanwhile, all of the economic commentators are saying that we are going backwards. The Business Council Bulletin refers to a report by the Australian Manufacturing Council which, without going through the statistics and to quickly summarise the article, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australia performs poorly as a manufacturing country on all four criteria measured. It has the lowest value added per employee; the worst export/import ratio; the lowest contributor to GDP; the second greatest decline in competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Australian Manufacturing Council found in the survey that it provided as late as November last year. There are some criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to growth in exports. Senator Childs claimed that there had been growth in exports, but again that must be measured against our growth in imports and must be measured against our trade deficit across the whole economy. The figures of the blow-out in our international indebtedness would certainly show that manufacturing is not pulling its share. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make relates to the overall achievements of the Button ministry. Our contention is that his policy has failed to deliver real economic benefits to Australia. It has been a failed policy for eight years. Honourable senators can look back and compare it with the Fraser years, if they want; but it would be better to compare it with the policies that the coalition now offers. The Government has had eight years to make achievements. Those achievements have been less than marginal; those achievements have been a dismal failure, on any comparison on a world basis-and we are looking at international competitiveness as the only true measure. I am suggesting that Senator Button and the Government, nearly eight years from when they started fiddling with industry, must figure out where they have gone wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much speculation about Senator Button's future in this place. That speculation includes suitors to his portfolio and suitors to his leadership in the Senate. There would be no shortage of people wanting to take his seat. Over the Christmas period, if he lasts that long, Senator Button will have to think seriously about whether he wants to seriously reappraise the lack of achievement over the last eight years and re-jig the entire policy, or whether he gives the game away and goes into private industry or into retirement and hands over the reins to Simon Crean, perhaps. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point is that we have had eight years of failure. The Government has a couple of short years in which to try to fix things up. Rather than stand on its record, which has been shattered and which is a dismal record by any world comparison, we need to ensure that that reappraisal takes place. I will not rebut any of the innuendo and the vitriol from Senator Walsh. I have already discussed the points made by Senator Childs. I will conclude by saying that no real economic benefits have been delivered to Australia by the Government's industry policy, and certainly the Minister has been irresponsible in overseeing the administration of his portfolio. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was chairing a private hearing of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for over two hours. For Senator Patterson's information, we were having a briefing from Chris Lamb, the ministerial counsellor in the Australian Embassy in Washington who is in charge of congressional liaison. It was much more worth while listening to that in the past hour than listening to any Opposition senators, because Mr Lamb actually gave practical examples of what diplomats such as himself are doing to improve Australia's trade performance in the United States markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position was created by this present Government. It has the support of some members of the Liberal Party of Australia. Senator David MacGibbon has been a strong supporter of the position. I found listening to Mr Lamb's remarks much more useful than hearing the remarks of the previous speaker, who spoke with all the charisma or passion of a cow pat in trying to explain why Senator Button had not delivered the goods in his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to speak very positively in defence of Senator Button. No Minister for business and industry in Australia's history has done as much and as consistently. Senator Button has worked hard to get the culture of this country in manufacturing and industry turned away from being insular and introverted to being an export oriented sector of our economy. Let us compare the record of the mob opposite when they were in government for 30 of the last 40 years with the 10 years that we have had in government, particularly the last seven years. The figures are quite startling. I suspect that some of these figures were cited previously by speakers from the Government side in this debate, but I would like to emphasise them. Real average growth in manufacturing output in the Fraser years was one per cent; in the Labor years it was 3.4 per cent. Annual average employment growth in manufacturing in the Fraser years was minus 1.2 per cent; in the Labor years it was plus 0.8 per cent. In the Fraser years 122,000 jobs were destroyed in manufacturing; in the Labor years, 65,000 jobs were created-and so it goes on. In every indicator the present Government is superior to the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators want to go back and talk about tariff cuts and reductions, they should remember that after 23 years of a coalition government the first government in Australia's history to reduce tariffs was the Whitlam Government with a 25 per cent across-the-board cut in tariffs without a tackle and nothing being taken on by the previous coalition government during the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon years. It took the Whitlam Government to do it. There is no doubt that it created stress in the community. It cost the Australian Labor Party many votes and probably helped in the short term to put us out of government in 1975, but it was a breakthrough in economic thinking that we could actually reduce tariffs in Australia and not put them up as the way to overcome economic problems. I do not think it is necessary for us to listen to the bleatings from the Opposition that John Button and the Labor Government have failed in the administration of this important area of activity in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with four areas in particular where I think the record of John Button is exemplary. I will deal, firstly, with the steel industry. Senator Campbell made some mention in his remarks about the steel industry. I will quote two paragraphs from a press release put out by BHP Steel dated 18 September 1990. In refuting some of the critiques made of BHP Steel it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Productivity at BHP Steel had risen from 175 tonnes per employee per year in 1983 to about 350 tonnes per employee per year currently, a 100% increase. BHP Steel is on track to meet a target of 500 tonnes per employee per year at its Port Kembla works by 1991 and a year later at its other steelmaking centres at Whyalla and Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> BHP Steel in the last financial year maintained its position as the third most profitable steel producer in the world, behind only the Government-owned China Steel Corporation of Taiwan and the speciality producer Nisshin of Japan. Its profit performance in the last two financial years had been the highest on record. The 1988-1989 profit result for the Steel Group had more than doubled the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> BHP Steel has been nominated for an Austrade export award last week and was currently exporting at least 22% of total steel despatched tonnes. It is a committed, long-term exporter. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement from BHP Steel absolutely proves that the steel plan introduced in 1983 stopped the steel industry from going bankrupt and disappearing in Australia, got it reinvigorated, and now it is able to stand on its own two feet as one of the world's major competitive and efficient steel producers. </PARA>
<PARA> People do not realise that today more people are employed in shipbuilding in Australia than were employed 10 years ago. Though, unfortunately, the major shipbuilding industry in Whyalla, my own State, may have closed, still more people are employed in shipbuilding because we have gone out and sought markets where we can provide our skills in special areas of shipbuilding. This newly developed Australian shipbuilding industry has grown to such an extent that vessels under construction and on order exceeded $600m as at 30 June 1989 and more than half of the vessels were intended for export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has successfully entered a number of niche markets for luxury motor yachts, specialised fishing vessels and high speed catamarans. Ten years ago under the former Government the shipbuilding industry disappeared in this country, but we now have a shipbuilding industry that is delivering the goods, particularly in export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I come from a State which has played a significant role in producing cars. In 1982-83 under the Fraser Government, the car industry in South Australia was basically on its uppers. It was destitute, it was all but bankrupt, it had no future and no optimism, but the car industry plan of the present Government under John Button's leadership turned all that around. Who would have thought 10 years ago that a car industry, even in my State, would be exporting car components to Japan and that the Australian car industry would be exporting cars to the United States? They are export earners. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd in South Australia announced that it would be increasing the export of its components to Japan and in doing so would enhance its ability to produce a new model Magna car, which will further consolidate Mitsubishi's place as a major car producer in Australia. This has meant that people have secure jobs in the car industry in South Australia and they have better jobs which provide better productivity and more satisfaction. A visit to a car factory in South Australia today compared with a visit 15 years ago is like comparing the latter part of the twentieth century with nineteenth century work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The area I wish to conclude on, which I think offers a great opportunity- Senator Button has been involved in this-is the development of telecommunications policy. The other day I came across some information which said that in the first 100 years-or just over 100 years-of the availability of telephone services 400 million telephones had been connected around the world. It is estimated that in the next 15 years in Asia alone another 400 million telephones will be connected. In the next 15 years in one region of the world, the region closest to us, the number of telephones in the world will have doubled the number for the previous 100 years. This offers Australia enormous opportunities to expand its telecommunications industry in providing services, management and equipment to this most rapidly growing area. The decisions that the Government and the Labor Party took over the last month regarding telecommunications policy give us the best opportunity to get in and get a part of that market. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably not well known in Australia because we often get criticised when we cannot compete with countries such as Taiwan, but Exicom, one of Australia's major telephone manufacturing companies, makes a million telephones a year under licence for Telecom Australia and is actually exporting that telephone very profitably to Taiwan. Why? The phone that it is providing to Taiwan is highly engineered. It is an excellent phone and does not break when dropped, kicked, or when the kids knock it off the table; it lasts well. As a result, there is a market for that sort of phone in the region where we are told that we cannot compete against manufactured goods from countries such as Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> Exicom made it quite clear in private discussions that I had with it that it sees itself in the future expanding its export market. Alcatel, another telecommunications company, also provides telephones under licence to Telecom Australia. This company has recently completed the construction of a $120m factory at Botany in Sydney at which it manufactures optic fibre trans-ocean cables. It will earn hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade by manufacturing in this country, using the highest technology, cables which will be supplied competitively to the world. The company will employ people who will work in decent and interesting jobs. But, above all else, it will provide us with a base from which to expand our telecommunications exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has argued throughout the telecommunications reform process of this Government that industry policy in telecommunications is absolutely paramount. We must not allow the opportunities of telecommunications reform to pass by and ignore the industry consequences. We should take decisions which will allow both public and private industry in Australia-particularly the private sector-to take a view that they have a role to play in providing telecommunications equipment, services and management and exporting them to the countries of our region. The decisions that we took in creating the biggest public enterprise in Australia by way of the merger of Telecom and OTC Ltd will give us the platform from which to go into the Asia region and be very successful in seeking markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of the previous Government indicates that all Opposition senators can put to us is a lot of hot air. I believe that the performance of Senator John Button is an outstanding highlight of the term of this Government. He is the first Minister responsible for business and industry who has had the energy and taken the effort to go out and try to change manufacturing culture in this country from being introverted and insular to being export oriented and extroverted as well as, to use the phrase, making us a clever country-a clever country that is able to export. </PARA>

<PARA>Senators O'Chee, Boswell and Macdonald have only put at risk the temporary assistance agreement recently offered by the Commonwealth. They are only using the people of Ravenshoe for their own spurious political gains. </PARA>
<PARA>I take very great offence at the suggestion that I, as a representative of the people of Queensland, doing my duty by trying to find out for the people of the little town of Ravenshoe just what happened to the money that was given by the Government, supposedly for their benefit, and inquiring about money that they have lost as a result of the exercise of the compensation package, am pursuing something for my own spurious political gain. This is offensive to me in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reprehensible for the Government to make a suggestion such as this. It is also reprehensible that the Government should suggest in the passage that I have quoted that, because I have inquired into this matter, the assistance package which it has offered to the people of Ravenshoe may not now go ahead or may be put at risk. It is suggested that this may happen simply because I and colleagues of mine have been questioning the Government on what has been a sorry state of affairs in the spending of taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to say at the outset that I welcome the Government's response to the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I welcome its content. As Senator McKiernan would acknowledge, in many respects it coincides very closely with the dissenting report that my colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Ruddock, and I submitted. Senator McKiernan also put down a position that was very firm and steadfast. I am pleased to acknowledge the Government response to that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the recommendations that have now been adopted by the Government can be described simply as sensible. As the Government response and the dissenting report that I supported stated, it is untenable that illegal immigrants should receive the prize of being allowed to live in Australia by breaking the law. It is loud and clear that we are not the lucky country for illegals and it is not before time that we sent that message to the rest of the world. Clearly, the response of the Government in this instance is the right one. </PARA>
<PARA> At last count we had well over 100,000 illegal immigrants; some believe as many as 150,000. I am gratified that the Government has not bowed to the exceptional, heavy pressure of the minority groups who were demanding the untenable absorption principle of `Stay five years. Pop up your head with some character references, and you can stay on'. That would have been untenable. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some middle ground in this regard, and that is the British model that accepts the principle that deportation is the first option for an illegal immigrant, but states that there are exceptions to the rules. However, in giving consideration to this subject, the Committee was not prepared, at the outset, to state that fundamental principle prior to putting down the exceptions to the rule. For that reason, my colleague Mr Ruddock and I submitted the dissenting report. I could not support the across-the-board absorption principle applying after a five year residency period. </PARA>
<PARA> I was dismayed that some sections of the Joint Standing Committee were swayed by this idea of segmenting illegals into `worthy' and `bad'. This was the main reason for the dissenting report. The Government rightly acknowledges that a number of dissenting reports relate to this first report. In a moment I will refer to the circumstances in which so many dissenting reports were part of that first report. </PARA>
<PARA> There cannot be good and bad illegals; they are law-breakers who show no respect for the rules of the country they profess to be their own. For us to accept that principle would be a slap in the face to many thousands of people throughout the world who are going through the long, slow and proper procedures to make Australia their home-they are the people who deserve adequate consideration in a matter such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Committee, I have heard many arguments over the Government's handling of the broader immigration issues. However, I also believe in giving credit where credit is due. The Government's response indicates that commonsense and compassion have been used in equal proportions to reach its latest changes to migration regulations. The commonsense is seen in there being no let-up in our determination to ensure that our immigration policies work properly and that families enter Australia through the proper channels. The commonsense is also there in handing out harsher penalties for those who harbour or employ illegals. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the press release of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) dated yesterday-I assume it was released either late last night or early this morning-indicates a firmness in that approach. I welcome and encourage that. I hope that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, in its enforcement section, applies that principle in the future. The only way that we will get a clear, unambiguous, concise message to the community at large, not only to those who are here illegally but also to those who are harbouring illegals, is to indicate that we intend to treat them as people who have broken the law; and they ought to be treated as such. With more than 100,000 illegals in the country, clearly many people are deliberately harbouring and employing them. It is surely time to show that we mean what our regulations say; it is time to back them up in practice as well as preach that policy direction. </PARA>
<PARA> But compassion is there in the Government understanding and accepting that there is indeed a small group of people who are innocent illegals. In hearings of the Committee we heard many harrowing stories of such innocents. In a speech delivered to this chamber, I referred to several instances of young people innocently being caught; they are innocent illegals. These people were deserving of some compassion and consideration. I am pleased that a mechanism is to be put in place to give some discretionary powers to the Minister to take account of them. They deserve and should have all the help we can give them. Through no fault of their own, they, as individuals, are innocent illegals. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, compassion is to the fore when we come to the Minister's discretion. When dealing with people's lives, there will always be cases of exceptional circumstances. This means that the rules are meant to be bent, to take account of those circumstances that we, as legislators, simply cannot embody in any legislation or regulations. That is why a Minister's discretion is important in an area where we are dealing with people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am wary of totally embracing that concept, no matter how compassionate. I know the pressure of lobbying on issues such as these. We have seen a number of cases-one notable case in recent weeks-in which ministerial discretion has been applied. I would hope that such decisions would in no way be political. It is important that they not be, as I believe the decision of several weeks ago was; that no Minister so entrusted would be swayed by the strength of any party or ministerial representation, but that any ministerial discretion employed or put in place would be based on the merit of the case and the argument put to the Minister. They are the bouquets to the Government for its response to our first report. </PARA>
<PARA> The rush with which the new immigration regulations were forced into operation, and continue to be pushed along, makes it all but impossible to work the issues through to ensure people's lives are treated with the awareness that they deserve. We are dealing with real people, not facts and figures. The December 1989 deadline means that we are now in a constant bandaid situation. That is a most undesirable set of circumstances that the Committee is faced with. </PARA>
<PARA> The rush on illegals for 31 October meant that the Committee's report was rushed and, as a result, ill considered in parts. That means that the Committee did not have the time to do its job properly, as it would have liked to have done. It meant many dissenting reports, which, in turn, must lead to some view of lack of credibility of the main report. Had more time been available, the Committee may have been able to come to a near-unanimous view, or at least a majority view without the number of dissenting reports. If my memory serves me correctly, there were five dissenting reports in this first report of the Joint Standing Committee. That is not a desirable circumstance for a report of a joint standing committee of this Parliament. A number of people put in a dissenting report simply because we were rushed as we had to meet these deadlines; we did not have an opportunity to analyse thoroughly and consider the merits of individual cases as we would have liked. We were not able to debate the issues to get an approach that was acceptable to the majority on the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that more time and more resources will be available to that Committee when it looks at other areas such as humanitarian grounds and change of status-a number of areas will be before it in the ensuing months-so that it can undertake its task and report to the Parliament, having been able to analyse, very carefully and thoroughly, all the circumstances, all the evidence, that it could muster. By doing its job more efficiently, effectively and properly, it will be not only doing a service to the Committee but also serving the interests of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> A committee report such as the one we have with dissenting reports leads, as the Minister noted in the comments that he made, to a lack of credibility on the part of the Committee. I am not saying that there was a lack of credibility as far as the Committee is concerned. What I am saying is that it leads to a perception of that as a result of those dissenting reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly know that I speak for a number of my colleagues on the Committee when I say that we are determined to ensure that sensible, easily understood and firm but fair migration regulations are put in place. It may be a long haul, but there is no doubt in my mind that the good intention of all members of the Committee is to meet that particular objective. I can but hope that this response by the Government is an indication that many of us on all sides of politics share similar views and are working, and can work, together for the same objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's media release indicates a number of directions that I would like to comment on. Firstly, he is going to reduce the appeal system mechanism so that there is but one avenue of appeal in certain instances, that is, people go directly to second tier-instead of first tier and then second tier-which hopefully will have the beneficial effect of reducing the timeframe in which people have submissions before the Department for consideration, so that they will not use that timeframe to defer or prolong the day of decision as to whether they can stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The position as it relates to innocent illegals and employing ministerial discretion is, as I have said, an important step forward. We cannot legislate for all sets of circumstances in an area such as this. Therefore, for the unintended consequences of the legislation, the regulation, through using ministerial discretion, will enable the Government to make decisions that take into account those exceptional cases that were put before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister rightly points out in his press release, there has been ample time-and there will be, through to December 1993-for people to present their cases and for innocent illegals to regularise their stay. The situation in which the majority of illegals have broken the law is well and truly past, according to the statement. That is the message that I think ought to be communicated clearly and concisely to the community. I might add that Senator McKiernan did that with a force and a conviction, not only at the committee hearings but certainly publicly. As a result, he received widespread publicity for a policy position that by and large I agree with, containing the exceptions to the rule which are now embodied in the Government's response to this first committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome this response from the Government. I think it shows commonsense. I think it shows compassion. I think it is an adequate, appropriate and effective response to the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I trust and hope that some of the concerns that I have expressed as they relate to the workload timeframe that the Committee has had to operate under in the past can be given adequate consideration in the future to ensure that we have adequate time and adequate resources to do the job thoroughly, effectively and properly, as I know each and every member of the Committee wants to undertake that task in that manner. That will serve the interests of the Parliament in a very appropriate way, a proper way and a way in which we ought to be servicing the needs of this Parliament. Therefore, I endorse the statement presented to the House today by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not welcome the response of the Government to report No. 1 of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations with the same degree of enthusiasm as Senator Olsen has just announced that he does, although at the same time I do not condemn the response. I am somewhat disappointed that the views which I put forward in my minority report were not, in total, taken up by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). I assert that my views were very well considered, were in the interests of Australia and were in the interests of those individuals from all over the world who want to come to this wonderful country. Indeed, as Senator Olsen mentioned, I got a reasonable amount of publicity because of the expressions of my views. I also got a considerable amount of public support from individuals who, in some instances, telephoned long distance to let me know that they supported the view that I put forward in my minority report. I welcome people when they express views in that manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we are debating a very important issue-Australia's immigration program. It is not simply a question of dealing with illegals because, whatever we do or whatever government does, this particular issue will have an impact on the total migration program. It is a program which is receiving its fair amount of publicity at the moment. The driving force behind the views that I expounded in the minority report-some of which, I might add, have been addressed by the Government in its response-was the integrity of the immigration program. I have a vested interest in that program because, as all honourable senators will know, I am myself a migrant. Indeed, people from different backgrounds make up a considerable proportion of the population of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In expressing some disappointment at the Government's response, I do at the same time welcome it. I also accept that the Minister and, indeed, the Cabinet and the Government had a very difficult job, as Senator Olsen has said, to come forward with a view. As has been previously indicated, while it was a majority report, minority views came from four members of the Committee. There were actually five dissenting reports. There are many times when people make jokes known as Irish jokes. I suggest that this is a good one for me to keep in the files to use as a response. It is not an Irish joke, but perhaps it is a bit of a parliamentary joke. That is not in any way seeking to reflect on either House of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a difficult report which the Minister had to address his mind to and those in the Department had to address their minds to. I think, on a very quick reading of the response that has just recently been tabled, that they have done a reasonable job of it. I am not totally endorsing all that is contained in it at the moment because I have not had the time to digest it and consider it in the depth that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I will pick up one point that Senator Olsen started with about good and bad illegals. There are actually good and bad illegals, and I would assert that the good illegals are those who are illegal but who do not know that they are illegal. That was the matter upon which the Committee undertook its inquiry-innocent illegals, people who found themselves in that category but who had not gone into the category willingly: it was something that they were caught up with. I believe the Government has addressed that question and that those people, when they are found out-perhaps the right expression is `when they find they are in an illegal capacity'-will now have the ability to redress that situation and attempt to put themselves into a legal capacity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That was one of the major concerns that the Committee had in commencing the inquiry. Unfortunately, it was subsumed in a broader question of what we do with illegals totally. I think this is part of the problem of the time constraints that Senator Olsen has mentioned; and I agree with the comments that he put on the record here this afternoon. We were faced with almost impossible deadlines. I read the second draft of the final report on an aircraft coming over here on a Sunday night and had to attend a meeting early the next morning to go through that draft report, chapter and verse, to try to bring it into some order. It required two separate meetings on that date to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The deadlines that we set ourselves or were in some way imposed upon us were almost impossible to meet. I am on the record of the Committee as indicating that I will not attempt to meet such deadlines in the future, because I do not believe that in the report we presented to this Parliament we did justice to the question that we were examining. I think the evidence of that is the fact that there were five separate dissenting reports to the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking for myself, the views that I expressed in my dissenting report were views that I had consistently expressed from the beginning of the inquiry, and I doubt that, even given an extension of time, I would have been able to convince the majority of the Committee to go along with those views. But that is the way of committee work, and that is how we did work. In fact, as a committee we are working very well together. In saying that, I am not, as Senator Olsen was doing a short while ago, seeking in any way to intimate to the Senate that I am speaking on behalf of all of my colleagues on the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter concerning the Minister's statement and the Government response that I want to address. One recommendation that I am particularly pleased has not been accepted is that concerning the principle of absorption. As I indicated earlier, probably eight of the 10 members of the Committee were in agreement with some form of the absorption principle. The majority report recommended a term of some five years, although I may be doing the Committee some injustice in that a couple of members expressed the view that a period of eight years in Australia might be more acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I oppose completely the principle of absorption. I think it is a reward for people who can prove over a sustained period that they are capable of breaching Australia's migration laws, and in doing so holding Australia's immigration system in contempt. The Minister and the Government have rejected the majority recommendation of the Committee, that a five-year absorption rule ought to apply, and I put it on the record that I am particularly pleased that that has happened. Inevitably, if it had been accepted by the Government we would have had people coming into this country, hiding for five years-hiding quite openly-and then making an application to stay. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that when this response is reported in the media-and it deserves to be widely reported-those illegals and their supporters will take note of the fact that the Government is firm and committed to dealing with the problem. It is an immense problem, as is indicated on the first page of the response, where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The increased number of illegal entrants, from 65,500 as at 19 December 1989 to some 90,000 as at 30 April 1990, is a serious development which must be met with firm and resolute action. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government will maintain its resoluteness in this matter, as it did in a recent episode at a market garden just north of Perth where 16 illegals were apprehended. I think that action of apprehending 16 individuals would have a far greater impact than on just those 16 people, because it proves to the community, both legal and illegal, that the Government is firm and resolute in dealing with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to make one appeal to the various ethnic communities around Australia. Now is the time that they have to accept that the Government is firm in dealing with this problem. They in turn have a responsibility to advise people that they are aware are here in an illegal capacity that the best thing those individuals can do is either to depart Australia voluntarily or to make application under the further concessions that are now available to them to regularise their status. There is no point in their remaining hidden forever and living what must be for those people an appalling lifestyle. I thank the Senate and commend the Government's response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the previous speakers in their expressions of qualified support for the Government's response to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I am perhaps not on all fours with all the comments they have made, and I will proceed to detail some of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that ministerial discretion has been widened and preserved and that in particular attention will be given to a reform of the bail conditions which are available to illegal entrants in Australia. It was a blot on our judicial system that these were found wanting in the past, and I welcome the reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not so pleased that the Immigration Review Tribunal was not and is not to be given the task of assessing the status of illegal entrants. It seemed to the Committee-and I supported the majority view-that that Tribunal was eminently suited to that task, much more so than the of necessity lengthy process which these people have to go through when they take the bureaucratic route through the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, which has not always been even-handed in its treatment on the evidence of migrants, intending or illegal. That they have then to rely only on ministerial discretion seems to me to narrow the process and seems also to bear the seeds of long and weary delays. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most important qualification that I would wish to address is the rejection of the absorption principle. I certainly cannot agree with Senator McKiernan or Senator Olsen, nor can I agree with the way in which the recommendations of the Committee were represented in the Government's response. On page 2 of the Government's response it is quite clear that the Government is conjuring up the furphy that such a provision would offer the prospect to future illegal entrants of becoming absorbed, whereas it is quite clear from the recommendations of the Committee that the majority view favoured a qualification based on past presence in Australia of five years or more and a record of achievement and behaviour during that time which has made the people in question worthwhile citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no suggestion in the recommendations of the Committee that this absorption principle is to be used as a guiding light for future decisions. It was quite clearly put forward in an attempt to deal with the existing situation, where we are faced with at least 90,000 and possibly 150,000 illegal entrants, and recognising that some of them are here illegally through no fault of their own. In fact, one could argue that this Government and past governments have been accessories to their behaviour, because the compliance provisions that we have had in place so far might as well not have been there. They certainly were not enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> People were almost led to believe that if they behaved themselves, if they worked, if they did not become involved in criminal activities, if they paid the tax, and if they founded a family, educated the children and generally did their job as citizens in our community, which contributed to the well-being of our community, then they would not be hounded to leave this country. I do not condone the breaking of our laws, and I agree that from now on we should use the tough measures of compliance which have been foreshadowed by the Government and which the majority view of the Committee has put forward and which it endorses. But I think that there is a sound case for people who, through their behaviour in the past and through circumstances, have become absorbed in the community. We should not tear them out of that context and break their family, professional and social ties in a community when we might be sending them to a country which to all intents and purposes has now become a country that no longer offers them a base for existence and with which they might have no further ties. </PARA>
<PARA> I must express some personal disappointment that this particular recommendation was not accepted in the spirit in which it was offered, and I reject the constructions that have been put on it which I believe are not warranted. Having said that, I do recognise though the balance of compassion and control that the Government has attempted to achieve. On that basis, in broad terms, I offer my support to the Government's response and to the measures foreshadowed. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Grants Commission report on Issues in Fiscal Equalisation tabled earlier today is a very complex and in some ways arcane sounding report, but it is in fact a very important report. It is a report that has been prepared by the members of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and I congratulate the Chairman of the Commission, Mr Dick Rye, and his fellow commission members on this report. It is a report that was requested of the Commission by the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, on 4 September 1989, when he conveyed to the Commission terms of reference for a review of certain issues associated with the methodology used by the Grants Commission in its 1988 report on the relativities to be applied to the distribution of general revenue grants amongst the States. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate will be aware, the Commonwealth Grants Commission is responsible for determining the relativities for the distribution of general revenue grants among the States. It does not have direct responsibility for specific purpose payments, and of course it does not have any responsibility for the borrowings of other States. But the general revenue grants by the Commonwealth to the States is, of course, a major part of Commonwealth funding for the States and it is not as much relatively as it should be. I will come back to that if time permits. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on Issues in Fiscal Equalisation is very detailed. It is very technical, very complex and in the time available to us today it is impossible to get to grips with all of it. It does deserve very considerable further study. I am sure it will be given that, particularly by the State governments that will be affected by the recommendations here if the Grants Commission does go ahead with some of the proposals it has in this report when it comes to the next review of how the general revenue payments are to be distributed amongst the States, that next general review being due in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> What this report does today is put forward the Commission's proposals as to how it will tackle the 1993 review. It has major implications for Federal-State financial relationships and particularly the distribution between the States. For example, just picking up one point from the executive summary and the overview in the report, the Grants Commission at the moment takes into account what are called location-specific disabilities that particular States have in terms of their own revenue raising capacity. I must stress that the Grants Commission is not recommending that these location-specific disabilities no longer be taken into account, but if they were no longer taken into account they would have a detrimental effect of some $650m on the smaller States, and would therefore result in a greater revenue flow towards the larger States of New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many important points made in the report. The one that I want particularly to refer to is the view expressed by the Grants Commission that in looking at the whole question of the most equitable method of fiscal equalisation between the States, the inclusion of most special purpose payments is the most appropriate method to adopt. At the moment not all special purpose payments are taken into account in any formal way in the allocation of the general purpose payments. The Grants Commission has proposed that the special purpose payments ought to be taken into account in the same way as the general revenue payments, and that indeed many of them ought to be absorbed into the general revenue pool rather than continue to be treated as special purpose payments. That is a recommendation of major importance. It would give the States much greater responsibility for determining how they spend the funds granted to them by the Commonwealth and, to a great extent, it would take the Commonwealth off their backs, which would be, in my view, highly desirable. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Few industries in Australia have been subject to such constant and widespread criticism as the textile, clothing and footwear industries. It is interesting to note that very little of that criticism seems to be directed to such efficiency considerations as output per employee, or per employee hour, or week. Nor is any consideration given to the ethics of the costs or the prices of some of those imported products. </PARA>
<PARA> We often hear about the problems of rainforests and the tragedies for the world as a result of logging in tropical rainforest areas and other problems, but seldom do we hear from those people who are so anxious to get the cheapest possible imported clothing and textile products that they are blind about the ethical composition of some of those costs behind the prices of imported goods that are put onto the Australian market. I refer perhaps to the misery in some of the overseas `sweated' workshops and the distortions in the purchase of raw material products. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that criticism, the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industries still form an important part of Australia's economic and social structure. In fact, they added 7 per cent of value added of Australian manufacturing industry during the year 1987-88. It seems strange that, despite our abundance of natural raw materials including wool, cotton, cattle hides and sheep skins, our industries have been unsuccessful in adding significant value to those raw materials in Australia. I suppose the most poignant criticism of the industries has been their failure to orientate their production significantly towards an export market. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that `the industries are looking positively to the challenges of the future because the Authority considers that a properly structured industry can make a solid contribution to the Australian economy without ongoing reliance on community support in the form of higher tariffs or large subsidies'. To achieve that, it has to be recognised that restructuring and time are required. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite often we are not aware of the efficiencies and the changes in the technology that is being applied in the textile industry because it is generally characterised by its high degree of capital intensity and automation of processing. Technological developments in spinning have mainly focused on the improvements to machine efficiencies, higher speeds and more uniform quality. Labour costs have been progressively reduced to a bare minimum. For example also, in weaving, tufting and knitting technical developments have focused on higher machine speeds and, in combination with electronic monitoring and computer programming, developments have allowed greater flexibility in pattern selection with variations and control of machine functions. I believe that short resume gives the Senate some idea of the textile industry's application of high technology to its future development. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few minutes, I will come back to the issue that I raised earlier in my contribution. Unfortunately, the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority report does draw attention-and I think this is an important contribution of the report-to the fact that government intervention in the international textile fibre market has significant cost implications for the world's textile industry. These ramifications affect Australia and Australian production. Some governments in fibre producing countries allow preferential fibre buying rates for their indigenous textile industry, thereby distorting the cost structures of these textile industries. These distortions can then flow on to apparel industries. Other pricing and market support policies also affect the prices the textile industry pays for raw material, thereby affecting the industry's competitive position. I believe these factors should be taken into account when we assess the comparative advantage of textile production in Australia vis-a-vis imports. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, the report of the Independent Auditor on an Efficiency Audit of the Australian National Audit Office is an important document because the role of the Australian National Audit Office is, of course, central to the verification of the actions of government, both in terms of its financial actions and the efficiency with which government departments carry out their responsibilities. The Audit Amendment Act of 1979 amended the Audit Act of 1901 to provide for the appointment of an independent auditor to carry out audits in relation to the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Michael Sharpe was appointed Independent Auditor in June 1988 for a period of three years. In the report before the Senate today, Mr Sharpe points out that that appointment has now been extended for a further two-year period. The functions of the Independent Auditor are set out in subsection 48k (2) of the Audit Act and include responsibility to carry out efficiency audits of the Australian National Audit Office. The manner in which efficiency audits are conducted, including their frequency and scope, is subject to the provisions of the Act at the discretion of the Independent Auditor. This is the second efficiency audit report that has been issued by Mr Sharpe. The last one-that being the first-was issued in September 1989. In this report, the second report, Mr Sharpe says that he intends to issue one further report during his new two-year term. The overall objective of Mr Sharpe's examination was, in his words:</PARA>
<PARA>to form an opinion on whether the manner in which the ANAO sought to achieve its aims and objectives was economical, efficient and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>The report will bear careful study, and in the time available to the Senate today that has not been possible, but I would like to offer some reactions to the report as I have been able to glean in the time available. My first reaction on reading the report is to say that I agree with much of its content. An independent report such as this is obviously a valuable exercise in ensuring that the Audit Office achieves its aims and objectives. The Australian National Audit Office, in its role as Auditor for the Commonwealth, by definition has to be a pacesetter on monitoring and making suggestions which allow these objectives of economical, efficient and effective delivery of government services to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of its important role in setting the pace for other departments, this puts more importance on what the Audit Office itself is doing. I note, for example, that the Audit Office is the key organisation responsible within the Department of Finance for establishing the ground rules and the monitoring of asset registers. That is a subject that has been debated and discussed at length in recent hearings of Estimates committees. Personally, I have not been entirely satisfied during those hearings that the Audit Office has the establishment and maintenance of assets registers by all departments sufficiently high on its own agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was discussed a couple of weeks ago in the most recent Estimates hearings and, although the Audit Office spoke of the importance of the assets register within departments, it gave answers to questions asked which left one in some doubt as to how comprehensively government departments were pursuing the approach of compiling their own assets registers, although work is well advanced on it in many areas. That is an example of one of the very important areas of work, I believe, that the Audit Office has to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that in recent Senate Estimates hearings officers from the Audit Office have said that if the Audit Office were a statutory body, there would be certain considerable advantages and particular advantages attaching to such a change in status. That relates particularly, in their view, to the scope that it would give the Audit Office, however so named if it were a statutory body, to compete with equivalent organisations in the private sector in terms of setting the terms and conditions of employment for staff. Also, perhaps more importantly from the Commonwealth's point of view, the point that has been emphasised strongly in discussions on this matter is the question of the independence of the Auditor-General. I believe that is a very important issue. It is one that I would like to see advanced to finality with a decision taken. Senator McMullan who, I note, is in the chamber now, advised Senate Estimates Committee A on 25 September, just two or three weeks ago, that this issue was actually in front of the Minister and a decision hopefully would be made on that particular aspect before too long. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter though that has, as I think Senator Watson was saying, been dragging on for a long time. I do ask the Government-hopefully Senator McMullan will take it up again, as he is here at present-to make sure that the decision gets off the desk of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) rather than lingers on in the bottom drawer as can so often happen with papers on Treasurers' desks, particularly this Treasurer's desk. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few recommendations in the report on which I would like to comment briefly, but specifically. The area of fees and productivity is the first one. I welcome the report's suggestion that the Audit Office should charge all auditees a fee for all financial audits and that the Audit Office should be required to justify this fee and any overruns to the audit committee. In my view-I speak, in a sense, personally on this-such a recommendation if adopted would, as the report itself suggests, place external pressure on the Audit Office to complete the audits as efficiently as possible. The introduction of a fee for service, of course, is also very much in line with the coalition's view that government agencies should, as far as possible, be put on a basis comparable with the private sector and be required to perform on as commercial a basis as possible. That, I think, applies no less to the Audit Office than it does to any other agency of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out that there is no Audit Office training strategy which ensures that all staff complete a minimum level of structured and unstructured training each year. Emphasis on the training strategies should be based on the transmission of skills, rather than knowledge, according to the report. I think there is food for thought in that. Again, it is essential that the Audit Office provide a highly professional service and that the best use be made of the resources that it has at its disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of financial audit, the Independent Auditor says that there is considerable scope for reduction in audit hours by greater use being made of the work of internal auditors. I am aware that the Audit Office has previously raised the matter of internal auditors. I understand from this report today that the Audit Office has gone some way to addressing the problems related to this. I hope it can progress again further in that direction. Therefore, this report is welcome in highlighting that matter again. Obviously the Audit Office will have a key role to play in ensuring that internal audits are carried out efficiently and within the proper guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of efficiency audits, I note that the time between the commencement of an efficiency audit and the tabling of the final report to Parliament is approximately 18 months. I endorse the views in this report by the Independent Auditor that these delays have tended to reduce the benefits which could accrue from early release of reports. Indeed I would go further and say that it should be a very important objective of the Audit Office to ensure that its efficiency audits are completed as expeditiously as possible. I believe that it should be given a very high priority by the Audit Office and that a delay between the commencement and tabling of efficiency audits with an average of approximately 18 months is something that should be shortened. I hope that the Audit Office will take that particular recommendation on board. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also recommends that a more formal and uniform methodology for selecting potential efficiency audits is required; that the Audit Office should give consideration to canvassing the views of users of programs in the performance of an efficiency audit; and a follow-up report on an efficiency audit should be conducted by the Audit Office to give independent assurance that appropriate action has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, those are the specific recommendations of the Independent Auditor. They are important recommendations. I welcome the report's highlighting of some of the issues facing the Audit Office today. I hope that the Government will take note of those recommendations, as will the Audit Office itself, because the integrity, independence and efficiency of the Audit Office is something that ought to be very high on the lists of priorities in proper and effective public administration. I welcome the report. I look forward to further consideration of it in due course and to the next report of the Independent Auditor, Mr Sharpe. I congratulate him on what he has achieved to date. I believe that he is doing an important service for the Parliament in highlighting some of the matters that he has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our colleague Senator Short has just reminded the Senate that the Audit Act was amended in 1979 to provide for the appointment of an Independent Auditor to carry out audits in relation to the Australian National Audit Office. The report that has just been tabled in the Senate is the second efficiency audit conducted by the present Independent Auditor, Mr Michael Sharpe. In his position as Independent Auditor, he is responsible for providing an annual report to Parliament which gives an examination of the overall objectives, organisational structure, manpower, audit methodology, management information systems, auditing performance, accounting and annual reports of the Australian National Audit Office, in addition to the efficiency audit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The overall objective of the examination by the Independent Auditor was to form an opinion on whether the manner in which the Australian National Audit Office sought to achieve its aims and objectives was economical, efficient and effective. In forming an opinion, the Independent Auditor, Mr Sharpe, has performed a review of the head office operations of the Australian National Audit Office. He has also performed a detailed review of a financial audit and an efficiency audit. In addition, he has reviewed the report of the independent review on the Australian National Audit Office by Mr T. A. Sheridan-Tom Sheridan -which Mr Sheridan delivered to govern- ment in March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the lack of publication of the Sheridan report to which I take issue today. We have not got that report. Yet the Independent Auditor is commenting on that report and making recommendations. Next week we will have the annual report of the Australian Audit Office making comments on the Sheridan report. Yet this Government, which has had that report since 31 March 1990, is still sitting on it. We are still awaiting its substantive response. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the independent auditor has supported most of the recommendations of the Sheridan report and made eight observations. I take this opportunity to speak to some of them. The recommendations relate to significant improvements in productivity, particularly in the output of staff engaged on direct audit work. There is still considerable scope for further increases in productivity resulting from the refinement of the application of the risk-based auditing methodology. There is also a need for an adequate remuneration structure which will assist the Australian National Audit Office to attract and retain competent professional staff, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The independent auditor also refers to the fact that the Australian National Audit Office has been continually reviewed now for over two years and should be given time to implement its reforms. I think that support for this recommendation is particularly important. I pay tribute to Mr John Taylor, the present head of the Australian National Audit Office, for the direction that he has been given to the Office. He has proved to be a very dedicated public servant and during his term he has been involved in substantially restructuring and refocusing the direction of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time Mr Sheridan reported that the ANAO be given an opportunity to get on with its job, following two years of continuous review. The independent auditor was somewhat critical of the management of information technology systems which required a sum of $28m in capital equipment over several years, and believed that it has made inadequate progress. That will be the big challenge for the ANAO. The fact that the independent auditor should make reference to the Sheridan report is of particular interest to me in my role as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and, secondly, because this report has yet to be tabled by the Government in this place. It shows the complete lack of management by this Government in relation to some very important aspects of discharging its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me fill in the background information for those honourable senators who may not be familiar with the sequence of events which led to the Sheridan report.  The Joint Committee of Public Accounts in April 1989 tabled its report No. 296 entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament, which made recommendations on the reform of the Australian National Audit Office. On 1 October 1989 the honourable Minister for Finance presented to the Senate the Government's first response to the Public Accounts Committee report. This response was to agree with the majority of the recommendations, but also it commissioned a further review. That review was headed by Mr T. A. Sheridan, the then South Australian Auditor-General, and its terms of reference were:</PARA>
<PARA>To examine, in consultation with the Auditor-General, the activities of the Australian National Audit Office to establish what further steps the Auditor-General could consider taking to more effectively utilise existing resources to enable an increase in efficient audit activity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This included audit methodologies, utilisation of the Australian National Audit Office's investment in information technology, and staffing, work practices and priorities. The Sheridan report, as I mentioned earlier, was completed on 31 March 1990 as required, and was given to the Auditor-General and the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> While the independent auditor has had access to the Sheridan report, it has yet to be made public. Naturally, as Vice-Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and having been involved in this question of reform of the Australian National Audit Office for nearly three years, I am disappointed that we should learn of the Sheridan recommendations via the independent auditor's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I am further advised by a reliable source that the annual report of that Office will be tabled on Thursday and will make considerable mention of the Sheridan report. Yet Parliament has not had the opportunity of looking at that report, despite the fact that it has been there since 31 March. Cabinet has yet to make a substantive response to report No. 296, apart from an interim response, and to the Sheridan report. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, after Question Time today, and before receiving the independent auditor's report, I placed a question on notice asking the Government when it intended to make public the Sheridan report. Therefore, I believe that this document today is quite timely. Given that the two reports will come before the Senate this week listing recommendations from the Sheridan report, I suggest that the Sheridan report be made public as soon as possible. I call on the Government to make its substantive response as quickly as possible to enable the Australian National Audit Office to implement the necessary changes and to show to the world community as well as the Australian community its high degree of professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Time does not permit me to say a great deal in detail about the independent auditor's report. However, I would conclude by saying that there are significant observations and recommendations in Mr Sharpe's report. These include the movement of control of an audit closer to those doing the audit and the entities being audited by the devolution of responsibility through the removal of layers of reporting reviews, and the creation of signing officers and audit managers. That would be in line with current private practice. There is also reference to the increased involvement of higher level staff in direct audit activities, and to the fact that sufficient fees should be charged to cover the total cost of an audit for all financial statement audits, including those of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that one of the most valid criticisms concerns the problem of training. Here Mr Sheridan is particularly critical of the Australian National Audit Office. The independent auditor, Mr Sharpe, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The ANAO has not adequately documented its training strategy. A strategy needs to be developed which gives more focus to training philosophy, training needs, course development and delivery, and the priorities. The development of a strategy will provide a consistent and high quality approach to training course development. </PARA>
<PARA> Staff in their first year are required to attend a specified training program. However, beyond that, staff are responsible for organising their attendance at training courses. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is a major criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the greatest criticism that comes most directly from the Department of Finance concerns the information technology used in the Australian National Audit Office. Over a five-year period this technology has been quite substantial, and up to 1992 will involve expenditure of the order of $28m. Mr Sheridan says:</PARA>
<PARA>This cost is substantial by any measure and appears high when contrasted with the cost being borne by private sector auditing firms. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The use of information technology was minimal, falling behind that of its overseas counterparts and major private auditing firms. The new system is aimed at moving the Australian National Audit Office to a position where it will be on a par with comparable organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he calls for:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an independent objective review of the project and its progress to be conducted. This review should be comprehensive and should include consideration of the management of the project . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that this issue has been adequately addressed by Mr Taylor in his annual report. Given the criticism, particularly that made by the Department of Finance, I would welcome the independent review which has been recommended by Mr Sharpe, but at the same time there is an inconsistency that we must grapple with. On the one hand, Mr Sheridan says that there should be no further reviews because of the constancy of review of the past two years. On the other hand, Michael Sharpe said that we must focus via an independent report on one further area, that being the development of information technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this additional financial resource that has just been given to the Australian National Audit Office by the Government will allow it to discharge its responsibilities and carry out its duties according to the highest professional standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the establishment of a statutory corporation, I would remind the Senate of a recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in which, although it recommended the setting up of an independent statutory authority to enable a degree of professionalism to be developed in providing adequate salary and remuneration, it also said that there has to be a link with the Parliament through a parliamentary audit committee, which would be the essential link between this Parliament and the new statutory body. I would like to see us go ahead with a statutory authority for the Australian National Audit Office with an adequate parliamentary link, which is so essential. Unfortunately, we are seeing the Government and the Executive distancing themselves from the Parliament. The ANAO is an essential link between the Parliament and the people. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>If the responsible Minister is to issue any directions to the Anti-Dumping Authority, surely such directions should be that it be more vigilant in protecting Australian society from the problems which might result from dumping. Let us be clear about this. It is not industry alone that we are protecting; it is society. Whenever one of our industries fails, society at large picks up the pieces. That is a fact which has become only too apparent since the failure of so many of our speculative entrepreneurial operators. </PARA>
<PARA> It is society, and not just industry, which benefits from viable industrial activities. Society benefits not just from the products that industries make for consumption, but from the employment generated, the reduction of expenditure on imports and the strategic value of determining our own production. When I say `strategic', I think that we should realise that that word can be used not just in the military sense but also in the planning sense-the planning for environmental benefits, the planning for health benefits and the planning for labour market benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Anti-Dumping Authority needs to be especially vigilant in respect of primary industries because it is in our primary industries that dumping can bring about particularly devastating results. The dumping of primary produce can, if timed effectively, cause havoc amongst our farmers. Because of the seasonal nature of production and the likelihood of bumper harvests in Australia coinciding with low worldwide prices, when primary producers are receiving low prices anyway, they are particularly vulnerable to attack from subsidised overseas competitors. I would have thought that the Minister would have understood this. Rather than producing directions, as we have here, to the Anti-Dumping Authority to lay off, to take care, and to be aware, for example, that the phrase `extended period of time' should only rarely be interpreted to mean a period of less than 12 months, this document reveals that the Government is not in tune with the real problems which dumping brings to our primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The present anti-dumping measures, in my opinion, are clumsy, bureaucratic and inefficient. One could be forgiven for thinking that they are designed more to appease and to protect the interests of overseas traders than to safeguard the viabilities of Australian industries and Australian society. I am most concerned to read that the intent of the ministerial direction is to make it clear that the term `material injury' means injury which is more than minor, injury which suggests that the industry concerned really is suffering. Those are the words which appear in this ministerial directive. In other words, the industry has to be not just affected but, in the words of this directive, really suffering. The industry has to prove this. It is up to the industry to prove that it really is suffering. That statement demonstrates that the Authority is not really an anti-dumping authority at all and that these ministerial directions are not in the best interests of our nation. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> It is generally recognised that the greatest global environmental threat is posed by rapid change in the composition of the atmosphere. Ice core sampling has provided us with a profile of both global temperature and atmospheric composition for almost the last 200,000 years. Analysis of these samples shows that the amount of CO2 in the global atmosphere varied between about 190ppm and 270ppm. Since the start of the industrial age when the level of CO2 was about 270ppm the amount of carbon dioxide has steadily increased until today it approaches 350ppm. It is now increasing at about 0.5% per year. Because of the inertia in both atmospheric physical processes and in the industrial and economic structures of human civilisation it is suggested that, even with the most vigorous attack on the causes of emissions, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will continue to rise to about 400ppm when it may be possible to stabilise it at that level. The precise consequences of this increase are unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> The ice core samples show a strong association between amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and global temperature. When the level of CO2 has been high so has temperature, when the level of CO2 has been low so also has the temperature. Scientific consensus is that the present rise of CO2 as a consequence of industrial uses of fossil fuels will be accompanied by a greenhouse warming. It is thought that this will result in significant sea level rise, shifts of climate patterns, disruption to agriculture and massive loss of species trapped by changing ecologies in isolated parks and remnants of older natural ecosystems. These consequences are serious and have led the Scientific Committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to recommend that CO2 emissions be cut by 60-80% as quickly as possible. This is a far more stringent requirement than the 20% suggested by the Toronto target but is also more soundly based. The latter was a political decision, the former is the decision of some 300 climate scientists from over 20 countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government appears to have accepted the seriousness of changes to the composition of the global atmosphere for which greenhouse has become the shorthand term. Mr Hawke's environment statement stated its importance. The present Federal government has also stated a commitment to developing an economy based on sustainable development. An economy which continually and exponentially increases the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere is not sustainable! Given the inertia mentioned above, especially the lag time between planning new industrial patterns and processes and their widespread appearance in the community, it is important to begin the move toward greater fuel efficiency and lessened CO2 emissions as soon as possible. Given also the dependence of the Australian economy on the operation of market mechanisms it is important that the task of CO2 emission reduction be accomplished, as far as possible within a market system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Montreal Protocol provides a model for CO2 reductions from motor vehicles. The Protocol mandates CFC reductions by set amounts but leaves industry free to determine how best to meet those reductions (with the exception of CFC use in pressure packs which were banned altogether). </PARA>
<PARA> This present Bill sets a limit to the CO2 emissions from each fleet of motor vehicles sold by a manufacturer or importer. This limit will relate to the total emissions from all motor vehicles sold by an importer or manufacturer in 1991 and will be based on the number, type, and fuel efficiency of the vehicles sold in that year. In each succeeding year this quota of total CO2 emissions will be reduced by 5%. Each manufacturer or importer will be free to determine how best to satisfy that reduction. They may decide to sell less vehicles overall, or sell less of their less fuel efficient cars and more of their more fuel efficient models, or make more efficient vehicles. A car using LPG emits about 18% less CO2 than one running on petrol. Selling cars which have been converted to gas would achieve four years of the required reduction. Quotas would be tradeable so that one importer or manufacturer could buy or sell quota to another who was better able to use the quota. In brief, another factor would be placed in the operation of the market to bend the market toward greater fuel efficiency and lessened greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation would have other beneficial consequences. The recent price rises in fuel resulting from the Gulf crisis has illustrated how vulnerable to events beyond our control our economy has become. Increased fuel efficiency reduces this vulnerability. Continued inefficiency will exacerbate this vulnerability as our indigenous supplies of liquid fuel are consumed. Improving our fuel efficiency also increases the life of our indigenous supplies. To the extent that we develop patterns of industrialisation which are more fuel efficient we shall be in a better position to help other countries to follow down the same road. Thus we turn an imperative to advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been placed between third and fifth worst greenhouse polluting country in the world on a per capita basis. Many other countries are much more fuel efficient across a wide variety of industrial and social practices. We are in real danger of being left behind if we do not start the process of improving fuel efficiency. Our motor transport contributes significantly to our total greenhouse gas emissions. By world standards our emission of greenhouse gases from motor transport, on a per capita basis, is among the worst in the world. In relation to cars there are already prototype Volvos and Peugeots which have achieved fuel efficiencies greater than 100 mpg on the old scale. Legislation of this sort will introduce the right signals in the market for these prototypes to become tomorrow's normal car. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the reduction of 5% each year is based on the quota for the previous year. Thus the absolute reduction in each year steadily declines. This is to take into account that significant early improvements are easier to obtain than improvements further down the track when one is starting from a more efficient base. For example, after five years the total reduction will be 22.6% and not 25% and between the fifth and the sixth year the reduction will be 3.8% and not 5% as it would be if this Bill required 5% absolute each year. Thus as the improvements become harder to achieve the degree of improvement required is adjusted to match this difficulty. </PARA>

<PARA> That new regulation 129 contained in amending regulation 26, and new regulation 142B contained in amending regulation 28 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 237 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion relates to the disallowance of Migration Regulations 129 and 142b, which, in brief, entitle the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to issue residential permits very specifically to pilots whose previous permits are under challenge in the Federal Court of Australia. The whole situation must be viewed against the backdrop of the pilots strike. We are all familiar with the history of that. In what I have to say about this particular issue of disallowance, I do not intend to review the merits or demerits of the pilots strike and of the actions taken by the various parties, and whether they were justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues here are perhaps twofold. The main issue is whether it is right and proper for Executive Government to intervene in the judicial process by legislation when it looks as though the Executive Government is loosing a particular case. Secondly, there is an issue of substantive consideration as to whether we should facilitate the entry of qualified personnel from overseas when hundreds of people in Australia with similar excellent qualifications to fill whatever vacancies occur are currently without a job. </PARA>
<PARA> I return chronologically to the first action in this particular case when the Government facilitated the entry of foreign pilots and arranged for them to be given residential permits under the employer nomination scheme. This action by the Government was challenged by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and it succeeded in the Federal Court of Australia in obtaining an interlocutory injunction. Mr Justice Keely of the Federal Court granted the injunction which would prevent the granting of any visa-entry visa or entry permit-to non-citizen pilots under the employer nomination scheme who were not physically present in Australia at 31 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The order preserved the status quo inasmuch as those pilots who had already been given entry permits were not affected by this particular order. However, the order issued by the court included Mr Justice Keely's finding that there was a serious question to be tried as to whether the decisions were authorised by the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This is really the kernel of the question that we are currently dealing with because at that point the Government decided that it did not want to run the risk of a court case proceeding which might invalidate the permits that were to be issued for the remaining pilots. Following the injunction of 31 May 1990, on 12 July the Government inserted certain provisions in the Migration Regulations allowing foreign pilots to apply for a change of status which had previously been prohibited under the terms of the injunction. As I said before, a new regulation 129 was inserted in the Migration Regulations which allows the granting of an extended eligibility pilot entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, a new regulation 142b was inserted in the Migration Regulations to enable the granting of a permanent entry permit to pilots who were already in Australia and who met the requirements of at least one of the paragraphs of section 47 of the Migration Act. Regulations 129 and 142b commenced operation on 12 July 1990 when they were published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. I believe that we are now faced with the question of Executive Government intervening in the judicial process of this country and that this is the central question which supports the disallowance of these regulations. In discussing this matter with the Opposition parties, I was asked to supply evidence that disallowance of these regulations would actually have a substantive effect apart from satisfying the principle, which I still believe is the overriding principle. The claim was made that pilots who had applications running would not be affected if these regulations were disallowed. We sought legal opinion and it was confirmed that the status of the pilots who had obtained residential permits-and therefore the process was completed-under these two new regulations would not be affected, but that once these regulations were disallowed the pilots who were still in the application process were really thrown back on the original position of relying on the provisions of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it was quite obvious that at least 300 to 400 pilots were still in that particular position. This emerged in the court case when it became clear and was stated by counsel for the Commonwealth that the process of getting these pilots through the system under the new regulations would take up to four months, and this number was mentioned as an estimate. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore believe that there are two legs of this particular argument which have been satisfied: firstly, the issue of principle, which surely must receive priority by this chamber. We are the guardians of the democratic parliamentary process. If we are prepared to sit idly by and allow Executive Government to intervene in the judicial process when it feels that the judgment might go against it on a substantive issue, then surely we are not doing our job of protecting the democratic process in Australia. Secondly, it has been shown that disallowance of these regulations will have a substantive effect and will enable Australian pilots to be given work ahead of pilots from overseas who have similar qualifications. I therefore believe that both major parties should support this disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990, and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 before us tonight, let me make it perfectly clear on behalf of the Opposition that we totally abhor this practice, which has been introduced tonight, of income tax being determined by regulation. It is an abhorrent principle of the first order. We would also prefer taxation affecting the so-called uplift factor to be determined annually by the passage of Bills through both Houses of Parliament because it is only by this procedure that we see the authority of the Parliament over the Executive. So the Parliament makes the decisions, not the Executive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the age-long political slogan-no taxation without representation. Further, the coalition deplores the disrespect that the Government has for the rule of law, particularly in income tax legislation. Taxpayers' rights are at risk right across the land. This is a familiar theme that I keep repeating in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The priorities of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for reform on simplification go back to 1985, but they are still in the too hard basket. If we look at legislation to be introduced tomorrow, we find foreign income legislation which has elements of reverse onus of proof, retrospectivity and incontestability-all going to the core of the problem of taxpayers' rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we put the Government on notice that the Australian taxpaying community is becoming increasingly restive-perhaps I should say fed up-with this Labor Government's unnecessary building of complexity on complexity and making tax laws unintelligent to ordinary, honest Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government seems to have a blinkered enthusiasm to catch the last cent of every dollar of revenue and to deny the last cent of any outgoing. The Government must lift its preoccupation veil of anti-avoidance and recognise the dignity of ordinary honest Australians. Without such a change in attitude, the Australian Taxation Office will be subjected to community perceptions similar to those prevailing in Old Testament and New Testament times. Honourable senators will recall that the tax gatherers in those times collected more than their due entitlement in situations not befitting a democratic civilised society. </PARA>
<PARA> Our laws must ensure that officials of the Australian Taxation Office can operate as a professional group upholding at all times the highest ethical standards. I believe that that is what they want. This is what the Government must deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to discuss what I regard as a most important part of the Bills that are before us. For example, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990 contains a clause which takes out of this Parliament the right to debate a proposed increase in tax-an uplift factor. This Bill proposes to allow by regulation the rate of the uplift factor to be applied when assessing provisional tax. The uplift factor is the extra percentage added to the previous years income so that in times of rising income the estimated tax payable in the present year is as accurate as possible. This has occurred with provisional tax assessments since 1976 in order to achieve reasonable consistency in incomes between the treatment of pay as you earn (PAYE) and provisional taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, it has been suggested that this uplift factor be 10 per cent. The uplift factor to date has annually been set by Parliament. The Bill now before us is an attempt to diminish Parliament's prerogative role. Fundamental to the lawgiving processes of this country is the concept of the rule of law that I mentioned earlier. This concept limits the executive arm of government. The actions of government are limited to those specified in regular law determined by Parliament as the representative of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to circumvent the practice of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary sanction and pass it to an outside body or group which has the power to determine the uplift factor. In other words, it is to become a discretionary power given to the Executive. The rule of law is seriously impaired by the use of discretionary powers. We have too many of them and their use has greatly increased in the past few years under this Labor Government. We now have literally hundreds and hundreds of discretions in the taxation area all given to one person-the Taxation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Discretions inevitably lead to arbitrariness and inconsistencies in the application of law. They also lead to difficulties for taxpayers in terms of knowing what the law actually is. They fit uneasily with this new concept of self-assessment in respect of which there has to be absolute certainty before the law. But that is not possible with many discretionary powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to give a bouquet to the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for his desire to try to make more open the taxation debate and to make himself accessible to as many groups as possible. I believe that this is refreshing; it is certainly a move that I welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The uplift factor is to be determined by regulations. So, the Parliament will no longer be involved, except in the case of special parliamentary intervention. The system has worked quite well in the past. I sympathise with the Government in respect of situations such as that which the Treasurer led us into last year before the election. At that time the Treasurer was not prepared to take out of a Bill non-contentious provisions which related to provisional tax. The Bill contained some elements which at the time we found objectionable. So the Bill, which contained provisions relating to the uplift factor and the imposition of provisional tax, was not passed before the Parliament rose for the election. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the Taxation Office was placed in a very difficult position of having to determine what it should do in relation to provisional tax. The regrettable result was that the Taxation Commissioner had to go out and reissue all of his provisional tax notices. Clearly, that is not a good practice. He did the best that he could, relying on precedents and the available provisions within the Act at the time. We did not challenge this action because we believed that under the circumstances he did what was humanely possible according to the tools that were available to him and the provisions of the legislation. But this sort of thing is clearly unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> We have spoken to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and expressed our wish to participate in meaningful dialogue with him and, maybe, the Treasurer, the Treasury officials and the Tax Office to try to find a mechanism that avoids the application of regulations and, if possible, avoids putting these sorts of things on a permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems, of course, is that at present we have taxation by regulation. There are proposals for the uplift factor to be permanently enshrined in legislation. One of the figures currently being quoted is 10 per cent. We are in economic recessionary conditions at present. To apply a 10 per cent factor in these sorts of conditions again puts the onus back on to the taxpayer who has to lodge a variation for provisional tax. If the taxpayer is wrong, he will be subject to all sorts of penalties. I say that there is room for a much more reasonable figure, given the economic circumstances of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no quarrel with a relevant uplift factor. But we do have a serious problem with a measure that gives the Government the discretion to lift the uplift factor in the ensuing years to 12 per cent from the 10 per cent that will apply this year. Such a device will further enshrine the practice of bypassing parliament and obviating the duty for it to deliberate on all measures which are intended to raise revenue by taxation. It is a fundamental responsibility of the Parliament which we must not let go. </PARA>
<PARA> If a parliament agrees to allow the executive government to increase any tax without first having the opportunity to debate it, it will just be allowing another nail to be put in the coffin of our own irrelevance as both individual representatives and a parliament. The Parliament has already allowed automatic twice yearly increases in excise on petrol, alcohol, tobacco and like products. So I would like to think that we have at least learnt a lesson from our mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> In that case, I suppose that the excise hikes have the virtue of being at least calculated in accordance with the consumer price index (CPI). The uplift factor is well in excess of the consumer price index. It is well in excess of the Budget calculation for inflation. So, 10 per cent is just too high. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's Budget estimate is for a 6.5 per cent rise in the consumer price index. In the ensuing years it is intended that the uplift be between 10 and 12 per cent. The Government just does not seem to be giving us much hope for the state of the economy in the future. This is certainly a pessimism that is shared by many. Consequently, the Opposition proposes to present to this chamber during the committee stage of this Bill an amendment to keep the determination of the uplift factor by the Parliament and not through regulation. All honourable senators have that amendment before them this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are other aspects of the proposed arrangements for provisional tax that need discussing. In February this year the Treasurer announced that a review of the present income tax legislation was to occur. I do not have to remind the chamber of the complexity of the extra 18,000 pages of legislation, court decisions, interpretation and explanatory memoranda, et cetera, that have been brought forward since 1 July 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The Green Paper on simplification was promised in the Budget. It was then postponed until the end of September. We are now in the middle of October, and we are still waiting. During the Estimates no-one seemed to be able to give me a date as to when we could expect the simplification package, except Senator McMullan, who offered a tentative date of 30 September. Unfortunately, the Treasurer is not helping Senator McMullan in the important work that he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget the Treasurer announced further changes to the provisional tax arrangements. So, far from honouring its promise to simplify the income tax system, the Government has, yet again, increased the complexity of the provisional tax system. This time, we find that selected individuals, including company directors and higher paid persons with more than one job, are to be subject to an extension of the provisional tax regime. The new rules will levy a provisional tax liability when PAYE collections in the preceding year fall $3,000 or more short of the taxpayer's actual liability on personal exertion income. The new rules have strewn even more obstacles in the taxpayer's path. </PARA>
<PARA> In all my dealings, both in the past as a tax agent and a company director, and now as a senator, I have constantly heard complaints from my constituents and others that the most annoying and disturbing factor that they face in income tax is provisional tax. Here is one avenue where the Government can make it a lot simpler than it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent Budget estimated that the Government would raise an extra $370m annually from this procedure. A number of questions and concerns surround this large additional amount of $370m. It has come to my knowledge that a number of accounting firms whose clients include people likely to be affected by the change are sceptical that the potential revenue to be gained from the changes will be anywhere near the projected amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of these people who pay provisional tax. Farmers, small business people, individual investors and retirees, as a result of the present economic climate, could expect to see a downward movement in their income and consequently in their income tax and also their provisional tax bill. Rather than paying the uplift factor, they would have justification for putting in a variation to their provisional tax. But why force them to do that by having an unnecessarily high uplift factor? In his Budget Speech, Mr Keating said that to keep the tax system fair, provisional tax arrangements will be extended to remove scope for high income earners deferring tax payments on wage and salary income at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. He said that this practice has been particularly prevalent in relation to directors' fees, commissions and bonuses and short term contract employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has cited this group as its predominant reason for the change. I find this rather surprising. All these sorts of people referred to should have been liable for the ordinary PAYE deductions for many years; that is, such payments are integrally linked with our PAYE system, which requires the payer to make tax instalment deductions before paying the recipient. Therefore, how can these measures raise $370m? One explanation given to us is that the Taxation Office is unable to enforce the existing law. I will not accept that. The sum of $370m is a high price to pay for what I refer to as `lax tax administration'. We found that the Taxation Office was not adequately enforcing the existing law, but I contend that 70 per cent should have been caught with the existing PAYE provisions. That aspect of the law has not been adequately policed and enforced. We are being asked to accept more complexity simply because of lack of enforcement of the PAYE system. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is such a high number of defaulting employers, the imposition of provisional tax on employees lets the non-complying employers off the hook. The PAYE provisions contain substantial penalties for defaulting employers, but the Taxation Office has not extracted its pound of flesh where it should have. To do justice to complying employers, the Taxation Office has an obligation to pursue those employers who do not do the right thing. The Budget Speech and Papers are silent on what will happen to those employers and why the situation has been let go for so long. That is the tragedy. I will allow honourable senators to ponder the aforementioned questions because they are serious. </PARA>
<PARA> Before us tonight we have the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990, in addition to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, which we have so far discussed. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and the Income Tax Amendment Bill also cover the new personal income tax rates for this year and next. As part of Mr Keating's February economic statement, taxpayers were promised tax cuts as a result of a restructuring of the tax scales. Two of these Bills here tonight-the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and the Income Tax Amendment Bill-implement these changes. As from 1 January 1991 we will have new tax rates. I commend the Government for that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the savings and the actual restructuring of the tax scales are not large, and are not large enough. Let me give honourable senators just one example; I have several, but I have a time problem. If, in 1989-90, someone earned $30,000, he or she will have paid tax of $7,157; in 1990-91 he or she will pay $6,953; while in 1991-92 he or she will pay $6,633. The savings are $204 for 1990-91 and $524 for the year 1991-92 respectively. I have other figures for different income levels, but that will suffice to show that the savings are not large; they barely cover the inflation rate. But do they? No; I am wrong. They come nowhere near covering the inflation rate. According to the parliamentary research service monthly indicators, inflation for the last financial year was 8.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the figures for an income of $30,000 a year. To maintain our lifestyle, considering inflation of 8.2 per cent, we need an extra $2,460. The tax cuts for the year are nowhere near enough; they amount to only a few hundred dollars. I know that many workers have received productivity increases of 3 per cent in the last year, and this has done something to help; but with the increases plus the savings in tax, we still come nowhere near covering the inflation rate. This problem will mean extra costs at the grocery store and reduced savings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good to note that the tax free threshold has increased from $5,100 to $5,400. However, again if we consider the inflation rate, the price increases, the reduced standard of living and the impacts of bracket creep, this is still not enough. This increase is not big enough. Fundamentally, the restructuring of the tax scales do not seriously take into account the problems of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> Bracket creep is that insidious dark horse which eats away at our hard-earned earnings by putting average wage and salary earners into a tax scale bracket never originally designed for an average income tax worker. That is the problem. This year, yet again, bracket creep will push an increasing number of PAYE taxpayers into higher tax brackets and increase the real tax burdens, despite the cuts. The new system will refund only half the additional revenue to be gained by the Government through bracket creep this year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the credit side, the bulk of the cuts will go to the lower income taxpayers with taxable incomes below $25,000. That is reasonable enough. Again, it does not go far enough, but we welcome it. Do not get me wrong: this is good, but the ordinary middle income worker on an average wage of, say, $25,000 gets very little benefit from tax cuts nowadays. It will be the increased taxes on these workers which will go to finance the large Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> With declining living standards through bracket creep, higher prices and high interest rates, the ordinary worker with a family is in a dilemma. The amount of income tax paid is a source of much personal dissatisfaction amongst taxpayers in this country. Over the years, personal income tax has jumped dramatically as a share of total revenue. It now represents 53 per cent of average Government revenue, despite the new fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and extensions to the wholesale sales tax, which have been pretty dramatic. Income tax revenue was only 31 per cent 30 years ago; it is now 53 per cent. A greater share has been taken out from the personal taxation system. Much more effort should be made by this Government to adjust the tax scales to make sure there is an equitable taxation burden. That is the last point I would like to make in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As a direct consequence of bracket creep, inflation has meant that more and more people are now in the top, or towards the top, tax brackets. Savings are down because half of all taxpayers pay more than 40 per cent tax on any interest, additional income or marginal income they receive. The same applies for any overtime done or any rewards received from working harder or more effectively. Working extra hours in a factory or coalmine is sometimes hard because one finds that almost half the money earned disappears in tax, and this is not really a great incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's biggest problems, both internally and externally, is debt; and it can only be solved by greater savings. The tax scales can be cut either by government cutting government expenditure or through a change in the tax mix. I think it is time that the Government looked very carefully at the suggestion put by the Opposition of a broad based goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government is well aware, in this year's pre-Budget submissions the main accounting bodies-the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, finance companies, construction contractors, the life insurance industry and the Australian Council of Professions- all advocated a form of broad-based goods and services tax as a means of redressing just some of the fundamental structural problems of the economy. Lest I be misunderstood, it is but one in a mosaic of reforms that are necessary to overcome this country's ills. But we must at least make a start. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is the only country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that does not have a form of consumption tax, either at wholesale or at retail level. According to Professor Cedric Sandford, the former consultant to the OECD on value-added tax systems, the Government's aversion to this form of tax was more likely to be, unfortunately, from political concerns rather than principled objections to changing the focus of the taxation burden. Unfortunately, just too much that this Government does has a political focus. However, I commend the Government on its reductions in the tax scales and the increase in the tax-free threshold, but I think that there is a need for much greater reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I would like to remind the Senate of earlier arguments concerning the uplift factor. I commend to the chamber the need and, certainly, the urgency for the coalition's proposed amendments that I will move during the committee stage of this debate. The Parliament should be the determiner of the taxes in this country. Rule by regulation leads to loss of parliamentary power and sovereignty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are looking at a package of Bills which are essentially part of the enabling legislation for the Government's Budget strategy. While the substance of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 may seem routine, as they are, in effect, building on the previous initiatives of the Government they are particularly important. It is also important that we take the time to consider the effect of this legislation on ordinary working people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first piece of legislation that I wish to speak to is the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, which will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to impose the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1990-91 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1991-92 financial years. The basic rate will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable income, which has been the rate since 1 December 1986. The Bill will also increase the low income thresholds below which people are not required to pay any levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Universal coverage and equity have been the dominant themes of the health care policy of this Labor Government. This Bill allows the continuation of these two themes. When this Government came to power there were almost two million Australians who were not covered by medical and hospital provisions, and they faced a very serious situation. Two million people-many thousands of Australian families-were in very dire straits when this Government came to power. For those who could not afford private health cover the grim reality that they faced was how to meet the costs of health care for themselves and their families. It was a basic tenet of this Government's social justice program that that fear and anxiety should be taken away from people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of cover was a barrier to the use of health services. In 1982 a study of 90 low income families by the Australian Council of Social Service found that over half of the families were forced to go without the treatment of often major health needs that were required. In contrast, a study of 56 low income families by the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence in 1985-86 found that families reported that they could use doctors and hospitals when they needed to. That was the contrast in a few short years, based on the Government's program. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare has enshrined an important principle: that health is funded by all according to their means and available to all according to their needs. This also means that health care is affordable. Fewer people now have to pay medical bills with the number of services bulk billed increasing from 35 per cent to 55 per cent of all services since the introduction of Medicare. It is a significant move of people who do not have to worry now about bills towards a 55 per cent target. </PARA>
<PARA> We can be sure, by supporting this piece of legislation, that our action is going to be supported by the vast majority of Australians. A recent survey commissioned by the Health Insurance Commission showed that a very high seven in 10 Australians are currently in favour of Medicare. The key finding of this survey is that support for Medicare is not only very high among those with Medicare cover; it is also high among those who have private health insurance. Almost three-quarters of all Australians favour Medicare because they see it as affordable and good value for money and because it is a system of universal coverage which also offers assistance to those financially not so well off. The principles of Medicare and the main features of the program have extremely solid support from a wide range of the Australian community. Bearing in mind this contrast between the Government's record and that of the Opposition, it is a bit surprising to see in the Sydney Morning Herald just a week ago an article headed `New call for tax bonus to people with health cover'. It is worth while reading the article. It points out:</PARA>
<PARA>Internal controversy over the Opposition's health policy took a new turn yesterday when another Liberal called for taxpayers who insure privately for basic medical and hospital care to be allowed to opt out of paying some tax. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australian Liberal backbencher Mr Ian Wilson, a former Fraser Government minister, has circulated a paper to his Coalition colleagues which he describes as the `philosophical extension' of the policy put forward by the previous Opposition health spokesman, Mr Peter Shack. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Shack surprised his colleagues last month by publicly advocating his policy in a public speech. </PARA>
<PARA>That article highlights the division in the Opposition as significant sections of the Opposition cling to the discredited policies of Peter Shack, a policy that is not supported by over 70 per cent of the Australian people. The Sydney Morning Herald article went on to describe the policy, far better than I could, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition was forced to abandon his policy in an embarrassing political fiasco just before the March election after Mr Shack admitted he could not fulfil previous promises that the policy would be revenue neutral and not leave anybody worse off financially. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is what it is all about. The people within the Opposition are still seeking to allow people to be given an advantage because they join private medical funds. The obvious danger in this is that there would clearly be pressure on people to force them into private funds because Mr Wilson's approach will lead people into being disadvantaged if they stay with the Medicare system, should the Opposition be foolish enough to repeat the Shack mistake and follow such a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I again quote the Sydney Morning Herald to emphasise the danger as far as the Australian people are concerned of the Opposition following this policy:</PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Wilson says they should not have to contribute through their taxes to the health cost of those who do not purchase private cover but could afford to buy it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wilson told the Herald he believed Medicare should be retained for those who could not afford to pay for private insurance and those who chose not to insure privately, but could afford to, would face a higher Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the threat from Mr Wilson. That is a very serious situation. Having said that, I am pleased to see that the next day, on Wednesday of last week, the Sydney Morning Herald, under the heading, `Collins joins Opposition health policy debate', stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The NSW Minister for Health, Mr Collins, yesterday fuelled growing divisions within the Federal Opposition over its health policy by calling on them to `do their homework' and `get it right next time'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Collins said the Opposition had `botched' its health policy during the last election and said he was amazed that the former health spokesman in charge of that policy, Mr Peter Shack, was now campaigning to have his policy accepted again. </PARA>
<PARA> In an interview on Sydney radio station 2UE, Mr Collins said: `They're trying to jump the gun with far too little information and for Peter Shack to try to revive the health policy that he lost on, I think, is inexplicable'. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Opposition-or at least sections of it-has a policy that is inexplicable in its attempt to move away from Medicare. I raise this matter because people have the opportunity at this moment to contrast the security of Medicare with the confusion of the Opposition. That is something that has to be taken into consideration when people consider the run-up to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to two Bills which introduce the rates of tax for the period 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990 and for later years-the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990 and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990. The changes to personal tax rates proposed by this legislation were foreshadowed in the February 1990 economic statement and are an integral part of the agreement reached between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) under the accord for the 1990-91 financial year. This agreement provides for increases in disposable income and living conditions through a continuation of wage increases, tax reductions and improvement in the social wage. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement also provides for an aggregate wage target of 7 per cent for 1990-91 with support for the following increases on the basis that award restructuring is continuing and successfully moving from award to award: a first increase to maintain the real value of wages following the September quarter 1990 consumer price index, which, of course, is being discussed currently; and a further increase of $12 per week six months later. </PARA>
<PARA> These increases are to be paid from a common date where the relevant unions remain committed to progressing award restructuring, which is part of the understanding. Included as part of the agreement is a modification of the no extra claims commitment applying to minimum rates awards to allow scope for additional negotiations for increases based on achieved increases in productivity and profitability. Outcomes of the process are to be limited and within the 7 per cent adequate wage target to which I have referred. Discussion may proceed between unions and employer bodies on how this element of the accord is to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The third component of this agreement is an additional 3 per cent superannuation phased-in aggregate over three years. I believe that this is a very important aspect of the Government's policy. Yesterday a press release put out by the Treasurer, Mr Keating-I think this is significant as it relates to the first figures that have come out on the impact of superannuation-stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's superannuation reforms were now pumping $19 billion a year into Australia's savings pool . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The changes since Labor won office not only meant Australia would be able to look after the growing numbers of people retiring into the 21st century, but that they would enjoy better living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The press release pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the first Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey of superannuation assets today, which showed that funds invested rose 21 per cent to $109.7 billion in the 12 months to March this year. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued-and it is worth while drawing attention to this because it is an exciting possibility at a time when there is a great demand for investment in Australia-to point out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . 21 per cent growth rate in the 12 months to March was worth $19 billion, more than double fund assets when Labor came to power in 1983, while an extra $5 billion has been invested in Australian shares over the past year. </PARA>
<PARA> `It is, of course, a remarkable achievement and it goes to show that superannuation is now a substantial part of the savings and asset picture of the nation which of course it wasn't in 1983,' Mr Keating said. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is something that is important. So when we consider this legislation that is primarily based on the taxation promises of the Government we have that additional aspect-at a time when we are talking about industry development-of the tremendous amount of money that wage and salary earners in Australia have been contributing to the future growth of this nation into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord wages proposals are subject to consideration by the Industrial Relations Commission in the forthcoming national wage case. The agreement reached between the Government and the ACTU is an important component of the Government's overall economic strategy. The accord agreements have had a significant influence on economic outcomes in Australia since 1983. They have underpinned macro-economic strategies aimed at a recovery from the 1981-82 recession and more recently at addressing the difficulties faced with our external account in the second half of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the accord, the alternative policy options available to the Government would have meant a far more restrained economy. The economic achievements of the accord, that I would just like to put on the record again, include: the reduction of unemployment in inflation from the previous double digit figures; the creation of over 1.6 million jobs in that period; and the remarkable drop of about 60 per cent in the amount of industrial disputation that has been recorded in this country. Owing to the restraint of wage and salary earners, a substantial reduction in the real unit labour costs of 10.5 per cent are now well known. Although, unfortunately, we have not had the movement that I would have liked to have seen in industrial development, nevertheless the wage and salary earners of this country have made a significant sacrifice in order that that might be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget deficit, of course, has been turned into a surplus, and in recent years the accord has been responsible for encouraging award restructuring, which is aimed at updating industrial awards so that they meet the competitive requirements of industry and provide workers with more secure and satisfying jobs, with opportunities for training and advancement. The award restructuring process is well under way, and most awards have been varied to incorporate changes which lead to real productivity increases. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to continue by drawing attention once again, as I did with Medicare, to the Government's proven record in this area, and to the danger that the Opposition still will unsettle and destabilise the country with its continued proposals to try to base the whole of the financial or the wage negotiating situation in this country in the hands of individual enterprises. I have outlined the stability that the accord process has given to this country but what we still have, unfortunately, is the Opposition sticking to the proposal that there should be negotiations only at the enterprise level, with no overall plan or strategy or agreement in place. Of course, those enterprise proposals by their very nature have to be unequal. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said here many times, the Liberal Party policy-the Opposition policy-is not to have everything fair and equal, because while the employer will have access to his employer's organisation, to the lawyers, to the economists and to the research from the State bodies and the national bodies of the organisation, what the Opposition says is that the individual 50 or 100 workers will form their own union. That is one view of it. Or, in some other way the workers will come together and be able to negotiate against the ultimate power that the employer has with all the resources of an employer's organisation. Of course, this is only a subterfuge. What the Opposition really wants to do is to take away from wage and salary earners the trade union that will advise them of the salaries and rates being paid in other places, in other enterprises, in other States, and in other cities. The trade union will give them the information that will allow them to go to the bargaining table without one hand tied behind their back. </PARA>
<PARA> So, unfortunately, the coalition will continue to push that policy because it has not seen that if we are to solve the many problems that exist in this country, we can only do so by a degree of cooperation. We can only get people to give away, as we have shown, the methods and the labour management relationships of decades when they know that the Government is backing the negotiations that will take place and, on many occasions, with the Government assisting with restraining and with resources in a whole range of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by commending this legislation to honourable senators and point out that it is part of a consistent path this Government is maintaining. Also I warn them that on these two issues-first of all on the question of Medicare, the Opposition is hopelessly divided as usual, and secondly on industrial relations and their enterprise agreement proposals-they are out of kilter with the needs of modern Australian industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point I was going to make. I have been in the Opposition party room only since May and I have never seen a more cohesive group of people who are more determined to win government and to turn this country around and not, as honourable senators opposite would do, create equality of outcomes for individuals, but indeed to create equality of opportunity. Coming from the parliamentary Labor Party, as Senator Childs does, how could he possibly even dare to say, after the last few months since the 24 March poll that his Party has been through, that the Opposition is divided? We have seen Minister after Minister knocking other Ministers over the head, knifing them in the back, and then having a very open and public squabble about all sorts of micro-economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I suggested earlier today in another discussion in relation to industry policy, if honourable senators opposite had worked out some of their priorities in the micro-economic reform area back in 1987, in what was meant to be the period of the great Hawke micro-economic reform agenda between 1987 and 1990-it is totally forgotten and was a disgrace-then perhaps this country would not be in as great a mess as it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Childs talks about the Liberal Party wanting to unsettle and destabilise this country with its industrial relations policy and its Medicare policies. I think one would be hard pressed to find a nation more unsettled and more destabilised, with an economy that is living on the razor's edge, than Australia is at the moment. It is a sad indictment upon the gross failure of this Government in so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point in Senator Childs's contribution here tonight that I want to rebut relates to his discussion about Peter Shack, the honourable member for Tangney in the other place, and the health policy discussion before the 24 March election. I do not think anyone would be stupid enough to say that the discussion of the honourable member for Tangney during the election did the Opposition, as it was, any good at that time. However, in Mr Shack's defence, it is fair to say that he is a very honest man and he was prepared to come out, to make an honest contribution, and to say that something that we had hoped for before the election was unable to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA> That is more than one can say about the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and this Government. Before the 1987 election they said that there would be no new capital gains tax and, of course, that promise lasted about as long as most of his other promises. We also have the great promise about the fact that there would be no more children living in poverty in Australia by the year 1990, and all of us who have spent any time out of this place and around the metropolitan areas of the cities of Australia know that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the only other promise that he has made recently-we will see whether he comes through with it-is his promise to stay on as Labor leader past the next election. I guess that if his track record of keeping promises is as good as it has been proven over the last seven years, then I sincerely doubt that he will. The conjecture is only as to whether Mr Beazley, Mr Keating or Mr Kerin is to succeed him. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not here to talk about that; we are here to talk about these tax Bills. I think it is fair to say that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, would have us all believe that Australia is a low taxed nation. Indeed, the Treasurer comes out on regular occasions saying that Australia is taxed at a lower rate than other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. All I can say is that when one is out there talking to business people or talking to housewives or talking to anybody, the rhetoric of the Treasurer, in trying to convince people that they are not being taxed very much, does not go over very well because it is just not true. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move on to speak about some of the reality behind taxation in Australia as opposed to the rhetoric of our Treasurer. The reality of these Bills is that, of course, the tax rates are being reduced and that must always be applauded. It would be nice to see the rates reduced a lot more. I think many taxpayers would love to see the rates reduced a lot more because there are so many more taxpayers slipping into higher and higher brackets and paying more and more tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Back on 17 August 1986 the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, described Australia's economic circumstances as being `in a crisis as great as the crisis of war'. I suppose that quote has been used quite often around the place. Back in 1787, some time before, an American philosopher by the name of Thomas Paine said of war, `It has but one thing certain, and that is to raise taxes'. I guess that is another statement that has been quoted here, there and everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are waging a war, an economic war at that, I suppose we could presume to ask: Who are we fighting and what are we fighting for? I suggest that not many senators would disagree that we should be fighting to make Australia more competitive, we should be fighting to reduce our foreign debt, and we should be fighting to reduce, if not get rid of, poverty. Most of all, we should be fighting to give Australians more economic freedom because it is only with that greater economic freedom that individuals can decide for themselves the kind of life they want to lead and where they want to invest and spend their hard-earned money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that that freedom and that individual's right to make decisions about his future is something that governments cannot decide. I suppose the one way that governments reduce that economic freedom is through taxation. For every increased dollar that they rip out of the back pockets of taxpayers, it is one more increment of less freedom that those individuals have. So when this Government rips out a dollar from an individual's pocket and spends it on some new government program, that is one less decision that that individual is allowed to make. I think that is a crucial point whenever we are considering taxation, considering the size of government and, indeed, considering the very role of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to my analogy to economic war-indeed, the Prime Minister's analogy-in looking at it as a war we have to ask ourselves: how have Hawke and Keating, how has this Government, done in fighting this war? I think it is fair to say that the Government is losing on a number of fronts. I think it is also fair to ask: How can one possibly win a war when the very best forces are taken and taxed out of existence, when the most lethal soldiers in the war have one arm and one leg cut off?</PARA>
<PARA> It reminds me of that scene from the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which I am sure many people have seen, where the Black Knight meets the troops along the way and he has one arm cut off and a leg cut off and he still wants to keep fighting and there is blood spurting everywhere. The Black Knight still wants to keep on fighting and he says, `Come on, have a go'. Then he loses another arm and another leg and he is lying there bleeding to death. Finally, his head is chopped off and he is still saying, `Have a go'. I think Australian taxpayers have a lot in common with the poor old armless and headless, hapless Black Knight-only in this case it is not the Monty Python team which is chopping off arms and legs, it is this Government which is bleeding the taxpayer and the business people dry. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the Government thinks that it is inflicting only a few economic flesh wounds. Most of us who have been out in the real world, who can actually spend a bit of time away from this place and mix with the real people out in the country or in businesses or in the supermarkets or in the delicatessens, know that Australians are suffering because they are overtaxed and this is hurting them severely. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to understand that if Australians can actually survive the taxes and charges slugs of the State Labor governments and the gross economic mismanagement and incompetence of those governments and actually make a bit of money, that is when they start meeting the Federal fiscal fiend and the Federal Government's savage tax regime. Like the Black Knight, first Australians pay sales taxes, excises and Customs duties. Then if they make a profit after that and they actually sell their goods and interest rates do not chew up the profits they are making while the goods are sitting on the shelf, they get the privilege of paying company tax. If they are still going after that, if there is still a bit of profit left in the back pocket, they then get the privilege of paying exorbitant rates of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that just when taxpayers really have had the blood and the life and the limb sucked out of them by this voracious Government, the Government can always, if there is anything left, ensure that it taxes what taxpayers' earnings may be in the following year with provisional tax. I suppose while our poor taxpayer is lying in a pool of fiscal blood, like our Monty Pythonesque Black Knight, armless and legless, the Government can still hit him, if there is an ounce of life left in him, if there is any money left in him, with the capital gains tax. If that does not end him, what will?</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate, and it is something that many small business people ask themselves these days: Why would one bother to fight on? I suppose it is no wonder, to honourable senators opposite, with this incredible impost imposed by Federal and State Labor governments, that thousands of small businesses have decided to give up the fight and throw in the towel and, indeed, with 128,000 more people out of work since last June, they have given up the fight, too. I suppose it is fair to say that one does not get much tax and one does not get much revenue out of unemployed people or businesses that have gone to the wall. There comes a point where taxation and the regressive rates of tax which have been imposed by this Government are counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA> On the more positive side, it is fair to say that Australia is a nation of great natural wealth, we have a highly educated population, and we are very close to the rapidly growing South East Asian area. What Australia should be doing is fighting to become a major economic force in that region. To do that, we need a motivated force of men and women who are inspired by their economic self-interest to work harder than they have ever worked before. These Australians will work hard in the full knowledge that they will be rewarded for the extra effort and that they will be rewarded as individuals and that they will share the achievement of this reward as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what this Government has done about motivating individual Australians to work harder and to produce more. The figures relating to pay as you earn tax receipts show that between 1982-83 and the estimates for 1990-91 in the Budget Papers there has been an increase in those tax receipts of about 128 per cent. If we take into account that the inflation rate during that period was about 78 per cent over that time, the real rate of increase was somewhere around 70 per cent. If we take into account all the other forms of income tax, including capital gains tax, the Medicare levy, which we have referred to earlier, and the prescribed payments scheme, in 1982-83 the figures were $22.967 billion rising to something like $54.85 billion in the current year, which is a 138 per cent increase. If we adjust that for inflation, it is an increase of 60 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to tax on companies. In 1982-83 the revenue from that area was $4.768 billion and the current year estimate is revenue of $11.635 billion-again, an increase of 144.4 per cent or, inflation adjusted, around 66 per cent in real terms over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> During this time we have had a whole load of new forms of income tax-the withholding tax, tax on superannuation, the resources rent tax and the fringe benefits tax. The withholding tax, because it came in just prior to 1983, raised $259m in those years. Revenue from all those forms is proposed to raise about $3.36 billion in the current fiscal year. That represents an outstanding increase of 1,199.61 per cent or, if one makes an adjustment for inflation, 1,121.61 per cent-an unreal figure. But basically what we are saying is that this Government has found another $3.36 billion over the last seven and a bit years. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount raised from sales tax in 1982-83 was $3.49 billion. In 1990-91, the figure was $10.668 billion-an increase in excess of 205 per cent from sales tax. So we ask ourselves what this Government's real policy is in relation to consumption tax. Senator Watson has referred to this already, so I will not cover that ground. But basically in this one area of tax revenue, under this Government-even after taking into account an inflation factor of 78 per cent over that period-there has been a real increase in revenue of 127.67 per cent in seven and a bit years, which is over 16 per cent per annum. To add up all those boring statistics, total tax revenue in 1982-83 was $40.743 billion moving up to a total tax revenue of $96.921 billion-if those targets are reached-in 1990-91, an increase of 136.33 per cent, or indeed about 7.3 per cent per annum over the eight-year period in real terms. The Treasurer would have the Australian people believe that they are being taxed less and less. It is important that the people of Australia know that when the Treasurer says `less and less', what he is really saying is `more and more'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to talk about one of the important consequences of taxing everything that moves. I think the Government has taken that tax policy a bit further and has said, `If it keeps moving, tax it a bit harder'. What this policy and regressive tax rates have done to the Australian community, both the business community and the housewife and general households, has basically been to create an economy and business decision making which are driven by the tax system. That is something we would like to avoid. In other words, the regressive tax rates and the regressive tax system, in a very real and destructive way, distort all sorts of decisions. If one is looking at investing some money, setting up a new enterprise or spending some money anywhere, one always takes tax effects into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be a matter for the Government to direct, persuade or otherwise entice people on how to spend or invest their own money. One day the Government will decide that people should put their money into family homes; the next day or the next year it will decide that superannuation is perhaps a better place for people to put their money; and the next day it might decide that people should invest their money in export industries, films, the arts or whatever it thinks is the right idea. So, in other words, we have a tax system that distorts decision making. Indeed, it is a regressive tax system that makes people spend a lot of their time thinking about how they will get through this world by minimising their tax. I do not think anyone in this place would applaud that. But it is a very real situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, an entire industry has been set up to provide tax advice. There are financial planners and accountants specialising in tax. Larger companies have tax specialists working within them to structure their affairs to minimise tax. When taxes get so high that people have to invest so much valuable time and expertise in trying to reduce their tax, obviously that has a large impact on our ability as a nation to be competitive, entrepreneurial and to look for opportunities at a time when we really need them. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess it is fair to say that in a competitive world environment where the nations in the South East Asian region in particular are getting on and increasing their productivity, miles ahead of Australia, it is not hard to imagine why, when most of our good brains and professional brains are sitting up late at night in tall buildings trying to figure out how to avoid and minimise taxes and come up with new schemes; indeed, individual executives and even middle and low income earners are trying to figure out how they can squeeze the last dollar out of their tax return. With all of that ability and skill going into minimising tax, Australia is not competing very well in the South East Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude with a few quotes on a philosophical nature about tax levels and governments taking control of people's lives and indeed the propensity of government to tax people and impose regressive tax rates which, I think it is fair to say, basically chop down tall poppies and create the view that anyone who earns a buck or does a little better than average should be taxed out of existence because that person can afford to pay. I guess that is an argument that relates back to yesterday's sales tax measures on luxury cars. I quote from a former Secretary of Treasury in the Nixon and Ford administrations, William E. Simon, in his book A Time for Truth:</PARA>
<PARA>Our citizens must learn that what keeps them prosperous is production and technological innovation. Their wealth emerges, not from government offices or politicians' edicts, but only from that portion of the marketplace which is free. They must also be taught to understand the relationship among collectivism, centralized planning, and poverty . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate must understand that the more government and the more control over people's lives and the more centralised and collectivised planning, the more taxation is required and the less economic freedom individuals have. I put it to the Senate, and it is a philosophical belief that I feel strongly about, that with the Government getting bigger and bigger and taxes getting higher and higher, as I have clearly demonstrated here tonight, economic freedom is reduced significantly and Australia's ability to become competitive, and indeed the ability to allow individuals to earn more money, is severely inhibited. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote another extract from Simon's book:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . profits needed for investment must be respected as a great social blessing, not as a social evil, and that envy of the `rich' cannot be allowed to destroy a powerful economic system. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I think that reinforces my philosophical belief about high and regressive rates of tax, chopping down tall poppies and taking away motivation for people to take Australia through with their own entrepreneurial flair, work and toil to earn money and reward for effort. Because if we have a government, which I think we have at the moment, that has this egalitarian view that we do not have equality of opportunity but indeed equality of outcomes, and the tax system is probably the best way to achieve that egalitarian objective, Australia will be no more than and have no chance of becoming more than the white trash of Asia. I do not want my nation to be that. I think that the taxation system is an important part of government policy which needs to embrace the philosophy that people should have that motivation and encouragement to succeed and to help Australia through its success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak for only a few minutes on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986. The Bill contains technical provisions that raise various thresholds. Therefore, it is not a controversial Bill in itself and we shall be supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What concerns me, however, is that once again we have a situation in this country in which Medicare is creating tremendous hardships for the people of Australia. We all remember the lovely brochure we received from the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in the early days that contained the words `Welcome to the best health care system in the world'. In those days the levy was one per cent, and those people who were below the threshold did not pay the levy and those who were over the threshold paid the maximum. This was at a time when the patient paid 85 per cent of the doctor's schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a totally different situation, because we have a levy of 1.25 per cent. We were promised by Dr Blewett that it would not go up, but that situation did not last very long and the levy rose to the present figure. The ceiling was taken off the levy and it is now in parallel with a taxpayer's income. As to the schedule fee for doctors in private hospitals, Medicare pays only 75 per cent of any treatment. Consequently, because of all these additional costs for the average Australian who was insured, people are moving out of insurance, out of the private hospital system and into the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a recent headline in the Australian: `Breathing life into the health system'. The article under it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is sick. It is not likely to survive without fairly radical surgery. The pathology is plain. Medicare has bled the private hospitals and stretched the public system, which cannot bear the weight. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Medicare was introduced in 1984, the proportion of Australians covered by private health insurance has fallen from near 70 per cent to less than 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Labor Ministers who can well afford not to bludge on society have Medicare and take out no insurance at all. So when one of their family or they themselves go into hospital, they take the place of a pensioner who is unable to get a bed. Let us not be misled or hide from the fact that if a Minister or one of his family want a bed, they will get it, and will get it very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> People have moved from the private hospital system-a system that is becoming too costly-into the public hospital system. As the Australian article said, the system is collapsing under the weight of the patients. There are now lengthy hospital queues. They are so long that pensioners in particular are giving up and not bothering to have their hips fixed and are resorting to wheelchairs. Such people are unable to get medical surgery carried out in an appropriate fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is such a blow-out in costs that the Federal Government has decided to limit the number of beds, limit the health care, rather than keep on increasing funding. Why has that blow-out occurred? Australia has an ageing population and it follows that health costs will increase. It has a general increase in the population, and there are rising expectations that people can have anything done these days. They can have triple bypasses, hip replacements-the lot. Indeed, I myself have had a hip replacement. People can have all sorts of replacements done. Because the Prime Minister promised us the best health care, the expectation is that we can have these things, and have them for nothing, and Medicare will cover the lot. These are the expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that is all the new expensive technology and all the new expensive drugs. The expectation and belief in the community is that the levy covers the lot. This is far from the truth. We know only too well that the levy does not cover a third of the costs of health care in Australia. The Government pretends otherwise, and indeed it was the main campaign at the last election. It was said that the levy covered health costs and that if some people were allowed to opt out of the levy, there would not be enough money left in the pool to pay for the health of the nation. That was what the Government was putting round, and it is absolutely untrue. As I have said, the levy does not cover a third of the costs to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The frustration of surgeons in Australia is unbelievable. They are trying as best they can to service the patients and to go to them. At the conference of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons last week, we heard statements suggesting that it would be a good idea for patients to sue the Government for not enabling them to enter the public hospital system. The headlines were `Call to sue on hospital wait'. I wish to read just a part of this item because I believe it is important that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is present for this debate, hear this. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Patients on long Medicare waiting lists should sue the Federal Government, a Melbourne conference heard yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Australian College of Surgeons' state chairman, Tony Buzzard, told the conference on the crisis in public hospitals that people getting sicker while on waiting lists would be justified in going to court. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Buzzard, a medical-legal consultant, also said he believed they would have a reasonable chance of winning. </PARA>
<PARA> `The promise of Medicare is that it will deliver access to high quality care,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course we all got the pamphlet from Mr Hawke telling us so. Mr Buzzard continued:</PARA>
<PARA> `If the Government has not honoured that commitment, it stands liable. </PARA>
<PARA> `Such a legal action would open the floodgates for suits against Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> `I believe that patients would be quite justified in bringing an action for Medicare's failure to fulfil its public duty and provide services.'</PARA>
<PARA>The surgeons, frankly, do not know where to turn. The conference was told that ambulances shop around to find a place where they can get a bed for the patient. The article concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> `Waiting lists are a disgrace, ambulances have to shop around for a bed and patients who should be in beds are littering the casualty departments.  Morale is low and frustration is high among the doctors, nurses and other staff. </PARA>
<PARA> `The Government is letting our hospitals decline at the community's peril.'</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that the Federal Government, which previously financially supported the States' hospitals fairly well, has allowed the States to continue to close more and more beds as its funding of those hospitals diminishes. The Federal Government will not give the States enough to run the hospitals properly. So we have more and more beds going by the board. In their frustration, nurses are leaving the hospitals. Because of the vicious circle, the hospitals cannot employ enough nurses, and altogether the situation is deteriorating to such an extent that I believe the system will very shortly fall apart. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has seen fit to say that charging pensioners for drugs, making pensioners pay a small amount per prescription-say, $2.50-will cause them to think twice about having a drug prescribed or about collecting the drug. If the Government is serious and if the Government really believes that, why does it not also say, `We will stop bulk billing; we will stop the completely free medical service to everyone, except pensioners and the disadvantaged'?</PARA>
<PARA> The only reason the Government has for not doing that is a philosophical one. It will not deliberately destroy its beloved Medicare, no matter how much it is sending this country down the gurgler, no matter how much this health system is hurting Australian citizens. All the Government has to say is that those who can afford it, such as Dr Blewett, Mr Howe, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is sitting at the table, and I, should be insured. We should make the beds at the hospitals available for all those disadvantaged and pensioners who are on the waiting list. We should pay our insurance and, through that insurance, pay the doctors the full amount-not bulk bill so that people can go to the doctor as often as they like, as frequently as they see fit, and not have to pay a penny. </PARA>
<PARA> It is illogical that the Government says, on the one hand, that it will make a difference if pensioners have to pay something for their drugs but, on the other, that it will not limit the doctors' visits if bulk billing is taken away from the whole community and left just to pensioners and the disadvantaged. I have spoken about this issue on many occasions. The Government keeps turning a blind eye and a deaf ear and will continue to do so until the whole Medicare debacle collapses around it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Listening to some of the previous speakers, in particular Senator Campbell, one would think that the generally available knowledge that we are the third lowest taxed country among industrialised nations had totally bypassed them. One is also reminded, by contrast, of the statements by Mr Dick Smith, a noted entrepreneur of a somewhat different calibre from the entrepreneurs we have been hearing so much about lately. I recall Mr Smith saying that he does not retain tax avoidance experts; he is proud to be able to contribute to his country's well-being, to the infrastructure, to the education system, and to the health system that he and his family are using and that thousands and millions of Australians are using.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the current climate, very often created by previous speakers on both sides of this chamber and certainly outside, this must appear as almost sacrilege, certainly as idiocy. Yet Mr Smith's statement should represent the moral fibre of our citizens and it should be the principle on which honest business is founded in this country. Without a sound government based infrastructure, without public utilities, business could not exist. It is interesting to note that, while big business did not complain when high interest rates affected small business, home buyers and farmers, in the past few months it very quickly took up the cudgels and asked for government intervention when corporate profits started to take a downward turn. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is examining the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990, which are being debated cognately. I shall deal, first of all, with the rates and provisional tax Bill. This Bill is designed to alter income tax as from 1 January 1991 to deliver the tax cuts promised in the Budget; to reduce the medical expenses rebate from 29 per cent of the excess over $1,000 unreimbursed medical expenses to 21 per cent in two years' time and in 1991 to 25 per cent; to insert, as a standing measure, the rules concerning the calculation of provisional tax for 1990-91 and subsequent years; and to broaden the provisional tax system to include salary and wage income where there is a shortfall of more than $3,000 worth of deductions from previous years. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, the provisional tax provisions refer to the customary practice of creating an uplift of 10 per cent for calculating the rate of provisional tax which is to be levied. This year it is proposed to be 10 per cent; however, the Government proposes to fix a maximum level of 12 per cent which it can impose by regulation. The Australian Democrats do not accept this discretion giving the Government the power to raise a tax by a regulation. Our amendment will seek to leave the tax at a bare 10 per cent but to continue that 10 per cent for subsequent years, unless otherwise provided by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax cuts which were announced during the election campaign and confirmed in the Budget will not be opposed. They benefit low and middle income earners and are thus reasonably equitable. The only point one could make is that it is rather sad that these tax cuts for low and middle income earners come in this financial year, whereas the tax cuts benefiting high income earners came in previous years. Perhaps that is an indication of the Government's priorities, too. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of these tax cuts, the threshold has been increased from $5,100 to $5,400. We take a particular interest in the tax threshold as it affects pensioners. We believe that the tax threshold for pensioners in this current year should be $10,000. It is still considerably short of that: currently for a single pensioner it is $9,789 effectively and for married pensioners $8,217. We encourage the Government to push towards that threshold for pensioners and beneficiaries. On our calculations, that expenditure would be approximately $160m in the current financial year. It is not in the Government's Budget provisions to introduce this, but it is something we have included in our alternative Budget. I urge the Government to look towards that as an equity measure. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is another measure which we will introduce by way of an amendment to this Bill; that is a marginal income tax rate of 60 per cent on that part of income which is above $100,000. The motivation is quite clear-rather than taxing the people who cannot resist and do not have the capacity to generate political pressure, we suggest that the Government should tax the people who have the capacity to pay. In recent years, the trickle down theory has become the vogue and the tax rate has been compressed to a point where the low and middle income earner deserves the sympathy of Senator Campbell rather than the high income earners who currently have more disposable income than ever before in Australia. It is time that we introduced a measure of social equity into our tax system. Hence the amendment that I will seek to move, and which has now been circulated, to introduce this particular tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also advert to the fact that the Government seeks to introduce one further provision in this Bill which will broaden the provisional tax system to include salary and wage incomes, where in the previous year pay as you earn (PAYE) contributions have fallen short by more than $3,000. We raise no objection to that particular provision; we think it is fair and equitable and needs to be used to enforce payment of tax. However, we do note that it is an enforcement measure which is, once again, directed at PAYE earners. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government persistently avoid attacking those people who still enjoy the privileges of tax avoidance loopholes? I refer, amongst others, to tax savings which result from the difference between the company tax rate and the rate of withholding tax payable by non-residents on interest derived. The obvious answer is to reduce the current differential which is approximately 25 per cent. As we know, the withholding tax is currently 10 per cent, although some of our reciprocal taxation agreements would allow a 15 per cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of countries do not have reciprocal arrangements and the withholding tax rate could be increased considerably. There are precedents across the world where this differential exists. Canada, for instance, imposes a 29 per cent rate on non-treaty country residents, whereas the rate for treaty country residents can be as low as zero depending on the treaty, of course. France imposes a 45 per cent rate on non- treaty country residents, whereas the rate for treaty country residents is dependent on particular arrangements and contracts. The United Kingdom imposes a rate of 27 per cent on non-treaty country residents, whereas the rate for treaty country residents can be as low as zero. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that amongst these countries Australia alone persists in imposing a 10 per cent withholding tax rate thereby opening a vast loophole which it has been estimated could lose up to $1 billion in revenue in avoidance measures. In addition, the Australian Taxation Office has actually admitted recently that $100m is evaded in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other tax avoidance loopholes which the Government could profitably attack rather than, once again, targeting PAYE taxpayers, such as the royalty provisions which are used to transfer profits out of Australia. We believe that the Government should completely review the taxation treatment of all royalty payments to tighten up the provisions. One of the most worrying is the trend of purportedly selling copyrights and brand names overseas and then paying licence fees to these offshore captive entities. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of luxury cars, the Government has omitted to act to limit the leasing charges of luxury cars allowed as a tax deduction, so the provisions levying a higher sales tax on luxury vehicles can very conveniently be overcome by using the leasing mechanism. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990. Under the Constitution a separate Act which actually imposes taxation is necessary. This was introduced to prevent the Government from being able to tack another provision onto revenue Bills. The two Bills formally impose income tax and the Medicare levy respectively for the 1990-91 year and subsequent year for all taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill which imposes the Medicare levy has also raised the exemption levels for the levy, which we support. We believe that the formal annual imposition of the tax, while it is constitutionally necessary, is a waste of the time of the Parliament if it has to be done separately every year. To our mind there is no reason why the imposition of income tax and the Medicare levy cannot be enacted to apply in this and subsequent years, which will save us a lot of trouble. It will also make sure, at least in the Medicare area, that a future government, of whatever complexion, which might be of a mind to get rid of Medicare cannot do so simply by omitting to bring in the Bill imposing a Medicare levy. For these reasons, we will be moving an amendment to impose income tax and the Medicare levy on a continuing basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing my remarks I wish, again, to call on the Government to turn its mind to tax avoidance loopholes, which in our alternative budget numbered 22, are yielding possible revenue of $2.6 billion. Surely, this is a matter that the Government should address instead of creating-I am not saying that it is doing so actively-a climate where the Taxation Office is pulling back from its program of auditing and from issuing tough regulations which force our companies to disgorge some of the profits which they have avoided paying tax on in recent years during the deregulation boom and now bust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating legislation regarding income tax rates for the remainder of 1990 and the continuation of the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy for 1991. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 may be described as mechanical. They do, however, involve essential areas of policy where the actions of the Hawke Labor Government are failing the people of Australia. That is the area to which I would like to address my comments tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to taxation, this Government works on the principle that if it asserts what is patently untrue for long enough people will believe it. Thus we are being told by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that we are lightly taxed and that we are being generously treated by changes to the tax scales. I have just heard Senator Spindler's contribution. Naturally enough he agrees with that too. As I said in this place last night, when we are dealing with tax junkies such as the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party, that should not be surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> Before any of us count our chickens for the 1990-91 year notice, should be taken of a statement made on 26 August by Mr Richard Buchanan of the Taxation Institute of Australia. When a promised tax cut is combined with the reality of inflation and bracket creep, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a 7 per cent wage increase and a 6.5 per cent inflation rate will in fact be worse off by $2.64 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> In a double income family with each on average earnings there will be a loss of $262 for the year or $5.28 a week. Of course, this is just a continuation of the decline in living standards that we have progressively seen over the last 7 1/2 years. A taxpayer on 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings-not what one would normally describe as a massively wealthy income-would be worse off by $4.39 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Rises in oil prices over the last month, with their effect on the general economy, will make the inflation prediction conservative. I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) a question a couple of weeks ago, after the price of fuel had gone up decidedly, about what impact that would have on the Budget estimates. At that stage he said that they were flexible and that they were always an estimate. He did not really know the answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we debate adjustment of the tax scales, we should remember that inflation is the ally of big taxing Labor governments as it is the engine pushing more average wage earners into higher tax brackets. It is a fact of life under the Hawke Labor Government that inflation has risen, according to the consumer price index, at 7.6 per cent annually compared with an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 4.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned to hear Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats substantiate the moves that the Government has made in this area. He keeps justifying these moves, when the people whom he allegedly represents are the ones who are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the crocodile tears of the Treasurer that a greater emphasis on taxation through a goods and services tax, as proposed by the coalition, would erode the value of savings. This is exactly what happens under the inflation that this Government, for all its reliance on extortionate interest rates, has never made a sustained effort to control. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the public sector is forecast to grow at 2.75 per cent in 1990-91, when the essential private sector will not grow at all and with business investment down by more than 7 per cent, reflects the continuing pressure of higher taxation on which this Hawke Labor Government relies. It is not the sign of a low taxed country that over the last seven years of Labor Government fixed capital formation in Australia has been 22 per cent lower than the average of 24 OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, there is no change to the rate of Medicare levy for 1990-91. There is no change to the essential fact, glossed over, of course, by this Government, that the levy is nothing more than a tax surcharge with little relevance to the cost of health care in Australia. The Budget Papers predict that the levy in this coming financial year will raise $2.7 billion. This amounts to 21.1 per cent of the total cost of health care expenditure of $12.9 billion and 57.4 per cent of expenditure on medical benefits alone. In 1989-90 the levy raised $2 1/2 billion and amounted to 21.3 per cent of total health spending and 59.6 per cent of spending on medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Gradually, therefore, the levy has less and less relevance to the true cost of health care and helps this Government in its constant public relations exercise that Medicare is adequately looking after Australia's health needs. Maybe it can if, in fact, we avoid becoming seriously ill and in need of elective surgery. But it certainly will not look after the people who get ill and who need to have hospitalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall health outlays continue their inexorable upward spiral despite the cost savings adopted in the area of pharmaceuticals. Medical services will grow by 11.4 per cent and in total there will be a 2.2 per cent rise in real health spending. The Budget Papers tell us that by 1993-94 health will comprise 15.4 per cent of total outlays compared with 13.6 per cent last year. I might remind the Senate that this form of health cover-the Medicare system-was designed by Dr non-medical Blewett back in 1983 when he said that it would be a self-funding system. A self-funding system it is not; a self-funding system it has never been. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government makes much of its attempts supposedly to tackle overprescribing, it does nothing to discourage the overservicing that is the inevitable product of the Medicare system. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) can boast that bulk billing has risen from 35 to 55 per cent of all Medicare services, with general practitioners services at 65 per cent. There is no disputing that the incidence of bulk billing has gone up and up and that people are going to doctors for any reason because they do not have to pay. When will we get to a system where there is more responsibility on both the provider and the patient? The 31 per cent rise in medical benefit items from 1983-84 to 1988-89 has taken place with only a slight rise in the aged population and points to the increase in demand that Medicare has generated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government constantly tells us that the reason for the increased cost burden on Medicare is the development of technology and the ageing population. I take issue with that because there has been only a very slight rise in the aged population in that time. If a system is unable to cope with the developments of technology and the increased availability of that technology, the system is not an adequate one to service the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What does prevent a more massive blow-out of public health expenditure is the fact that 45 per cent of Australians have private health cover and 87 per cent of these people are covered for private hospitalisation. Yet, once again, it has to be stated that this Government does nothing to encourage self-provision among younger, healthier Australians whose participation is essential if private cover is to remain within the reach of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I must state a simple but forgotten fact that unless 45 per cent plus of Australians keep their private cover, Medicare will grind to a halt even faster. But there is absolutely and utterly no incentive for people to take out private health insurance cover. The problem is that the demand is too great in the public hospital system and there is no incentive for people to go to the private hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> People who are privately insured at the moment are in fact paying three times for their health cover: they are paying this idiotic 1 1/4 per cent levy, which covers only 21 per cent of the total cost of health care; the rest of it is being picked up in general revenue, which is their second payment; and their third payment is through private health insurance. That just is not a correct mechanism to encourage more people to go into private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Withdrawal of government support for re-insurance and for private hospital beds has created $400m in additional costs for private insurance and forced up the cost of insurance by as much as $150 annually for a family. Every family knows at the moment that it can afford less and less. When families do their budgets they know what they can cut out. They know that they have a problem with high interest rates at the moment. They look at all of the expenses that they have, they look at any private health insurance that they may have and they then assess whether they need it. If they have been healthy in the recent past, they decide that that is one of the first things that goes. Therefore, we have this declining membership of private health insurance funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments put further pressure on the non-government medical sector by using private patients as a means of financing public hospitals, while 8,000 private hospital beds lie empty. Why is it, if this system is so good, that the public hospitals actually attract the private patients? The answer is that the public hospitals get paid more by having private patients in their hospitals. Yet, as I say, there are 8,000 private hospital beds lying empty and there are many private hospitals on the verge of closure because they are unprofitable. They are not unprofitable because of bad management, as the Government would suggest; they are unprofitable because so many people are now pulling out of private health insurance owing to the disincentives created by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Minister for Community Services and Health appears to follow the same collectivist philosophy as his predecessor, stating on 12 September that Medicare enshrined the principle of taking from all according to means and delivering according to needs. What rot! This sentiment was contradicted by the Minister's admission that in Victoria alone 4,500 people were waiting for elective orthopaedic surgery, with an average waiting time of 3.4 months. What an admission for any Minister to have to make: that there are actually 4,500 people in Victoria waiting to get into hospital for orthopaedic surgery. Needless to say, many people would have spent far longer than the average awaiting procedures essential for their quality of life. However, as we all know, some people can jump the queue without difficulty-namely, the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Robert Hawke. Why should he be able to jump queues when other people have to wait on average 3.4 months?</PARA>
<PARA> One searches the Minister's speech in vain for any recognition of the contribution of the private health sector. Indeed, this Labor Government does not seem to care that private insurance in Australia has generally held to the socially responsible principle of community rating, keeping insurance within the practical reach of those who most need it, rather than those who require it least. But it is alarming that the Minister decrees that some groups are receiving `too much medical care' that they are presumably willing to pay for.</PARA>
<PARA> It is an essential difference between the Government and the coalition that we do not believe that governments can arbitrarily declare how much medical care the community or the individual needs. I did not realise that the Minister for Community Services and Health was actually a medical practitioner of all Australians who could decide whether they were receiving too much care. I thought that trained doctors were those best equipped to decide how much care their patients needed. Hospital queues are hardly a memorial to the superiority of a government dominated health system. </PARA>
<PARA> The review of Medicare announced by the Minister will be nothing more than a window dressing exercise if the Government does not recognise that each one per cent drop in private health insurance adds a further $120m to public health spending. </PARA>
<PARA> The review will be positively harmful if it strengthens the tendency to penalise private patients and private hospitals, which may indeed be priced out of the range of many people with private insurance. The lesson has been learned overseas that the elimination of a private hospital system and private hospital insurance, with a supposedly-I emphasise the word `supposedly'-free public system, results in massive costs. Canada is an example, with wealthier people deserting the system for the United States of America. In other Western nations with a government dominated system, private insurance and hospitals become the preserve of the rich alone. Why is it that this Government has not learned from the experience of other government dominated health systems? One can only wonder. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year I raised at some length how Medicare in Western Australia was resulting in savage cutbacks in country public hospitals. At Geraldton, 450 kilometres from Perth, a 24-bed surgical ward was closed. When a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council, the honourable Margaret McAleer, raised this matter urgently with the Prime Minister in April, she received a letter from the Minister for Health stating that spending priorities were decided by State Governments. Six months after this urgent inquiry was made, a letter from Senator McMullan was gratuitously sent to her explaining how Medicare worked. That was not the question. But of course the Government does not care about representations from members of parliament. Senator McMullan, who happens to be in the chamber, could not care less. The Government thought, `We'll go and give Miss McAleer a lecture on Medicare'. She does not need a lecture on Medicare; she is fully aware of its pitfalls. What she sought from the Prime Minister or somebody who was capable of answering her was some information. One could expect that she was entitled to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, a major point of Miss McAleer's letter was a request for tax deductions for private health insurance that would ease pressure and costs on the public system. Clearly, this Government prefers not to consider this matter. It is all too apparent that, despite a change of Minister, this Labor Government will continue to pursue a policy of downgrading the private health sector and containing costs by the rationing of services that impact hardest on elderly Australians without private cover who need hospitalisation that is essential to repair eyesight or provide the mobility without which they cannot remain in their homes or, in many cases, at work. We all know what happens when they cannot remain at work: they then have to give up work. The taxpayer then has to provide some additional payment to them in the form of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The unchanged nature of the Medicare Levy Bill is a symbol of the refusal of this Labor Government to change its approach to health care, despite the evidence here and overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an attempt to get the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990 passed, I will be very brief in my closing of the second reading debate. I thank honourable senators for supporting the legislation. Most of the substantial points in relation to particular amendments concerning issues such as taxation by regulation, which is important but which we do not need to debate twice, can be dealt with better during the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that some of the spokespeople for the Liberal Party of Australia thought we were being too assiduous and putting too much of our effort into pursuing tax avoiders. Honourable senators who spoke on behalf of the Australian Democrats thought that we were not doing enough. This probably means that we are getting it about right. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also some substantial issues relating to the new provisional tax proposals. We will deal with those in the committee stage. The only matters that will not come up during the committee stage are those to do with the fact that it should have been caught up in the pay as you earn (PAYE) system, a matter that Senator Watson raised. I can assure him that it is not for want of assiduous efforts to pursue people trying to defer their PAYE obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Senator Spindler misunderstands the target group for this measure if he thinks that it is another pursuit of ordinary PAYE earners. In the normal course of events, these people will not be picked up by this particular proposal. But we can debate that at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I will make in closing the second reading-we do want to be brief-is to repudiate Senator Spindler's suggestion that in some way the Australian Taxation Office and the Government are pulling back in the proper pursuit of taxes owed to the Government, particularly by big business, as a result of changes to rulings and some pull-back in audits. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some people with conspiracy theories instead of brains have attempted to establish this sort of case. They have put out the occasional story to that effect. Unfortunately, Senator Spindler has fallen for the conspiracy theory rather than the substance. There is not one skerrick of evidence to support the view that this Government has pulled back or will pull back in its pursuit of proper tax rulings or that it will not assiduously pursue the complex audit process to make sure that all Australians in all segments-in response to Senator Spindler's point, those large corporate taxpayers-pay that which they properly should as their share of the tax burden that falls on Australians and that would otherwise fall on other taxpayers were those people not to meet their proper obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that that story gets a run every now and again because what it does is undermine the very fundamental commitment to voluntary compliance that makes a tax system work. For voluntary compliance to work, ordinary Australians need to be persuaded that others are paying their fair share of tax. Cheap shots like that undermine that, and I want to take this opportunity to utterly repudiate that. On the main issues before us I thank honourable senators for their unanimous support of the legislation and urge that the second reading be passed as quickly as possible. </PARA>

However, a few years have passed and we have been able to look at the vast array of tax Bills which come before the House every year and which give us ample opportunity to raise matters relating to taxation and financial matters. Therefore, it is not, in our view, an essential necessity to waste the time of the Senate each year to pass a Bill to impose a tax which is certain to be imposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that Senator Watson is not prepared to accept the distinction between a Bill that imposes the tax and a Bill that declares the rates.

It is certainly not important to waste the time of the Senate every year to impose a tax which we all know will be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other aspect that I have adverted to briefly during the second reading debate, that is, that perhaps Senator Watson is looking forward to the day when he may be on the treasury bench and may wish to get rid of Medicare. We have heard such a lot of criticism here today of this universal health care scheme, which has been held up as a model health scheme the world over, that it raises some fears that the various threats that have been made in past years may one day actually be implemented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the quorum was called I was speaking very briefly in support of the Opposition amendment moved by Senator Watson. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the Parliament is guaranteed its say each year in determining the provisional tax uplift factor. Under the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill as drafted by the Government, the uplift factor will be determined each year, in effect, by regulation, which takes the very important decision as to what that rate will be out of the hands of the normal operations of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a matter of very considerable concern because what the provisional tax uplift factor shall be each year is a very important matter in itself. It is certainly one that affects a great number of people. In the Opposition's very strong view, the Parliament should have the automatic right to determine its view on this matter and to examine the proposals of the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> To have a situation in which that figure will not be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament, we believe, is a very important principle because it is yet another step in the direction that this Government has so assiduously followed over the whole of its term in office of abrogating the rights and responsibilities of this Parliament to examine and determine matters of considerable importance to each and every taxpayer in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Not every taxpayer in Australia pays provisional tax, but a large number do. The penalties now for not getting one's provisional tax figures right and being a certain margin away from the uplift factor determined each year, even if that mistake is made in totally good faith, are very considerable indeed. So the figure struck each year is very important. The way that the Government has it proposed in this Bill does not lock a particular figure in but provides much more scope for having a figure locked in in practice than ought to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Before a vote is taken, I ask that the Australian Democrats have another look at their position on this matter. As Senator Watson so rightly pointed out in his remarks in moving this amendment, the Democrats only two or three years ago supported the principle that we are attempting to enshrine in our amendment. The now leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell, was in favour of it at that time. This is a very important point of principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats claim to be the Party that is here to keep us all honest, yet they are now prepared to support a Bill which takes away from the scrutiny of the Parliament a very important part of the tax law. I hope that before they take a vote they will look again at themselves and at the implications of this amendment so that when the vote is taken they may vote with the Opposition along the lines of principle-very important and democratic principle-that they themselves supported only a couple of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a small amendment; it is a very important amendment in principle and a very important one in practice. I very strongly support the amendment, its having been moved by Senator Watson, and I hope that the Committee will accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the amendment (Senator Watson's) be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to make a few comments on the State and Northern Territory Local Government Grants Commission recommendations for 1990-91 which was presented to the Senate last week. The overall changes in the 1990-91 Budget for financial assistance for distribution by the various States grants commissions is an increase of 3.2 per cent, which is a drop of 2.9 per cent in real terms. I might say that this is calculated using the Government's consumer price index figure of 6.1 per cent. The actual figure to local government is $699,292,000 as against $677,740,000 for the 1989-90 year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In times of economic stringency which this Government has forced on this country by its defective economic strategy, local governments could have expected difficulties in funding. But, as is the case on almost every occasion, this Government has made its Budget cuts, and local government is the victim. To illustrate my point: the Commonwealth general purpose grants to the States in the 1990-91 Budget were cut by 2.4 per cent in real terms, whereas I have already noted that local government received cuts in its funding of 2.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth's own spending increased over the same period by 11.9 per cent with a real increase of 5.4 per cent. I was also curious to note in a recent local government publication from the Department of Local Government, that when it was referring to micro-economic reform-and I often wonder what this Government means by micro-economic reform, but I guess we will find out a bit more tomorrow from Senator Collins on that-what it meant within local government was to cut revenue to local government which the Federal Government said was its way of achieving micro-economic reform because of forced efficiencies. I suppose if one cuts the revenue to anyone in society, he is going to have to cut his purchases of food, goods or services, and so this apparently is another definition of micro-economic reform by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that these cuts came on top of secret special deals, which I might say were sprung by the Opposition, of payments amounting to some $72m to three Australian Labor Party States from an Advance to the Minister for Finance the day after the Premiers Conference of 29 June 1990, and just before the end of the financial year when the States in fact had been told in no uncertain terms that their funding had been severely cut and that local government funds would be similarly cut. </PARA>
<PARA> The payments to the three States were: South Australia, a capital grant of $12m for water treatment projects; Tasmania, a capital grant of $40m for public sector restructuring; and Western Australia, a capital grant of $20m for public transport improvement. It just bears witness to the fact that local government is having to bear the brunt most unfairly for this Government's inability to manage the economy. On top of that, in my own State of Queensland there has been something of a revolt over the State Government's system of allocating Federal grants. Many cities and towns in the State are considering joining together to object to what they consider are unfair cuts in their funding. The Mayor of Townsville--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Macdonald" NAMEID="YW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator Macdonald</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note Senator Macdonald is here and that, of course, is the area with which he is most familiar. The Mayor of Townsville-Townsville has a Labor local government and a Labor mayor-Alderman Tony Mooney, has invited councils in Brisbane, Burdekin, Cairns, the Gold Coast, Ipswich, Logan, Mackay, Pine Rivers, Redcliffe, Redlands and Toowoomba to be part of a joint protest against the State grants allocation system. The Brisbane City Council, which has been one of the worst hit with a cut of 6.1 per cent, has already given the Townsville mayor its full support and urged other councils to join in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Sallyanne Atkinson, has also written to the Federal Minister for Local Government, Minister Fatin, to point out the funding anomaly and to ask that Brisbane be removed from current Grants Commission arrangements. I believe Alderman Sallyanne Atkinson makes a strong point when she argues that Tasmania with a population of 451,000 will receive this year a grant of $19m, whereas Brisbane with a population in excess of 745,000 will receive in the order of $15.7m. The grant paid for Brisbane for 1989-90 was approximately $16.7m. </PARA>
<PARA> Alderman Sallyanne Atkinson also points out that if the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were included within the New South Wales grant allocation, there would be screams of protest within the Australian Capital Territory. It appears that the State Labor Government's new methodology under Premier Goss, which it recently introduced, selectively disadvantages its own capital city of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> One final point I want to make about the State and Northern Territory Local Government Grants Commission recommendations for 1990-91 which have been presented to the Senate is that those recommendations were received by the Minister for Local Government on 14 August 1990, some months ago. There have been three sitting weeks since that date and the question one almost must ask is: What has been the cause of the delay? It seems it is just another example of this Government's total inability to organise business in the Parliament or in the economy itself-what I would call just another bulge factor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to address the Senate briefly on the rural industry crisis and highlight some aspects of it that are not particularly well known. Just before I do that, I want to add to what Senator Parer has just said on the grants given by the Grants Commission to local authorities in Queensland and the new methodology that has been adopted in the last couple of years on how the money that the Commonwealth gives to the Queensland State is divided up amongst local authorities in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a lot of concern about the way the methodology has changed in the last two years. In this last year some of the major provincial cities have been quite badly affected by the methodology and, as Senator Parer mentioned, those cities are getting together and they include such diverse or widely-spread cities as Townsville and Brisbane. The shire that I had the privilege to represent for many years has been rather adversely affected in the last two years because of this changed methodology. It is almost like a double dipping by the State Grants Commission in allocating assumed expenditure and assumed income to particular councils when they get down to work out what each particular local authority should receive. We in the Burdekin Shire and many other rural authorities have equally been disadvantaged because the methodology used or the formula used includes an assumed gross value of rural production and it also includes a component where the personal income of farming families is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> One really includes the other, but the methodology adopted by the Queensland Grants Commission includes both those components as separate identities. In the case of my shire, it has meant that we were assumed or deemed to have had a greater income than we could possibly get because the figures were added in twice. There is an ongoing concern and it is a situation that the Commonwealth Government should keep an eye on because although the Commonwealth Government is not directly involved in the way the grants are divided up within the State, it does supply the money and it should carefully monitor the way it is divided up in the State. </PARA>
<PARA> As the rural crisis in Australia deepens, the Liberal Party has brought to the attention of this Senate many of the real problems facing primary producers. They are problems which, to a very great degree, have been exacerbated by the Government's high interest rate policy which has in turn caused enormous fluctuations in the exchange rate. I am pleased to say that the exchange rate in the last couple of days has fallen to an extent where primary producers are now starting to breathe again in the hope that they may get better. </PARA>
<PARA> If we add to the Government's high interest rate policies the loss of export markets due to the Middle East crisis and serious overproduction problems in many commodities, including wool, we have a real crisis in rural industries. The wool industry and the wheat industry are two industries which have come to the attention of the Parliament and the Senate a number of times in the last few weeks. I wish to refer briefly to the rice industry which is also suffering, particularly because of high interest rates, difficulties with the value of the Australian dollar and also the Middle East crisis which has severely affected the exports of the rice industry in Australia because both Iraq and Kuwait were very large buyers of the Australian rice crop. </PARA>
<PARA> The rice industry in Australia has several different geographical components, the major ones of which are in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area down this way and in the Burdekin area of Queensland. I believe there is rice grown in other parts of Australia as well. The rice in Queensland was an industry which commenced within my time. I can clearly remember the rice industry starting in the Burdekin. It was established at a time when there was a recession in other rural industries. The people of this part of rural Australia got together as a community to look around for alternative crops which could be used to bolster the main crop when it was suffering bad times. </PARA>
<PARA> From that very early start, that very humble start, the rice industry has become quite a major component of life in the Burdekin district, with a major milling operation there which mills rice not only from the Burdekin region but also from the Mareeba area west of Cairns. Burdekin rice is renowned worldwide because it is a very superior quality long grain rice. The decentralisation which has occurred in Australia because of this new industry has meant a lot to rural parts of Australia and it has also earned very efficiently considerable export dollars over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The very energetic board of the rice mill in the Burdekin, the Queensland Rice Board, has put a lot of work into creating exports for rice products overseas, particularly into Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Pacific Islands. It has become very difficult for Australia's rice exporters to market into these areas because of the value of the Australian dollar and because they are competing with crops grown overseas in areas which do not follow the same rigid and honest farming practices and trade and tariff practices that the Australian industry does. </PARA>
<PARA> There is difficulty in marketing into these places. Fortunately, in Queensland, exports into New Guinea are relatively cost effective because of the proximity of the market to the area of production. Rice from the Burdekin mill is exported out of the port of Townsville. It creates good business for that port and is taken straight into New Guinea, and very effectively provides for a market there. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst every effort is made to market overseas in competition with cheaper foreign products, it does become rather difficult with other products coming into Australia. Australia is the only country in the world that I am aware of that does not have any restrictions on rice imports. So whilst we are restricted from exporting our rice to many other countries-I mention, for example, that if we want to sell rice in the European Economic Community in competition with rice grown in, say, Spain and Italy, we would be selling it at about $US500 per metric tonne, which is the going price, but in addition we would have to pay another $250 per metric tonne as some sort of levy to the Economic Community to be able to sell the rice to that area-we seem to allow anyone to sell rice here. Free trade is all well and good. It is a great principle to aim for, but we have to compete with other countries that play by the same rules. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other problems that the rice industry has is that of quarantine restrictions being lifted on overseas rice coming in. Until the present time, the quarantine limit has been one paddy grain of rice per kilogram of white rice. With a limit of only one paddy grain, most overseas exporting countries, such as India and Thailand, could meet that standard, but the Vietnamese rice industry could not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has instituted an inquiry through the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to see whether that quarantine limit should not be raised to five or 35 grains of paddy rice per kilogram. The Australian rice industry opposes any change to the current level of one paddy grain per kilogram. It is a level which does, according to the Australian rice industry-and I accept this-protect the Australian industry against the importation of diseases that can come in from rice originating in Thailand, India and Vietnam. But the proposal to allow that to be five paddy grains per kilogram, or even 35 grains per kilogram, which is the tolerance for seed rice, is one that would put the Australian rice industry substantially at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion paper put out by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service indicates that quarantine decisions must be based on sound technical grounds and that there should be no suggestion that tolerances for paddy milled rice should constitute a form of non-tariff trade barrier. But there is a real concern that if this tolerance of one paddy grain per kilogram is increased, it could put the whole Australian rice industry at some risk of serious disease infliction. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the Quarantine Service investigation is that there is some suggestion that it may not be looking at things evenly within Australia. There is an acceptance, and I understand some regulation, that does not allow any foreign rice, or any rice grown in other Australian areas, that has any paddy grains in it to go into the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA). I understand that the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service accepts this or, if it does not, certainly the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and Fisheries does. So it keeps the MIA rice areas free from any rice which might contain paddy grains. If the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service accepts that no rice with paddy grains in it should be allowed into the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area for fear of spreading disease, that same view should also be held by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service when it considers what tolerance of paddy rice it should allow into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been very honest and open in ensuring that its quarantine decisions are made for quarantine purposes and not for non-tariff protection. But the Government must be vigilant to ensure that everybody else with whom we compete continues in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly make reference to the peanut industry in Kingaroy-another industry that is not often talked about which is experiencing some real difficulties at this time in Australia's history. At the present time, the peanut industry in Kingaroy is suffering as a result of a couple of years of very severe droughts followed by a couple of years of very intensive rain at the wrong time which has just about wiped out the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, a lot of peanuts are being imported from overseas sources. Twenty-five per cent of all peanuts now sold in Australia are grown in China. The peanuts that come in from China have a chemical residue content that would not be allowed if Australian peanuts were being exported overseas. Pesticide tests on Chinese peanuts have revealed benzine hexachloride levels which are 10 times higher than the residues in Australian grown peanuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I make reference to the Queensland Government, which has recognised the plight of peanut growers in the Kingaroy area, has seen that the industry is on its knees and has come to the aid of those growers. It is offering low interest rate loans-and I understand this was only announced today-to enable those peanut growers who are thought to be or can prove that they are viable and have a long term place in the industry to get back on their feet after these disastrous years and get their industry going again. </PARA>
<PARA> I do ask that the Government, when dealing with matters of quarantine and export and trade matters, bears in mind that since we do not allow any tariffs, the very honest and strict rules that we apply in Australia should apply to all countries around the world who compete with us in the trade of foodstuffs. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted and always borne in mind that Australia imports $150m worth of foodstuffs each month. That is $2 billion worth of foodstuffs per year, which is almost 10 per cent of our trading deficit. That is for food that we produce ourselves in Australia. So there is an enormous quantity of food coming into Australia from overseas sources, competing with industries which we ourselves have established over the years in this country. Those things must always be kept in mind and be very carefully considered when decisions are being made on trade and quarantine matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak tonight to one of the recommendations in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, entitled Drugs in Sport, presented to the Senate in May of this year and to which the Government has not yet responded. I am not suggesting that the Government is out of time in not doing so, but I believe one particular recommendation needs to be responded to quickly. Some of the matters that I will raise have to be dealt with, unfortunately, at some length, but I think it has to be done. The matter I raise relates to the sport of powerlifting. It is a sport which has existed in Australia since 1970. Many practitioners of that sport really make no bones about the fact that the sport went downhill as a result of the increasing use of drugs in the sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1985 a group of powerlifters from the then governing body, the Australian Amateur Power Lifting Federation (AAPLF), broke away and formed an alternative group called the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation (ADFPF). This organisation has operated since 1985 without any government support whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, chaired by the former Senator Black, commenced its investigation into drugs in sport, some members of the AAPLF who had been concerned about the infiltration of drugs into their sport decided to stay within that organisation and make an attempt to clean it up from within. They ultimately decided that it was a waste of time, and some with whom I have spoken told me that they got nowhere in this regard because some of the people who were managing the sport were in fact involved in the distribution of performance-enhancing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of members of the AAPLF gave evidence to the Senate Committee about the operation of drugs in their sport. Having failed to clean up the sport from within, they also took the decision to leave the AAPLF and join the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation. In fact, a significant number of powerlifters, disenchanted with the failure of the AAPLF to reform itself, joined the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, some of the office-bearers of the AAPLF gave evidence to the Senate inquiry, and I shall shortly refer to the inquiry's conclusions about the two rival bodies. But at this stage I would point out that during the drugs in sport inquiry, the AAPLF disbanded and a new organisation was formed called the Australian Powerlifting Federation, merely dropping the word `Amateur'. Significantly, it comprised officebearers of the old AAPLF. </PARA>
<PARA> One result of the Senate inquiry was that a number of State affiliates of the old AAPLF disaffiliated, including the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. Many members of the organisation were lost to the drug free power lifters. I am informed that the Australian Powerlifting Federation now has fewer than 100 active members, although it claims to have significantly more. The Drug Free Powerlifting Federation has about 1,200 active members either as competitors or as officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Some conclusions were drawn by the Senate Committee about the respective organisations which I think it is useful to refer to at this stage. Perhaps you can read it later, Mr President, but I seek leave to incorporate at this point in my speech the conclusion of the Senate Committee at paragraph 8.145 set out on pages 272 and 273 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>8.145</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has closely examined the activities of the AAPLF (and its subsequent forms) and the Drug Free Powerlifting Association. And the record of AAPLF in drug testing is unacceptable in the Committee's view for an organisation receiving public funds. The major grounds for the judgment are:</PARA>
<PARA>* Officials of the AAPLF have not presented an unambiguous opposition to drug use until quite recently. </PARA>
<PARA>* Some AAPLF officials do not seem to understand the proprieties to be observed for drug testing in sport. Mr Robert Orr, for example, is a competing powerlifter, but as an official Mr Orr submitted an application to be an IPF approved drug control officer. The Chief Executive of ASDA has advised:</PARA>
<PARA>This does not meet with the approval of ASDA and could only be seen as a clear conflict of interest. (Letter to Committee Secretary, 12 January 1990)</PARA>
<PARA>* Drug testing under the AAPLF has not always been credible. The Committee has indicated its conviction that drug testing for the 1988 National Championships was expected to be `fixed'. In the event, the `fix' did not eventuate and six powerlifters including the official who sent out the notice that drug testing would be conducted, were found positive. </PARA>
<PARA>* The Committee is not convinced that the AAPLF has demonstrated its bona fides in reacting to positive drug tests. Gael Martin, for example, was permitted to compete after testing positive at the 1988 Women's World Championships. Mr Glenn Jones told the Committee that Mrs Martin's test result was kept a secret and she was not actually banned for some six months. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will read out, though, recommendation 20 which follows immediately after that paragraph:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation Inc. (ADFPF) be recognised as the national sporting organisation for official recognition and public funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to that, that body, the drug free powerlifters, applied to the Australian Sports Commission for funding as the nationally recognised organisation. It also sought to obtain access to facilities for its members. I am advised by that body that the Sports Commission did not acknowledge or reply to its application, and for four months it heard nothing. The Drug Free Powerlifting Federation began to form a view that the Sports Commission would not be funding the powerlifting at all. Having survived since 1985 without any government funding and though disappointed, it believed that it could live without a grant, but certainly wished to obtain access to Australian Institute of Sport facilities and coaching for its athletes. In order to pursue this access, the Federation provided to the Sports Commission its financial statements, auditors' reports and a five-year plan. </PARA>
<PARA> In July of this year the APLF was interviewed by two officials from the Australian Sports Commission. Those who were interviewed, I am told, felt from the outset that there was an attitude of hostility towards them. They may, of course, have been wrong. They had, though, detected a similar attitude in a telephone conversation between the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation and an ASC official in which, I understand, the official expressed the view that it was for it to run sport and that it was not to be run by a Federal parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> During the interview I am told that there was a fairly frank discussion about the future of powerlifting. The ASC officials apparently indicated that they were aware that the ailing Amateur Powerlifting Federation had no affiliation with New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), had effectively folded in Tasmania and the Northern Territory and only had any real membership left in Victoria. I am also advised that the ASC officials said that the APLF had submitted no documentation, had no five-year plan and had only recently been incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> The tone of the conversation led the Drug Free officials to believe that funding was unlikely to be forthcoming, but the Federation's representatives repeated their wish to have access to the facilities which would be of benefit to their athletes. They were told that a decision was likely to be made by the end of September, but they heard nothing more. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that on 28 September there was a telephone hook-up between the Sports Commission and the Australian Powerlifting Federation and that the board approved the recommendation of its officials that the APLF receive funding and be recognised as the national sporting organisation representing powerlifting-that, of course, not being the group that was recommended by the Senate committee. Apparently, the APLF had by then put together a five-year plan and otherwise satisfied the Commission that it should represent powerlifting. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanation offered to the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation for these decisions was as follows: that the APLF has international affiliations with the International Powerlifting Federation which is related to the body which organises the World Games, and the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation's international affiliate does not have that relationship. I am told that the international affiliate of the Australian Powerlifting Federation is connected with the body which organises the World Games but that powerlifting as a sport has never appeared in the World Games. This affiliation, I suggest, is of doubtful value or significance. </PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested that the APLF has more members than the Drug Free powerlifters. On this point it is said that the APLF claims to have 2,000 members, but everyone would know that it is not a large sport. The claim of the APLF is rendered somewhat dubious when one examines the history of its predecessor, the AAPLF to which I referred earlier and which was exposed to the Senate inquiry as having indulged in numbers rigging. Admissions were made to the Commission to the effect that the organisation tried to get:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a large percentage of people down so that we can show numbers to help with our government grants. I do not deny that at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have the exact figures but I think that it would be appropriate to say that the figures are greatly inflated because of the school children's participation. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I could explain the school children's participation. This evidence of the witness refers to a schools bench press competition which has been used to boost numbers. A young boy or girl is given one lift of a bar in return for the organisation using his or her name and address as a non-paying junior member. I understand that in fact the APLF has only about 100 active members, mostly in Victoria. I am informed that at a recent competition where four events were held on the same occasion to maximise participation, it was still able to muster only nine competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> A third matter that was advanced as a reason for the funding going to the APLF was that the APLF has affiliates in every state and the Drug Free powerlifters do not. As to this matter of affiliates, the APLF is centred in Victoria with a small membership in Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The old New South Wales affiliate withdrew its affiliation during the Senate inquiry and never reaffiliated. The ACT affiliate also withdrew and its members have joined the drug free powerlifters individually. The Northern Territory affiliate of the APLF is basically defunct. The Drug Free Powerlifting Federation has affiliates in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania and is in the process of incorporating in the Northern Territory. Negotiations are also taking place with drug free lifters in Western Australia in an attempt to establish the sport there as well. It has a membership of 1,200, with a genuine 800 training, lifting and officiating members. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these considerations, it is difficult to see how the Commission has concluded that the APLF is entitled to be recognised as the official body representing powerlifting and be entitled to $20,000 of taxpayers' money. I believe that we should have an explanation. It would appear that the Commission may have ignored much of the Senate Committee's findings in coming to its conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has ignored the fact that the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation's record in drug testing is second to none. It has utilised the services of the Australian sport drug administration since well before it became known.  It has also privately funded tests which the administration has conducted on behalf of the Federation. This has been an onerous financial burden, but has been considered by the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation to be vital to the purpose of the Federation and to the value of its reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federation has had six positive tests in its entire history, the last five in the last 12 months all registered by former members of the old AAPLF who were accepted by the drug free powerlifters in accordance with the requirements of the Senate inquiry that it open up its membership to persons from those associations. That is referred to in the report. One person who tested positive received a lifetime ban for the use of and trafficking in anabolic steroids and the others, who were using prohibited substances, received three-year bans. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent 1990 Australian Open Championships saw the drug agency conduct 23 drug tests, with no refusals, and all were clean. Contrast this with the APLF, the now national representative organisation, whose 1990 national titles were somewhat disrupted when one State team which arrived to discover that random tests would be conducted decided to withdraw its participation, and when there were a number of other refusals and four positive tests. I am at a loss to understand the basis for the Sports Commission decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation says that it has detected an element of resentment in its dealings with the Commission. It is my view-and I put it to the Senate-that we should be given an explanation as to what has gone on and how it is that the money has been given in the fashion in which it has. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the fact that two months ago an official of the drug free powerlifters was informed by a person involved with the Australian blind sports competition, which includes powerlifting, that the blind sports organisers had been told by the Australian Sports Commission that they should not use the Drug Free Federation to officiate at the blind sports. </PARA>
<PARA> We are entitled to know why the Commission appears to be proceeding in a manner so different from the recommendations of the Senate Committee. If there is good reason to do so, I believe that the Government ought to respond to that report to the Senate before any decision is made to support one or the other outside the one that is recommended and give money for that purpose. I fail to see why the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation has been denied government support, having applied recently as a result of the Senate Committee's findings. As I said, the Government has not responded to the findings of the Senate Committee and I am really surprised that funding has been determined without that having been done. Why one and not the other? I think we are entitled to know and I believe that if funding has not yet been paid over it should not be, at least until we have been given a full account of what has gone on. </PARA>

<PARA> The problem as I see it is really centred around the fact that the Government, knowing of the existence of very strong recommendations in the bipartisan report, Drugs in Sport, of the Black inquiry, had the arrogance to pretend that those recommendations did not exist when it made this announcement, with no justification and no explanation for ignoring that report. I might remind you, Mr President, that the chairman of the Committee was a Labor senator in this place. I might tell the Government that I have spoken to ex-Senator Black on this matter and naturally he was interested-I suppose that would be the polite word-to note that his strong recommendation was totally ignored by the Government.

I am glad that is on the record from the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple fact is that after I had complained about this behaviour and the decision, I was contacted-and I try to maintain these informal contacts with Government bodies-by the Australian Institute of Sport, quite properly, and we had a discussion about this matter. As a result of that discussion I understand that the Minister has referred the matter-this is how serious it is; I know Senator Reid will be interested to know this-back to the Australian Sports Commission. As a result of the media coverage-of which the alert, intelligent honourable senators opposite apparently are totally unaware when they interject-the matter has been referred back to the Australian Sports Commission, which is, of course, looking at it again. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the merits of this matter, on the face of it there is a clear burden of evidence indicating that the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation should have received the grant. Despite all the other suggestions that, because it is not `national' and not affiliated with an international body-which to my knowledge has little standing anyway-it should not get the grant, I believe there is a clear weight of evidence that if the grant were to go to anyone, it should have gone to the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> My simple view on this matter is: why not test both these bodies in a very simple way- it is not a drug test, it is a finance test-see how they behave, and reward good behaviour? I think that is a far more sensible approach. I would be inclined to take the view that perhaps the funding could be deferred for a while. On the face of it at the moment the Drug Free Powerlifting Federation has a far superior record, and I would expect that record to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue remains that it is arrogant and defensive for any government totally to ignore the strong findings of a Senate committee without explanation and without feeling that it has any sort of obligation to this chamber to explain why it should act in such an arrogant way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in Question Time Senator Richardson gave an answer to a question asked by Senator Bjelke-Petersen with respect to family allowance and the possibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) reviewing the assets test that the Government foreshadowed during the Budget in response to, amongst other things, the strong protests made by the National Farmers Federation, by the people on this side of the chamber and also by many ordinary Australians at rural crisis meetings throughout Australia over the last month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take a few minutes to go over those assets tests and the importance of the Government changing its mind on those matters. I have said all along that if the Government does something right I want to be the first one to give it a bouquet. I have not exactly rushed down to Interflora, but I am hopeful that the assets test that the Government wants to introduce for family allowance will be a net asset level of $300,000, for the isolated children's allowance a net asset level of $200,000, and for Austudy a net asset level of $200,000, which is reduced by $200,000 from the current level of $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with these reductions is that many students who come from provincial Australia, many students whose parents are involved in primary industry who have properties and so on, will be severely disadvantaged. In particular, I single out those students who are currently receiving tertiary education, are reliant on Austudy, and who may, as a result of any change in the assets test, be forced to leave their tertiary education halfway through their course. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully Senator Collins would be as disturbed as I am at the prospect of these young Australians undergoing a university education losing their places and perhaps losing two years or more of invested study because the Government has reduced the assets test. That is why I am sure Senator Collins will be one of those people on that side of the chamber who will hopefully be pulling very hard at the coat-tails of the Prime Minister and saying, `Please review this decision because we don't believe it is in the best interests of the people in rural Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is very important because although the distance education schools do a very good job, they can only go so far. I have travelled around Queensland and visited distance education centres in Queensland. They try very hard, but one gets to a point-past about Grade 6 or Grade 7-where it is difficult to provide the intensive specialised education that is now demanded of those leaving high schools through the mechanism of the distance education centres and it is necessary to send those children away. In country areas that is not considered some sort of privilege, it is just a necessity. Local high schools do not exist in many areas, and where they do exist they do not offer a wide range of choices when it comes to subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make it very clear: the assets tests levels that are proposed are so low that anybody with a farm would have to have at least that level of net assets or the farm would not be viable. Therefore, if the Government goes ahead with changing these assets tests, the consequence will be that those people will lose any chance of getting the family allowance, the isolated children's allowance or Austudy. I think that would be a very severe blow to those people because they are battling as it is. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen said today, in spite of the fact that they may have $200,000 or $300,000 in net assets, they do not necessarily have an income. Many of them will have negative incomes; they will be digging into their savings just to get by over this year and next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned for those young people right across rural Australia. I would like to take the opportunity to add my voice to the many thousands of voices across Australia and, on behalf of all the young people of rural Australia, I beg the Government to change its mind on this matter and not implement the lower assets tests. If it does that I promise Senator Collins that I will rush down to Interflora and buy him a bouquet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 21 May 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to a review (tabled) by a consultant to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Dr Ian Nisbet, of the National Health and Medical Research Council's (NH&amp;RC) Committee on Toxicity's assessments of the toxicity of the organochlorine pesticides aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor and chlordane between 1985 and 1988-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Is Dr Nisbet's statement that the NH&amp;RC incorrectly assessed the composition of heptachlor and chlordane correct; if so, does the Minister accept that the NH&amp;RC's incorrect assessment of the chemical's composition led the NH&amp;RC to underestimate their toxicity; if not why not. (Please provide references.)</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is Dr Nisbet correct in stating that, in its assessment of the literature on chlordane and heptachlor, the NH&amp;RC neglected to cite, and/or refer, and/or accept the following scientific and peer-reviewed papers: (a) Epstein 1976, and (b) Reuber 1987, on each of the occasions recorded by Dr Nisbet on page 3 of his submission; if so, for each paper, will the Minister explain why the NH&amp;RC decided to ignore or reject these papers on each of the occasions recorded by Dr Nisbet.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is Dr Nisbet correct in stating that, in its assessment of the literature on chlordane and heptachlor, the NH&amp;RC failed to cite and discuss the following studies: (a) Cabral et al (quoted in Epstein 1976); a study of heptachlor in infant rats which, according to Epstein, is positive for endocrine and renal tumours; (b) Becker and Sell (Cancer Res 39:3491, 1979); reported that technical chlordane was carcinogenic in C57Bl mice; (this study is important because it was in a strain with low spontaneous incidence of liver tumours); (c) Williams and Numoto (Carcinogenesis 5:1689: Toxicol Pathol 13:325, 1985); reported that technical chlordane and technical heptachlor were tumour promoters in a two-stage bioassay in B6C3F1 mice; (d) Cerey et al (Mut Res 21:26, 1973); reports dominant lethal effects and chromosome abnormalities in rats dosed with heptachlor; (e) Welch et al (Toxicol Appl. Pharmacol. 19:234, 1971); report effects on hormone metabolism; (f) Shain et al (Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 40:115, 1977); report effects on hormone metabolism; (g) Seifert (Bull. Env. Path. Toxicol. 42:707, 1989); report teratogenic effects of technical heptachlor and technical chlordane in chickens; (h) Spyker-Cranmer et al (J. Env. Path. Toxicol. 2:357, 1978); reported postnatal mortality following exposure of female mice to technical chlordane at 8 mg/kd-d; (i) Cranmer et al (Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 68:204, 1984); and (j) Spyker-Cranmer et al (62:402, 1982); and Spyker-Cranmer et al and Cranmer in 1977 report to USEPA; reported postnatal effects on behaviour, ecnocrine function, immune function and corticosteroid levels following exposure of female mice to technical chlordane at 0.16 mg/kd-d; and (k) Barnett et al (Toxicol. Letters 25:173 and 22, 1985); reported other immunoteratological effects of technical chlordane in mice; if so, for each one of the studies, will the Minister explain why the NH&amp;RC failed to cite and discuss them.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is Dr Nisbet correct in claiming that, in its assessment of the literature on chlordane and heptachlor, the NH&amp;RC accepted at face value, without critical review, the reported conclusions of most studies on reproductive developmental toxicity, even when the reported conclusions are inconsistent with the data.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is Dr Nisbet correct when he states that the NH&amp;RC either failed to conduct or inadequately conducted statistical analyses on any of the reproductive/developmental toxicity studies cited on page 5 of Dr Nisbet's report.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Will the Minister confirm that up to 1 per cent of the known human mutagen and carcinogen propylene oxide is incorporated into both technical chlordane and technical heptachlor; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is Dr Nisbet correct in claiming that the NH&amp;RC failed to mention that up to 1 per cent of the known human mutagen and carcinogen propylene oxide is incorporated into both technical chlordane and technical heptachlor.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Is Dr Nisbet correct in claiming that NH&amp;RC failed to consider: (a) that most measured indoor human exposure to the cyclodienes underestimates total exposure as it fails to measure the more volatile components of the compounds; (b) that many of the toxicity animal studies have been conducted on single components of the chemicals; and (c) that studies conducted by administering technical chlordane to animal-feed are biased towards effects of the less volatile components, because the more volatile components volatise from the feed during preparation; if not, why not. (Please provide references.)</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Is Dr Nisbet correct in claiming that, in its assessment of the literature on chlordane and heptachlor, on all but one occasion the NH&amp;RC failed to consider that: (a) reported indoor measurements usually underestimate total exposure; and (b) that available studies reflect only part of the toxicity of the mixtures because they refer only to their less volatile components; if not, why not.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) -</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The papers upon which the relevant NH&amp;RC committees have based their recommendations on chlordane and heptachlor have been released to interested parties under the Freedom of Information Act and I have arranged for copies of them to be passed to Senator Vallentine.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there is a difference of view between Dr Nisbet and the NH&amp;RC committees in relation to interpretation of a number of scientific studies. The position taken by the NH&amp;RC committees is supported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A different view has apparently been taken by the US authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The substance of these differences is discussed in the report of the Australian Science and Technology Council `Health, Politics, Trade: Controlling Chemical Residues in Agricultural Products' pages 61-65, which I commend to the honourable Senator.</PARA>
<PARA> The NH&amp;RC has commissioned a further review of the cyclodiene pesticides which include chlordane and heptachlor. The Working Party undertaking the review is to report to the Council in November 1990 and a report is expected to be subsequently released for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be borne in mind that severe restrictions have been recommended on the use of chlordane and heptachlor in Australia, including a prohibition on the use of these pesticides in the indoor living areas of domestic dwellings and habitable buildings and in outdoor living areas, as well as in home gardens where food is produced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This matter is subject to private negotiations and possibly litigation and any enquiry should be directed to Mr Tokic or his legal representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The gun laws applying to diplomatic missions and consular posts in Australia are those that apply to Australian citizens. The Customs Act covers the importation of weapons into Australia and the Australian Customs Service polices that. The laws of the State or Territory where the mission or post is situated cover the possession and licensing of weapons, and State and Territory police forces and the Australian Federal Police are responsible for policing those laws. As I announced on 2 July, the Government has placed tight additional restrictions on the possession, carriage and use of firearms in the diplomatic and consular community. This has been done under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. In consulation with the Australian Federal Police, my Department will approve the very few weapons that are to be permitted, under rigid control. State and Federal Police will report any significant abuse of those restrictions. I will deal with any such report on the basis of the Government's instruction that consideration is to be given to taking the most serious steps available to us under international law.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The individual concerned was expelled from Australia along with other members of the Consulate-General and the Australian Government has no further information on him.</PARA>
