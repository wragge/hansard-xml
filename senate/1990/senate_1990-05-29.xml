<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate. The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would *reduce biodiversity, *compromise animal welfare, *concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and *allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the patent system is to encourage entrepreneurs to develop and commercialise new technology. Since a patent confers a limited monopoly over the use of the patented technology, the patent owner has the opportunity to make a profit from it, gaining a return on investment in innovation. The international character of the patent system makes patents a useful tool in penetrating export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background that the Patents Bill was formulated. The present Bill is in fact a reincarnation of the Patents Bill 1989. That Bill was introduced on 1 June 1989 by the Hon. Barry Jones as Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. However, it had not been debated when Parliament was prorogued prior to the March 1990 election. The Patents Bill 1990 derives from the 1989 Bill, but also takes into account a number of submissions made by members of the public about that Bill. Those included submissions by expert groups in the patents field: the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, the Australian Manufacturers' Patents, Industrial Designs, Copyright and Trade Mark Association, and the Law Council of Australia's Intellectual Property Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of participation by users of the patent system in formulating the Bill is heartening. I intend that it continue, where appropriate, in further legislative developments in the industrial property field. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic effects of patent systems have been the subject of debate for at least a few centuries. The main arguments were outlined by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC) in its report ``Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia'', which forms the major basis for the policy changes which the Bill represents. Economists have not agreed, however, and IPAC, chaired by John Stonier of BHP Co Ltd, produced a report which was constructive rather than revolutionary. IPAC sought to improve the operation of the system so as to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant changes made by the Bill focus on fostering indigenous innovation and the use of the international patent system in developing export markets to improve Australia's international competitive position. For example, the standard of patentability for standard patents is strengthened by testing inventions for novelty and inventive step against disclosures in recorded form anywhere in the world rather than, as at present, just in Australia. Novelty and inventive step for petty patents, on the other hand, will be tested only against prior disclosures in Australia, consistently with the fact that petty patents are better suited to less significant inventions with a shorter commercial life and less likelihood of achieving market success abroad. Other changes are aimed at improving the efficiency of the administration of the patent system, ranging from examination procedures to enforcement of patents in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill uses greatly simplified language and structure in comparison with the present Patents Act, so that it will be more comprehensible to people who are not patent experts. The Bill and IPAC's recommendations have already been dealt with in the Second Reading Speech on the 1989 Bill. There would be no point in my repeating that-it is in Hansard, and I agree with what was said then. I do wish to make two short general observations, however. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the patent system of Australia, or any other country, cannot operate usefully in international isolation. The reason for that is not theoretical; the reason is that international trade affects national economies. We in Australia have said and heard a great deal in recent years about our international trading position and its implications for the Australian economy. Patents and other forms of intellectual property have a role to play in international trade because they can assist in the establishment and development of export markets. A patent in Australia gives no protection against appropriation of the patented technology in other countries. But patents obtained by Australian enterprises in other countries can make a tremendous difference when it comes to developing an export market. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a two-edged sword here, since availability of patents in other countries to Australians is matched by the availability of patents in Australia to the nationals of other countries. A patent owned by a foreigner restricts imitation of the patented invention in Australia-a fact which has been anathema to some economists. But an Australian patent can also be an essential feature in negotiating an agreement for the licensing by an Australian company of foreign-owned technology. And the Bill, like the present Patents Act, contains provisions expressly designed to prevent abuse of patent monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, like IPAC, supports the patent system, but believes that it can be modified to enable Australians to make better use of it internationally as well as nationally. One of the main features of the Bill is to move towards greater international compatibility of the standards of novelty and inventiveness which are applied in deciding whether a patent should be granted for an invention in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to emphasise is that a patent only gives an opportunity for profit-not a guarantee. A patent is no substitute for entrepreneurship in the broader sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere fact that a product is patented will not persuade people to buy it. Intellectual property is not some form of commercial magic which can cause a profitable market to appear and grow overnight. Marketing skills are just as necessary for success with a patented product as with any other; the difference is that the availability of a patent for a successful product can justify investment in research and development. Having got a patent, however, the entrepreneur must make the best use of it in developing a market. Intellectual property must be managed properly to ensure that it achieves the objectives of both the owner and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Patents thus have a subsidiary, albeit important, role in entrepreneurship. The patent system itself is, in IPAC's words, ``a blunt instrument of industrial policy''. There are other more direct ways in which innovation can be stimulated. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill increases the usefulness of the patent system as one of the measures which Australian entrepreneurs can draw upon. It is a constructive example of the Government's commitment to improving the climate in which Australian industry operates, but it is no substitute for entrepreneurship by Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before commencing this debate, I would like to refer to the lack of courtesy on the Government's part by its failure to meet a request about the timing of the presentation of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990. It was my understanding, because of a commitment I had to a congress in town, that this legislation would not be brought in on this occasion. I had to shorten my stay there. I asked for leave of the Senate, which was granted but, because of a misunderstanding or lack of courtesy, I was required to return to the Senate this morning. Obviously there is a lack of communication on the Government's side which has certainly proved embarrassing to the Opposition. I regret what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate has before it the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990 for scrutiny and debate. This Bill is essentially the same Bill that was introduced into the chamber, but was not formally considered last year, as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1989. The intervention of the general election necessitated a new Bill for consideration by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Bill contains an omnibus series of amendments covering many of the proposals originally proposed in the 1989-90 Budget. The issues raised include anti-avoidance measures with regard to the transfer of assets, net capital losses within company groups, exemptions to capital gains tax on a taxpayer's principal residence, rules concerning the concessional treatment of research and development, and other matters such as income tax treatment of a carer's service pension, interest payments on overpaid tax and tax file arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to raise some practical problems associated with the amendments to the capital gains area. The legislation proposed within this Bill with regard to the transfer of net capital loss within the company group and the transfer of assets between companies within the same group are complex, cumbersome and produce unintended consequences that are beyond the original tenor of what the Government intended. The coalition considers it inappropriate at this time that the Government should be introducing legislation that is beyond the comprehension of the everyday taxpayer and completely contrary to what was intended in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is essential for the Opposition to cooperate within its philosophy with the Government to ensure that certainty is achieved in terms of what is intended as to how taxpayers will interpret and understand the law. Therefore, it behoves us all as members of the Opposition to bring to the attention of government those areas of legislation that have been hastily drafted and do not fulfil the Government's stated intention and need redrafting. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeking amendments in a couple of areas to overcome deficiencies. As we mentioned to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) last night, it is no good his seeking and encouraging industry to review and restructure when, at the same time, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), espousing the same ideals, puts up roadblocks that make this impossible and rejects Opposition amendments which see the way clear to overcome those problems. The Government is either genuine or hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> I am seeking assurances in this debate that there will be further consultation within industry to ensure the rapid passage of some of the needed amendments even if the Government does not agree with what we are putting forward today. Within a short period the identical amendments that we are putting forward today will come back, albeit in a slightly revised form, in three months, six months or, if we are unlucky as we have been in the past, we may have to wait two or three years, in which case incalculable damage would have been done to the speed of restructuring many essential Australian industries simply because this Government is too proud to say, `We will have another look at it, there might be another way of doing it-there might be a simpler and more direct approach'. Unfortunately this Government has a red-necked attitude towards tax avoidance and wants to pick up the last dollar rather than the last $100. For that reason it couches its amendments so wide as to make normal commercial dealing almost impracticable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government espouses the need to improve performance, and companies have to move into new areas. Before they can add an additional coated paper product to a process of paper manufacturing and paper processing, they have to have an environmental impact statement. There is no allowance under tax law for these items to be treated as an expense or written off. It does not meet the challenges that are required of a changing society. The Government demands with one hand and takes with the other. It makes it more difficult for industry to meet the challenges of the future by its archaic ways and obsession that 98 per cent of Australian taxpayers are tax avoiders and tax cheats. It is time the Government opened its eyes. We have moved away from the 1970s and we are now in the 1990s, with a new approach. The Government has to take off its tunnel vision approach to legislation and has to make sure that it is not so tight as to make normal commercial transactions law avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes that much of this legislation is contrary to normal commercial practice. It is important that we cooperate with government and that within our philosophy we ensure certainty within the law. We had a debate the other day about the need, with self-assessment, to have this certainty. The package of Bills before us today takes away that certainty and creates more uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> Two areas of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill need great attention. First, I will discuss the areas dealing with the transfer of net capital loss within a company group-section 160zp in clause 23 of the Bill. I beg the patience of the chamber in discussing the next two areas as they are rather technical. One section permits a loss company-that is a company with a capital loss-to transfer to a gain company an amount of capital loss for capital gains purposes where both companies are within the wholly owned group. This is stated government policy, but there are roadblocks all the way in the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge that mischief can arise by way of a double tax benefit if the loss company is subsequently sold. This derives from the fact that when a company sells an asset at a loss the net worth of the company is reduced and this is reflected in a decrease in value of the shares or other investment in the company. In other words, the company suffers a loss, which is deductable for capital gains purposes, and the shareholders, in turn, suffer a similar loss. By selling the shares-that is if acquired post-September 1985-the shareholder may also create a loss for capital gains purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposed to limit the transfer of losses within a group to the extent of the post-September 1985 investment in the loss company. Also, the cost base, which is an indexed cost base, will be reduced by the amount of the loss transferred so avoiding scope for a double tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, as presently drafted, does not achieve this objective. What is the purpose of putting legislation forward which does not even achieve the objective that it is seeking? In fact, it goes far too wide. The approach is: we must stop the last dollar of any possible tax avoidance. For example, loss transfers would be available only to the extent of post-September 1985 investments. This would mitigate against long established company groups-that is, those established pre-1985 which would have cause to keep the loss in the loss company, and carry it forward, and suffer tax in the gain company in circumstances where the group had made neither a loss nor a gain by the simple process of combining the two companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's solution is quite simple: it attacks the typical tax avoidance case which involves the sale of the loss company shortly after the loss transfer. We propose that a deemed amount of the consideration, equal to the loss transferred, should be added to the sale price of this loss company if it is sold within three years. This very simple approach overcomes the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government believes that three years is too tight a period-and with current interest rates, that is hardly the case-let it put up an amendment to extend it to 3 3/4 or four years. To protect the long term restructuring of Australian industry the Government should make it simple, straightforward, understood and practical; it should not build in cumbersome arrangements that are impractical, costly to administer and ineffectual. In most cases of group loss transfers the loss company continues to be retained and so no suggestion of double tax benefit arises. </PARA>
<PARA> It is believed that, under our amendment, by limiting the period to three years it would overcome virtually all tax avoidance arrangements. The Government has not been able to point out one tax avoidance practice in this area; but we acknowledge that there is the potential for it to happen. It is fair enough that the Government has attempted to close the gap ahead of what might happen, but not in such a way as to close down business. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the converse can arise: a company with a capital gain could be sold with a further liability attaching to the shareholders. Of course, no attempt has been made to remedy this double taxing. So the Government catches on the one hand but, on the other, it is not prepared to offset a situation where there is double taxing. There are numerous examples throughout the tax Act nowadays where the single item of income is taxed in more than one hand. That is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's redrafted amendment takes note of the Government's original intent. It defeats the tax avoidance scheme without the impractical consequences of the original Government Bill. We say that if the Government is unhappy with this amendment it should come back and-it has had it for a long enough time-seek the necessary improvements. If the Government wants to refine it, it should do so, but it should not allow damage to be done while it sits on the impractical solutions that it is currently putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA> In the areas dealing with the transfer of assets within a company group, we have a similar problem. Again, the Government has asked corporations to restructure. We are not restructuring by grabbing a company and rearranging a new one straight away. We are talking about a long term restructure within a company group. With respect to proposed section 160zzo, which is dealt with in clause 31 of the Bill, the original proposals that the Government put forward today were cumbersome and contrary to commercial practice. Our tax Act is stifling business in Australia, and that is not good enough. The proposals require interlocking investments between groups which are frequently inconvenienced. Companies intending to restructure for purely efficiency reasons are prevented from doing so by virtue of the legislation before us today. That is not good enough in these perilous times that the Australian economy is facing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is constantly pressuring business to restructure, to become more efficient, to compete both domestically and internationally; yet the willingness of these companies to restructure is being thwarted time and time again. We have before the Senate today examples of tax impediments, such as the very amendments that we are referring to, that seek unwieldy, unworkable arrangements including cross-holding securities which some company laws forbid. How much further can we go?</PARA>
<PARA> Further difficulties arising from the Government's proposals include the impossibility, in terms of the Companies Code, for a parent company to issue shares to a subsidiary and the impracticality of issuing the alternative securities in terms of the proposal-here The Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury are working on their own without reference to the company law people-the inapplicability of the proposed roll-over consideration requirements, as applied to the restructuring of international and Australian groups' thus potentially excluding groups from the use of roll-overs; the effect of effectively converting previously capital gains tax exempt assets into assets subject to capital gains tax when there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership and when that result is not the stated intention in 1985 or later years-the Government is leading us into no-man's-land, a quagmire from which it is going to be very difficult to extricate ourselves in the future-and, finally, the proposed amendments, in effect, reduce the options available to taxpayers with no tax avoiding purposes whatsoever. This is the tunnel vision that the Government has with tax avoidance. In effect, the Government waters down the rights of taxpayers and exposes them to potential capital gains tax liabilities, which in many cases, should not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of assets between members of a company in exchange for shares issued by the transferee company could create a web of cross-shareholdings between companies within the group, thereby creating unnecessarily the complexity of company groups which, over the years, will add to administrative and auditing costs. In addition, such cross-shareholdings could give rise to flows of dividends through the group which are inappropriate to the normal commercial practice within a company group. The problems caused by such cross-shareholdings as proposed in the legislation cannot be overemphasised. </PARA>
<PARA> We have given the Government in advance our proposed amendments for evaluation. We hope that the Government will respond meaningfully. The Liberal-National Party amendments provide greater flexibility and will strike down the offending loopholes. The proposed amendment will assist intergroup transfers and, at the same time, diminish the avoidance possibilities. Where an asset is transferred between companies within a wholly-owned group, any capital gains liability which might otherwise arise may be deferred by placing the purchaser in the same capital gains position as the vendor with regard to the cost base, thus passing on to the purchaser any potential tax consequence-that is, the roll-over benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition acknowledges that tax avoidance may arise in at least two ways. We wish to present a means of overcoming this deficiency in the law. The avoidance can occur in a number of ways. I mentioned that the treatment creates unnecessary cross-shareholdings. The mischief in transferring a post-September 1985 asset to a pre-September 1985 group relates to the concept already covered in proposed section 160zzt and should be covered by specific amendment to that provision. It is the coalition's view that amendments should be dealt with through that section without upsetting the roll-over relief provisions of proposed section 160zzo where a specific provision already caters for this sort of contingency, rather than making 160zzo completely unworkable by extending the definition. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue raised in the practice of creating a new company capitalised as the market value of asset is specifically covered by our proposed amendment. At present, a purchaser can pay the market value for an asset, the vendor can claim roll-over relief, and the shares in the purchaser can then be sold at market value without incurring capital gains tax. The liability for capital gains tax remains with the company but unless the underlying asset is sold in the short term the capital gains tax may be deferred indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> By causing, in our proposal, the consideration for the asset transfer to be limited to the cost base, which is the fundamental structure and integrity of our amendment-indexed or reduced cost base, as the case may be-the shares in the purchasing company will, if sold, give rise to a capital gains liability such as will prevent tax avoidance arrangements. This is a very simple approach compared with the Government's very extensive change which involves excessive use of one provision to roll over into other provisions which have been set up to deal with specific purposes. Each of the proposed arrangements will be the subject of two of the three amendments the National-Liberal Party coalition intends to put forward at the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area in which the coalition is proposing to move an amendment is the legislation concerning a taxpayer's principal residence. Here the Bill does not go far enough. Why should the Government discriminate against young people who go out to the suburbs, buy a block of land and put a house on it and who, before the transaction is completed in terms of the requirements of the legislation, are transferred in their work-for example, an operator in Newcastle being required to move from the shipyard down to the frigate project in Melbourne, or a person in the defence forces being transferred overseas or from Sydney to Western Australia, or a person in a bank or insurance company moving to its head office? Why should the Government discriminate against these people, essentially the young people of Australia, who are seeking progress? We require a more mobile work force, yet this legislation is putting a road block on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should the Government favour a person who has bought an existing house and is getting the benefit of a principal residence exemption and, at the same time, deny that principal residence exemption where a person pursues the alternative route of wanting to build and plan his own home? I certainly hope that the Australian Democrats will move with us on extending that exemption. It could be a compulsory transfer or a non-compulsory transfer. Plenty of precedents exist, but why leave this gap that is essentially going to hurt the younger members of the community? I believe that the coalition's proposed amendment, which the Senate has before it today, can be easily achieved by alterations to clause 34 of the Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has very many examples of hastily drafted legislation. On the three Bills already discussed, the coalition will move amendments in the committee stage of this debate. However, we draw the Government's attention to another area that it might also like to examine-the treatment of research and development technology. It is not consistent with current practice, which generally treats intellectual property as capital assets, which, as such, are subject to part 3a of the Industry Research and Development Act with respect to the sale of eligible assets. Here the Government is moving in an area contrary to international practice and international standards in relation to the treatment of intellectual property, and in an area which poor old Barry Jones used to refer to as the sunrise industries of Australia which were going to help us get out of our current morass. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments provide that, where a deduction has been allowed in respect of eligible activities, they are to be included as assessable income-no great problem. The rate of deduction of expenditure on core technology is limited. Core technology has a special definition, of which all are aware: it refers to intellectual-type property. All assessable income from all receipts from granting access to, or the right to use the results of, a research and development project where expenditure on the project has been allowed as a deduction is included. So, consequently, the result of such research cannot be sold for more than the grant or costs involved and the excess will be taxed; hence the need, of course, to encourage firms to go into research. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers on the other side constantly say that there is a lack of research in Australia and a lack of incentive. The lack of incentive is caused by the failure to the Government's legislation to provide adequate means of compensation where that research is carried on in Australia and subsequently sold. This legislation before us today further inhibits Australian progress in the intellectual sphere of research and development technology transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the amendment in this Bill before us today-hastily drafted legislation just to get something on the statute book without considering the consequences of its repercussions down the line-is to deny the vendor of research activities the benefits of the indexed cost base provisions provided in part 3a of the Act in respect of the sale of eligible assets. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is responsible for this area, to take this legislation back to Cabinet with a view to revising it in order to overcome the dilemma that companies are going to face as a result of its introduction. I appeal to the science community in Australia to apply pressure to this Government to have this particular provision overturned in order that the proper provisions of part 3a can apply.</PARA>
<PARA> It has further come to my knowledge that a small, wholly owned Australian research and development based company and another Australian company are participating in an unincorporated joint venture which has developed a system to remotely identify, locate, track and communicate with vehicles in urban environments. It is a system that is unquestionably in a world-leading position. The intellectual property associated with the technology is owned on a 50:50 basis by two companies, and they now propose to transfer their respective interests in the technology to a new company which will be owned on a 50:50 basis by the original two companies which have developed the technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The compelling reason for the introduction of the new company is the need for a vehicle to exploit the considerable export potential of this new technology. It is envisaged that aspects of the technology will be licensed, at significant benefit to Australia, to major international telecommunications organisations. The housing of technology in a single entity greatly facilitates this approach. In order to assist the export drive and to provide working capital for the exercise, a third partner is to be introduced into the new company shortly after its incorporation. The two original companies are not proposing to sell any of their assets but to issue new capital. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the proposed legislation, the original two companies requested the Australian Taxation Office, prior to proceeding to incorporate the new company, to rule on a number of taxation issues. Principal among these is the proposed transfer of the technology to the new company, bearing in mind that this transfer would not generate any assessable profit to the original companies involved and that, for the expenditure prior to 7 September 1990, a transfer would be subject to the roll-over provisions of section 160zzn (2) of the capital gains tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The roll-over provisions of the capital gains tax legislation were introduced in recognition of the fact that asset ownership changes associated with specified types of business organisations, where no changes occur in the underlying ownership of the assets concerned, should not constitute taxable events, but the failure to recognise this particular problem has resulted in capital gains tax acting as an impediment to sensible business organisation. Income should be taxed only when income is generated. The amendments before us to section 73b fail to recognise why the capital gains tax provisions allow roll-over. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies involved in this new technology, which should have outstanding export value to Australia, have been informed that the transfer of the technology from the original two companies to the new third company will be deemed to generate an income, the value of which will be imputed from the price of any shares issued to a third partner. If, for example, the third partner were to be issued shares amounting to one-third of the total for a price of, say, $5m, the imputed value of each of the two original companies' shares would also be $5m to each of the companies. This is in spite of the fact that neither of the original two companies has received any proceeds and both have sought only to transfer an asset from an unincorporated 50:50 entity to an incorporated 50:50 entity. </PARA>
<PARA> The final result is that, in the case of one of the companies which actually has all the technical know-how and experience, the tax liability that will arise out of the incorporation and integration of the third partner will be so great, if imposed, that it will almost certainly result in the liquidation of the company and the end of the new technology and the potential for an excellent export business. The Government is killing from the start a new technology, a new innovation, not as a result of the enthusiasm of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce but as a result of the tax legislation not being able to cope or keep up to date with modern technology and modern movements. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this venture is poised after four years of development to launch into the lucrative international telecommunications market, the taxation position could thwart all the efforts of these enterprising people here in Australia to develop new markets and new research and to open up new areas of export. This Government should be encouraging business and encouraging companies to restructure and to export. Yet what has occurred is hasty, detrimental drafting of Bills which hinder business through taxation laws that go far beyond anything that the Government has intended. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government to at least give an assurance of when a review is going to be organised to overcome the problems that have been raised. Does the Government intend to follow the path that we have suggested, of agreeing to straightforward amendments, or does the Government intend to defeat this Bill purely for the purpose of winning the game in terms of `The Government beat the Opposition on this amendment because the Government had greater numbers', irrespective of the detriment that the problem is going to cause to the restructuring of companies and irrespective of the suffering that the deficiency is going to cause some young people who may have to refuse a transfer on the ground that they cannot afford the capital gains tax when they are forced to transfer by virtue of their employment, whether voluntarily or involuntarily? I look forward to the Minister's response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating legislation dealing with changes that the Government announced in the Budget last year-the Government introduced legislation last year that was not passed by both Houses before the dissolution of the Parliament-to deal with a number of matters, including some changes with regard to the treatment of capital gains tax and subsequent matters. The Australian Democrats support the passage of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened with interest to many of Senator Watson's comments. The passion with which he talks about these matters rarely strikes any other member of this place. But the point of the matter I find strange is the passion with which various changes to the particular pieces of legislation that the Opposition is proposing are put forward, considering that during the last election campaign it wished to abolish the entire exercise. As people know, the Democrats supported this. We were the only party that ever campaigned in an election for the introduction of a capital gains tax. We believe that it is part of the equity establishment within a taxation system that those who earn their income by salary have to pay tax. We believe also that those people who earn their income by capital ought to pay tax too. Prior to the introduction of the capital gains tax it was possible for many people to escape that liability. Of course, that meant that the wage earners of this country had to carry a larger burden because other people were exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing these types of items under a taxing regime there has been a massive amount of equity introduced into the taxation system. It is inevitable when this occurs-certainly from our point of view we strongly urged that there be a starting date with regard to this type of taxation, and that it not be made retrospective-that there is a dividing line. What we have in a large proportion of this particular piece of legislation is again a treatment of that dividing line. So we are going back to 1985 to attempt to modify some of the problems that undoubtedly occur when we move from a total non-taxed context to a taxed context. The proposals that the Government has here are sensible. I will leave to the committee stage those matters which were rehearsed by Senator Watson at the second reading stage as they really form the substance of the amendments he intends to move in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also changes being made in this Bill in terms of the company context. I think one could easily foreshadow that given the new company regime to start on 1 July, with any hope, we will be facing further changes because there have been substantial modifications made, particularly with regard to grouped companies, that will have an impact on the taxation regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Another item included in the Bill, and probably the most contentious item, is how to treat the major primary exclusion from the capital gains tax, that is, the principal residence. Again, the Government has sought to address a number of quite genuine concerns in the community as to how these matters will be dealt with. I must admit that in wading through the explanatory memorandum, which I found in very large part not to explain anything and only to make the essence of the thing more difficult, I had to go back to the Bill on a number of occasions to try to find out what was going on. I found it difficult. I remember when I asked a previous Minister for Finance to explain to me what the explanatory memorandum meant he could not explain it, neither could any of his advisers. We are getting to the context whereby explanatory memorandums ought to do a little bit of explaining. I hope that those who write these might take a course in plain English-there are excellent ones in Victoria that they could be referred to-so that all of us, including not only people in this place but people who have an interest, might be able to find out in straightforward English what is going on in terms of the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will raise in the committee stage some interesting waffle in regard to the exercise relating to a principal residence. For a person who is not in residence at the principal residence for up to four years-which I think is an excellent idea as people obviously move around a great deal in this community and that has to be taken into account-there is an extraordinary section in this Bill which explains how the whole thing is treated with regard to a person's absence. I seem to have lost the reference but I will bring it up in the committee stage because I think a lot of people want to know-this is presumably what this particular section is talking about-what happens when they leave their residence. </PARA>
<PARA> What is still massively unclear from the explanatory memorandum is what happens when people leave their residence and rent it out. As I remember, in this particular explanatory memorandum, it is referred to as earning income on it; the normal terminology is `rent'. I think most Australians know what rent means. It is a pity that the person who wrote this did not know what rent meant. When a person rents out his residence when he is not living there-which I presume is what it was all about-what happens? I think that is a reasonable question. People ought to know. It ought to be put in a reasonable way so that people can understand and so that their advisers, in reading this material, might be able to advise their clients more quickly and more surely as to what they should do. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the complexities of the taxation system being what they are, I do not suppose we will ever get a simplified tax system. I know that it is the Government's earnest wish in this regard. It says something is going to happen later this year. There is not a soul in Australia waiting with bated breath for that particular exercise. It seems to me that at least in one step back, if we cannot make the legislation readable, we should at least make the explanatory memorandum readable. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the various items in that regime, the Democrats support the variations that the Government has introduced in terms of the treatment of the principal residence. I think every honourable senator has had people talk to them about some of the anomalies that occurred. Particularly difficult for those that I have dealt with, and I am sure other senators have had to deal with, is where a person has died. There was some odd treatment of that exemption where a person died. The difficulties and concerns of the remaining partner as to what precisely might happen if he or she wished to sell their residence at that stage, particularly those residences which in the majority of cases, in a married context, would be owned by the husband and wife. I think the Government's move in these regards is most welcome. In many cases these changes have been backdated, as they should be. Undoubtedly, that was going to cause some unravelling. Nevertheless, I think the Government is on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter can be dealt with more extensively in the committee stage. At the end of the day the line has to be drawn somewhere. I suspect that we will not be able to do a great deal to make that line any more acceptable to those people who fall under it than has been done to date without abolishing the exercise in its entirety. Certainly, our view is that the exercise needs to be treated with a great deal of caution. At the moment the Government's propositions, as have been put in this legislation, seem to meet the difficulties that have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson constantly referred to the matter of hasty drafting of legislation. I am not quite sure to what he referred specifically. I presume that he had some inside knowledge-that I do not have-of the amount of time that it took to draft this legislation. I merely point to the fact, and it will be important in terms of the committee stage debate on the commencement, that the Democrats did say to the Government that we wanted legislation within six months of announcement of these matters. In regard to this legislation the Government has done that. It made the announcement in August and, as I remember, brought in the legislation in November. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we have before us is new, but is in substantially the same form as the first Bill introduced. This enables the community, particularly advisers, to be aware of what is likely to happen. I agree with Senator Watson that we would not want any hastily drafted legislation. Nevertheless, do we want a return to the situation of having to wait around for months, indeed years, before we see legislation with regard to an announcement? I think the movement to get it done within that six-month timeframe needs complex drafting and undoubtedly mistakes can be and are made. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not like my silence to be taken to mean that the Democrats agree that the Government has a lot longer timeframe in which to get its legislation into the Parliament. We believe that when it makes an announcement it ought to introduce legislation with as much despatch as possible, otherwise the destabilising effect of knowing that something will commence from a particular date but not knowing the details of it makes the disposal and operation of one's private affairs extremely difficult. It also makes the operation of company shareholdings, movements and restructurings almost impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> We would support the Government moving with as much despatch as possible to get these pieces of legislation into the Parliament, and thereby exposed to the public for longer periods before they are actually passed by the other chamber or this place. It also gives people like Senator Watson, who have an interest in these matters, the opportunity to be able to go through the proposed legislation in detail. It we do not have that timeframe available to us it makes our task more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will be supporting this legislation at the second reading stage. We reserve comments with regard to the points raised by the Opposition until we get into the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I express my appreciation to Senator Watson and Senator Macklin for the constructive way in which they have approached not only this debate but also the discussions that have led up to it. I have appreciated the openness with which we have had those discussions. Whatever the outcome on this occasion, it is the sort of process that can, over time, lead to better outcomes from the deliberations of the Parliament. I thank them for that. I indicate my willingness to continue to participate in that sort of process and hope that they will reciprocate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson and I were a little surprised about the timetable that was brought forward for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990. Last night we discussed what we wanted as a timetable and this was not it. Certainly, I raised it with the representatives of my Party and I presume Senator Watson did as well, but other people's wishes have prevailed. I acknowledge that he has raised it with me. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not, at this stage, go into a sort of quasi-committee debate dealing with the detail of all the amendments. In response to some of the points raised in the second reading speech, I am happy to give what are called assurances for continuing consultation, as Senator Watson requested. The Government has already commenced dialogue with business groups concerned about the particular matters to which the Opposition has proposed amendments, with regard to both the transfer of capital losses and the transfer of assets between group companies. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been some discussion on research and development. I am aware of the example to which Senator Watson refers. The people involved have also communicated with me. In regard to those three instances all I want to say at this second reading stage-although I am happy to discuss it in more detail subsequently-is that we do not believe that any of the alternatives proposed are better than that which we have before us. We have looked at proposals that have come from affected companies, related interest groups and the Opposition, and we have tried to be as open as we could. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we all have to acknowledge that from time to time we may be restricted intellectually by a sort of pride of authorship-this is our proposal and we do not want to see it changed-but on this occasion I think not. We have tried to be open to sensible suggestions and we have indicated to those affected that we will continue to be so. But at this stage there are no amendments from members of the Opposition or industry suggestions that we find acceptable in terms of our principal responsibility, which is to protect the revenue and the interests of the taxpayers who pay their tax regularly and who are entitled not to have an extra burden placed upon them because others enter into complex arrangements to avoid their proper responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other points to which I should refer because they do not directly arise from amendments, and I want to respond to a couple of things which Senator Macklin said. With regard to the possibility that double taxation might arise under the Bill I say two things. First, in the normal circumstance the question of a capital gains tax obligation being transferred would obviously be reflected in the price of the asset being transferred. The person buying it would buy it in that knowledge and that would be reflected in the price. In the normal course of events I can see no circumstances in which that double tax would arise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that, in a not dissimilar way to a complex arrangement which might endeavour to incur, at the moment, a duplication of the loss, one could enter into a complex corporate arrangement that would incur for one a double taxable gain. It would be an extraordinary arrangement that somebody entered into that achieved that sort of odd objective. I do not think that in the normal course of business this will arise because of the price factor and the information. So we do not have a problem with double tax. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the question of hasty drafting I do not want to say more than Senator Macklin has said. I think we need to make the distinction between being hasty and being prompt. It is appropriate that these things are dealt with as speedily as possible. It is appropriate for the Parliament; in effect, it is a requirement of the Parliament. It is also appropriate for people in business. </PARA>
<PARA>If from time to time this throws up a particular drafting problem, that is something we in this place ought to address. But as a generality I do not accept that this has been particularly hastily drafted. By virtue of the arrangements that took place at the end of last year and then leading up to the election, we have had a chance to have two goes at it. Without unduly delaying procedures we have had the chance to review and revise the drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say with regard to Senator Macklin's comments that I welcome the continuing views that he and the Australian Democrats express concerning capital gains tax overall and I recognise the points that he makes with respect to the principal residence exemption and particularly the question of complexity. I am a great advocate of the plain English approach to drafting. Senator Macklin and I had some experience of it during our membership of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. If anything can make the tax Act look simple, it is the Financial Corporations Act. That was a learning experience for all of us. Some discussions are taking place between me and the Australian Taxation Office, and within the Taxation Office, about the question of plain English drafting, in part relating to the ongoing simplification project. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of other things could be said in detail about the amendments but they would be appropriate for discussion in the committee stage, so I will simply conclude by saying that we will not be accepting any of the amendments that have been put forward at this stage. We do not believe they meet the principal obligations on the Government with regard to preventing avoidance but we remain open to constructive suggestions in the future. </PARA>

Opposition amendment No. 3 refers to the principal residence in the situation where a taxpayer buys a block of land, builds a house on it, and, before the transactions are legally completed to meet the requirements of law, is transferred in his employment. This situation is an anomaly because the Government treats a person who buys a house and is unable to complete the transaction in terms of the required residence requirements as entitled to the principal residence exemption. Why should we treat the younger people in the community differently? Our remedy seeks to overcome that. I am disappointed that neither the Government nor the Democrats have responded to this third amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that perhaps in the second reading debate I did not make sufficient response to the question of principal residence exemption. I am happy to do so now. I want to proceed in the order in which the amendments have been moved-that is, the transfer of net capital losses, the transfer of assets between group companies, and the principal residence exemption. I will not go into matters in great technicality but will try to deal with them in the way that Senator Watson did, in terms of the broad principles that are involved. Having canvassed the matter in the second reading debate it seems to be inappropriate to do otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the transfer of net capital losses, the Government's amendments are designed to prevent a company group from obtaining the benefit of multiple capital losses in respect of one real loss. Our problem with the Opposition amendment, the purpose of which we accept, is that all it would achieve would be to defer for three years the opportunity to realise multiple losses. It may be that the circumstance Senator Watson has outlined is what he calls typical at the moment; the problem is that it would become rapidly atypical the day after we passed this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the problem. I am not saying it would be of no benefit but it does not achieve the benefit for which the Government has proposed the amendment because it could easily be circumvented. The concern which has been raised with me in that regard is that the amendment applies only at the time when a loss company ceases to be a group company, and that is, for the purpose of the Taxation Act, when 100 per cent common ownership ceases. So there are a lot of options between the sale of one per cent and 100 per cent in which companies could still transfer a substantial balance of shares in the loss company without the application of the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We think the three-year mechanism of itself is not satisfactory but also we are concerned that the trigger mechanism in the proposal, whereby the Opposition amendment applies only at the time when the loss company ceases to be a group company, is flawed as well. I think our objectives are common; I do not think what Senator Watson proposes achieves them. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the transfer of assets between group companies, the proposed Government amendments are essentially intended to prevent the abuse of the concessions available on the transfer of assets between companies sharing common ownership. There are two aspects to those. One is the question of whether the concessions can be used to defer tax on accrued gains indefinitely. `Deferring indefinitely' and `avoiding' are difficult to distinguish when we come to the net effect. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a second problem; that is, the transfer of value-using these concessions to transfer value from assets subject to capital gains tax to assets that are exempt by virtue of their pre-19 September 1985 status. The Opposition I think recognises-and Senator Watson acknowledged-that we could not just allow that potential to go unchecked, and it has attempted to address the problem. I will come back to the question of the business difficulties in a moment, just to reiterate what I said in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> But we are concerned that the Opposition's amendments do not achieve these aims. Even if they are effective in dealing with the deferral problem-and there is significant doubt about that-they do not address the value shifting problem at all, as we see it, and we are not therefore satisfied at this stage that we can accept that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that these amendments have the potential-and, of course, this has been raised with the Government as it has with the Opposition-to cause difficulties for legitimate businesses going about legitimate activities, and we have no desire to achieve that. We have said to them that we wish to cooperate, but we have said to them that we cannot cooperate in a manner that leaves open blatant avoidance mechanisms. However, we have not only said that we welcome further suggestions but also have set out to establish mechanisms that will facilitate those companies and bodies like the Corporate Tax Association most effectively having their views reflected by attempts to come to an agreed position about subsequent amendments. But at this stage we are not prepared-and have made it clear to such bodies and to the Senate, as I did in the second reading debate-to forgo what we believe are necessary amendments for the elimination of tax avoidance opportunities. So we will press on with these but we certainly indicate our openness to further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Once one enters the principal residence exemption area one has to try to deal with some of the complexities that arise in the arrangements that individuals and families make in relation to the home that they either live in, aspire to live in or aspire to build. The problem we are confronted with is that the Opposition amendments seem to be even more arbitrary and, unfortunately, to a great extent, subjective. Whereas we have a prolblem-which I acknowledge and with which nobody could argue-that there is some arbitrariness in the existing legislation, I do not think we wish to see that problem exacerbated. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these discussions raise the question, which, I think, Senator Macklin mentioned, about where to draw the line. The honourable senator asked what is the essential distinction between a change in circumstance caused by a change of employment and a change in circumstance caused by other problems. He mentioned the example of the death of a close relative and I, as a constituency representative, have had examples of that sort put before me. Nobody has mentioned one to me concerning a change of employment. But other circumstances have arisen with people whose financial circumstances have changed, not by virtue of a transfer but for other reasons which have meant they have had to sell. Although they have been subjected to the capital gains tax, can I say that this has been imposed only on the real profit that they have made-on the income which they have earned. I, therefore, wish to say that they have not been subjected to capital gains tax on some notional gain-they are subjected to it only after a gain, and sometimes a quite substantial gain, has been realised. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a problem if a person says, `That block of land is an investment purchased in order to generate the capacity to build a house subsequently'-which is what it becomes if one allows people to sell a block of land and use the profits, tax free, to build their subsequent residence. There is no obvious reason why we should exempt vacant land as against some other capital purchase that an individual may have made for the purpose of making a profit to fund the building of his house. If that were allowed it might equally be argued that gains realised on the disposal of shares to acquire a house are a legitimate investment and ought, somehow or other, be income that is treated preferentially with regard to all other sources of income when it comes to capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a problem when we introduce this subjective element. The tests at the moment-arbitrary, as they need to be, in some circumstances-are at least objective. There are certain fixed periods of time involved for determining the availability of the exemption. We would not wish to see the subjective test introduced, particularly one that I think will create as many anomalies as it resolves. I can imagine the correspondence that would flow saying, `I had to move from Newcastle to Melbourne for some valid purpose other than a change of employment. My neighbour moved because of a change of employment. Otherwise, we were in identical circumstances but we were dealt with differently for tax purposes'. I think this creates a fairly fundamental tax equity question, which the Government feels the Opposition amendment exacerbates. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise in advance, in order to avoid duplication, a point which Senator Macklin raised at the second reading stage concerning the principal residence exemption and the situation that an individual who is gaining income from rent may find himself in with regard to this amendment. I think that maybe I have read the explanatory memorandum too often, and perhaps I have a false sense of reality about the extent to which it is capable of being understood by others. But as far as my reading of it is concerned, the explanatory memorandum refers to the situation where houses are rented out during temporary absences. I do not have that document in front of me now and the language may not be as simple as it appears to me in retrospect, but my recollection and understanding is that even if a dwelling is used for income producing purposes-rent, lease or the like-during a temporary absence, that use will be disregarded in determining the availability for the exemption. I think the situation, if it were not clear in the drafting, ought to be clear by that comment. Those are the comments that I wish to make at this stage concerning the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for his comments. The point to which I was referring at the second reading stage is covered in the explanatory memorandum and reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Furthermore, if the dwelling (or if the whole of the dwelling (within the expanded meaning of that term) was not used by the taxpayer prior to its ceasing to be occupied as his or her sole or principal residence-the part that was used for that purpose) is also used during the taxpayer's temporary absence for income producing purposes that use is disregarded in respect of the dwelling, or part concerned . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What the Parliamentary Secretary says is perfectly true-it would, in fact, be disregarded. However, I do not see that what I have just read is terribly explanatory of anything. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for now clarifying for people precisely what will occur. It is a fairly normal occurrence for people to rent out their homes when they are away and it would be nice for them to know what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved three amendments. As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, there seems to be a difficulty with the first amendment concerning the net loss situation. I understand that Senator Watson, in using a three-year exercise, is seeking simplicity and that actually is gained by his amendment. However, the difficulty is that I think his amendment can be got around precisely by the proposition that was raised by the Parliamentary Secretary-that is, the difficulty, under company law, of moving. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, all that would be necessary would be for the loss company simply to enter into a contract for the sale of a share. That loss company would then cease at that time to be a group company. The appropriate proportion of adjustment to the consideration of the disposal of that share would then be made. The balance of the shares in the loss company-which, of course, is now no longer a group company-could then be sold off without the Opposition's amendment being needed at all. That seems to me to be a problem within the three-year context that Senator Watson is talking about. So I think one could drive a hole through the amendment and, therefore, I indicate that the Australian Democrats cannot support it on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that that is also one of the reasons for our attitude to the second amendment, which has caused us a great deal of trouble. Indeed, one of my advisers, in exasperation, finally wrote to me and suggested that, as he could not understand what it meant, we should not support it. The amendment is a difficult one. In terms of the amendments which both we and the Opposition have sought to move over time to taxation legislation, one has probably to err on the side of caution because of the possible ramifications throughout the taxation system. Luckily, not all legislation that comes into this place is piled on top of each other as is the case with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill. Therefore, we are very cautious about these amendments. Indeed, Senator Watson, in his comments at the second reading stage, accepted that there is a difficulty here. The ability to defer tax or credit gains almost indefinitely by movement cannot be accepted, particularly where they carry over that cut off period, that September 1975 boundary-after all, it is that boundary that we are talking about-and then move on in an almost indefinite fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson's argument for the Opposition's alternative proposal was quite attractive. However, I still remain to be convinced that the problem of tax deferral and particularly the movement of values has adequately been addressed. On that basis of not being convinced and relying on that abundance of caution necessary in this area, we will not support the Opposition's second amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment deals with a far simpler matter-if anything relating to this legislation can be simple-and that is the principal residence exemption. As I indicated during the second reading debate, the Government has engaged in a number of movements that we think are acceptable to the general community. The Opposition seeks to go yet a step further to deal with a situation where a person who had bought land and was either preparing to build on it or had built on it had got to the stage of not being able to fulfil the new residency requirement in this Act, which is now only three months rather than the previous six months. One could probably feel something for the people caught up in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty of deciding where to start this exercise is one we have discussed within the Party. We have had this concern with a number of pieces of legislation. Under the Fraser Administration Senator Colin Mason got quite upset in this place about changing dates for first home buyers. Of all people his son was drummed out of the exercise because he fell on the wrong side of the arbitrary date that was set. There is an arbitrariness about major tax changes. That has to be accepted. If the Government had not chosen to bring in legislation on that particular day, then obviously some other day would have been the cut-off point. Indeed, the same people may have found themselves exempt. To that extent one must sympathise with those individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the Parliamentary Secretary, I have not had any of those people raise this matter with me. However, I am prepared to accept, as Senator Watson said, that those people actually exist. At least they are a theoretical possibility. Given the large number of people who move in this country, it is presumably more than a theoretical possibility; this has probably happened to some people out there. This did happen five years ago. I am sure the people have forgotten about it, though I congratulate Senator Watson; he is still fighting on about the issue. But the people probably forgot it and got on with their lives. They probably said, `That's the way it tumbles'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a difficulty. If we were to accept Senator Watson's proposition we would have a new starting point. I am quite sure that we would then have to deal with those people who prior to Senator Watson's starting date had entered into a contract to buy land or who had entered into some contractual arrangement eventually to buy some land. There can be an almost infinite regression. On that basis, one simply has to say, `This is it. This is the point. We are not going any further'. I accept the Government's proposition on that basis. The fact is that a capital gains tax ought to have been introduced long before it was. The fact that it was not indicates a massive failing in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though we are doing something that is inequitable. The introduction and operation of this tax introduced equity, not inequality. Quite frankly, those people who gained an exemption prior to that date can count themselves lucky. They got away with something which should never have been allowed in our taxation structure. One cannot say that these people have been badly done by. The entire country-all the wage earners-were badly done by because the tax was not in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Government has seen fit to allow the reduction for three months is a further concession with regard to this principal exemption. The notion of the principal exemption is not likely to die at this particular point; I am quite sure it will live on because of its very nature. Indeed, it became a matter of some controversy because of various items that my Party raised about it during the election that the Government has not seen fit to take up. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not moving away from the fact that there are problems with this. But on the basis that we have equity in the system by the very introduction of this tax, it is reasonable to accept the Government's cut-off point. The Parliamentary Secretary's argument that it was introduced on the basis of an objective rather than a subjective ruling is probably as good as any in terms of where the line is drawn. I do not wish to make it any higher than that. There is not a great deal to stand on in any of these particular lines that one draws. </PARA>
<PARA> One could even draw the line further back than Senator Watson would like to draw it. When a line is drawn some people are excluded and others are included. The Government has argued that it wishes to do it and it has sought to do it in this legislation on the basis of an objective test. I think that is reasonable with regard to this principal exemption. On those grounds we do not support the Opposition's third amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the committee stage of this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill pride is taking pre-eminence over realism. We note the Australian Democrats approach to the amendments. They regret their support but they say there is a need for `abundant caution'. I also note the Democrats' concern and sympathy for the young people-their so-called natural constituency-who will be severely affected by this legislation, which I would have thought the Democrats would seek. I regret their decision. This is one of the first instances where we have seen essentially the young people in the community let down by this new emerging Party-the Australian Democrats. The party appears out of tune with the aims, aspirations and hopes of young people who want to own a home and at the same time advance in their employment to be part of a highly skilled and mobile work force. We note the Democrats' sympathy and concern. I regret their inability to accept our amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the coalition gives a practical approach to overcome an anomaly. I disagree with the Government that the amendment is subjective. The only possible subjective component could be the viability or credibility of whether there is a transfer of employment. Surely that can be very easily established by reference to the past employer, the future employer or the continuing employer. However, one does not win unless the issues are put up. We believe that we have demonstrated today that we have put up viable alternatives. Unfortunately, in the past the Government has lacked this contact with the affected people. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome this new approach. If anything, although we might have lost these amendments before the chamber today, we have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government intends to contact these people to have a dialogue to try to overcome the issues that have been created by the roadblocks that it has put forward in the legislation before us today. They are very serious roadblocks. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Government's intention and I hope there will be meaningful discussions leading to amendments to overcome the impasse in three areas. I think we have got to acknowledge that the Government will not proceed with the matter concerning the principal residence. If industry is to restructure something has to be done in relation to the intercompany transfers and the regroupings which are so necessary for the revitalisation of the Australian economy. A roadblocking mechanism has been put in here. I regret that that is the level of complexity which is absolutely necessary to overcome the problem of tax avoidance. As the Government has found, it is necessary to draft laws in a complex way to overcome the problem. I regret it was the complexity that got the better of the Australian Democrats, that they had an inability to see through to the end result, and that there was a need for an abundance of caution. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say I did regret the Parliamentary Secretary's comment about excessive avoidance, or words to that effect. Again, I think it shows the Government's preoccupation with what I refer to as a 1970s mentality when the High Court of Australia liberally interpreted legislation to thwart the intentions of some principal tax avoiding measures that we had at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind you, Mr Chairman, that it was the Liberal Government that brought in part 4a, the replacement of section 260, which is the principal mechanism now to overcome such arrangements. I regret that the Government finds it necessary to introduce detailed anti-avoidance mechanisms rather than use part 4a. The fact that this provision has been virtually unused by the Government or the Commissioner for Taxation demonstrates to one and all the effectiveness of that provision that was introduced by a Liberal-National Party coalition Government. It is successful. The fact that people at large have not used it and the Tax Commissioner has not used it demonstrates its effectiveness. It stands alone. We hope that before drafting legislation in future there will be genuine contact with the people affected. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may give advance notice, I welcome the Government's recent changed approach in relation to the foreign income legislation which will supersede the foreign tax credits legislation. I think there has been, for the first time, a proper and meaningful dialogue which will tend to overcome the sorts of problems that have been experienced and that are being experienced as a result of this hastily drawn legislation which is drawn without adequate and full consultation with the affected people. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret the approach that has been used. I regret the Democrats' endorsement of the process referred to as backdating; retrospective application of legislation. With such a position, I wonder what will be the future of the interest component on moneys purchased to acquire shares in new companies whereby there seems to be an insistence to overturn established law by virtue of a reliance on a superseded section-section 46 (7). If that is pursued in line with the current enthusiasm of the tax audit division of the Australian Taxation Office, it will bankrupt many companies, force severe price decline in the share markets and raise $2 billion in the process. So in the process of raising money, extreme damage will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I flag this at this point because it is not unrelated to the problems that we are encountering in this sort of legislation by the endorsement of what is known as backdating, and undoubtedly a recognition that there has to be some unravelling which is of some inconvenience. I put it to you, Mr Chairman, that if great cost, great unravelling and great reorganisation is required, in many cases the legislation will not be worth proceeding with. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that neither the Government nor others are prepared to go along in a meaningful way to support our amendments. What could be simpler or more effective to overcome a tax avoidance situation than to add back the effect of that loss to one's consideration? This would not be done in the quarantine way that the Democrats and the Government have suggested, because it is not restrictive in terms of the way it is interpreted. If one does not have the advantage of that very loss, one is not going to enter into these proposals because the advantage is just not there. </PARA>
<PARA> What is there to trade? The trade-in is essentially the loss. If it is going to be added back for three years because there is concern about the time, I say that for even two years it does not pay to indulge in these sorts of operations because of the interest component alone. If someone comes back to us and says they are worried about the three years because it is pretty marginal, we will suggest they take even four or five, because what we are interested in doing is looking at protecting the investment through the restructuring arrangement in the long term and in the short term picking up the paper traders and the avoiders in a very simple and meaningful way by virtue of what we have done. </PARA>
<PARA> I also regret that there has been some confusion-and it is understandable-of the difference between a trading loss per se and a loss on disposal of the company's shares. I think we have put forward a way around that. At least I think the Opposition has now demonstrated to the business community and to those affected people of Australia our genuine concern for tax reform and the overcoming of the problems of tax avoidance, but at the same time opening up the opportunities for the genuine people to move ahead. I only hope that the Government moves expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that we had not the time or the resources to put the necessary amendments to section 73 (3). I am afraid it will be treated in exactly the same way as other amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We are killing research in this country. I plead to the Government to move expeditiously to implement the appropriate procedures used in part 3a of the Income Tax Act to overcome this dilemma, and to at least allow some Australian companies to rise above the mire of taxation stalemates and roadblocks that are currently before them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I will now refer to clauses 4 and 5. Those amendments affect clauses 12, 23 (1) and 38 (7) of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990. They cover dual resident investment companies. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) previously announced that the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 would be amended to overcome double dipping tax avoidance schemes, whereby a dual resident company utilises the tax laws of Australia and another country to obtain a double tax benefit for the same deduction. When mooted, it was envisaged that the amendments would deny dual resident taxpayers a tax benefit where the taxpayer obtains an Australian deduction as a result of the scheme entered into for that purpose. At the time, such proposals were envisaged to stop a number of schemes where double dipping was occurring. The Treasurer, however, stated in his press release that the tax benefit would be allowed when it was established that the revenue would not be detrimentally affected and another tax benefit would not flow to that of another country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Against that, the proposed legislation has some defects. We draw attention to proposed new section 6f (1) (c), where there are a number of tests-a business test, a substantive purpose test and a discretion test. It seems inappropriate, particularly when the Government is concerned about improving the balance of payments in this current economic climate and is attempting to stimulate exports, that we have the sort of inhibiting legislation which is before us at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to refer to clause 13, those sections which deal with research and development, and the receipts of the operation of the capital gains tax. I note that the Government is seeking by proposed subsection 73b (27a) to provide that where a deduction under section 73b has been allowed in respect of the eligible activities, any amounts received in respect of those eligible activities are to be included in assessable income. I reiterate-for the purpose of the Government's further consideration of this matter-that the treatment of research and development technology is not consistent with current practice which generally treats intellectual property as a capital asset and, as such, subject to the provisions of part IIIa. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister whether it is the Government's intention to move in this direction in relation to discussions that it intends to have with such people as I referred to who are going to be badly affected as a result of this legislation. I wish to point out more strongly that the effect of the amendment is to deny the vendor of research results any of the benefits of the indexed cost-based provisions which would be provided by part IIIa of the Act in respect of the sale of eligible assets. Is this the way the Government intends to move?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit premature to indicate whether we will move at all, let alone whether that is the direction in which we shall move. I indicated at the second reading stage that I was aware of the example, that I understood the concerns raised by the companies affected, and that we are certainly open to discussing the matter with them. But at this stage, far from saying that the Government is going to move in a particular direction, I do not even want to flag that we are definitely going to move. We are simply saying that there is an issue worth further discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the companies' cases are not as positive or as totally positive in their direction as they would wish. Substantial benefits are otherwise available under the tax system for research and development and we may not wish to move any further. But, of course, that which Senator Watson proposes will be part of the discussions. </PARA>

<PARA> With respect to section 160zj, the Australian Democrats are concerned about minute details but they are not concerned about the substance of what we are looking at later on.

<PARA> We have already referred to the problems in clause 23, the transfer of the capital losses. Again, the Government and the Democrats were not prepared to support what was put forward. Throughout the amendments we are seeing the application of the principle of retrospectivity which, as an Opposition, we abhor, but which the Government believes unfortunate but necessary because of its particular attitude to overcoming particular tax avoidance measures. They are the matters which I wish to refer to in the need for some expediency and to meet unfortunately a 12 o'clock deadline elsewhere. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is designed to do a number of separate things. It implements many of the social security measures which were announced in the Government's February 1990 economic statement and, indeed, previously proposed in the coalition's Economic Action Plan of October 1989, including such measures as the tightening of the administration of income support for the unemployed, encouraging labour market participation by spouses of married beneficiaries, bringing unemployment benefits and Austudy more into alignment and removing certain anomalies in income support arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition takes the view that each of those steps is desirable in terms of providing the right incentives structure in order to avoid the unnecessary temptations that currently arise from the malalignment of such things as Austudy and unemployment benefits. We therefore welcome the rationalisation which we believe provides the necessary incentive signals in order to encourage as many people as possible to re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be said that most of the significant changes in the Bill relate to the overhaul of the unemployment benefits system, but only pending the Government's foreshadowed total replacement of the current arrangements from July 1991 by the Job Search allowance for the first 12 months and the Newstart allowance for the long term unemployed. That indeed was a hastily cobbled together proposal floated in the heat of the election campaign by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the February economic statement. Quite clearly, it was a recognition of the overwhelming level of positive response from the community to the coalition's proposals in relation to the cutting out of unemployment benefits after the first nine-month period and thereafter to allow special benefits where necessary to accommodate those who were still out of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the real reason why the Government came up with its own cosmetic proposals lies in the fact that, when pressed for detail, it acknowledges that in the first full year of operation, in 1991-92, the new scheme is estimated to save only $21m. That, I would have thought, was a devastating indictment of its alternative approach. Mr Howard had previously talked about far-reaching initiatives which would involve the total overhaul of the unemployment benefits system but, if we are talking of only $21m worth of savings in the first 12 months, it is fairly clear that that was little more than a cosmetic change designed for pre-election purposes, to try to suggest that somehow the Government was able to trump the Opposition's proposals and that it had a solution of its own to the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a problem that has vexed policy makers for many years. In our judgment, it has been characterised by scandalous neglect on the part of the Government, principally because of a reluctance to come to terms with the hard issues-that very many people had been unemployed for years and that something more needed to be done about them than having periodic reviews. It is interesting to note that the mythology still abounds, because only a week or two back in this chamber during Question Time the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, not only got it wrong in terms of the new government structure-he thought it depended on how old one was-but also thought that the majority of the long term unemployed were those in the age bracket of 50 years or over. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that Senator Richardson, having gone away and reflected on his off-the-cuff remarks, now acknowledges that the statistics make it painfully obvious that more than two-thirds of the long term unemployed are aged 45 years or younger. Clearly there is a great deal of scope for putting in place a proper incentive structure that would encourage very many of the longer term unemployed to re-enter the work force or to rethink their options and to undertake the training that people on both sides of the chamber recognise is necessary to properly equip those who have been out of the work force for a substantial time. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at a proposal that will save only about $21m, it is fairly clear that the Government simply is not serious in its alternative approach. It can usefully be said that the dichotomy which the Government seeks to draw is false. There is no particular reason why we need to talk in terms of Job Search allowance for the first 12 months and of Newstart thereafter. We are really talking about increased training for those who have been out of the work force for a longer period of time. If that is the case, we do not need to come up with these sorts of cute gimmicks which somehow suggest that there is a new two-track approach which will replace the old system and that this will give us the way to dramatically reduce the numbers of those on the unemployment lists. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that, the longer a person is out of the work force, the more training and encouragement he or she is likely to need. There is no particular magic about the 12-month cut-off period. In fact, waiting for 12 months before embarking on an intensive phase may well be leaving it far too late. In my experience, it is analogous to delays that one can experience in the courts in personal injuries actions where it takes two or three years to prepare the case for trial, there is an endless round of visits to doctors and lawyers, and endless pensions, all of which tend to reinforce the victim in the notion that somehow there is no great economic disincentive in staying out of the work force and that there is a pot of gold that can be picked up in due course-all the signals are in the wrong direction. By the time people get to court, they find that psychiatrists are saying, `There may well be a significant functional overlay but we do not believe it will disappear once the litigation is concluded'. By now those people will be locked into a mindset which will make it very difficult to get them to come to terms with the true level of physical disability and to have a positive approach to re-entering the work force. The same can be said about the 12-month cut-off period. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways we need to act pretty intensively from a very early point in time. That is to be done either by training or by economic incentives. Yet the Government's proposal does neither. It simply has an arbitrary cut-off point of 12 months and thereafter pretends that somehow we need a new scheme. Well, we do not need a new scheme; we simply need to be upgrading the level of training, depending upon the difficulties confronted by the individual unemployed person. Therefore, it is fairly clear that, despite the rhetoric, this was no more than a crude pre-election bid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating), on 21 January when the Government's new proposal was unveiled, described it in very high rhetoric:</PARA>
<PARA>Our is a constructive and mature approach to help people back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet on the following day, when asked what he would do to those people on benefits after the initial 12-month period, he said in his inimitable, compassionate style that he would simply `bump them off'. </PARA>
<PARA> We still do not have any realistic idea from the Government as to how many people will be moved off benefits under this new scheme. Indeed, it will not even begin to operate until July 1991-17 months after the announcement. One can only imagine that that is because, firstly, the Government needs to cobble together a lot more detail than it was able to trot out during the election campaign and, secondly, the Government is hoping that it will be able to defer any significant expenditure on training schemes and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government was fair dinkum about the need for a dramatic overhaul, which is what this legislation purports to be, one would have thought that there was absolutely no good reason at all why the matter could not have been properly addressed-not during the heat of the campaign-with an early start-up date. Instead, we had a quick off-the-cuff announcement of a dramatic overhaul and then 17 months to think about it. One can only deduce from that that there will be a substantial period of rethinking during that time. It may well be that the Government will try to dress up in another form the fundamental policy approach which the Opposition announced late last year and which was very much welcomed by a great bulk of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that these changes in the Bill deal with some relatively minor adjustments, they are welcomed. But they really are not the main game. The main game is yet to be properly unveiled and we should not take seriously what the Government put forward during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal briefly with quite a number of initiatives in the Bill. One matter of concern in the area of long term unemployed that is worth dealing with is that in early 1989 the Department of Employment, Education and Training released figures showing that, out of the 10,000 long term unemployed who were part of the initial Newstart program, on the basis of one letter of advice to attend a departmental interview with DEET, 30 per cent had advised that within two weeks they had obtained employment. We simply do not know how many overall are in employment and receiving benefits when they ought not to be entitled to them. Yet the Government has just furiously ducked for cover on this issue. We have not had any satisfactory explanation as to whether there were significant mistakes made, whether people simply did not get letters when they ought to, whether it was a failure of Australia Post, whether people have subsequently been reinstated, or what the true outcome of that pilot project was. I would have thought that the time was long overdue for the Government to come clean on the issue and to release a measured response to that project, instead of, as I suspect, it being taken seriously in private but discounted heavily in public. </PARA>
<PARA> As many people suspect, the reality is that there is still quite a high level of abuse in the system. I say that not in any way to downplay the real demands of the genuine unemployed. To the extent to which there are people who are rorting the system, the capacity of the Government to cater for the needs of those in need of additional welfare is diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we all ought to take these matters much more seriously than we do instead of somehow pretending that the problems do not exist because in the course of doing something some interest groups might be offended. Generally, the Government has taken the course of least resistance in this area. As a result, it can accept a large proportion of the blame for the welfare system in this country attracting the odium that it does in many quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with a number of relatively minor and unrelated matters, such as ensuring that Austrian Government restitution payments for Nazi persecution during World War II are not treated as income under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. We support that change. It also implements a social security agreement with Spain. Again, there is no reason to regard that as controversial. It allows for back payment of family allowance and family allowance supplement for multiple births despite late lodgment of application. Again, that seems to be a desirable change. </PARA>
<PARA> It also provides for the payment at a double rate of the first week's payment for victims of natural disasters. Undoubtedly, that is a worthy initiative as far as it goes, but I am not sure that it does much more than dabble with the problem. Clearly, there will be people in this category from time to time, and I think that a one-off payment of this small size will not really make a great deal of difference other than allowing the Government to claim that somehow it has done something in the area. We deserve to be told what the needs of victims of natural disasters are likely to be in that initial phase, what other emergency arrangements ought to be made and, generally, how the Government proposes to cope in the future in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> But the most significant matter that seems to be causing the most angst in the community is the proposal to limit the payment overseas of the wife's pension and class B widow's pension to a maximum of 12 months. I want to deal in some detail with that proposal. As at September 1989 there were some 26,661 persons resident overseas in receipt of a range of pensions and benefits. Of those, over 27 per cent are resident in Greece, 15.5 per cent in Italy, 15.7 per cent in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 12.2 per cent in Yugoslavia and 4.2 per cent in Turkey. Greece and Turkey have been the cause of most community concern. Indeed, they are the two countries with which Australia has very longstanding and, in a number of significant respects, outdated bilateral agreements and treaties which will need to be updated. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, I take the view that we do not have nearly enough information on the record to know precisely what is going to be renegotiated and what is the justification for Senator Richardson's taking himself off to those climes in the relatively near future. There is a lot more to be said by the Minister before the public can be satisfied that it is necessary for him to swan off and put his name to a couple of agreements. Certainly, the two communities in question are very concerned that there ought to be substantial consultation before any reciprocal pension agreements are signed. As recently as last week, they took the view that to date that certainly had not even started. They also feel very strongly that genuine, open community consultations ought to be carried out by the Government on this vital issue prior to any final decision and implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that this Bill has been brought on, in a sense, prematurely. When it could have been put down the agenda for a day or two, it has been brought forward despite the fact that the Greek community are in the process of arranging a meeting in Melbourne this coming Sunday. There was a meeting of quite a large number of community organisations, I think nine in all, representing various sections of the Greek community, which they expressed their very widespread concern about the proposals. There have been a number of requests, almost pleas, to defer the legislation until a number of matters have been clarified. Yet we find that the matter is being dealt with sooner rather than later. That seems to me to be a breach of faith with these communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Wives' pensions, both for wives of invalid and age pensioners, and class B widows' pensions vary as a proportion of the total, but, relatively speaking, they represent about 30 per cent of the total of pensions paid to those five principal countries that I have mentioned. In respect of wives' pensions, the Government proposes that it will be able to save $2.4m in the 1991 financial year and $12.6m in the following year, presumably on the basis that once the 12-month period has expired very large numbers of pensioners will drop off the entitlements list. The same range of figures applies in relation to class B widows. It is foreshadowed that $2.2m will be saved in the 1991 financial year; thereafter, $11.5m will be saved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an expectation that a very significant sum of money will be saved after the first year although, in the overall context, wives' pensions currently cost about $747m, which is being paid to almost 200,000 wives of age and invalid pensioners. Class B widows' pensions cost the Government about $565m for 81,000-odd beneficiaries. In some scheme of the total figure, the amounts that are proposed to be saved by these overseas cutbacks verge on the minuscule. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why we have to look very seriously at the rationale behind these proposals. I can understand the class B widow's pension being brought into line with the sole parent pension, which has already been cut off after 12 months overseas. I can understand the desire of the Government to encourage those persons to re-enter the work force, although when they go overseas there is very little opportunity to monitor and, therefore, check on any abuse either in terms of not declaring employment or not bothering to seek out employment. But I do not think the same can be said in relation to wives' pensions. It seems that the Government is saying, `If you intend to live overseas permanently'-presumably that is what the 12 months cut-off period is all about-`you will miss out'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of humbug in the proposition that somehow one can come back after 12 months and requalify. My understanding is that one would not have to satisfy any test to do that. One would simply have to come back and prove that one was the spouse of an age or invalid pensioner. That is not something for which temporary residence in Australia would be needed. Even if one simply came back, spent the air fare, established one's claim and went away again, presumably, one would be entitled to another 12 months of pension receipt. I think that is humbug. </PARA>
<PARA> It is really a Budget measure under the guise of formulating some elaborate method of requalifying. If the Government has in mind that those living overseas ought not to be entitled to a pension, it ought to have the courage of its convictions to come out and say so. But it seems to me that, if that is the real rationale, that is discrimination on the grounds of residence and, some would say, gender because, obviously, it will affect only wives. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I think it is a matter of considerable significance. The view that if one is outside the country one ought not to be entitled to a pension even though one might have been in the work force for many years, does not strike me as equitable. If the Government's real agenda is to cut back on wives' pensions altogether, we ought to hear about that. If this is not the case and the Government is prepared to go on spending 98 per cent or more, probably 99 per cent, on residents, there seems to be a clear case of discrimination against non-residents. One is left with a very strong suspicion that the Government, particularly Senator Richardson given his prime areas of expertise, is very cognisant of the fact that these people are non-voters and, therefore, are not part of a constituency that needs to be pandered to in the way that Senator Richardson, no doubt, will endeavour to do with a number of other client groups. </PARA>
<PARA> We express a great deal of concern about these matters. We do not understand why the Government needs to take the blind or blunt approach that it is taking. It has been suggested to me that there might be wives who automatically qualify as spouses of pensioners even though they might never have lived in the country. To the extent that that is possible, it would strike me that they probably have a very low level of entitlement. Conversely, the Government might find that there are wives who have been in this country for many years, have been active in the work force, and have paid their taxes and could, if they continued to reside in Australia, continue to receive that pension. Therefore, I wonder why-I would be interested in an explanation from the Minister in due course-there could not be some cut-off period, such as 10 years, so that if a person had been resident in the country for a substantial period then he ought to be entitled to continue to receive that pension even though he might choose to spend the rest of his life overseas. In many ways that person is probably putting less strain on community resources if he is outside the country rather than inside the country. Therefore, it does smack very much of a budgetary measure designed somehow to cut back wherever possible. I think that the Greek and Turkish communities in particular, and the ethnic communities in general, are entitled to a much fuller and franker explanation than they have had to date in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> This is clearly a Budget measure. It was explicitly foreshadowed in the February statement. To that extent, I think that the Government has a clear mandate for these proposals and we do not propose, therefore, to oppose them, for that reason. But we do believe that the Government does owe an explanation to the migrant communities and that it ought to have consulted much more and earlier than it has. The determination to push this issue through now smacks very much of Senator Richardson's recent election to the Expenditure Review Committee and a desire to be able to show that he has already achieved a certain level of savings which might then be able to be squandered elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to save about $75m in 1991-92 and $122m in the following financial year. Clearly, that is a measure of quite some financial significance in budgetary terms. For that reason alone, in line with our approach to Budget Bills and expenditure measures, we would not be seeking to hold the legislation up at this stage. We certainly believe that there is ample scope for an explanation about these measures on their face insofar as they affect people who have been in receipt of these benefits for a number of years. If they are suddenly to cut out after a period of 12 months, clearly that would seem to be a retrospective measure and I think, again, those persons are entitled to an explanation as to why they should suddenly be disqualified. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have made it clear that the Opposition does not wish to condone any efforts on the part of those who are abusing the system; and neither do the ethnic communities which have displayed a measure of responsibility in this area and, through their spokespersons, are very anxious to ensure that only the genuinely deserving continue to benefit from the social security system. But I think that they are the overwhelming proportion. There is undoubtedly some anecdotal evidence around which reinforces people's prejudices, but the community is entitled to have a government make its decision on the basis of fact. I think we ought to be entitled to much more detail than we have to date. For example, the Government ought to address the numbers of persons that we are dealing with-some 26,000-odd-and explain simply what proportion it believes are currently rorting the system to any, and what, extent. If they are not, then we are entitled to know why there is going to be this discrimination on the ground of non-residence. Until the Government comes up with those answers, I think the ethnic communities and the community at large will continue to believe that this is a measure driven very much by Budget expedience and by a recognition that these people do not have voting rights in this country and that, therefore, their claim on government support systems will be reduced accordingly. We do not regard that as equity in any sense. The Ecumenical Migration Centre takes a similar view. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> These measures are particularly heartless and expose the government's access and equity policies as nothing more than misleading rhetoric. They are particularly discriminatory when compared with the government's much vaunted concern for Australian born age pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a lot of strength to that proposition. Unless the Government is able to refute it in a much more detailed and coherent manner than it has done to date, then that belief will persist in the community. I think it is incumbent upon the Minister to explain these measures in a lot more detail than he has to date, to explain what he hopes to achieve by the renegotiation of those bilateral treaties, and to justify why he needs to wander off to the Mediterranean in the not too distant future. Until we have those sorts of explanations, then I think we will be very much of the view that this Government's commitment to the genuinely needy will be overwhelmed by extraneous issues and that its commitment to a proper functioning system of social security in this country will be dominated much more by rhetoric than a serious attempt to grapple with the very difficult policy issues which underlie the present system. Therefore, I think that we do have a very good opportunity in the course of this debate to have a number of these issues put on the table for the first time by an incoming Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the social security regulations are based on a number of false assumptions. Some of these are: that there are plenty of jobs out there just waiting for young people to apply for them; that basically all young people are lazy and uninterested, are not willing to work, and need some sort of punitive so-called incentives to get them out there working; that young unemployed can live more cheaply than older unemployed; that by tightening and further complicating the bureaucratic maze, young people will be more anxious to get a job; that small business, traditionally a large employer of young people, is thriving; that there are sufficient and appropriate places for young people in education and training; and that all families are willing and able to support their young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will start with the first assumption; that is, the erroneous belief that there are plenty of jobs out there for these young people. Unemployment statistics and job vacancy figures show otherwise. Last year 46.8 per cent of unemployed females and 39.9 per cent of males were under the age of 25. In South Australia alone there are 30,000 young people looking for fewer and fewer jobs. Given the current ratio of unemployed to job vacancies, it is inevitable that many young people will be rejected time and time again, and many do simply give up and drop off the statistics table. There is simply not a job for every young unemployed person; in fact, in January this year an average of one job was available for every eight young people seeking it. In some country areas in South Australia those figures are much higher. For example, in the outer western suburbs of Sydney it is almost impossible for young people to find regular work. In the next few months, even if the landing which we are supposedly going to be experiencing economically is soft, unemployment will certainly rise and the capacity to find work will be much reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look at some facts on the fundamental changes that have occurred in the labour market. This quote comes from a report written in 1988 on the young homeless allowance:</PARA>
<PARA> In the decade after 1974 youth unemployment rose from 5.8% to 23.3%, teenagers holding full-time positions declined by 196,000-the number of part-time positions increased by 129,700. It is major economic changes, including structural changes that have occurred in industries throughout Australia since the 70s, that have resulted in youth unemployment. More recent figures show that . . . </PARA>
<PARA>these are between 1983 and 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>full-time jobs for 15 to 18 year olds have decreased by 70,000, while in the last decade casual part-time jobs have more than doubled. In addition to the casualisation of the youth labour market, many of the types of jobs in the past filled by young people no longer exist. Specifically, unskilled and semi-skilled jobs at the bottom rung of heavy industry, retail and offices. </PARA>
<PARA>I will move on to the second assumption that is being made by the Government: that basically all young people are lazy, uninterested and not willing to work. This certainly has not been my experience as a teacher for the last 20 years before coming into this place. Yes, there is a small minority out there-just as, I think, we would find in any professional group in any section of the labour market-that is not particularly keen on doing anything at all. But this is a very small minority. I would argue that most of these unemployed have been long weeded out from the benefit lists after the crackdowns that have already been initiated by government. No research I could find shows that there is a vast number of young people not really keen on getting a job. They are deterred and they do give up after their continual efforts to find work are not successful, but these young people generally drop out, and off the unemployment lists. </PARA>
<PARA> This assumption, which is a popular myth in the community at large, places even greater stress on those unable to find work. I believe that it is the job of government, indeed the job of all of us here, to go out and publicise the facts and to support these young people who are unable to find work. In the February edition of Youth Studies, Christelle Withers-Mayne, in an article entitled `Responses to Unemployment', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Most writers agree that unemployment is a detrimental exercise for the majority of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA>She then goes on to quote a series of studies:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been found, for example, that the unemployed are more depressed and anxious (Feather 1982), have lower self-esteem (Harris 1980), have poorer psychological well-being (Hepworth 1980), poorer physical health and more life stress (Gore 1978 . . . ), a higher incidence of mental health problems (Donnovan and Oddy 1982), higher levels of apathy (Feather 1982), and that these are reflected in more negative body image and depressed appearance (Jahoda 1982). </PARA>
<PARA>The failure of politicians to stand up and support these teenagers further adds to this stress. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the third false assumption-that is, that young people can somehow live more cheaply than the older unemployed. Young people living independently have the same general food, clothing, transport and accommodation costs as adults. Those who have no support from parents may be in a precarious financial situation. The lowering of the unemployment benefit to the Austudy level means that unemployed young people are being pushed further below the poverty line-the poverty line being $142 a week as of December last year. The Australian Democrats believe that this is unjust and that in this case the Government should have brought Austudy benefits up to at least unemployment benefit levels. In fact, the Government should be paying living costs to these young students, keeping in mind that a highly skilled and educated work force will return considerably more revenue to the Government through higher taxes in the long term, as well as greatly assisting this nation economically. </PARA>
<PARA> Any person, young or adult, who is denied adequate income suffers damage to his or her self-esteem as well as to his or her image in the community. It is a blinkered approach to say that people can rely on their families. In many cases, young people live with their families in grossly inadequate conditions because their families are unwilling or unable to offer more support. Again, I quote from the report on the youth homeless allowance and youth in severe economic hardship:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the experience of the youth housing field that large numbers of homeless young people leave home and are unable to return as a direct result of the families' low-income . . . particularly those hit by unemployment, face independence of their teenage dependants as a necessity, not a luxury or absolution of responsibility. Significant changes in the labour market, including the disappearance of full-time teenage jobs and the rise in youth unemployment, have resulted in the prolonged dependancy of working class young people. For many low-income families, including single parents, this additional financial strain is unsustainable. In addition, it is frequently the case that the housing requirements of low-income families are not being adequately met. For many, an issue as basic as over-crowding, results in the necessity of the young person to leave home. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are no `junior' rents, no `junior' utility charges and no `junior' food bills, I noted that Monday's Adelaide Advertiser stated that there has been an increase of some 15 per cent in rents on flats. The average rent for a flat is now more than the allowance young people are able to obtain. I understand that in Melbourne there has been an increase of some 7.1 per cent-a rise of $5 to $10 a week. This is at a time when the Government is reducing benefits to young people. The Democrats ask where the justice is in that. As for a young married couple not needing as much as an older married couple, I would argue to the contrary: at least the older couple has had the opportunity to set themselves up with the basic essentials, such as bedding and kitchen utensils. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the fourth assumption-that is, that the bureaucratic maze now being further complicated, will encourage these young people to get a job. The taxation Act and Social Security Act are always before the Parliament. We debate these two areas of government administration more regularly than any others. Both have a considerable consumer base for the Government as an administration. Yet we adopt quite different administrative principles to both of these consumer bases. In taxation there is a continuing awareness of the need to simplify the Act and adopt broad principles and simple administrative guidelines. Yet in the Social Security Act there appears to be the quite opposite approach-a certain bloody-mindedness, if you like, that sees this Parliament inserting more and more its, buts and maybes which impact on the client base. I wonder how many honourable senators would pass the test if their continued income was dependent on replying to letters within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the difference in attitude lies in the simple fact that there are a raft of non-government professionals who are paid to interact with the tax Act by the client base. As a client base served by the Social Security Act generally has no money, there is not an extensive half-way house group of professionals between the Department and the client base. It is a wholly one-sided affair. I wonder how many honourable senators would get through the tax Act without their accountants. Rather than encourage the young to get a job, this burden will alienate them further and will encourage more and more to fall through the net and end up on the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, we look at where these jobs will come from, particularly those in small business as small business is not thriving. Small business has been a traditional employer of many school leavers. But, as was detailed last week in this place, very many small businesses are not in a position, owing to the current economic climate, to offer a large number of jobs to young people. Also, the work which is available now is frequently only part time and/or temporary. Although job growth has occurred in some parts of the economy, it is declining within sectors which traditionally employ teenagers. The general consensus seems to be that it will be a very hard year for undercapitalised small businesses in particular due to a reduction in domestic demand as Government policy begins to have an effect on consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth assumption is that there are sufficient, and appropriate, places in education and training. An article in Monday's Age shows that higher education in Australia continues to be the preserve of the nation's elite, according to a survey of students enrolling at Monash University. The offspring of top social groups are six times more likely to enrol than their schoolmates from working class homes. The segregation of the already privileged on campus remains as distorted as it has been for the last 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Already there is a considerable amount of hidden unemployment within the education system, particularly in state high schools throughout the country. More and more young people are staying on, but if a job was available, they would be gone tomorrow. Disruption and disinclination are common in many school classrooms as the underfunded education system is asked to cater for these teenagers. Additional funding for appropriate courses and appropriate counselling and support services are urgently required in all States; rather than punitive measures such as we see before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> The final assumption is that families are willing and able to support their young people. I quote two different statements in the Burdekin report Our Homeless Youth which sum up the situation well-firstly:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that youth unemployment is concentrated disproportionately among young people from poorer backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA>The class concentration of unemployment means that a family is often multi-disadvantaged, undermining its capacity to assist unemployed children. Often one or two parents are on a benefit or a very low wage or intermittently employed. </PARA>
<PARA>In a study conducted in the mid-1980s, it was found that unemployment rates were much higher among teenagers of sole parent families than among other teenagers and that this was attributable mainly to their low family incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, from chapter 9:</PARA>
<PARA> Family relationships also suffered:</PARA>
<PARA>the adults in the study experienced `stress created by the constant struggle to make ends meet' which `took a heavy toll on the quality of family life and relationships'; marriages were `strained to breaking point' and `relationships with children were also damaged'. While it is now generally accepted that parents of small children require community support provided in the form of child care etc.), there is little recognition that such support is needed by families with adolescent children. Sole parent families in particular need such support. </PARA>
<PARA> One recent study linked current economic trends to family conflict stating that high youth unemployment, along with the tendency for children to stay at school longer, means that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while maturing earlier than ever before, [children] are now often dependent on their parents for longer than used to be the case, creating another source of potential tension in family relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>Other studies show that access to income, housing and unemployment are directly influenced by class, gender and ethnic background. Many of these young people have all the cards stacked against them, and homelessness is often the result. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to what the Democrats believe will occur if these amendments are passed. As the only thing that really seems to matter to the Government in the current climate is money, I will first speak in purely economic terms. The results of this callous action by the Government, supported by the Liberal and National parties-in fact, given half a chance, they would increase the pressures further-will in the long term be a cost to all Australians. For example, statistics could be used to show that as the young become increasingly alienated, and as they find it impossible to feed and clothe themselves, petty crime such as shoplifting and car theft will increase. They will not starve. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are no formal studies, Dr Paul Wilson, Assistant Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology, gives as his extremely well-educated opinion the expectation that a lowering of the unemployment benefit for young people will lead to a higher crime rate, particularly in petty crime. The Retail Traders Association in South Australia estimates the annual loss to shoplifting now at a conservative $70m. So we can expect that amount to rise. A witness to the inquiry on youth homelessness stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Basically, if young people have not got any form of income you get things like housebreaks, cars being taken, stuff being taken out of cars, things as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA>Kate Hannaford, who is a South Australian currently on a Churchill scholarship in the United Kingdom looking at the victims of crime and how Britain deals with its young offenders, says that street violence is strongly linked to unemployment and that Britain believes it will get worse as the country slides deeper into recession and more jobs disappear. An increasing number of youths now have no jobs. Many are confronting the reality that they may never get one. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of homelessness, if the Government persists with its present policy of inadequate income support, the long-term results will be that growing numbers of young people will find themselves on the streets, and the cost of housing and looking after and caring for these young people will far outweigh any savings. The Burdekin report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Inadequate incomes are forcing young people into intolerable living conditions and leaving them exposed to ill-health, abuse, exploitation and often death, either on the streets if they decide to leave home regardless or are evicted, or in abusive families if they decide to stay in the family home.</PARA>
<PARA>One witness to the inquiry stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Without adequate income, young people have no choice regarding their housing and consequently are forced to remain in intolerable living situations where they are subject to family conflict and domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the recommendations of the inquiry was that the total benefit paid to a homeless young person be equivalent to the adult unemployment benefit. If we do not allow young people an adequate amount to feed and shelter themselves we will surely ultimately be paying. Whether the amount is for a night in hospital, gaol or a psychiatric institution, we will be paying a lot more than the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The social cost is incalculable. The ultimate expression of disenchantment may well be suicide, and the rate of suicide among our young people is unacceptably high. On the question of increased disenchantment, the O'Keefe report, a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, raised a number of concerns about the accessibility of social security. The harsh measures of the last three years have led to a different culture and an unpleasant attitude in regional areas. Clients are now fearful, in some cases almost to the point of being paranoid, about having to continually confront staff; and staff attitudes have undergone a change as staff themselves are placed under greater pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment beneficiaries and sole parents are seen as second-class citizens in the realm of social security. They have been targeted quite unfairly and it smacks of government by opinion poll. The recent $2 increase did not flow on to unemployment beneficiaries, which means that the gap between the single over 21 pension and the single unemployment benefit is now $11.80-not much less than at the end of the Fraser years-which flies in the face of the Government's commitment to remove the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has no carrots but lots of sticks. The sticks hit wide of the mark. Increased penalties for non-compliance with departmental rules will simply not address this problem. The Government would do well to increase its emotional support services dramatically to overcome these problems, letting social workers do what they were trained for rather than writing forms and double-checking everything. `I'd like to help you but I can't' seems to be quite common. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the amendments to this Bill will result in a social cost to the community which will be immeasurable in two senses. First, it will be devastating on the families and individuals directly concerned and on the families that they will have in generations to come; and, secondly, it will be felt widely. Perhaps then, at last, if it is felt so widely in the community, people will be able to see the need for us to support our young. </PARA>

<PARA> This morning the Prime Minister referred to the campaign by the IRA against innocent people, whether British citizens or not, and condemned it without qualification. He went on to say that the position of this Government in respect of the situation in Northern Ireland had been made consistently clear. It is in line with that of the Irish Government.

That is the view of the Irish Government and, of course, it is the view of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that governments hold that view does not any way lessen the tragedy which has occurred in Holland in respect of the two Australians who were killed and those others who were injured although, as I understand it, not seriously.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Treasurer to the fact that today's official statistics show that the March quarter provided the third consecutive quarterly decline in new capital expenditure in Australia, that the major factor in this was a 10 per cent seasonally adjusted fall in new equipment, that forecasts for the current financial year are already significantly lower than those derived from the December 1989 survey, and that the forecast for the next year is a decline of 4 per cent. How is Australia going to trade itself out of this economic crisis by increasing its exports if this Government's economic policies, particularly massively high interest rates, continue to discourage new business investment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to comment on the investment figures which were released today and I will do so in a moment. These figures come out one by one, day by day, series by series. If Senator Watson had looked at the figures published earlier this week they would have indicated to him that, on the basis of the investment which took place in calendar years 1988 and 1989 particularly, there has been a 10 per cent increase in the productive capacity in this country following those investment figures. That must be regarded as good news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one goes to the figures which Senator Watson refers to, it is true that there was an investment decline of 4.3 per cent in the March quarter in real terms which followed a 4 per cent decline in the December quarter. That was not entirely unanticipated by the Government. In fact, the Treasurer, other Ministers and I have made comments indicating that that was to some extent anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the data is not all negative, as the Opposition might wish to imply. For example, manufacturing investment was little changed over the March quarter from the record level in the previous quarter, and that is encouraging. Manufacturing investment expectations for the June quarter are still healthy. There is some increase expected and, even with the recent decline, investment as a share of gross domestic product will be well above 12 per cent compared with the average of the last five or so years of about 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The growth in investment over the last few years has also been encouraging. It is considerably higher than the very low growth rates in investment experienced during the 1970s when, as I recall, the figure was about 2.8 per cent a year.</PARA>
<PARA> The declines in the March quarter figures and, indeed, the December quarter figures are from a very high base. As the Treasurer and other Ministers have said on a number of occasions, that base in the last two calendar years was at an unsustainable level if one looked at the impact on the current account deficit of the imports of capital equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Watson well knows, monetary policy and fiscal policy were designed to decrease domestic demand, one component of which is, of course, investment. As I said a minute ago, that does not mean that that slowdown in investment is undermining the economy's capacity to produce more for both the domestic and export markets. As I said earlier, the growth in productive capacity as a result of that recent investment boom has been in the order of 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the increased capital stock over the last two years and the slowdown in investment resulting from monetary and fiscal policy can, I believe, be seen in recent trending improvements in the current account deficit which was referred to at Question Time yesterday.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question is topical because of the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) meeting of transport Ministers that was held in Perth last Friday. When the Inter-state Commission brought down its report on efficiency gains that were possible on the waterfront in Australia, it stressed that the productivity increases that were available on the waterfront were as great in that area under the control of State governments-that is, port authorities-as were the productivity gains that were available by any initiatives that the Commonwealth may introduce. Port authorities employ around 8,500 employees in Australia, which is about the equivalent of the number employed on the waterfront, and the revenues, approaching $1 billion a year, are also equivalent to the revenues generated by the waterfront itself. It is absolutely essential that if real productivity increases are to be gained across the whole area of the waterfront the cooperation of the States is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission in fact identified the areas where port authorities needed to apply some changes. They were establishing appropriate corporate charters for port authorities with full public accountability requirements, setting port authorities appropriate financial targets, ensuring that port authority boards had a high level of business management expertise, making port authorities more responsive to user requirements and making port authority pricing more closely related to costs. It has been evident in recent times that a number of the larger port authorities in Australia, principally at the ports of Melbourne and Sydney, are moving to do this.</PARA>
<PARA> All State and Commonwealth Ministers agreed last August to pursue these reform goals. Last Friday in Perth at the meeting of ATAC there was a detailed review of progress to date. It was a very amicable and positive discussion across the board with all of the Ministers, and the Ministers agreed that waterfront reform-that is, at the port authority level-will now become a standing agenda item at ATAC meetings, obliging the States to report progress in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> The State Ministers agree to develop and publicise their plans for port progress and timetables for reform of the port authorities in line with the Inter-State Commission's recommendations. The Ministers also agreed that a working party of officials convened by the Commonwealth will develop port performance indicators to make the reports to ATAC meaningful and examine other issues associated with achieving more competitive commercial environments in the ports. This working party, which will be convened by the Commonwealth as soon as possible, will include, by agreement, officers from the Commonwealth Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. State Ministers also supported the proposals being developed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) for union amalgamation in the waterfront and shipping sectors. The agreements reached in Perth last Friday are an important step towards the development of more efficient labour arrangements in the maritime industry.</PARA>

What happened was that an Ansett B737 jet was cleared to descend to 23,000 feet and go into a holding pattern at Eildon Weir near Melbourne. A 767 jet, also an Ansett aircraft, was at 22,000 feet also in a holding pattern and considerably below both of those aircraft was an Australian Airlines jet in a holding pattern at 17,000 feet over Eildon Weir. I simply state that to demonstrate that, in fact, this incident involved only two aircraft and not the third, as there was a distance of 4,000 feet between the 737 jet when it finally did descend and the Australian Airlines jet, which was not involved in the incident at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happened was that the aircraft did in fact descend to 21,000 feet. It descended below the level that it was cleared to descend to by air traffic control, therefore warranting the action taken against the crew. It was in full visual contact with the Ansett 767, and the pilots of the 737 had it in sight at all times. Perhaps it was the sight of that aircraft that alerted them to the fact that they had descended below the approved height. But at no point in time were the two aircraft anywhere near 900 metres apart. In fact, at no stage was there a breakdown in the separation of the two aircraft. The third aircraft, as I say, at 17,000 feet, was not involved in the incident at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume that this question was not asked yesterday because of incompetence. I assume that it was only the headline in today's Australian Financial Review pointing it out that provoked Senator Alston to ask the question. A picture had to be drawn for him. The Government will be introducing legislation into the Parliament which will set an absolute limit on foreign ownership in Australian licensee television channels at 20 per cent. The Government believes that it is vital that Australia's radio and television stations are owned and controlled by Australians. Therefore, the question of equity is very important in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of non-voting shares or quasi-equity, non-voting shares are shareholding interests for the purpose of ownership and control under the Broadcasting Act. They will be included when calculating the aggregate level of foreign investment in any Australian broadcaster. That is the situation with the current Act and the amending Bill will not change that. Quasi-equity, that is, convertible securities, are loans which give a right of conversion to a shareholding interest on predetermined conditions. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 will delete that requirement for approval of loan interests because they would not normally confer control, unless, however, the option to convert them into shares is exercised. If that option is exercised, it will come under the provisions of the Act, preventing that shareholding to be beyond 20 per cent. The Act bans foreign control of Australian broadcasters. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has the power to investigate any arrangement, including loan agreements, that is, convertible securities, which changes the actual control of an Australian broadcaster.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of that question is yes, it did, over three years from 1982 to 1984. It had access to coroners' reports and findings in terms of fatalities at work in order to carry out its study. It found, depressingly, that 1,738 work-related deaths had occurred in that period. Of those, 1,544 were in the civilian labour force, and of those 1,278, or 83 per cent, occurred during working hours; 266 occurred when going to or from work. Fifty-two were either in the armed forces or in the category under the age of 15 years. Eighty-seven were during unpaid domestic or community work, including voluntary firefighting, and 48 bystanders died in work-related accidents in that period, mostly on farms or in rural communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other significant findings of the survey were that mining and quarrying workers were nearly nine times more likely to be killed at work than other workers. They had 70 deaths per 100,000 employees per year in their industry. That contrasts with the next worst category, transport, where 38 workers per 100,000 employees per year died, and the rural industries category where 22 workers per 100,000 employees per year died. The rural category includes forestry, which is also a very dangerous occupation.</PARA>
<PARA> Many of these problems can be addressed only be cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States. That issue was canvassed at some length last Friday in New Zealand at the Australian Ministers for Labour Advisory Council. I am confident that there will be much greater attention to lowering the level of work-related fatalities as a consequence of some measures put in place there.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has as well undertaken several activities in its own right. This includes reconstituting the mining industry standing committee which has responsibility in this area and working with the Joint Coal Board in New South Wales and Queensland on epidemiological monitoring of the entire New South Wales coalmining work force and to detect and control work-related hazards.</PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, the Western Australian Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council is doing similar work. There is in place now a system of surveillance for work-related fatalities throughout the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew this matter would be of particular interest to Senator Collins as he comes from the Northern Territory. Senator Zakharov has had an abiding interest in Kakadu for a long time. Mimosa pigra has now overrun more than 750 square kilometres of wetlands in the Northern Territory since its introduction in the mid-1970s. This shows that it has a phenomenal potential to double the size of its infestation every year. Areas, once infested, become very different ecosystems from those which existed before. We now have a real problem right across the Northern Territory, and in Kakadu the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is now spending an awful lot of time and money in attempting, by hand, to halt the march of this weed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister announced during the election campaign and as stated in the Governor-General's Speech, we are now sitting down with the Government of the Northern Territory to look at a proposal for a joint strategy for halting the march of mimosa pigra. Under normal circumstances, weed control is a State, Territory or local government issue. But given the national significance of this one, I think it will require Commonwealth assistance and intervention.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that already mimosa pigra has had a serious effect on the Aboriginal way of life in a number of areas and on water resources generally. Its potential threat to primary production is probably greater than anything since prickly pear. We have already discussed with the Northern Territory Government program alternatives including the aerial release of herbicides, labour-intensive ground control, and research into effective chemical use in controlling mimosa and an accelerated research program into biological controls.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will be allocating $1.25m over the next three years so that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation can continue that research into biological controls. Hopefully that will produce some results. In the meantime, during the next year the Commonwealth will spend just on $1m in attempting to control mimosa pigra, mainly by some aerial application and utilisation of hand labour from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. We hope that the two-pronged attack of trying to hold mimosa pigra's march on the ground now and a three-year program to look at biological control might provide some answers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman has drawn attention to a position that has existed for a number of years regarding asbestos. It is most unsatisfactory. Whilst the problem is not strictly confined to the defence forces-it is a major problem in Canberra too-it is a specific concern in a variety of areas of the defence forces, but particularly in the Royal Australian Navy because of the way in which asbestos was used. It is also a problem in one of the training areas in Townsville, to which our attention was drawn one or two years ago. Action has been taken there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been calls for inquiries. Senator Newman may be confusing inquiries with studies. It will be essential that the defence forces study the problem. I reiterate the statement which Mr Bilney made on PM last Friday night that any servicemen and ex-servicemen who think that they may have been affected should, for heaven's sake, be checked now so that they can clear up in their own minds whether they have any health problems. At this stage, there is nothing to stop any studies into the problem. Minister Bilney will be looking at that. On the other hand, we have not yet seen a good enough reason for a general public inquiry at this stage. A study into the matter has not been ruled out. Following Senator Newman's question today, again I will draw the matter to Mr Bilney's attention. I might write to Senator Newman on it later this week if I hear of any decision from him.</PARA>

I thank the Minister for his answer, but I draw his attention to the fact that in my question I said that the Army `has not, is not and does not intend to conduct any studies into asbestos-related diseases because these have not been considered necessary'. In fact, that statement is a direct quotation from the Army's answer to a question I asked in the Senate Estimates Committee. Even if the risk is considered to be small, I am concerned about it and believe we should be trying urgently to identify the sufferers.

In light of the fact that last year the Australian Defence Force (ADF), apparently, was spending up to $1,200 on advertising to attract each new recruit in the Royal Australian Air Force, and a little less for recruits in the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army, I ask the Minister whether there has been an evaluation of this highly expensive advertising campaign given that there appears to be an equally expensive advertising campaign this year. Further, what is the point of all this advertising while there are continuing resignations from the ADF and it is likely that recommendations will be made that the size of the ADF be reduced and greater emphasis placed on the reserves. Finally, I ask the Minister whether the recent military displays, involving helicopters and hand-to-hand combat, at the Sydney Easter Show and the State of Origin match in Sydney, were part of a push to glamorise a career in the armed forces and whether the cost of this kind of display is being met by the taxpayer at a time when the ADF claims to be drastically short of money for day-to-day functioning and personnel needs?</PARA></TALK.START>

We recognise that recruiting for the Defence Force is getting more difficult. Therefore, we need to focus on how to do it better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole point of advertising is to attract recruits for both the regular and reserve elements of the Defence Force. That process is required because the Defence Force needs, on a 10-year average, some 8,000 new recruits each year for regular elements of the Defence Force. Recruit advertising tries to show the attractiveness of a career in the Defence Force. Whilst it does not shirk the warlike nature of the Services, it does not seek to glamorise war. Military displays such as that provided for the recent State of Origin match in Sydney simply show members of the Australian defence forces doing their jobs.

<PARA> The study found that children whose fathers were exposed to the highest levels of external radiation-either a total dose of 100 millisieverts, typically accumulated over six to seven years, or a dose of 10 millisieverts in the six months before conception-were six to eight times more likely to develop leukaemia than control cases. The currently internationally accepted limit for exposure of radiation workers is 50 millisierverts per year.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the outcome of the study is a matter of some controversy and discussion in the scientific community. It needs to be emphasised that further work needs to be done. The numbers involved in the Sellafield study were very small-just four cases with fathers who have received the high doses-and the evidence from the Japanese bomb survivors does not support the hypothesis linking paternal radiation dose to incidence of childhood leukaemia. Nevertheless, the Sellafield results are important and, if confirmed, would have a most important impact on radiation protection standards.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, along with the rest of the world, is already reviewing its radiation protection standards in the light of the current data on the radiation exposure suffered by, and the subsequent cancer incidence in, the atomic bomb survivors. The International Commission on Radiological Protection is revising the internationally accepted recommendations and the revision can be expected to involve a reduction to around 40 per cent of the current limits. When this revision is completed, the National Health and Medical Research Council will move quickly to change Australian standards. In the meantime, it has issued guidance drawing attention to the likely revision and reminding users of their responsibility to keep exposures as low as is reasonably achievable.</PARA>

I am quite sure that, in the light of the review of standards around the world, the National Health and Medical Research Council will move very quickly to ensure that adequate and sensible standards are promulgated in such a way that those involved in work in Australia which would expose them to radiation would be protected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has always taken a very consistently even-handed attitude to these almost irresolvable disputes in the Middle East. It is somewhat pleasing to see that the situation in Israel and the occupied territories has quietened somewhat from the violence of last week, but it would also be true to say that tensions remain very high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the United Nations Security Council in Geneva last Friday and Saturday, the Palestine Liberation Organisation Chairman, Yasser Arafat, suggested that it was time to have a UN fact-finding tour to Israel. The idea will continue to be discussed in New York today and probably tomorrow and some conclusion drawn.</PARA>
<PARA> It is our understanding that the Israeli Government is opposed to the idea of UN observers being permanently based in the occupied territory and might not even accept a fact-finding mission of the type discussed by the Security Council. The attitude of the Australian Government is that we want to encourage Israel to consider such suggestions positively as a means of reducing tension in the region. We will not be called upon actively, in the sense that we are not a member of the Security Council at the moment, and as such we would not expect to be involved in a fact-finding tour. But we did last October vote in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution on the occupied territories requesting the Security Council to consider measures needed to provide international protection to Palestinians in the territories, including Jerusalem.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in summary to Senator Hamer's question, there is a suggestion that there be a fact-finding tour by the United Nations in order to protect Palestinian rights.

However, the Premier of South Australia has recently raised the matter of this collection with the Prime Minister and has followed up with more details in a letter to my colleague Mrs Kelly. The Prime Minister has now asked that the question of providing financial assistance to South Australia for this purpose be reviewed by relevant Ministers. This review is currently in progress.

The Government is naturally concerned at the implications of any such decision. There have been a number of senior level exchanges between the Indonesian and Australian governments over the last three weeks on the issue of Cambodian boats. Most recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, has been in contact with his counterpart, Minister Alatas, on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government recognises Indonesia's excellent record in providing first asylum and the particular problems posed by the Cambodian boat arrivals, We believe it is in both Indonesia's and Australia's interests, and in the interests of the safety of the boat people themselves, to land boats from Cambodia which enter Indonesian waters. We also endorse accepted international practice for dealing with asylum claimants-namely, proper determination of their claims and return to the country of origin of those found not to be refugees.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling also asked about the integration of relevant authorities in order to meet any increase in activity adjacent to northern waters. There has been very close cooperation between Coastwatch, Customs, quarantine, defence and immigration authorities in the location, escort and processing of unauthorised boat arrivals from Cambodia.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the annual report 1988-89 on the operations of the registered health insurance organisations, I wish firstly to make the point that the majority of registered health insurance organisations operate their health funds on a non-profit basis. Any surpluses which the organisation accrues remain in the business and are used to benefit contributors. In this way the health insurance industry plays a vital role in ensuring the access of Australians to health care at a reasonable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a regrettable fact of life as we have come to know it under the Hawke Labor Government that our health care networks are facing an increasing state of chaos. Throughout the nation public hospitals have waiting lists which grow daily. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, promised in February of 1983 that nine out of 10 Australians would be better off under Medicare. How very wrong, once again, he has proven to be. The facts are that most people are far worse off. Waiting lists for public hospitals, which were once counted in the tens of thousands, are now calculated by the hundreds of thousands. Not a week goes by when we do not hear of public hospital beds closing, deficits and ever-increasing demands for rapidly diminishing resources. It is interesting to note that even the Prime Minister voted with his feet and trotted off to a private hospital for the small operation that he had recently. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, because Labor's health policies have discouraged private health insurance, private hospitals find themselves with empty beds, financial problems and, in most cases, the under-utilisation of their excellent facilities. This situation is a sad indictment of the Government and of the operation of the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA> The one per cent income tax Medicare levy was introduced in February 1984. In July of 1985, just 17 months after the scheme was first introduced, the Government saw fit to remove the Medicare levy limit, and in December of 1986 Mr Hawke broke his November 1984 election promise not to increase the Medicare levy, by raising it from one per cent to 1.25 per cent. The problem is that this ad hoc approach to health by the Government has served seriously to disadvantage an important component of our health care system-that of private health insurance. As a result, perhaps not at all surprisingly, some health insurance funds are facing a crisis which, if not resolved, threatens their future viability. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, 62 per cent of the population contributed to private health insurance funds. Today that number has dwindled to 45 per cent and continues to fall at the rate of around 2 per cent per annum. The point that the Federal Government has missed on this issue is that a drop of just one per cent in the number of contributors imposes on the State governments an additional $100m a year in hospital costs. If this trend continues at the present rate, by 1995 the additional cost to the Government will be $1 billion per annum and that figure does not take into account the rising costs caused by inflation. In other words, the Government's apparent failure to see the writing on the wall is destined to result in another huge bill being passed on to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> When this issue was examined from a practical point of view in my own State of Tasmania we found that over 20 per cent of public hospital beds are currently occupied by insured patients, generally because of a lack of understanding of Medicare and the lack of any financial alternative. Private hospitals have occupancy rates of 65 per cent while waiting lists in public hospitals grow longer. This is a tragic waste of resources and could have potentially fatal consequences for those awaiting urgent surgery. Even a smaller transfer of patients from the public to the private system would provide immediate benefits for taxpayers, the Government, and health care generally within this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite simply, the Government has turned its back on the private system at a time when it is more than capable of picking up some of the present surplus. A return of Commonwealth support for these funds would help to stem the loss of contributors by lowering contribution rates. As an example, an inflow of $400m from the Federal Government would reduce basic contributions by 25 per cent. I know that in Tasmania there has also been some discussion regarding the concept of giving very low priority to privately insured patients using public hospitals for certain specified procedures which could just as adequately be performed in private hospitals. There has also been consideration of the wisdom, or otherwise, of queue jumping by insured patients in private hospitals. In addition, the concept of charging a facility fee for specialists treating private patients in public hospitals is also being examined. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA> This report highlights the serious problems facing manufacturing industry in Australia. It is a report aimed at improving productivity in the manufacturing sector. Not to do so will see Australia's living standards decline. The manufacturing sector is a vital element in the Australian economy. A chilling reminder of its importance was provided in evidence to the Committee when we were told that all the `successful' economies were supported by strong and efficient manufacturing sectors. Unfortunately, relatively Australia is not one of those economies with a strong manufacturing base. Indeed, in 1988-89 Australia had a manufacturing trade deficit of $19.9 billion. In that year manufactured imports comprised 72 per cent of total imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Without wishing to sound too alarmist, it is imperative to lift productivity levels to the point where Australian manufacturers can compete on world markets or can produce goods which are a viable alternative within Australia to imported products. The Committee's findings are that this is possible. We have looked closely at the techniques employed by other successful manufacturing nations and set out the facts about the so-called `secrets' of their success in this report. I say so-called because they are not secrets at all. They are sensible management practices making the best use of technology but, more importantly, making the best use of human resources. It is this combination that is the secret to productivity increases. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry, Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA> In this report the Committee is promoting the concept of new management techniques. As defined in our report, the term covers the best use of technology combined with human resource practices that maximise skills, commitment and performance. Following extensive hearings and factory inspections it is disappointing to have to report that only a handful of companies in Australia have adopted such practices and could be termed `world-class'. More heartening is the fact that many companies are now recognising the need for improvement in their approach. It is the Committee's aim to increase that awareness and to ensure that they are able to obtain the assistance needed to change. For those companies who have not contemplated the need for change, I ask them to examine their staff turnover levels and rates of absenteeism for these are often direct indicators of poor management practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The report specifies a number of ways in which structures can be changed to create a greater feeling of common purpose among employees and employers alike. Common purpose will require a shared commitment to agreed corporate goals. This involvement, combined with responsibility for achievement, access to the latest technologies and training in their use, will lead to increased productivity and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> The report places a heavy emphasis on the issue of productivity. The argument is often advanced that through productivity increases Australian manufacturers will achieve greater export sales and hence turn around our balance of payments problems. This view is somewhat simplistic, as other factors such as distance from markets and the small size of Australia's domestic market will affect the level of exports. However, Australian firms need to increase productivity just to survive on the domestic market, particularly in competition with overseas imports. This issue is further complicated by the practices of other trading nations who provide various forms of assistance to their exporters. This is of great concern to Australian manufacturers as we move towards a freer trade position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware of this dilemma and the calls to tilt the playing field. We have not addressed that issue in this report but rather focused on the matters within the control of manufacturers. As set out in our report, the scope for improvement at the factory level is great. If improvements can be made at the micro level, they will also be felt in the national figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus for raising awareness is a series of conferences at national and State level aimed at developing an Australian model for new management techniques. The conferences will bring together manufacturers, industry experts, government agencies, peak bodies and others who are able to highlight action for change. The emphasis on selection of conference participants will initially be directed to those manufacturers and others who have already demonstrated a commitment to introducing new management techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to raising awareness of the matters discussed in the report, the conference will work on developing an Australian model for new management techniques. The conferences should also serve to emphasise the importance of the manufacturing sector to the Australian economy. The need for this recognition was a finding of the Committee's 1988 report Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation, and the Committee's approach in this report has been to focus on raising awareness through the conference process. The conferences must be an ongoing process with emphasis on practical solutions and case studies of successful implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report itself contains much specific information as to steps that should be taken, steps that have been proven effective by our overseas competitors. It details assistance that is currently available to industries to undertake the changes necessary to adopt new management techniques. Indeed, the range of bodies offering such assistance is a problem in itself. There is a confusing interrelationship between the many organisations and consultancy firms claiming to be able to provide support. When the Committee put itself in the position of a manufacturer attempting to find relevant information we were confronted with a daunting array of available courses and consultancies and, worse, difficulties in getting through to the organisation which was specifically set up to overcome the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> That coordinating role is clearly vital. It is performed by the National Industry Extension Service, which is a national and State government funded body. It refers enterprises to the most appropriate source of information and advice and also provides subsidies to engage consultants. The report details the importance of that approach and makes recommendations to streamline even further the service they are offering. </PARA>
<PARA> Training and development of staff is crucial to improving productivity levels. The approach to training is not consistent across manufacturing industry. It is our aim to demonstrate the value of money spent on training. Human resources are a company's greatest asset, yet in many plants surprisingly little is done to upgrade skills through formal in-house training programs that are properly supervised and evaluated. Making this and other external training through technical and further education colleges and other bodies relevant to industry's needs should be a major focus of the national and State conferences. Much more information about the value of training to industry should be provided, including how that increased knowledge can be best harnessed within a plant. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by again emphasising the value of national and State conferences to develop awareness and to increase current knowledge and practice about new management techniques. It will only be through this process that change across a wide range of manufacturing enterprise will occur. There are many examples of individual companies that are progressive and productive. Sadly, though, when we look at the national figures the need for improvement becomes all too apparent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to conclude my remarks on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill by going back to what we see as the problem-that sufficient jobs are simply not available for the age group that we are talking about. By adequate jobs we mean jobs that have a future, jobs that give young people an opportunity to work their way out of poverty, to get sufficient income at least to be able to feed, house and clothe themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have mentioned earlier, a lot of the jobs that are available for these young people are casual, part time work of irregular duration and generally very low paid. This is no problem for those young people who are simply working for some pocket money, who have parental support and encouragement, and, particularly, who have family finances that can support them if they happen to lose one job or decide that they want to move to another. These are not the young people we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The people we are talking about do not have these luxuries available to them. They have to work, they need to work and they need to earn sufficient money to be able to provide for themselves-without anyone else helping them-with the necessities of life. To say that by hitting these young people harder and harder we are giving them incentives to get out to work really flies in the face of any rational debate and discussion. What we should be looking at as incentives are support schemes, counselling and advocacy to make sure that they can find their way through the existing maze that has been provided for them-and, indeed, removing some of the restriction and qualifications they now need to face. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, therefore, will be moving a number of amendments. Hopefully, we will be able to give these young people a little bit more support and somewhat more of a chance than they are currently getting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, the first piece of social security and veterans' affairs legislation since the last election, I want to refer to the second reading speech which was presented in this chamber by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray).

It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Many of the changes provided for in this Bill . . . are the forerunners to the far-reaching initiatives announced in the Treasurer's February Statement which involved the total overhaul of the unemployment benefit system. </PARA>
<PARA>The February economic statement was, of course, an election campaign exercise in a climate where, as has been pointed out in many areas but particularly by Louise Dodson in an article in the Australian Financial Review in May, public sympathy for the unemployed is at an all-time low, a fact not lost on the Government during the recent election campaign. The Government's own research demonstrated that certain campaign promises which had been made by the Opposition seemed to be hitting a chord in the context of lack of public sympathy for the unemployed and other groups, including sole parents, and that therefore led to a statement that, if elected, certain other measures of that nature would be put in place by a new Labor government. Well, eventually we have that new Labor government. We have before us a piece of legislation which, as much as anything, could be said to be an example of government by public opinion polls in that it feeds a series of prejudices in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind Senator Alston, who, of course, has made his first speech in this chamber on legislation in his new capacity as spokesperson for the Opposition in this crucial area of social security, that this is not, in fact, a Budget Bill. As I have just said, we do not consider the February economic statement to have been a Budget. After complaining about certain aspects of this Bill, his excuse for not taking any action is very thin and rings very hollow. The best he can offer is to say that this is a Budget Bill and, therefore, there is nothing that the Opposition can do. In fact, the tax Bills that are yet to come before the Senate this week are Budget Bills and I understand that there is a whole range of Opposition amendments to that legislation. So I must say that I find that stance somewhat at odds with reality and even, indeed, with an honest approach. It was a pretty unremarkable debut from Senator Alston, and certainly it will give no comfort to those at the coal face of community support for the most disadvantaged and needy in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government did its market research and found that the community has pretty much hardened its heart against those on welfare. But Karen Luscombe, an Australian Labor Party researcher whose work is quoted by Louise Dobson in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 2 May, found that the community was reluctant to accept the Liberals' more hardline policy of withdrawing the unemployment benefit after 12 months, favouring instead compulsory training programs which became one of the election policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Julian Disney, the former President of the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Democrats believe that there is certainly value in directing tough measures against welfare abuse and, indeed, in making sure that the unemployed are given every possible opportunity to be trained and placed in worthwhile work. But targeting, which has been a feature of the welfare policies of this Government, has, in our view, gone beyond a reasonable point. The results of that `strict targeting', which has been the term used for taking draconian measures in this area and creating cost savings in the welfare budget, have included the continuation of poverty traps and the development of new ones for some groups such as sole parents and young people in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation which this chamber dealt with in December last year regarding sole parents and de facto relationships, and legislation in other areas, has created a reversal of the onus of proof-if not in legal reality, certainly in effect. It has created risks to people's basic civil liberties in this country. I refer to the freedom of choice that people have-not people in this chamber but people who are dependent on the community for income support for however short time; most of them want it to be a short time-about where to live. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already raised early in this session with the new Minister for Social Security Senator Richardson, questions about the program set in place last year which enables the withdrawal of unemployment benefit if people move to an area which is seen to reduce their prospects of employment. We objected to that measure at the time. It is a measure which, we believe, creates the potential for the beneficiary to suffer the reverse onus of proof. We were told by the Minister that `yes, there had been some problems', but that he-the Minister told us this on two occasions-was satisfied that the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) had adequate information available, that its officers could, and indeed would, make the right decisions, that the Government was keeping a very close eye on the situation and that it would see that this provision was used only to crack down on people who were moving their place of residence simply to avoid having to take work and, therefore, become classic dole bludgers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not believe that this provision is working yet. We opposed the provision and we continue to oppose it. I offer it here as an example of my point that we have endangered the civil liberties of people who are dependent on welfare benefits and community income support. I have been given some examples of cases current under this system. I ask the Senate to consider whether the rights of the individuals involved have been impeded. I ask the Minister to consider this and to attempt to assure this Senate that the problems raised by these cases have been, or will be, dealt with. We actually believe that we can deal with these problems only by removing this provision which is far too discretionary and is creating far too much distress. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples. Take the case of a person 17 years old, who has only one arm, who is currently unemployed but has worked in the past, and who is living with a family in Campbelltown, in Sydney. He has lived with this family for over three years, including for a period when the family moved to Kempsey for 12 months. This person's family is now due to move to Coffs Harbour because the father has received a work transfer. This young person-a 17-year-old-has been informed by the Department of Social Security at Coffs Harbour that he will lose his unemployment benefit if he moves with the family and that if he reapplies for the benefit he will have to wait 12 weeks. Those are the provisions that we put in place last year. He was told by the Coffs Harbour CES that he would be deemed to have-and I quote from the legislation-`reduced his employment prospects' by moving. This was determined by comparing the general unemployment rate in Sydney with that in Coffs Harbour-4 per cent versus 9 to 11 per cent. This is above a 2 per cent differential and so anyone moving from Sydney to Coffs Harbour would have his unemployment benefits cancelled under section 116 (6a)-the section to which we objected last time and the section which I offer as an example of the way targeting of social security benefits has put at risk the civil liberties of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this determination runs counter to the point that the Minister made in answer to a question I asked about whether the CES was determining these matters on a case-by-case basis or whether it was simply taking global figures and applying them to individuals. This person was told that he did not fall into the `sufficient reason for moving' category, which is in the legislation, as the family he lived with was not his father and mother and this was the only interpretation of `family member' allowed for by the legislation. If this is indeed the case, I will be exhorting the Minister at the appropriate time in the committee stage to make some definitive statement about what is a very narrow definition of `family'-that of mother and father. A 17-year-old person with one arm has lost his benefit because he has moved with his `family', but they are not his father and mother. </PARA>
<PARA> Another client moved with his wife and children from Sydney to Brisbane following an offer of work by his father-in-law. He left his job in Sydney, arrived in Brisbane and commenced work only to be advised a week later that there was insufficient work available. He applied for, and received, unemployment benefit in Brisbane. But, due to an overcrowded situation in which the client and his family were living-they had intended to move out into other premises once he was working on a regular basis-they then decided to move to Nowra where an aunt could put them up for a while. When the client moved to Nowra, the 12-week postponement period for unemployment benefit was put in place and his wife and children were paid the special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another client moved to the north coast of New South Wales in July 1988 after purchasing a block of land in that area. He left his employment in the Blue Mountains area of Sydney so that he could supervise the building of his house and he obtained employment after about eight weeks. His mother became ill and, due to delays in the construction of the house, he decided to move back to the Blue Mountains, which he did in November-December 1988. He has subsequently obtained employment in Penrith. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1989, just at the time we were passing this piece of legislation, he moved back to the north coast of New South Wales on the basis that the house was now completed and his mother's health had improved. The move back to the north coast constituted a breach of our new section 116 (6a) provision, and a 12-week period of non-payment was imposed. In this case, the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney advised the wife to claim a special benefit so that there was some income. The person involved did gain full employment just after the 12-week period had expired. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the `sufficient reason for moving', which is defined in the legislation at present, is too limited and is excluding genuine job seekers from income support, even with the Government's amendment, which now allows for the inclusion of health problems in the family. It was an amendment which was put in subsequent to my initial question to the Minister here on the first week of sitting. It is also clear that that provision is not being correctly interpreted in that the individual's employment prospects are not, in spite of the answer given to me by the Minister, being assessed; rather, a blanket approach is being taken by Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are examples of what I believe are impingements on the individual and civil liberties of Australians and their choices about where to live, about whether to go home and look after their mother for a while, and whether to build a house in another area, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill we have a further set of provisions which impinge on the rights of a particular group of Australians-those who were born overseas. The provisions in this legislation mean that a wife's or a widow's B pension will not be payable after 12 months overseas. In both cases it is when that woman has lived overseas for more than 12 months. This is clearly a restriction on these women who are entitled to benefits under Australian legislation, simply because they exercise their right about where they will live. In the case of these women, they are without work and without a partner. That is why they are on this benefit. In most cases these women are choosing to live among family or community support which happens to be overseas because they are not Australian born. This is clearly a discrimination against that group of people and one which we will oppose. As I am sure many other honourable senators have had, we have had a number of representations from, for instance, the Ecumenical Migration Centre in Victoria, the United Association of Greek Orthodox Communities and Parishes of Victoria, and the Ecumenical Migration Centre, and, on behalf of many immigrant groups and ethnic communities, the Welfare Rights Unit. We will, as I say, oppose those provisions of the legislation, particularly as we see in it some ministerial discretion as to whether a certain country will or will not be included, which seems to us to be totally inappropriate in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Lees has dealt with the impact of the tighter squeeze on young people and their families that is represented by this legislation. I particularly want to raise the question of the foreshadowed moves which the Minister mentions in his second reading speech. That is the replacement of unemployment benefit altogether with labour market training programs in the context of child poverty. The basis of my remarks will be the Brotherhood of St Laurence assessment of the election policies, which was made a week or so before the election. As I say, this whole exercise marks the beginning of the implementation of that election policy program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brotherhood place great emphasis on trying to create an understanding that child poverty has everything to do with the situation of the family. They asked the question before the election-and it is equally valid now, and perhaps more so-how are children likely to fare in a period of rising unemployment? We are, we are told, in a technical recession. Unemployment is not falling; unemployment is rising. The question is whether the pathways out of unemployment will be clear and navigable-to use the Brotherhood's words-for the parents of children at risk of poverty. The Brotherhood's view is that neither the Labor Party nor the coalition parties are planning to introduce measures that will make the economic security of unemployed families better. They believe they will be made more problematic by the sorts of draconian measures that are in this legislation. The proposals make access to income support more dependent upon the satisfaction of administrative tests of one kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brotherhood supports the view that I have already expressed: that there should be no abuse of income support systems. But they point out that the measures that we now have before us by way of legislation carry the risk that as the system becomes more administratively complex, some unemployed parents with genuine needs will fail to satisfy the new tests. New tests include those sections in the legislation in which it is proposed to extend the number of tests with regard to visits to CES offices and whether or not people answer their mail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brotherhood points out that the coalition's policies on unemployment benefits carry a greater risk for children because the long term unemployed will be subjected to more stringent conditions on entitlement without any guarantee that labour market training programs will be made available to them. So there is enormous concern about the safety net of income support from the children of unemployed families and the fact that both the Government and the Opposition are increasing the risks that these families and their children face. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge, as does the Brotherhood, of course, the child and family payments that have been put in place by the Government, and, in particular, the indexation which was a major feature of last year's legislation. The real problem is the continuing inadequacies of the benchmarks set for the child related payments and the level of income support provided to sole parents and to homeless teenagers in particular. They are both still well behind where they need to be in terms of an adequate income support program. This legislation also further reduces the income support for, particularly, the young unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to raise in the context of this legislation the point that is made by the Brotherhood when they say that there is no question but that rigorous administrative procedures are necessary to combat abuse of the income security system; but-and I am quoting here:</PARA>
<PARA>Brotherhood research has shown that as eligibility for pensions and benefits is tightened, the system becomes more difficult for genuine clients to understand and establish their correct entitlement. This results in lower take-up rates and confusion about rights and eligibility, at great cost to both the efficiency and the equity of the system. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask myself, when looking at the savings figures in the explanatory memorandum of many of the measures in this Bill and measures in previous legislation of the Hawke Government in recent years, how much of that cost saving is dependent upon the confusion and the lack of understanding of these people, and the lack of advocacy that they can get. This results in lower take-up rates and so the full circle is closed. The Government saves money, but at what cost? They are costs which have been very clearly articulated in this chamber today by my colleague Senator Lees, with regard to young people in particular. Louise Dodson said in the article to which I have already referred that the changes are likely to actually increase the role of government and add to, or at least maintain, spending and staffing levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I question whether the Government is adequately and sensitively administering these changes. I refer to the examples I gave about the withdrawal of unemployment benefits a few moments ago, and I raise the concerns, as expressed by the Brotherhood, that there is a need to ensure that the restructured system of unemployment benefits is administered with sensitivity to individual circumstances-and it is clear that is not happening in all cases-and with a recognition that no amount of obligation to undergo training or seek work can overcome that shortage of job opportunities in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, there are about eight unemployed people for every job vacancy. The figure is much higher amongst certain age groups and in particular areas. If there is not sensitive implementation of even a very fair system, even a system not so tightly targeted, then many people do lose out; there is no question about that. But the Government saves money and I suppose that is a goal which is attractive in the wider community. At least, that is what the public opinion poll showed and that is why we have this legislation, and why new legislation will be presented. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out again that the coalition does not have a specific policy in this area. It talks about tax breaks for families, crackdowns, and a special benefit for the unemployable; but it seems that a large group would fall between those able to find work and those able to qualify for special benefit. There would be many severe casualties under this sort of system. Indeed, labour market programs were to be scaled back under a coalition government. There is a continuing shortage of job opportunities and a limited pool of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> We must, and we will, constantly question the Government about the labour market training programs that it is proposing to put in place. It seems to me that if its goal is to spend less, then this is a major concern. Programs for training-for the wide range of people who are currently unemployed and for those who find employment most difficult to achieve-will not be inexpensive. If they are going to be implemented properly and if all people are going to be catered for, it will not be an inexpensive exercise. The Brotherhood raised these problems in its pre-election document: firstly, whether the planned increase in labour market program places will be adequate for demand and, secondly, whether it will all be adequately funded. That is a question which the Australian Democrats will continue to ask. </PARA>
<PARA> The further issue raised by the Brotherhood to which we should all pay attention is the need for family support services. Senator Lees has talked about family breakdown. We are all concerned about our homeless youth. This legislation specifically puts more pressure on families and puts more responsibility on families for a longer period of time. It is ironic that the class B widow's pension now cuts out once the recipient's child reaches the age of 16 because the child is said to be independent at that age. Yet dependency is designated as being up to the age of 21 in various measures that are implemented in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are conscious that in the new Parliament-albeit not yet a new Senate-we have the numbers man, Senator Richardson, as the new Minister for Social Security. I have thought about this matter. I will be delighted if he can get the numbers in the interests of the disadvantaged and turn around the discrimination which still exists against sole parents and their children-the children who are in poverty-and the young unemployed. I do not think that anyone will be delighted if Senator Richardson is in this new role in order to paper over the significant chasms in Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the article by Louise Dodson on 2 May in which it was said that Labor strategists felt that social welfare policy was a major weakness in the runup to the election campaign. The article stated. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where the new Minister . . . comes in. Mr Howe . . . was not able to successfully explain and sell the changes. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to Senator Richardson's appointment, the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Although initially far from happy with the job-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson must have had a grim look on his face when he did this interview, if indeed he did it-</PARA>
<PARA>he was given . . . perhaps, Senator Richardson's undoubted political skills could turn the social security reforms into a plus for the Government or at least neutralise the potential negatives. </PARA>
<PARA>It will require more than a paperhanging exercise. The Democrats will be here to ensure that progress is real progress, and will ask real questions about the new system which is proposed to be implemented in the Budget session. We will be looking at the labour market programs. We will be pointing out the deficiencies which will no doubt be there and which are there already. There would need to be a very sensitive and well resourced program put in place because we-like the Government says that it does-believe that unemployed, of all age groups and both genders, need the opportunities to get back into the work force, to be independent-to be their own people-and have all the choices. They will not have them if all that they are given is a sausage machine which tries to standardise them in labour market training, at the other end of which there are no jobs, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> There are people with special needs, such as those isolated rural women who have to get back into the work force because they are now on their own. They may have skills, but not necessarily the skills that the market wants at that particular time or in that particular place. What are we going to do for them? What are we going to do for the young people in the same communities, and young people for whom the education system, as it currently exists, has not been an advantage, and who have been square pegs in round holes? We will be looking at that, as will major groups in the community whose job it is to provide advocacy for the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a rumour that anybody who has $5,000 cash will become ineligible for the unemployment benefit. That is not in this legislation, but there is a very strong thought that $5,000 in the bank is going to create ineligibility. I want the Government to know that there are people who are concerned about this. I do not know where the idea came from, but it is out there. It might be useful if the Minister has something to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by saying that we will be here, we will be keeping an eye on it and we will be opposing those draconian clauses of this Bill. We will be looking at what the Government is planning to do next. I refer to some remarks made in the `Impact Newsletter' of the Australian Council of Social Service by the President, Merle Mitchell, about the fine election result of the Australian Democrats, pointing out that this was not just a green vote. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Much of the Democrats' support is due largely to their social and economic policies which are similar to the general directions advocated by ACOSS. ACOSS hopes this clear shift in opinion which is reflected in the Democrat vote will be recognised more by politicians and the media than appears to be the case so far and that the Government's policies will reflect this recognition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package has some positive aspects because it allows backpayments for family allowance supplements for multiple births and special payments for victims of natural disaster. It also allows recipients of compensation from war crimes exemption from income testing through a reciprocal agreement with Austria. So some parts of the legislation have positive aspects, and they are welcome. Although the social security legislation package is intended as a broad rationalisation of the benefits system, indirectly in principle it targets the female spouses of dole recipients to encourage them to re-enter the work force or skills training programs which will probably be irrelevant in a decade because of the impact of changing technologies on the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a particular concern about clause 10 (1) (a), or old clause 9 (1) (a), which effectively reduces the dole for 18- to 20-year-olds. This relates to a dependent woman living with a dole recipient who is on Austudy and who will have her benefit reduced to half the married rate. I will wholeheartedly support Australian Democrats' amendments to this clause. I do not believe that a young married couple can survive on less than an older married couple. So the legislation does discriminate against youth despite the Government's commitment to deal with youth poverty. Youth benefits will have to be increased to match married rates and pension rates if our welfare system is to reflect any social equity. Forcing youth into further poverty through reducing payments to Austudy levels will contribute to more people falling into the poverty trap-perhaps never to escape. However, in income testing terms the Austudy payment will not be judged as additional income, so it appears that the Government is taking away on the one hand from young couples and then giving a little bit back, but this is inadequate as a way of dealing with welfare policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation clearly discriminates against young women who will now have to qualify for the dole in their own right if they are married or in a de facto relationship with a dole recipient. This initiative is forcing women into training programs which are mainly blue-collar oriented for jobs that probably do not or will not exist for much longer. The whole emphasis of Jobstart is to put young people into trades and apprenticeships, an area now being overtaken by technology, so the structure of the Government's skills programs is increasingly irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation package is draconian and clearly discriminates against young, disadvantaged women who will be deterred from re-entering the education system because the total household income will be reduced because of the Austudy payment. The change proposed under the legislation, that the social security benefits of a married person whose spouse is on Austudy will be limited to half the normal combined married rate, goes against the philosophy of all the affirmative action programs the Government has introduced in other policy areas and against its poverty initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims it is a work incentive to reduce the level of the payment to Austudy levels while the spouse is on the dole, which is totally ironical because it is obviously a disincentive for women to enter or continue education courses whilst their spouse is on the dole. This clause will directly contribute to immersing women in a cycle of limited education and poverty. It is clear that education is the key to freeing women from the poverty trap and helping them contribute to the economy and society productively. But the Government is taking the right wing economic rationalist route by reducing the dole to the level of Austudy which has historically lagged behind social security payments, rather than doing what is just, which is to boost Austudy to dole levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1985-86 in its Youth Policies Budget Statement and other various statements such as Priority One, the Government has claimed that it is committed to creating parity between the dole and Austudy. In 1985, the Government said that by 1988 the basic Austudy rates for 16 to 17-year-old secondary and tertiary students and unemployment benefits would reach parity. However, this legislation shows that across the board we are moving in the opposite direction. The Government is long on rhetoric and short on action. What it is doing with this piece of legislation is reducing dole payments to half where a spouse receives Austudy, which is a shocking rationalisation at the expense of the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that over 21-year-old students still get a rate that is equivalent only to the intermediate rate of the dole for over 18s and under 21s or the youth allowance, so parity is not being reached according to the Government's projections and with the direction of this legislation it probably never will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is disregarding its commitment to help free under 21-year-olds from the poverty trap and goes against the grain of many other initiatives which the Government has instituted to help youth, such as the youth homeless allowance. The Government is slashing social security benefits and making rationalisations at the expense of the class of disadvantaged people and, even more particularly, disadvantaged women wanting to educate themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> All the rationalisations the Government is making in the social security area are tightening the welfare sector and reducing fraud in some areas-and, of course, that is commendable-but at the same time they are squeezing the life out of an underclass of people already caught in the inescapable pincers of the poverty trap. For example, the decision to discriminate against dole recipients moving to low employment areas by extending the period of non-payment of the dole is unacceptable and is one major rationalisation in a whole package of draconian measures. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Job Search allowance, which will replace the dole after nine months is the Government's middle ground solution to the work for the dole scheme. The whole welfare system is now becoming very harsh and punitive and is forcing the margin of people unable to receive the dole onto the stringent category of special benefits. In other words, it is squeezing the life out of those in the poverty trap. The welfare lobby are outraged by these rationalisations and I believe that middle Australia would be appalled too at what is going on if the Government did not couch the changes in the language of economic rationalisation, which is really the hidden sell out of traditional Labor principles. It is no work incentive for a woman to live on half the married rate of the dole. It is just another bureaucratic rationalisation at the expense of the rights of individuals at the expense of social justice as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about clause 16, formerly clause 15, which extends the period of non-payment or punishment for an individual not taking reasonable steps to find employment-not visiting the CES office for registration for jobs, or by voluntarily leaving employment-from four weeks plus two weeks to six weeks plus six weeks. This is unnecessarily harsh and it does not allow for an individual to explain the circumstances of those alleged breaches. The whole social security system is becoming highly discretionary and punitive. People on welfare should not be made to feel like criminals. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also worried by clause 17 of the Bill, which disallows people conditioned sickness benefit if they are deferring their education course. This is also highly discriminatory. If the Australian Government looks at the effects of Thatcherism, it could well learn the dangers of increasing the gaps in the social structure through tightening the welfare system. Britain now has a large, angry and dispossessed underclass and the commensurate problems of increasing violence and crime. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that our family support structures such as the family allowance supplement and the Government's initiatives to boost middle Australia are being made at the cost of disadvantaged, dispossessed and unemployed youth. As Senator Lees pointed out, the Burdekin report left us in no doubt about this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The welfare system in Australia has gone off the rails and cuts to youth benefits are now subsidising benefits for the families of middle Australia. The Government is juggling the figures to make the Budget look equitable, but in real terms no increases are occurring in the welfare sector and the dole and Austudy have not been equalised. The monetarist policies may work for the moneyed classes, but they certainly do not benefit our new underclass of poverty-stricken youth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not seek to answer all the points that were raised during the second reading debate because quite a few of them relate to the passage of legislation over the last two years and not actually to those amendments with which we are dealing today. In any event, no doubt in committee we will go into those in some detail. However, I would like to mention a number of points that Senator Alston raised, particularly those in relation to our arrangements for the Newstart program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston said that 30 per cent of 10,000 persons surveyed were supposed to have found jobs within two weeks of the start of the scheme. He hinted that they actually had jobs while on unemployment benefits. In July 1989, the then Opposition spokesman on social security, David Connolly, claimed that 25 per cent of beneficiaries who were sent a letter inviting them to attend a Newstart interview reported that they had found a job in the previous fortnight; they were, therefore, fraudulently in receipt of the benefit. Since February 1989 a total of 5,289 unemployment beneficiaries, that is, 13 per cent of a total of 40,000 who were invited to attend the interview, terminated from benefit within one week of the interview date. That includes 2,440 beneficiaries whose benefits were terminated for failure to attend the interview, 1,001 who returned to work and 499 who failed the work test. </PARA>
<PARA> Six weeks after the interview 2,964 beneficiaries-that is, 7 per cent of all beneficiaries invited to a Newstart interview-had not come back onto benefit. That includes a further 858 returning to work, 1,217 who failed to attend the interview-and that is only 3 per cent of the total, and 244 who failed the work test. So I think Senator Alston has followed on from a mistake made by his predecessor and his criticisms make no more sense than did the initial ones. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of one of the most important aspects of what we are dealing with today, though, Senator Alston raised the question of portability. This has, of course, had particular reference to the Greek and Turkish communities in recent times because should the Government proceed with not exempting Greece and Turkey, wives' and widows' B pensions in those countries would cease to be paid from 1 July next year. </PARA>
<PARA> This would also involve the Government giving formal notice of the termination of agreements between Greece and Turkey signed in 1972. It should be noted that those agreements have always been dead letter treaties. Neither Greece nor Turkey ever abided by the terms of them because the foreign currency restrictions in both countries virtually prevented the payment of any pensions overseas. In the case of Turkey, they totally prevented the payment of pensions outside the country and in the case of Greece, they very severely restricted the agreement to the point where we think that only 101 pensions from Greece are paid into Australia whereas we are paying 7,200 into Greece, costing $45m a year. The Greek Government is paying $160,000 in pensions a year into Australia. For that reason we want to get reciprocal agreements with Greece and Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the worry about the cancellation of wives' and widows' pensions, it is important to note the rationale behind it. Many of the reasons given in the last few weeks simply do not get to the point. Widows' pensions in this country are not strictly confined to widows; the recipients include divorcees and others. Wives' and widows' pensions are unique to Australia. They are paid in almost no other country. That being the case, the Australian Government decided in February that these pensions were not appropriate for export. Instead of simply terminating those payments around the world, instead of giving those who had been in receipt of those pensions no time to adjust, the Government quite correctly announced that the decisions would take effect from 1 July next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of prior community consultations with the Greek and Turkish communities and Senator Alston's suggestion that the Bill be deferred in the meantime, it has to be remembered that, under this legislation, by regulation any country can be exempted. The reality is that the consultations with the Greek and Turkish communities are not finished. They have now been occurring for some weeks. I have had two meetings in Melbourne, two in Sydney, I am attending a further meeting with the Greek community in Melbourne tomorrow and I will be meeting with the Turkish community, also in Melbourne, on Thursday morning. Those consultations will continue, and will include some much larger meetings in Sydney and Melbourne next week. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that this legislation provides the power to exempt by regulation, should the Government at any time between now and 1 July next year decide, for whatever reason, that Greece and Turkey should not be included in this legislation, that power to exempt can be used. That is why the consultations with the communities are valid and will continue in the way in which they have during the last few weeks. At the end of those consultations I will be able to report to Cabinet on the attitudes that have been displayed by the communities in question and the Cabinet can then determine its position. </PARA>
<PARA> As to whether there is evidence of rorts under the present system-which is what Senator Alston was attempting to get at-it should be noted that whenever pensions are paid overseas, and not just wives' and widows' pensions but pensions for the age or invalid pensions, virtually all of the policing of those pensions is done on an honour system given the difficulty of finding out sufficient information in foreign countries on assets and income. So one can only speculate as to whether there are abuses to the system. Certainly, members of the Greek community have approached me and suggested that these abuses exist. In terms of proof, one wonders exactly how one could go about getting it. With a comprehensive reciprocal agreement signed between Australia and other countries, the possibility of a better flow of information between Australia and other countries might assist. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to be made about these reciprocal agreements which so far has failed to be made during this debate is that reciprocal agreements with countries such as Greece and Turkey would over time inevitably mean more money, rather than less, being paid into those countries by Australia. A short-term saving is involved in chopping off wives' and widows' pensions. The form of these agreements is quite well known because Australia has signed agreements with Canada, Italy and Spain. Malta is also now ready to sign and during the next 12 months I think I can confidently predict that agreements will be signed with Portugal, West Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Austria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will manage to stay here occasionally; Senator Alston should not worry about that. There is a whole range of countries with which negotiations are at an advanced stage. The social security system differs in each one of these countries, so we cannot have exactly the same agreement with every country. Nonetheless, it is pretty obvious that in all these cases the agreements do provide for the continued payment of age and invalid pensions, which make up the bulk of the payments to all the countries. For all those who fear that in some way we have a thin edge of the wedge step, that a move on wives' and widows' pensions is actually the first step to cutting off age and invalid pensions later on, all I can say is that the signing of all these agreements around the world should allay those fears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I cannot pretend or purport to bind a future Australian Government in 10, 20 or 50 years time, I can say that Australia's record of honouring its international obligations is first class, irrespective of the political colour of its government. That being the case, the agreements now being signed obviously will be honoured by future governments. It will be virtually impossible for any Australian Government to decide to walk away. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that there is a benefit in the signing of these agreements. As an example, they allow the qualification periods in both countries to be added together, to give a total eligibility period in either country. That means that in the case of Greece there will be many people who would be entitled to a part pension if we had an agreement but who receive nothing at the present time. That is why the signing of these agreements can bring about considerable benefits for more people. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of progress of negotiations, the Government of Turkey is seeking to have a joint announcement with Australia on the termination of the 1972 agreement, asking that negotiations on a comprehensive reciprocal agreement begin immediately, and it is confident of having the Turkish Minister visit Australia in August. I will be seeking to visit Ankara in September. The Government of Greece, too, is anxious to begin negotiations, which will kick off during the next few months. So we will be pursuing with vigour negotiations with those governments and with the other countries that I mentioned earlier to make sure that as those agreements are signed, there is less and less concern expressed by people in Australia about the Government's present and future intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the contributions of Senator Powell and Senator Lees covered many of the same points. Many of their comments related to changes in the legislation during the last 12 months or perhaps two years and to their assessments of those changes, what they meant, and what was behind them. The philosophy which has been behind most of these changes is that Australia needed to do much more for those receiving unemployment benefits, in particular, to get them back into the work force. The changes seek to reflect that need. </PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as whether I will be welcomed as the Minister for Social Security, I can say that I agree with the philosophy espoused. It is certainly the Government's intention to do as much as it possibly can to assist people get the skills and information necessary to get back into the work force. However, that does not mean that we will not tighten up on work and activity tests to make sure that people try. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time there will be problems in the implementation of those sorts of schemes. That is inevitable. But I say to Senator Powell that I will endeavour over the course of the next few years to make sure that sensitivity is shown by the Department of Social Security and, insofar as I can have an influence, by the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) in dealing with these labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators would appreciate, there is quite an overlap from the CES to the Department of Social Security. As the question that Senator Powell asked in the chamber a few weeks ago demonstrated admirably, that overlap can sometimes cause difficulties. Today again she has referred to the difficulties of those who seek to move to areas where employment prospects are considerably lower than in the areas in which they presently reside. </PARA>
<PARA> While there have been teething problems at the implementation stage of this scheme, they now largely have been overcome. It is not just a question of State governments saying that they will not drop people down the waiting list for housing if they refuse to accept the offer of a home in an area where employment prospects are lower; the way that the CES now assesses each case has also changed. It looks not only at generally the possibility of getting a job in the area to which a person moves, but also at the individual case and the particular skills and occupation of the person concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a case of endeavouring, in so far as is possible, to make sure that programs which are intrinsically worthy are administered properly. If they are, there should be no real cause for hardship. I totally reject the concept that this has a sausage-machine effect of jamming people together and throwing them out at the other end onto some labour market scrap heap. Certainly, that is not the aim of the scheme nor the way the scheme has been administered; nor would I ever allow it to be administered in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell talked about another rumour as to what the Government might be contemplating in the course of Budget discussions. One classic example appeared last week in the Sydney Morning Herald. It recklessly announced that we were looking at reducing from 16 to 12 years the eligibility of people to receive the family allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just refer to clause 6, which requires that application for maintenance be pursued. In other words, if entitlement to the guardian's allowance is to be gained reasonable action must be taken. It is not that we object to this at all. In fact, it is consistent with previous legislation in this area. But we wish to express some concerns and, perhaps, get some comment from the Minister about the procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At an earlier time, when the question of child maintenance came up under the child maintenance scheme, we were concerned about the position of some supporting parents for whom the pursuit of that maintenance is very difficult. We realise that there are exceptions in this legislation, but our concern continues because we are aware that for many people it is difficult to pursue the maintenance option. In fact, some simply do not want to because of perceived dangers; others cannot because they are not sure where to begin. The level of advocacy available to these people has not improved. In my State of Victoria, the Welfare Rights Unit, which has carried out a great deal or work on behalf of many supporting parents, has its own funding under threat. All of the advocacy agencies around the country, which do such a good job, are very strapped for resources and very often cannot meet the case load adequately. We are concerned that there should not be delays in the provision of the allowances on the basis of this provision. We are aware that for some people there have been delays. We are really questioning the procedures and asking the Minister whether he is satisfied that unnecessary delays will not take place as a result of the implementation of this clause. If he is satisfied, what is his basis?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer very briefly. As part of the Government's overall policy on child support, obviously we need to encourage those who are in receipt of benefits to take up their maintenance option. That is all that the clause seeks to do. There is no suggestion that the application of the term `reasonable action' will be harsh and unconscionable. We want to make sure that people take up their rights. That is pretty basic to the application of any policy of social justice. It is not simply a question of the obligations of Government being adhered to; the obligations of individuals must be kept as well. We ought not to walk away from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can give the honourable senator an assurance that this provision will not result in undue delay or, I believe, in undue hardship. There are, of course, a number of exceptions where people do not have to take action at all when it comes to collecting maintenance: fear of violence is one of the obvious ones. I think the way in which this has been, and will continue to be, administered should allay the fears the Committee has expressed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.30)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I want to confine my remarks to clause 6 of the legislation, which deals with the link between access to social security payments and pursuit of child maintenance entitlements. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to extend a requirement which currently applies to applicants for sole parent's and class B widows' pensions to applicants for all other pensions and benefits. The requirement is that all reasonable effort must be made to pursue child maintenance entitlements before access is given to social security benefits. In practical terms this means lodging a request for maintenance with the Child Support Agency. The coalition agrees that, wherever possible, non-custodial parents should provide financial support for their children where they have the capacity to do so. In this respect the arrangements under stage 2 of the Child Support Agency scheme are to be welcomed as the maintenance determined under stage 2 better reflects the actual costs involved in raising children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That said, however, it would seem all too apparent that the mechanism to make collections of maintenance needs to be carefully reviewed. I understand from answers given in Estimates recently that the Department of Social Security is currently undertaking a review of the scheme. It is with this in mind that I wish to emphasise the important point that under this Bill the Child Support Agency is effectively being asked to undertake further tasks in a system which already seems grossly overburdened and unable effectively to undertake the tasks already being asked of it-a veritable mountain of particular instances of poor administration was presented by my colleague Senator Reid earlier in this session. In terms of overall effectiveness, I point out that it was originally forecast that implementation of the scheme would save $120m in 1988-89. That figure has since been reduced to $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a number of representations in my office on the delays-even to the point of hanging on for undue periods waiting to be answered by the Agency, and also of not being able to get back to the same person to whom one spoke originally and therefore having to go through the whole story all over again. There seem to be some hold ups in that area. As I said, we are further burdening the Department with this added responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button said in this place on 5 December 1989 that 61 per cent of maintenance liabilities were met on time and that after enforcement action by the Child Support Agency some 25 per cent of liabilities were met. He also said that the Agency expected those figures to improve over time. In the light of this optimism for better outcomes, I was disturbed when the Agency advised my colleague Senator Short during the Estimates inquiries that 52 per cent of payers were in arrears at the time of disbursement and that following enforcement action over the next three months the level of payment rose to 71 per cent. These figures clearly represent a falling off in the effectiveness of the Agency since Senator Button provided figures in December. The Agency did not dispute the fact that this left 29 per cent of maintenance payments outstanding. These outstanding amounts of maintenance obviously mean that the Commonwealth is paying more to beneficiaries than otherwise would be the case. Delays in recovery also add to administration costs of both the Agency and the Department of Social Security, which must make retrospective adjustments to benefits paid. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these figures, I am left to speculate as to how effective the amendments we are debating can possibly be, given the problems with which the Child Support Agency is already beset in dealing with its current client population. I am aware that some additional funding has been made available to the Child Support Agency in the Additional Estimates. I assume that this was the funding to which Senator Richardson referred in his reply to a question on 25 May. However, it would appear from the explanation given in the explanatory notes that this additional funding will be used to address some of the inadequacies in current administration. It takes no account of the additional workload burden which will be placed on the Agency by these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very least, I hope that the current review of the child support scheme will take account of the additional workload which these amendments imply and that the reviewers make their recommendations accordingly. It is in the interests of the children whose parents are sought, the parents of those children, and the community as a whole, that this system be run in the most efficient way possible. This requirement is only increased given that these amendments seek to extend the activities of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I acknowledged the other day that there are delays of up to five months now at the Child Support Agency. That is an intolerable delay. To that end, I have approached the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and he has in turn approached the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to ensure that adequate resources are given to the Agency. The honourable senator will appreciate that the Department of Social Security does not administer this; it is actually done from within the Australian Taxation Office, and that is why I have gone to the Treasurer. I am very confident that within days, literally, we will have an announcement from the Minister for Finance on the extra numbers that will be given to the Agency to try to clear up the backlog.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have sought extra resources, taking into account the problems this scheme has had and the small amount that this would add to it. I do not really believe that this will be a major impost to the Agency, but I concede that there must be some effect. We are confident that if we get the resources we are asking for we can eliminate the delay very quickly. That will have to be a matter we will discuss over time. We will have to monitor it and see how quickly the delays are reduced. I certainly undertake to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator refers to the review. There is a Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group, chaired by Justice Fogarty of the Family Court of Australia. It is due to report by 31 July. I will make sure that that report is tabled in the Parliament in the next session so that everyone gets to see exactly what is in the review. The Government will take on board whatever Justice Fogarty comes up with, although I think already the weaknesses have mainly been in the sheer lack of numbers we gave to the Agency in the first place. That will pretty well be remedied now. </PARA>

People should know who they are talking to and be able to go back and speak to the same person, especially sole parents who are dealing with sensitive areas such as de facto relationships, overpayments and that sort of thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are opposing clause 7 of the Bill. This is the part of the Bill which, we believe, discriminates against overseas-born Australians. I have referred to this in my speech at the second reading stage. I raise it again as being one of those areas in the whole exercise of saving money from within the social welfare budget which runs the risk of being accused of removing people's individual rights and civil liberties. It is also discriminatory, particularly against women dependent on income support from the community purse, if you like. The provision is of concern for those reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We note that this measure has an expected saving of $29m in the first year and $28.7m in the second year. I question how accurate those savings figures are because, until the passage of this particular clause, there is no way of knowing whether or not this will create an unexpected return to these shores by some of the people who are eligible. Therefore, the figures would seem to be extraordinarily rubbery. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been pointed out by groups in the ethnic community which are concerned about this issue that it will cause distress to particular groups of people. For example, elderly women on these pensions who, I repeat, are currently eligible-and it is a policy matter to remove eligibility from those people-will either have to become dependent on the family with whom they live or the community in which they are living-that is really extending the age of dependency-or they will have to travel back to this country in order to maintain their eligibility. Travel will be expensive and, for many, physically distressing. </PARA>
<PARA> But really we should be standing for the principles of Australians being eligible and not differentiating between Australians who were born here and those who were not and those who, in the vast majority of cases, choose to live overseas for social, family and emotional reasons. Those are the principles that we wish to stand for on this occasion, and that is why we oppose this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the provision that gives the Minister discretion. The Minister spent a bit of time telling us how much discussion he is having with this group and that group. Obviously this will mean that the large ethnic groups in our community will have a better chance of gaining exemption, because this is politics and squeaky wheels get oiled. It means that the passage of this clause will actually add a further discrimination against any group of overseas origin which cannot raise enough noise with any government or Minister either now or in the future. Such groups will remain the groups discriminated against. We are pleased to see that when the Minister does make a decision, it will be a disallowable instrument. I assure this Minister, and subsequent Ministers, that whenever one of these comes before this chamber we will raise the matters of principle which we have raised today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell said that clause 7 discriminates against overseas-born Australians, but it is my understanding that it is more a discrimination against those who are non-residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the rationale behind this whole proposal, is it correct to say that 12 months has been taken as a period of time that is sufficient to indicate that a person has an intention to be permanently resident overseas, and to avoid the difficulties that might otherwise be experienced with someone being away for a couple of months and coming back if the Government tried to determine some shorter level of permanency? Subclause 2 (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an absence of a person from Australia ends if he or she returns to Australia, even if only temporarily. </PARA>
<PARA>If it is correct that 12 months is meant to be the indicative period for determining permanency, it seems to me that it is verging on the hypocritical if the Government says that the mere return to the country entitles a person to then go away for another 12 months. What the Government is then doing is condoning permanent absence from Australia but making an exception for a person who can afford to come back. I do not know why the Government simply does not come out and say that it does not want people to be resident overseas and that what it is on about is restricting that entitlement, rather than having this backdoor arrangement that somehow will cater for those who can afford to come back here. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that representations have been made by bodies such as the Welfare Rights Centre. I have read very carefully the comments that it has made in relation to this clause in particular. Others have suggested that this may well result in an excess burden on the social infrastructure in the sense that a lot of people will come back here who otherwise would not have returned. It seems to me that this is quite unlikely. The reality is that what the Government has in mind is that hardly anyone will come back; that people will simply throw in the towel. If that is the case, I wonder why the Government allows someone to return and requalify and then go away again. Such people are likely to be the very sort who have other means and, therefore, should not be entitled to receive continuing welfare payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 12 month period is simply the normal period that we have used. It is indicative of the kind of absence that people might want to take for a holiday or whatever purpose. In fact, the 12 month period is already in the legislation in respect of sole parents. So it is one that we have used before, and we consider it to be a reasonable period now. There is some disagreement, of course, in different ethnic communities about how many people are actually going to come back to Australia and take advantage of it. I am told by the people in the Turkish community that great numbers will come back and take advantage of it. I am told by others that the numbers will be very small because they will not be able to afford it. I just do not know; I am not going to make a firm prediction of how many might come back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards Senator Powell's statement about rubbery figures, I do intend to write to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) shortly and suggest that perhaps all the savings anticipated from this measure might not be there, for a number of reasons. Something like 10 to 15 per cent of the women involved in this decision, it would appear, will be eligible for transfer to age pensions. Some should have been transferred already but have not been. I have the Department analysing this on a file by file basis for each person, but clearly from the examinations we have done so far that is one fact that was not taken into account in looking at the savings. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, if, for example, an agreement were signed with Turkey prior to 1 July next year, and there would certainly be some chance of that occurring, and it was to take into account wives and widows pensions-the agreements we have with other countries vary; the agreement with Italy does take into account wives and widows pensions, and we are paying 500 or something pensions into Italy now-the proposed savings from that country would be wiped out. If the same thing happened with Greece, about half of the proposed savings of the measure would be wiped out. I intend to let the Minister for Finance know that that is the case, although perhaps I can now send him the extract from Hansard and he will have the message. So those savings figures will need to be looked at more carefully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Minister indicate the source of those figures? I think Senator Powell mentioned $29.2m as the savings in respect of the wives pension in the first financial year of operation. My reading of the February statement was that the savings in respect of wives pensions for 1990-91 would be only $2.4m; for the following year, $12.6m; and for class B widows, $2.2m, followed by $11.5m What is Senator Powell talking about?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in response to Senator Alston, I think the only reason for putting back the date was the intervention of the election, and that interregnum meant that we could not do it quite as quickly as had been hoped when the announcement was originally made. I will have to check on the exact date it was announced that it was being put back. Someone will find that for me, and I will try to let Senator Alston know before the end of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of a disincentive, other points are to be made about the general economic worth of reciprocal agreements. It is not simply a matter of saying that there is a saving here or a saving there. The other point is: how much will be paid into Australia from other countries when we get these agreements off and running? There will be a considerable change in the imbalance at the moment of Australia paying very much more out than it gets in. Obviously, some of the countries that will be most heavily involved are not among the richest countries in the world, so we cannot expect parity in dollar terms. But one can expect greatly increased amounts, and I think the Government has to take that into account, quite apart from looking at what savings we might get from this or that country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are committed to the program of signing agreements with those countries I have mentioned, and probably a few more, and those negotiations will continue over the course of the next year or so. As I have said, I am very hopeful that we will be signing quite a number of these agreements, and I assure Senator Powell and the Committee that this will be no disincentive at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, in evaluating the kinds of pensions it thinks appropriate for payment overseas, in the absence of reciprocal agreements, made the decision that pensions which are pretty well unique to this country are not appropriate for export. I think Australia has a right to make that decision. Having taken it, for those already in receipt of those pensions but not living here, the Government made sure that people understood that we were not trying to implement it straightaway-we gave quite some notice to people-so that they could adjust their circumstances accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I do not pretend that some hardship will not be caused to these women; it obviously must. But a number of things should be borne in mind. The connection of quite a number of these women to Australia is pretty tenuous anyway. Prior to 1981, as an example, one did not have to be here, one did not actually ever have to have been here, to get some of the pensions we are referring to; one could apply for them out of the country. Indeed, in looking at the widows pensions, I think two-thirds of those that we have looked at so far were widowed outside Australia. Therefore, the connection of some of these women to Australia is not, I would suggest, all that strong. This was allowed to continue over many years. The Government simply decided in February that it ought not be allowed to continue any longer. Having made the decision, we gave 12 months notice and proceeded-and, of course, as Senator Alston would be aware, his own party's election manifesto concurred with what we were doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can well understand that. It will be obvious to all that there will be different permutations and combinations. But the longer the period of residence in Australia, the greater the claim that one would have thought that those women would have had on the welfare system. I do not really subscribe to the view that simply because one pays taxes one has a birthright to pick up some benefits at the retirement stage of one's life. But I would have thought that those women who had been in Australia for many years and who had contributed to the maintenance of the welfare system through paying taxes would have some claim to special preference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Richardson says he is still completing a review of the gradations, why does he feel it necessary to push this through at this stage when there may well be a case for arguing that some cut-off point, be it five or 10 years residence in Australia, ought to constitute an exception? If people have been here for that length of time and then choose to live overseas, should they not be entitled to some greater degree of consideration? This proposal says, `It does not matter whether you have been here for five minutes or 50 years-you are out after 12 months'. </PARA>

I would have thought that during an election campaign it would be proper for either of the major parties to put down a fairly broad statement in the same way that Senator Richardson rushed in with his total replacement of the unemployment benefits system-and he has given himself about 17 months before it will take effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of comments in relation to clause 9 and ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) to clarify something I raised in the second reading debate. I acknowledge that this clause now contains an additional criterion which allows people to move their place of residence if this is necessary under paragraph (c) for the purpose of treating or alleviating a physical disease or illness suffered by the person or by a family member. I congratulate the Government on the speed with which it has picked up one of the anomalies drawn to its attention in the first week of this parliamentary sitting. It would be nice if other things could happen with such speed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I gave examples in the second reading debate of people still having enormous difficulty with their individual circumstances being taken into account when they move to an area where, on the surface, the unemployment level is higher than in the place from which they move, and with other personal circumstances surrounding those moves. I have given examples of people receiving offers of new jobs from small private enterprises which subsequently fall through and then suffering because they are not able to gain unemployment benefits, or of somebody's mother being ill, the house not being finished, and so on. I understand that the Minister and his advisers have taken those things on board. I will be pursuing this in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to look at section A and the term `a family member'. When this legislation was passed it was made clear that if a recipient moved to live with a family member who already had his or her residence in that place, then this was an exemption. Yet I have given the example of a young person who did move, living with family, but where that person lost the unemployment benefit for the 12-week period under section 116 (6) (b) because the family member was neither a mother nor a father. Is the definition this narrow? If it is, I am absolutely staggered. I am quite certain that it has at least been applied that narrowly in one case. I am very concerned that it might have occurred in more than one case. If this is not the intention of the legislation, will the Minister now make a statement and follow that up with some implementation to make sure that it is not this narrowly defined?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things I have done since I have come into this place is push, somewhat successfully, to have the definition of who can be eligible for a carer's pension extended beyond immediate family. The Government was most cooperative and understanding in doing that. If this is an example of a reduction and a restriction of the definition of a family member, then I think we should have that clarified. I would certainly be calling for urgent action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell is quite correct about the narrowing of the definition. We are talking here about immediate family. Senator Powell will recall that I asked for a review of all the people affected thus far by the implementation of the rules on a postponement of the period of payment because of a move to a new place of residence. It has not been possible to take on every aspect of the problems that have been raised about this provision this quickly. I took the opportunity to move on the most obvious one, which was health. I have not been able to move on the lot because I want to have a proper investigation into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can give Senator Powell an assurance that once we have investigated each person affected and if I think it is necessary I will certainly proceed to further amend the Act. In any event, I will provide the honourable senator with the details of the review so that she can make up her own mind as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am still unhappy. We are constantly hearing about families from people in politics. We have to make it clear what a family is. I am not asking the Government to extend the definition of a family beyond all sorts of boundaries, although as a person brought up in a rural community I think we could very well extend the definition and our society would be much better off. I am very worried about a system, which the Australian Democrats opposed very strongly, coming into place and then there being evidence that individuals who are already disadvantaged are being badly disadvantaged by it. Perhaps I should remind the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) that the individual I instanced has one arm, is 17 years of age and cannot get work. That is disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we have to wait for the Minister's assessment and examination of the whole exercise, more and more of these individuals will be disadvantaged, unless we can get some sort of clarification-and they probably will be anyway. It is a matter of enormous concern if `family' is to be very restrictively defined. Surely, what we are trying to do in our community is to promote caring and sharing amongst people, particularly amongst families. Surely this should not be restricted unless absolutely necessary. In many families a relative who is more distant than a mother, father, brother or sister, might very well be the person in the family considered closest. There may be people in this chamber who have had that experience in their own lives. It is not a very satisfactory response to say, `Well, we are examining the situation'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another reason for saying that. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We have undertaken at great length an investigation into another section of this Act which the Democrats opposed, saying that it would cause distress and disadvantage for debt recovery provisions. The Committee will be coming down with a report fairly soon, I hope. I do not want to pre-empt it; I just want to say that it is possible to do the wrong thing in legislation and disadvantaged people. It is also possible to lumber committees with investigations that could very well have been avoided if we had taken action as legislators. I am still concerned about this, and I hope that everything possible will be done to make sure that severe disadvantaged does not occur because of narrow thinking on the part of the Government or those administering its policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was regarded as sufficient justification because people who are unemployed are often under stress, in need of extra family support and that can very often be provided by a member of the immediate family, as we see now, although, as I have indicated, I will review that to see whether it is unduly harsh. For people in these circumstances the support of family members is very often important to them and we did not want to unduly restrict movement.

<PARA>Page 5, after clause 8, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``8a. Section 81 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in section 81 after `prescribed educational scheme' ``, with the exception of the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme,''.''</PARA>
<PARA>The reason that I am moving this amendment is to give effect to the declared intention of the Minister to seek to have the Act amended in that way. The Committee will recall that on 17 May I raised with the Minister the case of a mother who lived in an isolated area of Tasmania. Her child was boarding in Hobart in order to attend secondary school. She appealed against the removal of her family allowance payment when her child reached 16 years of age because she was receiving a boarding allowance for her student child under the assistance for isolated children scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary to the Department of Social Security, pursuant to section 81 of the Social Security Act, removed the family allowance because the mother was receiving a boarding allowance for her child under the assistance for isolated children scheme. I posed the question to the Minister as to whether it was fair for parents living in isolated areas to suffer such a financial penalty simply because the child turned 16. I pointed out to the Minister that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, whilst having no alternative but to deny the appeal on technical grounds, said that the case of the mother was a `reasonable case' and that `it seems unreasonable that receipt of AIC boarding allowance should disqualify receipt of family allowance'. That was the statement of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister responded quite positively. Having asked his Department for a good reason as to why the provisions were included in the Act as they are, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot find a good reason. It seems to me certainly to be harsh, unconscionable and oppressive that this should occur. I am not aware of any other case although I will have that double-checked for you. I think it is the only time it has happened. Nonetheless, even if it were to happen only once or twice, it should not happen and I shall seek to have the Act amended to make sure it does not happen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason that it did happen is to be found in the actual text of section 81 of the Act, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Where the Secretary is satisfied that payments under a prescribed educational scheme are being or will be made to or in respect of a student child, other than a child by reference to whom the rate of those payments is increased, the Secretary shall decide that family allowance in respect of that child ceases to be payable as from a family allowance pay day specified in the decision (whether before or after the making of the decision), not being a day before . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Section 79 (1) of the Act includes in the definition of `prescribed education scheme' the assistance for isolated children scheme. Therein lies the unintended consequence and the cause for the denial of the appeal of the mother in this case, on technical grounds, and therein lies, I believe, the reason that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal itself suggested that it was unreasonable for the family allowance to be withdrawn in that circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment simply seeks to amend section 81 of the principal Act so as to remove `assistance for isolated children scheme' from the definition of `prescribed educational scheme'. I think it is very reasonable because, as was pointed out by the mother in this case, the fact that her child turned 16 did not mean that she was any less expensive to keep boarding in Hobart. The reverse is the case, because we have seen figures to that effect, but I will not go into that. The fact is that, as the Minister said in his response to us, it seemed to him that it was harsh, unconscionable and oppressive that this should occur. The purpose of my moving the amendment was to give effect to what the Minister had indicated and also to the view expressed by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal that this was unreasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our problem with this particular clause of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill concerns amounts. We have no great problem with the idea that Austudy and unemployment benefits should be at one and the same level-pegged, as it were-but our problem is with the reduction of the unemployment benefit down to Austudy levels. Other than to save money, why has this been done? Is there a particular reason for this being done?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the rates on which married people will now be required to somehow survive, are there any surveys or research to show that people were in fact marrying in order to get any sort of extra benefit? Again we particularly draw the Government's attention to the very small allowance that married under 18-year-olds are required to live on. Marrying at that very young age is surely enough of a handicap without having this additional problem. Frequently children who do marry at this age do not have a lot of parental support and are not welcome in one or other of the parental homes. I ask the Government: How are these young people expected to live when each of them is only entitled to that very small amount of money?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The same unemployment benefit rate is currently payable to young people irrespective of whether they live at home or away from home. However, Austudy recipients who live at home receive lower rates of payments than those who live away from home. The new at-home rate of unemployment benefits for 18- to 20-years olds of $69.20 a week and the away from home rate of $105.15 a week are the same as the at home and away from home Austudy rates. That change is consistent with the principles of the common allowance structure and further reduces financial incentives for young people to discontinue full time study. I mentioned that at the end of my contribution when summing up the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think if we want to encourage young people to remain in the education system we must realise that if we have an unemployment benefit higher than the rate which they attract if they stay within the education system a lot of them will opt for the unemployment benefit rate. That is the reason for this change, and I suspect that by so changing it we might at least maintain, if not increase, the numbers in full time study. </PARA>

<PARA>(2) Pages 5 and 6, paragraph 10 (1) (a), line 31, (page 5), to line 11, (page 6), leave out the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>We seek to amend clause 10 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill by removing a paragraph from clause 10. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, has not really answered the questions put by Senator Lees. Perhaps he just does not want to say that it is cheaper to do it that way; it obviously is. This proposed section effectively increases the age of dependency. In doing that, it places more stress on families. The amounts are higher for those people who are not living at home-which, of course, is appropriate-but none of those amounts are very much above subsistence level. That is a major concern and one of the reasons we seek to leave out the paragraph, as our amendment suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle of having parity between Austudy and the unemployment benefit is the way to go. However, given that Austudy is not an adequate payment-indeed, it is almost a disincentive-and given the difficulties of gaining part-time employment in order to subsidise staying in education, we believe that the Government should be giving the highest priority to raising Austudy payments rather than to reducing the unemployment benefit to Austudy levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are opposing this clause in toto because what is happening here is a very good example of the approach that has been taken recently in legislation with regard to the unemployment benefit. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, we believe this takes the whole exercise beyond what we can support. True it is that the rationale for increasing penalties and restrictions is that we do not want welfare fraud. We do not want welfare fraud any more than anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, concern has been expressed by organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Australian Council of Social Service that one can go beyond a point where one is really making available the opportunity for income support as a genuine safety net to those people who need it. This clause imposes non-payment periods of four weeks and two weeks for each additional occasion where unemployment is due to a voluntary act, to misconduct, to failure to accept an offer of employment or to undergo a medical examination or to take reasonable steps to seek employment. These provisions have been in the Act before but the periods have been extended. This clause also adds two further areas: refusal to comply with requests to attend a Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) office departmental interview or to respond to correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not saying that requirements for appearance at offices, requirements to accept offers of employment, requirements to take reasonable steps and so on should not be in the Act. What we are saying is that the requirements that are currently there are sufficient. To add to the penalties and to the requirements does nothing to make the system that is here a better safety net and does very little in the area of genuine prevention of real fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be many perfectly valid and human reasons for any of these provisions not being met. We are concerned-and examples have been given already in this debate-at the lack of ability of the Department of Social Security and the CES, either separately or in joint operation, as they increasingly are, to be able to handle these matters with any kind of sensitivity, even with adequate information at their disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> It therefore seems to us that we are going beyond what is reasonable in this clause. We cannot support that extension of the stress and the consequent distress of those people who are unemployed in an environment where there still are not enough jobs for all those people who want them. With regard to these sorts of provisions, we are concerned about people's access to speedy appeal, and we are conscious of the history of difficulties in these areas. One example is unemployment due to misconduct. Some individual has to determine whether that is in fact the reason for a person moving into unemployment. That comes down to what the previous employer says, what the previous employee says, and the assessment that is made in the CES and then at the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example is failure to accept an offer of employment. Clearly, there would be many young women, for instance, who would go to a place of employment and be extremely uneasy about the prospect of working in that workplace because of the implications and insinuations that might be made that might make young women fear some form of sexual harassment or some other form of rather subtle mistreatment which might not be able to be proven. It will be very difficult for these women if we continue to make the penalties for these sorts of processes more draconian and if we add other requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> So we believe that there are unreasonable expectations here. I point out that the Government's expectations for savings here are $3.2m in the first year and $6.5m in the second year, which seem to us to be rather small-not that one sneezes at a million dollars here or there; but we are conscious, given the history of these sorts of provisions in the Act, of the distress that is caused and the ultimate consequence that many people, particularly isolated people, have to face these kinds of provisions. How are we handling things such as requests to attend CES offices when people in isolated areas are obviously not physically able to do that on demand or with great frequency or without difficulty? How are we handling cases where correspondence is not replied to for a range of reasons-it was not picked up, the dog took it out of the letterbox, the person was away for a period, it was lost in the mail, or whatever?</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about these provisions and we are not prepared to take them any further. We think that the tests in the system now are adequate and, indeed, we are concerned about how they are being carried out and we do not want to extend them any further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, there is no question that the intent of this clause is to be punitive. I would not seek to deny that, but I believe it is well targeted. I think the problem with the system as it exists at the moment is that repeated offenders, if you like, those who habitually do not attend interviews, know that they can get themselves back on benefits very smartly, and do so. There are many other people, though, not knowing that, who miss an interview and who could be off benefits for longer periods. We want to make sure that the smarties cannot take advantage of the situation, because there is no equity if that current situation is to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must be understood that there is the situation where Department of Social Security (DSS) staff are lined up for an interview at a Commonwealth Employment Service office. They take the time to go to the CES office to be ready for the interview, and obviously when people do not attend those interviews there is a considerable wastage of the time of DSS staff. We are developing guidelines for what sufficient reasons for non-attendance at an interview might be. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Powell" NAMEID="O14">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator Powell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are passing legislation and you have not got the guidelines?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we are, because we must address what at the moment is an obvious anomaly which advantages those who are seeking to abuse the system. We cannot allow that to happen. It is going to be my job to make sure that the Department administers this in such a way as not to disadvantage those who do not attend an interview for what we consider to be a sufficient reason. If that is the case, I will make sure that they are not treated harshly, and we will make sure that DSS officers are informed of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it should also be taken into account that there are review officers at every area office whom people affected by this can consult and there are expedited appeals before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT). I understand that that completely independent body can deal with appeals of this nature in a matter of two or three days. So it will not be the harsh provision which Senator Powell is suggesting it might be. For those who are wronged, or even think they are, then the appeal procedure is there, first through a review officer and then by those at the SSAT, over which the Department has no control. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this provision enables us to make sure that offenders who are repeatedly not attending interviews do not go straight back onto benefits. It will act as a deterrent to that kind of behaviour. If one believes in the philosophy behind that-to encourage those who are on unemployment benefit to make an effort to seek work-then one has to give real strength to activity and work tests. This is just part of that general philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also raised the question: What happens to people in isolated areas? What happens to people who do not reply to correspondence? Again, if they do not reply to correspondence, they can be taken off benefits. Reviews are available very quickly. People take advantage of them. People in isolated areas have particular difficulties and we do not seek to make them attend offices which are difficult to get to without giving them plenty of notice. We do not seek to make them attend job interviews without giving them plenty of notice. I do not believe that there is a harsh administration for people who are in that situation. Obviously, we take these matters into account. </PARA>
<PARA> So that we are exact about the figures, for Senator Alston's benefit, if one looks at those intractables in the over 50 years of age group, one sees that they make up only 9 per cent of those who have been unemployed for less than 12 months. That figure jumps alarmingly to 25 per cent of those who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months. They are the hard core, difficult group that we will have to watch very carefully when it comes to the administration of the Newstart program. They are the ones that we seek to help. They are the ones who need the most help, but they are the ones for whom looking for a job is the most difficult. That is an example of how we will have to tailor the administration of our programs to make sure that people in the more difficult categories are looked after. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address one of those difficult categories. I am conscious that this is the International Year of Literacy and we are here introducing a provision with regard to answering mail. I ask that special consideration be given to those who might be hiding their illiteracy. This might be the first opportunity for somebody to discover the illiteracy of a person who has been seeking work. They must be treated compassionately. No doubt there will be some figures in the Budget Papers when we come to the next stage of this whole process. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has mentioned the review officers. They are an addition to what we have had in the past, made necessary by the need for quick review provisions as we have become more targeted in this system. We need more review officers. That is one thing that is being constantly told to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are told what the savings are in relation to this measure; but if we are really honest, what would be the additional costs of this particular measure in servicing people humanely, compassionately and efficiently? Additional requests for attendance at Commonwealth Employment Service offices will be sent out. There is going to be additional correspondence which has to be replied to. There are all those other actions which are part of the activity and work tests which are getting more and more stringent. More staff will be required if they are going to be compassionately implemented. We would be interested if there was a separate costing of this part of the exercise, just as there is a separate savings figure put down before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer particularly to clause 16 (e). The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) stated that the Government is mainly after repeat offenders, which seems quite reasonable. However, first offenders have also been penalised harder. I ask him why that is so if what the Government is really after is repeat offenders. In particular, I am still concerned about the idea that somehow the unemployed just need a little more education or a little bit more incentive and then those people are going to be able to get jobs. The jobs are becoming scarcer and harder to get. In particular, work that will take young people out of poverty by lifting their incomes above the poverty line is becoming rarer and harder to find. Does the Minister agree with that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When one looks at the labour market at the moment, one sees it is clear that it has been tightening. So I do not dispute that there are difficulties for people in these circumstances. This legislation does not make it any more difficult. It just means that we are ensuring that people continue to make an effort. Senator Lees said something that was incorrect. She said that in some way we are seeking to have a harsher penalty for first offenders. The penalty previously was two weeks, and it will be two weeks after this legislation is introduced. The harsher penalty comes in for the second, third, et cetera times because we have gone from the old system of two weeks and then four, six, eight, 10 and 12 weeks et cetera, to a situation of still having two weeks for the first offence but then six, 12 and 18 weeks-moving on by a longer period for repeated failure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are opposing this clause. This is a provision which provides that unemployed people may not claim sickness benefit during the education leaver deferment period which in the current Act is either six or 13 weeks, depending on circumstances. We have had objections to many aspects of this legislation, but this one we find extraordinarily objectionable. We object to the extension of the deferment period for education leavers when that was implemented on the basis that if a person completes his or her education it is complete; he or she is in the work force and therefore ought to be eligible for the unemployment benefit. If such persons leave at the end of a course, clearly they are ready for employment; they are part of the employment market. If they leave during the years of secondary schooling, I think we can also say-and my experience with these young people would indicate it-that they believe that that education is now of no value to them and that they ought to be treated as though they were in the work force, which would mean that they ought to be eligible for unemployment benefit, for income support, while they seek work. However, this has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are saying is that those young people may not claim sickness benefit in that same period. It is useful, I think to note that one of the major concerns among those people who deal with homeless young people-bearing in mind the very low rates of the income support that are available anyway and the stress on families that this whole program of income support, so-called, is increasingly creating-is that we are having an increasing pool of young, unemployed, homeless people. One of the major problems they suffer is illness, for many reasons-through lack of nutrition, lack of shelter, or substance abuse of one kind or another. Here we have a provision that these people may not claim sickness benefit during the school education leaver deferment period which is up to 13 weeks in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA> We find this an extraordinarily odious provision and, perhaps, something of the flavour of things to come when we are told in post-election statements by Ministers of this Government that the area next to be targeted is sickness and disablement areas. They also point out that the massive saving-we will probably be told it is a net saving, but I am not sure about that-is $0.1m, $100,000. This saving arises from young people not being able to apply for sickness benefit at a time when they are without any income support whatsoever and are supposed to be establishing to all of us the fact that they are actually out there seeking work; but we will not give them any income support in that period anyhow, and if they should be eligible for sickness benefit by virtue of all the other criteria, we are now going to render them ineligible by virtue of the fact that they are education leavers. We oppose this odious clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That decision was taken some time ago. It is not up for debate today. Such an education leaver is eligible for sickness benefit, so the situation is that the education leaver has not lost earnings by virtue of illness or injury, and has not been disqualified for unemployment benefits or Job Search allowance by virtue of that illness or injury. So the education leaver claiming sickness benefit has a financial advantage over a fit education leaver who is ineligible for an unemployment benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures which Senator Powell has cited quite a bit during this debate show that the savings are negligible. It is not a question of the Government desperately searching for savings; it is merely an attempt to correct an obvious anomaly. Any cases of genuine hardship-if we are worried about those people on the streets, as Senator Powell puts it-will be eligible for special benefits. We are only redressing an anomaly. All of the cases of genuine hardship can be dealt with under the special benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a problem with the drafting of Senator Harradine's amendment which, I think, renders the Committee incapable of agreeing to it. Senator Harradine's amendment proposes an amendment to section 81 of the Social Security Act. That would be fine except that that section was repealed by section 48 of Act No. 164 of 1989 with effect from 1 January 1990. The repealed section referred to payments made under a prescribed education scheme, whereas the equivalent provision now refers to a prescribed student child. The concept of the prescribed student child recurs in the Act in a number of different parts. Sub-sections 3 (1), 3 (13) and 82 (1) (aa) are examples of those recurrences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is feasible that an amendment with the same effect as Senator Harradine's could be drafted, but this would not be an easy task. It would be quite a complicated one, and I do not believe that we would be able to achieve that tonight. At the very least, I think that the assistance of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel would be required. I think that now is not the time to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes back to the Frankcombe case from which this arose, it should be noted that when Senator Harradine raised this matter in the Senate I said that it was the only case of its kind. I think that there are 2,300 children in receipt of assistance for isolated children. This is the only time that a case of the kind that Senator Harradine has mentioned has come up. If we could wait and draft the section properly, we may well come up with the results that Senator Harradine wants without causing any extra unintended consequences of the kind that he has said tonight he wishes to avoid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for his advice on this subject. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that my amendment was soundly based on two foundations. The first foundation was the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal of 9 January 1990; and the second foundation was the resources that are available to honourable senators from the Senate itself-the legislative drafting resources. It is on those two foundations that I put forward the amendment which the Minister now says may well be defective because of some changes in the wording of section 81 from, as he says, 1 January 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If they were the changes, why did the Social Security Appeals Tribunal not refer to those changes? In fact, in attachments to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal decision the provisions of section 81 and section 79 (1) are set out quite clearly. In section 79 (1) a prescribed educational scheme was to include assistance for the isolated children's scheme. In was on that very issue that the whole question turned. In fact, the Secretary to the Department had no alternative other than technically to withdraw the family allowance in this case even though the Social Security Appeals Tribunal-and everyone in the chamber, most particularly the Minister-acknowledges that that is oppressive. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the words that he used, which are quite forceful and proper, but, indeed, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal indicated that it is left with the view that disqualification from family allowance for the named student child because of the receipt of assistance for isolated children payments in the form of a boarding allowance is possibly an unintended consequence of the legislation. After having said that it is unreasonable, the Tribunal now says that it is possibly an unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the reason I have put the actual date of commencement in, which is the date from which the family allowances were removed, is to overcome that unintended consequence. I would be happy to accept an undertaking by the Minister, if he would give it to the Committee, having acknowledged the problem and the possibility of the defectiveness of the amendment that is now before the Committee and the need to make sure that whatever amendment comes before the Parliament it is legally sustainable, that that will be done and that the unintended consequences of the previous legislation will be rectified; namely, that the operative date will, in fact, be the date that I mentioned-8 July 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to take part in this discussion but, after what I have just heard, I must challenge what is being done. This arrangement was described earlier as `a total overhaul of the unemployment benefit system' and `an initiative'. If one takes an initiative one imagines that something new is being done and faults are being corrected. Certainly, if a total overhaul is being undertaken, any faults which the Minister has been made aware of would have been addressed, or at least considered. It seems to me that there was ample opportunity for the correct drafting, using the proper resources available to the Government, to have been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was not just a case of Senator Harradine raising this matter tonight. As the Minister has already been quoted, he was well aware of it and he undertook to bring about an amendment. It is very disappointing for me, expecting things to be done here, to witness this lack of resolve from the Government and lack of an intention to solve the problems of which it has already been made aware. I can only express my disappointment at that. </PARA>

Given the fact that this is the only time the Frankcombe case has arisen and it came in front of a number of important issues in which I am involved, I will not apologise for a 12-day time lapse.

In other words, if an assets test is run and people come up who have got so few assets that it barely rates on the scale at all-I am only picking for ease of argument tonight a figure of about $50,000-we could perhaps consider an additional special benefit for those young people who are going to fall off the assets test altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Training Guarantee Bill have as their objectives, according to the provisions of the Training Guarantee Bill, to increase and improve the quality of and employment related skills of the Australian work force. The Opposition has no quarrel with those objectives. They are widely shared in the community, and I think it is recognised very clearly that training for the work force to improve its skills, to retrain because of developments which require new skills, is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Opposition differs fundamentally with the Government about the way these objectives can be achieved. The legislation seeks to do this in a typical way that one associates with this Government-to impose upon a selected group in the community, namely, a limited number of employers, a charge to the extent that they fail to meet the Government's requirements for training. That is what these Bills do. That is their whole purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition fundamentally disagrees with the Government's approach to solving this problem. We are opposed to it because it amounts to a tax on a small section of the community, namely the group of employers selected by this legislation. I will deal with that in detail as I develop my argument. Essentially, our problem with this legislation is that the Government has chosen a selective approach and a heavy-handed and bureaucratic solution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that training is desirable. That is also the widely accepted view of the community. But our solution to these problems is totally different from that of the Government. We see the solution to these problems in working through the ordinary pressures and forces placed on employers when working in their own interests. We believe in providing incentives and government leadership so as to encourage greater training without putting impediments and further taxes on the employers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, this legislation is presented, by use of words, as not instituting a new tax. The fact is that that is just what it is doing. In the first year of this legislation's operation the Government will raise hundreds of millions of dollars. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) says that that amount will reduce as more people satisfy the requirements imposed upon them by this legislation to train not only people in their own work force but also others. As those obligations are met, the amount raised by the Government will decrease. But even if that pious hope is achieved, the Government will recover substantial moneys and place them into a separate fund, admittedly, to be spent by the Government on the objectives of the legislation, namely retraining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather ironic that the Government has sought to present this legislation not as a taxing measure. The language used during the second reading speech and indeed in the Bill emphasises the fact that it is not the Government's purpose to collect further revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> According to an opinion that I have received, the only way that this Bill could be constitutional would be if it came within the taxation powers. Indeed, according to the opinion I have received, it is probably unconstitutional legislation because the measures in the Bill do not amount to taxation in the constitutional sense. But that is an argument for another place on another day. I do not propose to spend my time tonight developing that constitutional argument. Nevertheless, there is a threshold problem for the Government with this legislation. It may well be that whatever we do with it in this Parliament, it will fail under a constitutional challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's concerns about this Bill are not on those grounds. That is really a problem for the Government. Our concern is to oppose this legislation in its entirety because, as I have said, we believe that the Government is going about solving this problem in completely the wrong way. In our view, the effect of this Bill is to place a new impost on a selected group of people in the business community. It is part of a long line of legislation that has been brought down by this Government over the years, imposing more and more taxation on business. It is in the same tradition as has been achieved by the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and the new provisions to accelerate the payment of taxation in the business community. It is particularly directed against a relatively small number of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very important exception in the Bill which is designed to protect small business. That exception of a payroll threshold of $200,000 a year, is in itself an inadequate protection, even for small business. With that threshold the Bill will impose these obligations on a minority of employers, even though many of those people will be categorised as small business because the threshold of $200,000 a year for the payroll of a business will exempt only businesses with perhaps as few as six or seven employees. Even the Minister has stated that clearly businesses that are employing 10 or more people will come within its provisions. Nevertheless, as far as a majority of employers are concerned they will be relieved from obligations under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is clearly an impost on a relatively small number of employers and certainly a small number of people in the community, whereas the object and purpose of this legislation is to benefit the community generally by improving the quality of the work force and thereby the benefits which the whole of the community will receive if that work force is better trained, better skilled and able to produce better quality products both for domestic consumption and exports. The whole of the community will benefit by improving the skills of our work force. As I have said, that is an objective with which the Opposition agrees. However, placing the whole burden of this legislation on a small group in the community we believe is a very unjust way of going about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely so. It is only a selected group in the community who are having to pay it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also chosen one of the worst ways of taxing any section of the community. Even this small section of the community is going to be taxed on its payroll. There is no worse tax in Australia than the payroll tax; it is counterproductive because the employer has to pay it whether he is making a profit or not. There is no better way of reducing or killing the incentive to employ people than to have a tax on payrolls. We have already had years of experience of this sort of tax at the Commonwealth level. Let us give credit where it is due. It was a Commonwealth government that introduced the whole concept of a payroll tax. Some 20 years ago the Commonwealth generously handed that poisoned chalice to the States, so it is now a State tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a thoroughly regressive form of taxation. In the States the exemption from paying it is at a higher level. Even the State with the most benign form of payroll tax has a threshold which is higher than the one proposed under this tax. It is a selective tax imposed on a small group in the community. The method of paying the tax is the worst and the most counterproductive form that one could think of, particularly when presumably one wants to encourage employers to spend more money to train their employees better and to increase the level of skilled employment and employment generally. It will discourage employers from employing more people as well as from training them. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major weakness in this legislation is that it is simply imposed across the board on all employers above the threshold and has no regard to the nature of any particular employer's work force. It is not targeted to the encouragement of training because it is not targeted to the particular section of the work force which is most likely to benefit from training and which the employers are likely to see some benefit in training. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a whole range of examples of employees in respect of whom, because of their payroll, employers will have to pay this tax. It is very difficult to see how any benefit would be obtained by employers from that expenditure, which they are being encouraged to make because, by making what is called `eligible expenditure' under this Act, employers will be able to avoid paying the tax. A classic example of this is Drake International, which is a body that employs people who are immediately seconded to other employers. That is the nature of its business. It finds skilled people whom it technically employs, but does no more than act as agents to second those people to other employers. </PARA>
<PARA> A company of this kind will come within this Act. Its employees will come within the provisions of the Act and it will have to pay this tax or provide training for people who it does not, in fact, have working for them at all, although the employees may have that legal status. They are people who have the skills. They are chosen for employment simply because they have the skills that are wanted by the people who are benefiting from them. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are other categories of people who are themselves not likely to benefit from training and where the nature of the work means that the employer does not require them to have anything more than minimal training. If they have been trained at all, they do not need very much training. They are all the categories, say, of casual employees, seasonal workers and so forth. They include all those employees whose work enterprise does not require a high level of skill, where there is very little room for multi-skilling or for career paths and where there could very well be a high turnover of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are other employers most of whose work force is already highly skilled. This includes people in the professions who, although many would be working in partnerships, would be employing a number of people with high skills who have already received training with their professional education. They may need to keep up with that but would not do so under the concept of training which is part and parcel of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is impossible to try to amend this legislation because of the way it has been structured by the Government. That is why, despite the fact that we support the objectives of the Bill, we can see no way in which this legislation can be satisfactorily amended-certainly not without full consideration by a Senate committee, and that is another proposal that we will be making and one which I will deal with in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other serious problem that we have with this legislation is the concept of what is called the eligible training expenditure. Let us assume that we have justifiably selected the target of this tax-namely, a relatively small group of employers-and that these employers are employing people who may in fact benefit from training, and certainly a large number of such employees may well benefit from training in the way in which this Bill proposes its arbitrary and generalised concepts about the matter. But there are very considerable limits as to what will be eligible training expenditure. As I said, unless employers can come within these narrow definitions of expenditure that will be eligible-that is, can be used by the employer to set against the tax, or the charge, as the Bill calls it-the tax will be imposed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> A great range of problems emerges here. Firstly, what is excluded entirely from this Bill is the ordinary on the job unstructured training which has always been, and always will be, a very important part of the development of skills of any employees, whether they are professional people, people with high technical skills, semi-skilled people or people who are unskilled and who will never be skilled. It has always been a very important part of training that these people are trained on the job by people who are taking an interest in and supervising what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> But the definition of eligible training prevents that in itself from being included because the Bill requires that any eligible training program has to be a structured training program. Proposed section 27 goes to great lengths to establish what is meant by this and thereby to greatly limit the sort of expenditure that can qualify. For instance, a training program is only a structured training program if it satisfies a number of conditions set out in the section. The program has to be designed or approved by a person who is appropriately qualified to design such a program; the skills to be acquired are to be clearly identified before the program begins; the means of imparting the skills are to be identified before the program begins; before the program begins, the expected program outcomes are to be clearly formulated; and so on. The Bill goes on with the final sting in the tail that an eligible training program cannot include any generally supervised practice or work experience. So unless that most important form of training-namely, generally supervised practice or work experience-is part of one of the structured training programs set up in that bureaucratic, theoretical, arbitrary fashion as laid down in this legislation, it will not qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, as I have sought to point out, many great deficiencies in this legislation. We in the Opposition cannot see how this Bill can be improved-if it ever could be-without a great deal more thought and much more consideration of submissions from people who know what they are doing in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We have fundamental objections to it, as I have said, and we propose to vote against the second reading. However, if the Senate does ot accept that view and gives the legislation a second reading, we believe that the only other suitable course that we could adopt would be to endeavour to send it off to a Senate committee to see whether something could be done to make it a more workable piece of legislation than it appears to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the extent to which the legislation will impose further imposts, not only on large businesses or middle-sized businesses, but on small business. Any business which is employing more than 10 people will clearly come within its operation. There will be very great additional administrative costs imposed upon business in giving effect to all of the bureaucratic steps that will be required under this legislation. For all of those reasons, we believe that the Senate should defeat this legislation. It should tell the Government to try to do better. The Government should come up with a far more positive incentive, if it believes that that is required, in order to improve the level of training and the development of skills in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the pressure of business before us this week, I wish to speak only briefly on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990. I want to focus on the justification and need for these measures rather than the details of the legislation itself. However, I point out that Senator Durack has just said that the Government is going about this the wrong way. Well, we have waited a very long time. A succession of coalition governments did nothing about the situation and certainly did not seem to know what was the right way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The training guarantee will require employers to spend a minimum amount at least on training. Many employers, of course, are spending much more than that minimum amount on the training of their work force and these measures will not affect them. Rather, they are targeted at those employers who are making little or no effort to train or retrain their work force. Those employers will be required to pay the equivalent of one per cent initially, and 1.5 per cent from June 1992, on structured training activities, or pay a levy of that amount. I would argue that that levy is not a tax in the usual sense because it will not go into Consolidated Revenue; rather, it will be dedicated to funding additional training activities in the community. The legislation excludes very small-scale employers whose payroll does not exceed $200,000 per annum, and that threshold amount will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that these Bills were released in draft form earlier this year to enable public discussion and comment and this is the reason for some of the Government amendments. Such amendments, particularly after a draft exposure, show that the Government is being honest in its intentions and is willing to listen to community suggestions-this is probably far more profitable than sending it off to a Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme, many of us believed that it was wrong to expect some future employees to contribute to the costs of their education while employers, who stood to gain a great deal from a well trained and educated work force, were in many cases contributing little or nothing to the cost of that educated work force. In some cases, employers who may have had little education themselves were employing lawyers, accountants, engineers and so on to run their businesses-expertise to whose costs they had contributed nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> At the basic job training and apprenticeship level there are many companies, some very large as well as small businesses, who have taken little responsibility for training their work force, preferring to rely on those who have been apprenticed or been given training by other employers. Before I was elected to the Senate, I worked for many years as a student counsellor in a high school and was made constantly aware that the number of apprenticeships offered came nowhere near meeting the number of qualified and eager applicants. </PARA>
<PARA> The group apprenticeship scheme, which enables a group of usually small businesses to share the training of an apprentice, has overcome the difficulty of an employer who wanted to train his or her staff but could not provide the range of training experience required or could not meet the full cost of their training. But there were and there still are many businesses who prefer to poach or head-hunt those trained by others. This legislation aims to correct that situation, at least for employers whose payroll exceeds $200,000, which is not to say, of course, that smaller businesses do not have some responsibility for training, but it is recognised that a levy would fall unduly heavily on those employing very few people. In any case, it is my experience that there are many small employers, particularly in the skilled trade area such as the local electrician, plumber and so on, who are meeting their responsibilities for training, perhaps because they remember their own training, which they got the hard way. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that one of the major problems with many Australian companies at the moment is their concentration on short term goals and short term gains rather than on the long term viability, profitability and growth of their operations. In the training area, as with research and development investment, this means an unwillingness to invest in training, at a relatively short term cost, when in the long term they will benefit from a work force which is not only better trained but also more likely to stay with a particular employer who has helped to train them or perhaps in a job which they have been specifically trained for in that enterprise. At the same time employers are benefiting from increased retention rates in education as they do through public provision of child-care and labour market programs such as Jobstart and Skillshare, largely at the expense of the general taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of a lot of public discussion about the need for a better trained work force-a need recognised by major employer organisations, particularly in the context of industry restructure needed to meet Australia's present economic needs-the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures in April indicated no significant increase in structured training over the past two years. The ABS found that more than half of the targeted employers for this legislation-those with a payroll exceeding $200,000-spent nothing on structured training. This is a levy targetted to those employers, those not currently investing in training or investing very little. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of training in the legislation is broad-not broad enough, I hope, to be fiddled, but broad enough, for example, for donations to training schemes in tertiary institutions to replace direct spending in the workplace. The proceeds of levies collected will be used to fund additional training activities. So it does not affect those already meeting their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> One example I would like to give of an employer who is doing that is a very large company, the Ford Motor Co., whose factory at Campbellfield in my own State of Victoria not only provides a wide-ranging training program for all levels of its work force, but also shares its excellent facilities with technical and further education institutions and neighbouring industries. Other large operations would do well to follow Ford's example. </PARA>
<PARA> I support these Bills as a further step in ensuring that the cost burden for training is shared in an equitable way by a sector which has accepted the benefits of skilling without necessarily contributing to them. No doubt there will be attempts to circumvent the payment of the levy where applicable, just as the fringe benefits tax has sometimes been evaded by converting a business meal into `a seminar'. It will need to be monitored to ensure that the intent of the legislation is carried out. There are penalty clauses, for example, for failure to provide information or for the provision of false information, and those will be an added incentive to conform. I believe this is a missing piece in the education and training jigsaw and I hope it will neatly fit into the total picture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating two pieces of legislation-the Training Guarantee Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990. The Australian Democrats welcome these pieces of legislation. When they were announced last year we welcomed them in principle. This year, when we saw the drafts, we welcomed the level of detail that the Government had put into them. We believe that all employers need to accept responsibility for training their employees. I acknowledge that to date a very large number of Australian firms have already recognised the great value of training to their industry and to their particular businesses. Many Australian firms have embarked on substantial training programs. I have great admiration for these firms and the work that they have done. In many instances they are world leaders in methodologies and approaches to training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, however, there are still some employers who devote little or no time, money or effort to this task. Some rely on the public education system to perform this role for them, while others simply poach staff from other employers who have spent their money on training. It is primarily these particular firms to which this legislation applies. The training guarantee will ensure that there is a more equitable distribution of costs of training across all employers in Australia. Those employers who have, to date, been having a free ride on others will cease to do so when this legislation comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills that we have before us are, as was mentioned by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in his second reading speech, the result of extensive consultation and negotiation. This negotiation has taken place not only between the Government and other bodies, but also between the Australian Democrats and a whole range of industrial and academic bodies throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft Bills which were released by the Government in February this year represented a welcome approach to dealing with these types of matters. The Australian Democrats, having read those Bills, fully supported the overall thrust of the legislation; but we saw what we believed were major inadequacies in the then proposed Bills which we believe worked against industry and threatened the effectiveness of the legislation to achieve its desired aim. The Democrats recognise that the nature of this legislation is such that the support of industry is absolutely essential for its effective implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> As party spokesperson on employment, education and training, I undertook a range of meetings with a whole group of bodies throughout Australia to see what their concerns were with the draft legislation that they had had in their hands for some time. Those meetings were very revealing to me because they showed the enormous support and regard that industry has for training. This is something which is extremely welcome and augurs well for the future of this country. The other concerns that industry had were those that we had, having read the draft legislation. As a consequence of those discussions, I was able to undertake further discussions with representatives of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and with the Minister, in which I set out what I believed was a regime that we would be able to follow and which would have the support of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These particular suggestions were accepted by the Government and I think those changes now have increased markedly the efficiency of this legislation and provide a much more conducive environment in which training can be conducted. Included in these changes are the following: the partial devolution of responsibility for the Bill's administration away from the Australian Taxation Office to the registered peak industry bodies; the inclusion of a depreciation clause for capital expenditure on training; exemption from some of the more specific requirements of the Bill for those firms which can demonstrate that they already have and will continue to have an exceptional commitment to training; and the inclusion of a variety of items such as study leave, occupational health and safety and industrial relations as eligible training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in terms of the draft legislation, perhaps the greatest concern that I had was the assumption of responsibility for the operation by the Taxation Office. This concern, I must admit, stemmed from a number of grounds, not the least of which is the administration by the Taxation Office of the taxation deductions for self-education expenses which over the years have become so narrow and so restrictive as to become almost non-existent in terms of their original effect. I did not believe that the Taxation Office was the relevant office or had the relevant expertise to deal with this matter. I rather thought that the Taxation Office's involvement in this should be restricted to its area of responsibility; that is, if in fact a claim had been made for an eligible amount of expenditure, the Taxation Office was obviously the department responsible to check simply that that expenditure had been expended. In the original draft of the legislation the Taxation Office's operation would have gone much further than that. In addition to that proposition, one of my priorities-I believe it was the priority of the Government as well-was to have a minimum amount of bureaucracy involved with regard to the establishment of this particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed alternative, which is now in the legislation before the Senate, allows the peak industry bodies to become registered for the purposes of some of the Tax Office's former duties under the draft legislation. These bodies will now be authorised to advise on guidelines for eligible training expenditure; to deal with issues of interpretation with respect to the definition of training; and to approve individual firms' training programs as eligible training programs for the purposes of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very glad that the Government saw the value of this particular alternative scheme because I think it was that one move which brought on side a very large number of people in industry who had previously been prepared to undertake a very noisy and possibly effective campaign against this legislation. The fact that they did not go ahead with that was due to the fact that they saw this change put the exercise of this particular legislation back into their hands, as people who had been responsible to date for the training in their own industry and who, under the legislation, would be able to be responsible for the continuation of training within their particular industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice, then, an individual firm can now go to its industry body at the beginning of the financial year with specific details of training programs it wants to undertake in the coming year. Its industry body will be able to examine those particular proposals and before any time or money is spent it will be able to say that those proposals are acceptable. Where an employer's training proposal is appropriate, the industry training body will be able to issue a certificate stating that this is the case. Then if, for example, the Tax Office for whatever reason decides to conduct an audit, all these firms will need to do is show that they have spent the prescribed amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, under the draft legislation initially put forward there would have been great uncertainty. One would not have known until the Australian Taxation Office had knocked back one's expenditure that one had a problem. Then there was provision for an appeal to the relevant training body, which would then advise the Tax Office. There was great uncertainty in that mechanism for employers, who, when expending their time and money, want to have great certainty that that time and money will be expended in a way that is acceptable from the outset, rather than at the end. </PARA>
<PARA> Suitable industry bodies to perform these tasks are already in existence in Australia and have welcomed the opportunity to be involved in this matter. They have the capacity. In many cases they have been performing this task with excellent results. Of course, everybody recognises that they are the people with the relevant expertise who are able to say within their particular industry what is eligible training and what is not. What we have here is an option for employers; it is not a compulsion. They may well continue to deal direct with the Tax Office through those procedures if they wish to do so. However, it is highly unlikely that many employers will choose to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has stated, in his second reading speech, that the scheme for registered industry bodies will be up and running by 1 January 1991. In the coming months the Minister will be looking to the development of guidelines governing this scheme. I make a number of suggestions in that regard. It seems to me that the criteria used in determining eligibility for registration need to be fairly stringent to ensure that the legislation will be implemented in the intended manner. Included in these criteria, as an absolute minimum, should be items such as the recognition as a peak industry body or a relevant industry body, a demonstrated commitment to training-which I think almost every one of the relevant industry bodies in Australia has-and the capacity to administer that, which most industry bodies are very happy to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> The favourable reaction to this exercise now means that the big stick approach, which admittedly the Government has used in this legislation, will cease to have quite the wallop that it was initially seen as having and will now be more an exercise of working together with a vast range of employers in this country. I admit that a number of employers will still be forced to pay the levy: that is, they will not meet the one per cent exercise. However, I believe that this will be only a short term situation. I see absolutely no reason whatsoever, in this legislation, nor in the response that industry has now given to the new piece of legislation before us, as to why a complete phasing out of any money from industry should not be able to take place within the next two years. I believe that the relevant industry bodies will be keen to make sure that no group within their industry will be paying the levy. That means that we now have a far more cooperative approach, a far more supportive approach. The response that I have had so far leads me to believe that we are now on the right track and that this particular proposal is off to a good start. </PARA>
<PARA> To complement the industry-based scheme, the Democrats have also proposed that firms which have already shown a strong commitment to training of their staff should be given the freedom to continue with their established training programs without the necessity for further training approval. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks around Australia, one is aware that a number of firms, mainly very large ones, see training as relevant to their market niche. In fact, a number have expressed to me that they see training, their commitment to it, the way they have gone about it and their willingness to put resources into it as the reasons why they are the leaders in their field. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is possible to identify those firms. It ought to be possible for an agreement to be reached between the individual firms and the relevant national body which will be chosen to administer this so that those firms can be exempted from the exercise. Of course, we would be looking at firms which spend in excess of one per cent; normally, these spend much more than one per cent. They would have had this commitment over a number of years. Typically, they would even have a section or department within their corporate structure devoted to this task. Many of the large firms in Australia already have that set-up, as honourable senators will know. </PARA>
<PARA> In my discussions with the Minister, he has acknowledged that he thinks this would be a very valuable way to proceed. I ask the Minister to give a firm undertaking that the Government will enable such a scheme to take place and that those firms which wish to avail themselves of it and which already have an excellent training program will then be able to say to their shareholders not that they have operated with regard to the requirements of this legislation, but that they are such good trainers that there is no need for this legislation to apply to them and that they have reached an agreement with the Government on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these firms have expressed to me that training is seen as one of their shining glories and not something which is thrust upon them by government. Certainly in the discussions I have had with the Minister it has been apparent that the Government well recognises the valuable contribution that many of these firms have made to the development of training in this country and in no way wishes to impede the excellent work that is already being done. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those general major changes with regard to accountability and methodology, the Democrats also negotiated with the Government other minor changes which are worthy of note. First, we have now incorporated into this Bill a depreciation clause for capital expenditure on training. In the draft legislation, it was proposed that capital expenditure on training would be eligible expenditure only if it could be claimed in the year when it occurred. The Democrats believe that this would have placed a disincentive in the way of firms which wished to go down the line of computer-based training as this would obviously involve a significant capital investment on a one-off basis. So in the legislation we have a new clause 26 which provides that capital expenditure on buildings or depreciable property used for training can be claimed either in the year it occurs or over a number of years, as under the normal regimes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment initiated by the Democrats involves the evaluation process in a structured training program. The initial proposal put forward by the Government in this regard was really far too onerous in terms of the possibilities of training. While the Democrats believe that it is vital that any training program be able to identify the goals that it wishes to achieve and to know if they have been achieved at the end of the exercise, we believe that the proposal in the first draft was so restrictive as to rule out a considerable number of programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I think that many of the comments that Senator Durack made were directed at the original draft; certainly, they do not go to the draft which we have before us. There is no restriction on those programs. I found it strange that Senator Durack made the claim that the normal processes by which training has gone on in this country were ruled out by the legislation. They are specifically included in the legislation. What has been ruled out is the exercise whereby somebody is simply popped into an office or in front of a lathe and told, `Go to it, that is your training'. That is not allowable and could not be allowable under any circumstances. I do not think that anybody in his right mind would say-certainly I have never met anybody in industry who would-that that is good training. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that many things have gone on under the heading of training in industry that most industry bodies have been trying to stamp out for a long period. What has been offered to some people has been appalling. When one reads some of the reports on occupational health and safety, one realises that the level of industrial accidents in this country is often due to the lack of training for people coming onto the job. Industry does not accept that waving at people and saying, `Go to it', is training. It knows that what the employer puts in determines what he gets out, and that expenditure on individuals is probably one of the most productive expenditures that any company can undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the expected program outcomes need to be set in place, and the means of identifying the extent to which the program has enhanced the participant's activity are clearly formulated. That is what industry does when it undertakes training, and that is what this legislation merely mirrors. That is what goes on in training across the board. It may very well be that these things have not been formulated in those precise terms, but that is what people do. The reason employers send their staff off to courses is to increase their productivity. When the staff return there is an evaluation process by the employer. The employer will not fork out hard-earned dollars to send somebody else on another course unless he knows that the original operation was a success. All that has been put down in the legislation is a formulation of what goes on in good training practice within industry. Indeed, industry has not raised any problems with me about the new formulation. It is happy with that and sees it as mirroring what, in fact, is a good practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendments brought about in the legislation in terms of the propositions that I put to the Minister deal with the matters to which I have already referred. For example, question marks over items such as occupational health and safety, industrial relations, study leave and the like, have now been fixed up. The various groups which had a concern about those matters-and indeed many other people; lawyers and so on-have now found that the new legislation, which has passed the House of Representatives and is now before the Senate tonight, deals with those matters in an acceptable way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other items that I wish to raise in the committee stage with regard to specific exercises. I propose merely to flag a couple at this stage. First of all, I refer to the discrepancies in payroll tax. As honourable senators know, the States have different payroll tax requirements for employment agencies, which is one of the matters that has been raised by Senator Durack. When we get to the committee stage, I would be interested to have the Government's response on a number of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also particularly interested in the types of discussions that the Government may have had with the States. Because of the obvious constitutional prohibitions, we have a situation of being able to deal with the States other than as a single entity under the Crown. State departments-that is, the various departments of, say, education, training, housing, and so on at the State level-are, for constitutional purposes, probably to be regarded as a single entity. I want to know whether or not the Commonwealth Government has had discussions with the State governments on this matter. The Commonwealth Government, of course, will be able to treat each of its departments-as it does with the fringe benefits tax-as a discrete employer. That may not be the case at the State level. I wonder whether progress has been in terms of any discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also interested in the Government's discussions with the trade union movement, among others, as to the problems of equity in terms of training-that is, how we may be able to assist the spread, across the board, of the training dollar so that it does not congregate, for example, in the most highly skilled and highly trained areas which, despite what Senator Durack said, do spend a considerable amount on training. The continual need to upgrade one's professional qualifications and to stay with the profession as it moves very rapidly is very expensive. Indeed, the professions tend to spend far more than anyone else on training. How are they going to continue to do that?</PARA>

<PARA> I am also interested in the matter of confidentiality. What I did discover in my discussions, as I have already outlined, is that a very large number of companies in Australia are very proud of their training programs. They see them as things they have developed themselves: in other words, that they have a proprietary right to those programs and believe that if they were out there in the marketplace, their market advantage would be dissipated. Therefore, they are particularly concerned that no operations of this legislation should impact upon them in such a way that the details of their training programs would become matters of general knowledge within either their industry or wider still, otherwise their market advantage of relying upon those programs would be dissipated. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to flag the problem that I see arising from recent ruling No. MT2046 of the Taxation Commissioner with regard to tax exempt employers-that is, educational institutions, trade unions, and the like, which pay an employee's higher education contribution scheme (HECS) charge. The ruling was that they will now have to pay a fringe benefits tax on this. I am concerned that this will create a distortion whereby public institutions will be placed at a disadvantage vis-a-vis private institutions. In other words, when the HECS legislation, the fringe benefits tax, and this legislation are put together, an anomaly exists. I would like the Minister's response as to how the Government intends to deal with that anomaly so that public institutions are not placed at a disadvantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution I make this evening to the debate on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Training Guarantee Bill centres primarily on the scenario for the introduction of this package of Bills, it having been done with almost complete ignorance of the particular needs of particular industries in respect of training; the Government's seeming abandonment of its former confidence that extra training through the nation would come as a consequence of award restructuring; and, lastly, the business and economic climate not being appropriate for this sort of levy in any event at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, before doing that I make some remarks with respect to the two previous speakers, Senator Macklin and Senator Zakharov. Senator Macklin, who I notice has just left the chamber, made one remark to which I make some reference. He suggested that he had put to the Government that those firms who were now investing a large amount in training effectively should be let be, that there should be no further approval requirements for those firms. It is easy at first glance to see some merit in that sort of suggestion if, of course, it is possible to identify these people-and I noted that Senator Macklin made some remarks as to the criteria he would think were appropriate to identify which firms should be able to get some sort of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to his suggestion, I say two things. Firstly, he seems to be suggesting that we take no further interest in the type of training that companies that are now spending an adequate amount on training are doing, that whatever training they are doing will be satisfactory, and they will not have to comply with this legislation, so they can go on their merry way; but that we should take an interest in the manner in which companies that are not now spending are training. That is an inconsistent approach to take. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill is to proceed, either we care about the manner in which the training is implemented on a firm by firm basis and we require them all to satisfy certain criteria before they can get some acknowledgment that that is money being spent on training or we do not. There is no justification for saying, `Because you were in the pool a few years ago and you have been doing not too bad a job, it is okay, we will not worry, we will just leave you be'. That is the first problem I have, in a general sense, with some of Senator Macklin's remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the mere suggestion that we ought to do that highlights one of the problems of this package, and that is the difficulty of compliance. If it were so simple to comply, what benefit would there be in suggesting to these companies that they could gain some sort of exemption because they had been good in the past? If they had been really good and this legislation did not present some sort of difficulty for business to comply with, then there would be no benefit in Senator Macklin's suggestion, albeit that I see initial merit in the remarks he made. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I now turn to some remarks that you yourself made. As I noted your speech, you said that this side of the chamber was being critical of this proposal. Your assessment was that some eight years ago, when we were last in office, we had not done much vis-a-vis training and certainly had not got it right. Of course, when we were last in government people who are now able to vote were 10 years of age. I am not sure whether they were born when we last came into government. For a government to be looking back that far rather than forward is perhaps not really productive. What was happening when they were born or when they were 10 is not relevant to young people voting today. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Madam Acting Deputy President, you said that this legislation was targeted to making those not now making a contribution or making little or no effort cough up and make some sort of contribution to the nation's training investment. As I recall, the remark was made that small business was going to be exempted from this by means of the salary cut-off point at which this little package will interrupt business, but that in any event that was okay because it was doing a good job. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, you raised exactly one of the points made by Senator Durack and that no doubt other speakers will raise, and that is that small business does, in some cases, do a very good job of training. But if we were to test his remarks-were we able to test them empirically-I doubt that we would find that small business is engaging in structured, formal training programs that would qualify under this legislation. Of course, you must know that to be the case if you reflect on your remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that small business engages very heavily in informal one-to-one training. An employee goes to the boss and says, `Look, I've got a problem. I've mucked this up. What do I do?'. There is no structure or schedule to that sort of training. The boss gives the employee 10 minutes, half an hour or an hour, as the case may be. That is the case whether one is a plumber, a bricklayer or, as Senator Durack says, a solicitor. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time I was practising there were many occasions when I went to senior partners seeking some sort of advice not on a particular matter but on the conduct of those types of matters in general. I was seeking in-general training and guidance. With respect to what Senator Macklin said, I do not think that it is necessarily possible for solicitors, accountants, professionals and tradespeople alike to structure their one-to-one training in such a way that it will all qualify under this Bill. The very nature of one-to-one training-its immediacy, being available when someone needs some help and not according to some pre-determined bureaucratic program or schedule-precludes it from easily fitting into that category. I take issue with the remarks made about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Further remarks were made that the excess of the collections of this levy-the firms that do not spend the appropriate amount have to make it up and pay that amount in the form of a levy-will be allocated to community training. We have found this Holy Grail of community training-all that really matters is that we train the community; it does not matter what we train them in!</PARA>
<PARA> I notice by your expression that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, think that I am inferring that that is your attitude; I am not. That is my attitude. It is my assessment of the Government's general attitude rather than yours personally. What will it come to? Will we have technical and further education courses, for example, for women's surfboards. At one stage this Government thought that was an important priority for taxpayers' funds. I would like to know whether it thinks it is a priority for training. Perhaps we can have a couple of courses running up and down the Gold Coast for people to learn how to make women's surfboards. I would like to hear more about the guidelines for what those funds would be used for. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, Madam Acting Deputy President, you made some remarks about business being short-sighted. There are businesses that are short-sighted and in for the fast buck. Sure there are. But that is not what the Australian business community has prospered from. Quite the contrary; they are the sorts of businesses that fall by the wayside. I make the passing remark that for any Government member to criticise business for being in for the short term opportunity, when one looks at the short term opportunities that this Government has taken over the past seven or eight years, almost defies belief. Were there more time I would outline for honourable senators a very long list of examples of the short term opportunistic decisions taken by this Government. So for a Government member to be pointing the finger at business strikes me as being somewhat extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, you quite rightly pointed out that there would be a need to monitor this program to make sure that there was compliance. In doing so, you touched on one of our concerns about this very program, namely, that it will have a hoard of people implementing it, the costs of which may in any event outweigh the real benefits that some people believe will come from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, also referred to the penalty clauses being deceitful in terms of how much money the Government was spending on training and the like. In doing so, you invited attention to a particular clause that might be more fully debated in the committee stage. I want to refer briefly to clause 85 of the Bill, under the heading `Part 9-Penalty Charge', which says:</PARA>
<PARA> If:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an employer other than a government body:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) makes a statement that is false . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then outlines the consequences of that. Just briefly, I would like to refer to the exemption for government bodies. I would like to know-perhaps a Government speaker following would be able to answer this point-whether government bodies are not going to have to comply with this legislation, in which case we wonder why there is an exemption for misleading statements, or whether some government bodies, statutory authorities, et cetera, are going to have to comply, and why they are therefore entitled to such an exemption. I do not for the life of me see why a private enterprise employer should be banned from making misleading statements and a government body should not. I see every reason why both should be prevented from making misleading statements. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that that particular clause relates to misleading statements in terms of the amounts of money that have been spent on training. It relates to the collection aspect. That clause, in the sense that it relates to misleading statements, does not relate to misleading statements in general to anybody about the training capacity of a particular firm. It is quite specific-misleading statements to particular types of people about particular sorts of things. And it is a good thing that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Were that not the case and were government bodies to be responsible for misleading statements in some sort of retrospective way, it would invite attention to the sorts of misleading statements that were issued by this Government in August 1985. I think it might even have been Minister Dawkins or perhaps Minister Willis who introduced the much publicised Priority One scheme. We all remember that-`Youth of Australia: No. 1 Priority'. We saw billboards across the nation with Bob Hawke's smiling face coming out, saying, `Youth of Australia; you're our No. 1 priority', telling people to telephone the nearest college and get in on the Priority One training scheme. I had technical and further education colleges on the telephone saying, `We do not know anything about this'. It was a classic example of someone saying, `Would it not be good if we marketed ourselves as a government that was interested in training?'. In this case it was not training across the board for the whole nation but for young people in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole marketing exercise for this Government, based on the concept of `we are interested in training', was introduced. A fortune was spent on it when the detail of implementing the scheme had not been worked out. What did we find? We had a Prime Minister who promised with confidence, a promise conveniently forgotten now because it was made in 1985-half a decade ago-that by 1988-89 there would be 75,000 Australian traineeships per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaflets were distributed through the community, raising the expectations of young Australians. What happened? Because the detail of the program was not properly worked out to start with, by the standards that the Prime Minister set-75,000 traineeships per annum-it was an unmitigated disaster. The Government had not worked out training courses applicable to particular industries. There was just a general notion of `let's train young people'. It had not worked out a traineeship for the banking sector, or a traineeship for the transport sector, et cetera. While all the young people who saw these advertisements telephoned trying to get in on these schemes, the Government had not sorted out the detail on a per industry basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should have learnt something from that. It should have learnt that it is a mistake to blow the trumpet about what it is doing about training before it has worked out the details, as is the case in this particular Bill. More importantly, it should have learnt that training needs to differ industry by industry and level of industry by level of industry. The concept of `let's train in general, let's make people pay' is really very unsophisticated. It said, `Let's make everybody pay one per cent for training'. I should correct myself. The Government is not saying, `Let's make everybody pay one per cent for training'. The Government is saying, `Let's make business pay'. It is the old left wing view that businesses profit and that therefore the profits should be snatched off them; they must contribute to the profit they make. There was no acknowledgment that everybody benefits from training-not just the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the motivation for this Bill is misguided. It is targeted at the business community, which is seen as the rich, and the attitude is let them pay. With respect to targeting, as you pointed out, Madam Acting Deputy President, small businesses are excluded, and big businesses, as Senator Macklin pointed out, are already spending a lot of money. So we are actually imposing a levy on businesses in the middle, irrespective of their level within industry. It is a sort of make business pay and do not worry about the details approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder why we do not ask doctors to pay some sort of additional levy on top of the Medicare levy. Doctors benefit from the Medicare system, so why do we not make them pay more? They are all getting a big slice out of Medicare. If one follows the Government's rationale that business is making money out of training and that therefore it ought to contribute to training, why do we not make specialists pay even more, because they benefit even more from the Medicare system? If it comes to that, why do we not ask lawyers to pay some sort of special levy because they are getting a benefit out of the legal aid system and the courts that we provide? The reason we do not do that is quite simple-everybody else is getting a benefit out of those systems. So why do we single out business in this respect?</PARA>
<PARA> It is an unhappy little scenario that has been painted by Government speakers in relation to this Bill in the first instance. I mention a further example-proof, if you like, of the Government's mentality that the object of this legislation is to make business pay and not to get good training outcomes. If a business decides that it is not appropriate for it to engage in a higher level of training than it already does-it might be a business that uses lowly skilled people and has no need of further training-it can make a donation to an appropriate tertiary institution and get a deduction for it. It is really a case of the Government saying, `It is too hard to work out who needs training and who does not so, instead of letting those who need training pay for it we are going to make everybody pay. Those who do not need training can pay by making a contribution to someone else's training'. That does not seem appropriate or fair. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four points I want to make. The first is that this whole package is being introduced on somewhat dubious grounds. The expectations and outcomes for particular industries have not been sorted out, so we are going into a general, `let's train' attitude without sorting out the specifics. That really is somewhat naive. We are abandoning the Government's original view that it would be appropriate for employees and employers to enter into voluntary training arrangements. The Director of the National Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders University in South Australia, Richard Blandy, says with respect to the Government's view:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is preferable for the direct beneficiaries of training, including both employers and employees in the private and public sectors, to make arrangements for funding the required increases in training expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is preferable for them to make their own arrangements. That used to be the Government's view, but for some reason it has been disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, you made some remarks with respect to the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey. I think you said that half of the people to whom this levy was going to apply were not paying anything. There has been some dispute as to the efficacy of that particular survey. Honourable senators may have seen a letter to the Australian Financial Review from Mr Spicer, the chief executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelming number of employers, 85 per cent of all firms, are small employers who would be totally exempt from the Government's training levy scheme anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>We have covered that point. This is targeted to a very small particular group of employers. But in particular he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The ABS survey indicated that employers with a wages bill of $200,000 or more, the figure at which the training guarantee will apply, spent an average of 2.4 per cent of their wages bill on formal training. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is some dispute as to the interpretation of that survey that you were referring to. As I say, the grounds are dubious. It requires a huge bureaucratic apparatus to keep this thing running, if it does get going, and on that basis it is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already made remarks about the second point that I want to focus on, and that is that while we would all want to see more training of the Australian work force in all sectors of the work force, it is not appropriate to achieve that end by simply saying, `If you do not spend more on training, you will have to pay and we will donate the money somewhere else'-`possibly to teach you how to make surfboards for women'. That is just not the appropriate way to go about it. It is not anywhere near as subtle as one would have expected from a government that has had eight years experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Different industries, of course, have different training requirements. As Mr Huxter, the industrial relations manager of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>There are some jobs where a week's training is sufficient and some where an hour's sufficient to skill a person to do that job. No amount of expenditure on training is going to make them do it better . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are jobs like that. This particular package does not make allowances for that. The Business Council of Australia's submission to the Economic Planning Advisory Council on enterprise based training in 1989 had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a great variation in training investment between industries and also within industries, with investment of between 1% and 10% of payroll being the usual variation. Decisions of businesses are made in accordance with their own particular conditions. A uniform skill formation program will impliedly not cater for variety between firms. Minimum training expenditure through a levy will inevitably override the commercial judgment of people on the spot in business. There is a great potential for high administrative costs and uneven impact between firms. </PARA>
<PARA>I just come back to the point that through its own work place reform program the Government seems to be acknowledging the need for these sorts of things to be done on an enterprise level rather than an across-the-board level. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude that point just by emphasising that this package does nothing to acknowledge the complexity and diversity in Australian industry and consequent complexity and diversity of training needs in Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that this Government has put out many press statements, and in Question Time in this chamber we have listened to answer after answer, about the importance of micro-economic reform and, in particular, award restructuring and the structural efficiency principle. We have read and heard again and again how part of this package of negotiations is for broadbanding, creating career paths and creating training opportunities as part of the award agreements. Yet we have a Government that, while it is doing that with one hand, seems to be saying on the other that there is a necessity to impose a levy. It seems to be expressing a total lack of faith in the award restructuring process and the benefits that the Government has been promising the community will come from that, including the consequent training packages that will be developed through that process of award restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a Government putting forward two inconsistent propositions. One is, `It will be okay; we are in charge of micro-economic reform; we are moving more quickly to award restructuring; and through that you will get better career paths, broadbanding and better training opportunities built into the awards'. The same Government with the same mouth turns the other cheek and says, `But you are all so hopeless you will not spend any money on training so we had better impose this levy to make sure that you do'. Whilst the micro-economic reform of award restructuring will, quite sensibly, concentrate on training needs on an industry basis and, for that matter, in some cases on an enterprise basis, those on the other side who are oblivious to what is going on say, `We are not really interested in a per industry definition of training and its needs. We just want one per cent, full stop'. It seems to be an inconsistent approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Last but not least, I simply want to make a few remarks in relation to the impact of the levy, both on business and on consumer costs. There is no need to repeat some of the remarks that I have made, other than to refer honourable senators to them in the sense of the administrative cost that this program will impose on the business community-it is just another cost. The attitude is that the business community can pay and, what is more, it can pay to pay because it will have to accommodate the administrative costs incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, there does not seem to be a sufficient explanation of why the imposition of a further cost on the business community will not be passed on to the consumer. After all, the business community is not the Salvation Army, and when it gets an extra cost it will, if it can, pass it on to the consumer. This point has been raised but has not yet been answered. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to remind the Senate that I have seen this happen before: a hastily strung together package, designed to make the Government look as though it is doing something vis-a-vis training, without having worked out the details on an industry by industry basis, with great promises of what is yet to come and no expectations by the business community or this side of the chamber that it will happen. We saw that happen in 1985. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), whom we still have, promise with great confidence a training scheme for young Australians that was to involve 70,000 per annum. He even said it on television. He had a little program made of himself walking around with young people telling them what they would get. But they cottoned on pretty smartly and booed him our of a number of functions where he went to try to explain what his Priority One scheme was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a cartoon for 1985 still on my wall which contains a caricature of the Prime Minister sitting at his desk filing his fingernails with a big rasp. He has a spiky-what I would call a hood-hairdo. Underneath the caricature are the words, `Youth of Australia, priority 2; don't call us, we'll call you'. That is exactly what is going to happen with this scheme. Something that is promised will not be delivered. It will be a total mess-up and the Government would do well to agree to refer the legislation to a Senate committee. If we must proceed with this levy the Government at least should fix up the problems that quite clearly exist and give industry some time to adapt to the demands made by the legislation. That would be the simple thing to do. If the Government is pig-headed enough to proceed with this proposal, it should at least be smart enough to get it fixed up so that it does not have egg on its face as a result of yet another failed promise to train Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enthusiastically welcome the long overdue introduction of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990. The purpose of this Bill is to require employers to contribute a percentage equivalent to their payroll to training. Where an employer's spending on training is less than the required amount, he will be obliged to contribute the difference to a training guarantee fund. One of the most pressing problems facing Australian industry is the need for a more highly skilled work force-a work force that has been given, and has accepted, greater responsibility and authority. If Australia is going to be able to compete in the 1990s and beyond, training has to be an essential component of long term corporate strategies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has set out to make Australia the clever country. Although that is a slick statement, it nevertheless sums up the fact that we have to become more intelligent in the way that we do things. There must be a recognition that, to achieve this end, we must address all facets of education including schooling, tertiary and further education, universities and both on-the-job and structured off-the-job training. That is the area that has been neglected in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Developing a highly skilled work force is a complex process. Education plays a crucial role, by developing the talents and abilities of individuals and teaching some of the basic knowledge and skills used in employment. Industry training builds on this broad foundation to provide the skills required by workers and management to perform their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for Australia to increase its skills base is not new. In 1965-and that was in a period of conservative government-the report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry, which was known as the Vernon report, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Skilled labour, in our view is likely to be Australia's scarcest resource. Everything possible must be done to increase the supply of this resource . . . A cooperative attitude on the part of governments, unions, management and education authorities alike is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in 1990 we are still living with the legacy that reports such as the Vernon report have not been taken seriously enough, in terms of both formal education and industrial training. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came into power, the high school retention rate-the basis of education-was 36 per cent. It is now 60 per cent and it will shortly be 66 per cent. Although rising, Australia's high school retention rate is still low compared with our industrial competitors. The high school retention rate in Japan is 94 per cent; in America, 86 per cent; and in Sweden, 84 per cent. When we consider other things, such as only 7 per cent of the Australian work force having tertiary qualifications and only 26 per cent having trade or technical qualificatioins, then we can see many of the problems that we face and that are addressed by this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that industry-wide, firms spend the equivalent of just over 2 per cent of their annual payments on structured training. About one-third of firms spend little or nothing on such training. Whether or not that figure is exact, it is certainly a significant percentage of firms, and these are the firms that are targeted by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is almost universal agreement that Australian industry must become more internationally competitive as part of an overall adjustment strategy. Australian industry needs to modernise. Flexibility and speed in adapting to changing circumstances are key characteristics of successful economies. A highly skilled work force is essential to achieving this flexibility. The pace of technological advance is now so rapid and so institutionalised that those who are behind may never catch up. This is the threat, even to Australia at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Increases in job skills clearly facilitate the adoption of new technology. For many Australian enterprises, this requires a major break with the past. That is what this legislation is all about. We cannot continue with an industrial past, and I refer to industry because that is the area that I am most familiar with. We cannot continue with the Taylorist traditions that have been so much a part of our industry development in this country. Those concepts were derived and developed in the 1920s and are still with us. They have lead to mass production and a lowly skilled and tightly controlled work force becoming the dominant characteristics of our industry. They are long out of date and we cannot afford to cling to that style of business, to that style of organisation-to the giving of orders by powerful people through the layers of supervisors that are a characteristic of that inefficient method of industrial organisation, demonstrated by the resultant lack of initiative by people who are part of that system. What has been seen by management as its inalien- able right, management prerogative, is a characteristic of that system that is completely undemocratic and unsuitable for the world and the modern industry that we now need to have. Professor Ford, head of the program of organisational behaviour at the University of New South Wales, who I believe is one of the leading figures in this area and has been for 25 years, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The challenge for Australia is to reduce the boundaries-educational, functional, occupational, professional and trade-that are blocking the skill formation processes we need to achieve a productive culture. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at overseas experience, we see that processes that we need to follow are being implemented in countries very close to us. If we look at the position in east Asia, we see that some nations have put enormous resources into skill formation-for example, Japan, Korea and Singapore. Australia is threatened far more at this moment by skill formation successes in those countries of east Asia than it is by a low wage structure. Unfortunately, that is the sort of thing that the Opposition has not faced up to yet. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry has for too long relied on external sources to meet its skills needs rather than on training or retraining its own employees and meeting the changed skill requirements that our industry has needed. They tend to shed labour with obsolete skills and hire workers with skills that are in demand. That is not good enough for the modern society and modern industry that we need in Australia at the moment. They rely on publicly funded training as a substitute for private sector investment in training. That is once again what this legislation seeks to correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw upon my experience in and knowledge of the manufacturing industry to emphasise the importance of this legislation. The Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has presented two reports. In 1988 we presented one entitled Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation-Making it Together, and today I presented New Management Techniques in Manufacturing Industry-People and Technology. They are two reports that emphasise the need to revitalise the manufacturing industry in Australia. The economic imperatives for improvement in Australia's manufacturing performance are set out in those reports. It is a serious situation. Manufacturing as a percentage of gross domestic product is falling, with all the consequences to our standard of living that that implies. The level of Australia's trade deficit is subject to much attention. What is not often understood is that that deficit is really a manufacturing deficit. Seventy-two per cent of Australia's imports are composed of manufactured goods. That is part of the problem and it emphasises the need for import substitution in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem is the composition of Australia's manufactured exports. Only $4.5 billion of $20.5 billion of exports have a high value-added component. When one considers that about $16 billion of our exports relates to simply processed metals, sugar and other products with very little value-added manufacture, one can see the importance of Australia, as a country, making sure that we have the ability to raise workplace skills, the lack of which at the moment is a great impediment to Australian manufacturing revitalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Simply put, not enough money is being invested in human capital in this country. This legislation is part of the process of investment that must occur. If Australia wishes to become industrially efficient and internationally competitive, we can no longer afford to regard organisation of the workplace and in-house and off the job training-in a sense, these are new words, unfortunately, to many people in Australia-to either not exist or exist as separate entities and not be interconnected in the way that they are approached. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's goal must be to integrate work organisation and skills formation as much as possible so as to enable employees to upgrade, update and expand their abilities. This continual process of industrial development and innovation depends on the interrelationship of four factors: new technology; work organisation; industrial relations; and skill formation. It is the last point that this Bill is aiming to address, although, of course, none of the four headings that I mentioned can be looked at in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will require employers to spend a minimum amount on approved training, broadly defined. It is a targeted measure aimed at improving the efforts of firms which do not currently invest, or invest very little, in training. This particular aspect is worth highlighting. One of the most common reasons put forward for the lack of investment in training in Australia is poaching. Who are these employers who would poach staff? It is a very common development. The Australian word that describes this is bludging. A significant percentage of employers in this country bludge staff from the other sections of industry. Indeed, this Bill concentrates on a third of these people. I agree that the figures cannot be completely accurate, but it seems as though that is the best estimate of those employers who provide little or no training and rely on attracting skilled workers from firms that train their people. </PARA>
<PARA> Firms that will not invest in training but keep dipping into the pot of human capital that we have in this country are now going to have to face up to sharing the burden. The minimum training requirement is one per cent of annual national payroll for 1990-91. In 1991-92, it goes to 1.5 per cent of this amount for subsequent years. Employers will be exempt if their payroll for the year is less than the threshold level of $200,000, as has already been said in this debate. The training bill is a minimum spending requirement. It is not an industry average and for much of Australia's industry it is certainly not an optimum level of training and expenditure in the training area. We hope it will be a catalyst to make many employers-who are not bad people, but who have not realised that if they continue taking a selfish view as far as skill formation in this country is concerned they are going to suffer themselves-engage in training. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a targeted measure aimed at improving the effort of fims which do not currently invest in training or invest very little. I do not know why the Opposition is so upset about employers who until now have not faced up to their responsibilities. The Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology went around many factories. We saw classic example after example of employers who were attempting to introduce new management techniques, who had trained their staff to a particular level, and then had them filched from them by employers down the street who had no commitment to improving the modern techniques that are so necessary. If we did not have the Government moving as it is on this occasion, that situation would go on for another 10 years because when the coalition parties were in power they made no effort to try to improve the general standards of training that we had in our work force. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now reached the point where this last facet of raising the standards of people in industry and service industries means that we have all the components in place to be able to use effectively the exciting things that are happening, such as award restructuring. Senator Vanstone disparaged award restructuring, but this measure also assists award restructuring because we will not punish the employers who are doing the right thing and who are trying to change the way that things have been done. We are now going to make it a fairly even field-perhaps even an even playing field, which appeals to a lot of people; certainly it has that characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has criticised this proposal and it has criticised the unions. I would like to place on record the fact that trade unionists, through their trade unions, have made many sacrifices in recent years. To many of them this is an historic occasion. I well remember that at the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress in 1987 the strategy of the trade union movement was laid down when it set the key recommendations of Australia Reconstructed in the need to increase investment in training. According to that report, Australia spends a lower proportion of gross domestic product on education and training than do the more economically successful countries. Most of the deficiency lies in privately funded-that is, firms and individuals-components of expenditure. Award restructuring, as the main focus of the trade union movement over the last few years, has created new opportunities and incentives for employers to invest in improving workplace skills. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the metal industry-perhaps the best example because it is the most advanced industry-the training strategy set in place new training and career systems for Australia's 500,000 metal industry employees. Those reforms integrate present in-house training options with those in the tertiary education sector, produce career paths based on a wide range of skills instead of individual trades, restructure the metal industry award, resulting in training and multiskilling becoming the chief criteria for metal industry wage-setting, and make it possible for employees to move from unskilled job classifications to positions requiring training and finally to the professional engineering and management posts. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a revolution that is taking place in the metal industry. It is absolutely appropriate that this legislation complement all these developments I have described in making sure that all industry shares the responsibility to create and develop the human capital that is this country's most precious resource. It is now time that business accepted greater responsibility for the development of that human capital. The responsibility for skills formation needs to be negotiated continually between the interested parties. There is no place for attitudes such as those expressed by the Business Council of Australia and some of the other employer organisations that have had a knee-jerk reaction to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very confident that the things that are now being said-for example, that those organisations have been opposed to this legislation because it represents government interference in business-and all the usual things said by employers when facing new developments will not transpire. I am certain that if we review the situation in three, four or five years time when we have skilled our work force, when we have pressed ahead, as this Government is doing, with the general level of education in industry-I will certainly be happy to compare notes with Senator Vanstone then; I am sure we will both be here-we will find that the basis for manufacturing industry and service industries in this country is much more effective because of the passage of this legislation. We must not consider the Opposition's proposal, which is to try to shelve a project that has been in place and discussed by everyone who is interested for a long time. It is a last-minute tactic commonly used by the Opposition. It is attempting to push this off to yet another committee to prevent us having the benefit of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that last point, I say to Senator Childs that it is very easy to talk on this topic. It is very easy to be lyrical about the benefit of training. We have heard much of this in the past from many sources, as he has pointed out. But tonight we are talking about the actual detail of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill. That is a very different matter from what the rhetoric of the past has indicated. We are talking about getting the legislation right. As with no other Bill in the past, this Bill should go to a committee so that we actually get it right, so that the rhetoric is put into effect and so that we achieve something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Training would be the most popular topic anywhere one likes to go. The concept is very sound. Education and training are very dear to people's hearts. Look at the situation at present in the Australian Capital Territory where there is a threat of schools being closed. One can see the public response. It is a very emotive issue. But, at least, let us make sure that we get the legislation right. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I hope that when the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) replies-at the end of the second reading stage or in the committee stage-he will tell us where the Commonwealth gets the power to introduce this legislation. This has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly, I believe that the Government needs to tell us the basis of the legislation. It is quite clear that the Government has a power to raise funds by way of taxation. If it is going to be honest, it will have to tell us that this legislation really introduces a Commonwealth payroll tax. It is yet another new tax introduced by the Commonwealth Government; it is a payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth referring to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill. This Committee is one of the most respected committees, and it has brought down a report in which it makes a general comment in relation to clause 85, which I may refer to later and which Senator Vallentine referred to. The comment raises a very valid issue. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that the Bill contains a number of taxation legislation look-alike provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the actual wording needs to be noted. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Provided that the Bill is meant to be seen in that light-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, provided the Bill is meant to be a tax Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>most of them may be acceptable. Nevertheless, the Committee makes the following observations: (a) Clause 60 provides that on review or appeal the burden of proving that an assessment is excessive lies on the employer . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is a different onus of proof from what most of us believe should be the case. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) Clause 70 provides that the fact that a review or appeal is pending does not affect the effect of the assessment or prevent the recovery of the charges or additional charges;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) Clause 77 provides for substituted service of documents in relation to recovery of charges and service. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then talks about clause 83, clause 97 and clause 98. To save the time of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in relation to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 10 May 1990 by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes to provide for the administration of the scheme set up by the Training Guarantee Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>General Comment</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 85 provides that if an employer other than a government body makes false or misleading statements, the employer has to pay by way of penalty an additional training guarantee charge. While the Committee notes that this is not a criminal liability, it means that a government body is immune from penalty in respect of such statements. The Committee seeks the Minister's explanation as to why this apparent immunity is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that the Bill contains a number of taxation legislation look-alike provisions. Provided that the Bill is meant to be seen in that light, most of them may be acceptable. Nevertheless, the Committee makes the following observations:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Clause 60 provides that on review or appeal the burden of proving that an assessment is excessive lies on the employer;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) Clause 70 provides that the fact that a review or appeal is pending does not affect the effect of the assessment or prevent the recovery of the charges or additional charges;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) Clause 77 provides for substituted service of documents in relation to recovery of charges and service can be effected on an absentee or someone who cannot be found by posting to the last known address, without leave of the court;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) Clause 83 provides for service on the public officer of a trust estate and clause 83 (2) provides that, if there is no public officer, service on a person acting or appearing to act in the business of the trust estate is sufficient;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) Clause 97 provides that the production of a notice of assessment or a copy thereof is conclusive evidence of its making and that the particulars are correct, except for the purposes of review or appeal. The clause also provides that the production of certain documents, certificates or training guarantee statements are prima facie evidence. Clauses 97 (2), (4) and (5) use the phrase `prima facie evidence', whereas clause 97 (3) merely uses `evidence'; and</PARA>
<PARA>(f) Clause 98 provides for access to premises and documents and permits an authorised officer to inspect and copy documents. The authorised officer can do so upon the production of a written authority from the Commissioner of Taxation and does not require a search warrant issued by a judicial officer. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It raises important questions which the Government must answer before this goes much further. We are dealing with a payroll tax Bill which sets the level at which tax will be paid at the sum of $200,000, which is a considerably different figure from payroll taxes levied by the States at the present time. We are talking about a tax on businesses which have some eight to 10 employees. The businesses will pay one per cent this year, 1990, and 1 3/4 per cent after 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks into the Bill, one finds that it is to commence on 1 July 1990. That is pretty soon. Small business is already overburdened with paperwork imposed by this Government and State governments. One would expect to be able to look at the Bill and find out exactly what a firm has to do on 1 July 1990 to ensure that it complies with the legislation. But that is not the case. The Bill is dotted throughout with guidelines that might be brought down some time in the future. There is nothing in the second reading speech which indicates when the guidelines will be available. I do not imagine that they will be available by 1 July so that people will actually know what this Bill is about. If they are not available by 1 July of this year, then the operation of the Bill should be deferred until such time as people are able to know what they are doing, whether the schemes they are operating at present are proper training schemes which would exempt them from paying this tax, and are able to get advice from their accountants and lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I want you to tell Senator Childs that the reason why this Bill should be deferred to a committee is so that the guidelines can be seen, looked at and worked out so that we know what we are imposing on businesses. They are entitled to know. People suggest that the legislation can come into effect on 1 July this year and be operated upon by businesses when it is clear on the face of the document that the rules have not been worked out-they certainly have not been brought to this chamber, tabled or made subject to disallowance. Anybody who supports the operation of the legislation right now has never had anything whatsoever to do with the running of a business because anybody who has would know the difficulty that is being imposed on those who are attempting to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not against training and the opportunities it will provide. Other speakers have already referred to the extent to which it is going on. It may well be that there is good reason to look at why there has been no training in some areas in the past. There is a benefit of education and benefit from training skills. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that some of the speakers-Senator Childs, Senator Zakharov or Senator Macklin-talked about the Bill being designed to stop poaching. They seemed to be concerned that one employer may train people and then find that they are poached by another firm, and that that is a disincentive to train. We might look at it from the point of view that if employers are obliged or forced to train their staff beyond the level at which they are required to carry out their duties in that firm they really are inviting other people to take them. How much training can one give to a cleaner or a housemaid who makes the beds in an hotel? I will come back to them a bit later on because I think there are some questions that I want to understand in relation to the contents of the Bill about training people in these occupations. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of training that one might give to somebody who is totally unskilled and the level of additional training which may be appropriate for a professional person does not seem to have been thought through. A solicitor who perhaps has been in practice for 25 years would benefit from going back into some educational program on a part time basis for a time. This would increase his skills, bring him up-to-date with new legislation, and things such as that. Accountants will need to go to school to work out what we are talking about with this Bill if it goes through without the benefit of it being examined by a Senate committee. When one reads the legislation, one sees that the training program will undoubtedly be enormously costly to administer. No economic impact statement has been presented with the documents, the second reading speech, or anything else that I have seen, that really deals with the costs of it. The second reading speech refers to the costs. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>All revenue net of administration and monitoring costs will be disbursed to the States and Territories . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But we do not get precise figures as to what the costs are likely to be. I ask the Minister to tell us what the costs are expected to be. If one looks at the number of things in the legislation, one sees that the costs will undoubtedly be quite considerable. That again is a matter of interest to the Senate when trying to assess the benefits of a program such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Bill and some of the clauses that are in it. I just want to touch on some of the things that I hope will be answered. I note in passing that clause 9 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is that? When I was young and studying history and other subjects at school we were told that the King was not to be above the law. Why is it now that the Crown is legislated to be above the law? I think that is a very serious matter. It is the sort of thing that keeps creeping in. It is time we knew why the Crown is above the law in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill is entitled `Eligible Training Expenditure and Programs'. Clause 25 defines the meaning of eligible training expenditure and states:</PARA>
<PARA>Eligible training expenditure of an employer is expenditure incurred by the employer that is directly attributable solely or principally to eligible training programs. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an example and definitions that go on and on. I wonder what this means for a legal firm that has articled clerks. Can a firm deduct the cost of the wages of its articled clerks because it is a training program?</PARA>

What will be the criteria for those who are administering the program in determining whether the conditions for the programs have been met or not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators who have read only Senator Robert Ray's second reading speech and not read the Bill might think that the Government was inviting employers to have a say in what happens. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that employers should spend the money themselves in ways in which they consider will maximise productivity or contribute more generally to the skills of the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee is in fact a charge on the failure to train. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, this is the Government's way of trying to say that it is not a tax. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that employers should spend the money themselves in ways in which they consider will maximise productivity or contribute more generally to the skills of the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>But when we read the legislation we find that it is a different thing altogether. Perhaps some of those who have extolled the virtues of what the Government is talking about have merely read the second reading speech and have not gone through the Bill which is now before us, which we will have a chance to go through in more detail when we get to the committee stage-if the Senate does not send the Bill to a committee for closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA> I again raise the question of training a housemaid who is to work in a hotel. What about all the other staff of the hotel? Is that a deduction which it would be able to make? The Bill gives examples of eligible training expenditure of an employer as including expenditure incurred by the employer by way of salary or wages paid to an employee that is directly attributable to a period during which the employee was solely or principally engaged in participating in an eligible training program. The extent to which on-the-job training is a part of it is not clear. As I say, we may come to that later, or a committee will. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 26 (d) (i) (B) of the Bill, referring to eligible expenditure, states:</PARA>
<PARA>contributions payable or paid under Chapter 4 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is that telling us that if one studies as an engineer and graduates from university, as a consequence acquires a liability to pay graduate tax, and then goes to work for somebody who says, `I will pay your graduate tax; that gets me off the hook for a training program and it gets you off the hook for your graduate tax', the Government receives only one lot of money from the employer who is taking it off his training tax rather than both of them being able to pay that sum? I hope the Minister will tell us what loss there will be from the graduate tax as a consequence of that being an eligible training deduction. It is one of the other questions that I think could well be looked at. It has not been dealt with and, again, it leads me to conclude that the Bill would be better examined by a Senate committee. We are not challenging training, as Senator Childs seems to think we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth turning the page and looking at clause 27 (2) of the Bill. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>A training program is a structured training program if it satisfies the following conditions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that the Government believes that employers should spend the money themselves in ways that they consider will maximise productivity and contribute more generally to the skills of the work force, but now we find that `a training program is a structured program if it satisfies the following conditions'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the program is designed or approved by a person-</PARA>
<PARA>not the employer-</PARA>
<PARA> who is appropriately qualified-</PARA>
<PARA>not defined-</PARA>
<PARA>or experienced to design a training program of the relevant type . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It has nothing to do with what the employer thinks is best for his business. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the skills to be acquired by the participants in the program are clearly identified before the program begins;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the means of imparting the skills to the participants are clearly identified before the program begins;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) before the program begins:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the expected program outcomes are clearly formulated; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the means of identifying the extent to which the program has enhanced the participants' productivity are clearly formulated. </PARA>
<PARA>The paperwork involved in having all this written down so that one is able to meet an audit, if an audit is decided upon by the Commissioner of Taxation, is horrendous. All this would have to be in writing before the thing got under way at all. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Subject to subsection (4), a training program may be an eligible training program whether or not:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) It is provided personally by the employer concerned; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) it consists of or includes on-the-job training. </PARA>
<PARA>It cannot include any generally supervised practice or work experience. I am amazed why that should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It then deals with apprentices and goes on to a number of other things. Clause 30 refers to all the guidelines that have to exist before the Act can actually operate properly. Notwithstanding the fact that those guidelines are not available, we are being asked to pass this Bill now and have it come into operation on 1 July 1990. If the Government wants this Bill to come into effect on 1 July 1990, one can only conclude that it is a tax Bill and that it is the revenue from business that the Government is wanting to get and intends to have. The Government is not putting the guidelines forward and is not giving people an opportunity to find out what it is that they are embarking upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to a letter that I have received from the Real Estate Institute of the Australian Capital Territory Ltd. It is worth noting what it has had to say. The letter says, in part, that the Institute has some concerns with provisions of the Bill and the effect on small business in Canberra-and I would add, of course, small business everywhere. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, we are concerned with the administration of the system. The Bill intends to be linked to the taxation system, thus creating a negative image in those affected by it (ie employers), rather than a positive response. It will be perceived by employers as another taxation measure, rather than an endeavour to improve the level of skill of employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it not a pity that that should be the case? It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The administration involved with the bill will adversely affect real estate agents in the ACT; in fact all small businesses in Canberra. It will add to the already considerable workload involved in Government paperwork of these businesses. Moreover, the Standing Committee on Industry, Service &amp;Technology presented a report on small businesses and identified Government paperwork as a major handicap of small businesses. The Bill therefore ignores the recommendations from that Committee and will only compound the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Childs says that we should listen to what is said in Senate committees and not worry to go back to them in future. I ask Senator Childs: What about this one? He is happy to ignore what he wants to ignore. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>However, if this legislation intends to remain as it stands, we must ensure that it works effectively to minimise the administrative workload of employers. One particular concern that we have is the eligibility of expenditure under this Bill. The Bill does not include membership subscriptions to trade or industry related organisations, like ourselves, as eligible expenditure. Small businesses join trade and/or professional organisations-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are Eight Councils or similar forums which involve the Attorney-General's Portfolio (forums for meetings involving Ministers of all Commonwealth countries are not referred to in this response).</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Portfolio is also represented at meetings of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy by the Minister for Justice. My colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health has provided an answer on the composition of that Council in response to the question asked by the honourable senator of the Minister representing him. I have seen that answer and have nothing to add to it.</PARA>
<PARA> See Attachments A-H for answers to further questions relating to the above eight bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT A</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General-</PARA>
<PARA> seeks to achieve uniform legislation in appropriate cases, or to harmonise legislative and other action within the portfolio responsibilities of its members; and</PARA>
<PARA> provides a forum for discussion by Ministers of matters of mutual interest.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General usually meets 4 times a year.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General comprises the Attorneys-General (or, in some cases, the Ministers of Justice) of the Commonwealth, the States, the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The Minister who is hosting a particular meeting chairs that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. There is no full time Secretariat. The Secretary to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is currently an officer of the NSW Attorney-General's Department who performs these duties on a part-time basis. The cost of performing these duties, which are borne by the NSW Government, is not known to the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA> In addition to the Attorney-General and relevant members of his staff, the Attorney-General's Department is generally represented by one officer of the Companies and Securities Branch, normally the Senior Assistant Secretary, to brief the Commonwealth Attorney-General on the issues listed for consideration at the meeting and to answer any technical or legal questions that the Attorney may have. In addition, when the Ministerial Council meeting is held in conjunction with a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, usually the Deputy Secretary of the Department having responsibility for the co-operative companies and securities scheme also attends the Ministerial Council meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. This information would take an excessive amount of resources and time to determine. No separate records are kept showing the total cost to the Commonwealth of attendance at meetings of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. The travel and associated costs of the Commonwealth delegation are borne by the various areas from which members of the delegation are drawn.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has agreed that their meetings are confidential and therefore records of meetings are not available to the public where appropriate, decisions by Council are announced by the Chairman in a press release following the relevant meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT B</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities-</PARA>
<PARA> considers and keeps under review the formulation and operation of the legislation and regulations forming part of the Commonwealth-State scheme for the administration of company law and the regulation of the securities and futures industries (``the co-operative companies and securities scheme''); and</PARA>
<PARA> exercises general oversight and control over the operation of the above scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Council meets on average four times per year.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Ministerial Council has eight members, being the Ministers responsible for administering the laws covered by the co-operative companies and securities scheme. Current members are the Commonwealth Attorney-General, the New South Wales Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Northern Territory, Tasmanian, Victorian and West Australian Attorneys-General, the Queensland Minister for Justice and the South Australian Minister for Corporate Affairs. The Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory attends open meetings of the Council as an observer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council elects one of its members to be Chairman, usually for a period of 12 months. The current Chairman is the South Australia Minister for Corporate Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. A secretariat service for the Ministerial Council is provided by the National Companies and Securities Commission as an integral part of the Commission's operations. Consequently, details of the cost of providing the services are not readily available. One half of the funding of the Commission is contributed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA> 2. Australian Police Ministers' Council-</PARA>
<PARA> promotes a co-ordinated national response to law enforcement issues;</PARA>
<PARA> seeks to maximise the efficient and effective use of police resources; and</PARA>
<PARA> approves the budgets and oversees the programs and activities of the National Common Police Services-the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the National Police Research Unit, the Australian Police Staff College and the National Exchange of Police Information System. (These services are managed by Boards of Control comprising Commissioners of Police and the Secretary, Attorney-General's Department.)</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Council usually meets twice per year. A special meeting of Council was held in March 1988 on the firearms issue.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Council comprises Police Ministers of the States and Northern Territory, and the Minister for Justice. Chairmanship rotates each calendar year on a jurisdictional basis.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. A Secretariat, comprising two staff (1 x ASO8, 1 x ASO7) is provided by the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department at a cost, including salaries, of approximately $130,000.</PARA>

<PARA> 7. The Commonwealth meets the travel expenses of the Secretariat and those officials attending meetings in support of the Minister for Justice. It also pays for any hire of meeting facilities and for morning and afternoon teas. APMC meetings are held in tandem with NCA-IGC meetings and, as such, costs are not separately identified. It would be time consuming to track down the information required to calculate those costs over the last three financial years.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Records of APMC meetings are not generally available to the public because of the sensitive nature of issues discussed at the meetings. Where appropriate, decisions by Council are announced by the Chairman in a press release following the relevant meeting.</PARA>

<PARA> 4. The conference comprises Ministers for Corrective Services from each State and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, plus New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. The Commonwealth, and the Australian Institute of Criminology, attend as invited guests. The chair of the meeting rotates amongst the members.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. There is no secretariat. The meetings are rotated throughout the States, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. The host State or Territory provides resources to service the conferences.</PARA>

<PARA> Detailed records are not kept on the Commonwealth delegation to each meeting which is usually held in conjunction with a meeting of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. In addition to the Attorney-General and relevant members of his staff, the Attorney-General's Department would usually have been represented by a Deputy Secretary (and, in some cases, the Secretary) and the departmental officer responsible for co-ordinating the briefing for the meeting. In some cases departmental officers with responsibility for particular topics being dealt with at the meeting have attended. The Solicitor-General and the Director of the Institute of Criminology also attend some meetings.</PARA>
