<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether the word `blanket' is the right word to use on this occasion. I certainly support some criticisms which have been made of the business community by a variety of people. For example, I support some criticisms of the banks on the basis that their interest rate policies have not reflected a relaxation in monetary policy. I support some criticisms of business organisations in that they do not seem to be able to get a single view about major issues confronting Australian business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer says, by way of interjection, `Of course they don't'. I suppose he is in favour in this rare case of letting 100 flowers bloom. But 100 flowers blooming in Australian business organisations is not necessarily the best outcome for a sensible contribution from business to a whole range of issues such as wages policy, industry policy generally, and so on. I think Senator Parer will find that many business leaders share that view.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support inform the Senate of the time and date of the release of the environmental impact statement (EIS) on the proposed third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The environmental impact statement will be publicly released in Sydney at the Powerhouse Museum at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. It will be gazetted for public examination on the 20th of this month and the three-month period will be allowed to run from that date. I have in fact explained to the chamber before the reason for the delay in the original timetable that was established by the Government for this EIS, and it largely relates to the need for this document to be as exhaustive and as quality a document as possible. The delays were principally caused by the need to establish technical baseline data particularly in respect of the noise impact studies which I confidently predict will be a major item for debate in the next three months. It was also necessary to examine the planning strategy for Sydney Airport which was released just recently and prepared for the Federal Airports Corporation by a different firm of consultants in order to examine the traffic implications and strategies contained in that document, and that principally is the reason for the delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Requests have been made for the public examination period to be extended on the basis of what was said to be additional time given to Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd for cleaning up their figures-or words to that effect. That assertion is simply not correct. The delay was caused for the reason that I have given. I cannot logically understand why the period that has elapsed for the preparation of the document itself is in any way related to the time that is now to be allowed for public scrutiny of it. Indeed, the statutory requirement under the Act for public examination is 28 days, and the Government in recognising the controversial nature of this EIS-and it will be subject to a great deal of debate-has allowed three times that statutory requirement for examination.</PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the preliminary skirmishing on this issue has already begun. I said to Senator Faulkner earlier this morning that one of the reasons for the delay was that I had put in a last-minute bid to have the third runway replanned to go through the middle of his living room, but that was only in jest. The preliminary skirmishing has begun because it is an important issue that has serious implications for the people of Sydney whose needs should be considered and not simply brushed aside, and the wider implications of this airport as Australia's most important national and international airport. I have not the slightest doubt that there will be a vigorous debate with all of the issues thoroughly canvassed. I dare say some of it will probably seep into here over the next three months, and I look forward, as the Minister responsible, to participating in that debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is definitely going to go through the middle of the living room now. I have addressed that matter, but I just say again that I cannot logically understand the argument that, because additional time was required by the consultants to prepare the EIS, that should therefore of itself extend the time allowed for public examination of the document. I have a number of friends who have taken between three years and five years to put doctor of philosophy theses together but it certainly did not take that long for the examiners to assess them. I do not see how the two things are connected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, 28 days is allowed as the minimum requirement under the Act, and indeed the Government could have proceeded to have simply allowed that 28 days. The Government deliberately decided to extend that by a factor of three, because of what we acknowledge to be the intense interest in this particular debate, and I see absolutely no reason for that period to be extended.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. I refer the Minister to last Friday's decision by the Industrial Relations Commission which awarded child-care workers up to 40 per cent wage increases, and the subsequent comments by both the President of the Victorian Child-Care Association, Mrs Anne Young, and the Federal senior executive of the Australian Federation of Child-Care Associations, Mr Chris Buck, who claims that child-care fees will rise by as much as $45 per week. In light of this, and in view of the fact that Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) President, Martin Ferguson, indicated on Friday that talks would be sought with the Government about the impact of child-care subsidies, does the Minister concede that the Government will be forced to increase child-care subsidies? Has such an increase been taken into account in the Government's Budget Forward Estimates for child-care expenditure? If not, is the Minister concerned that many working parents, as a result of the Industrial Relations Commission decision, will no longer be able to afford child-care and that many smaller child-care operations will be unable to absorb the increased costs and will therefore be forced to close?</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2501" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1982 John Koowarta and his community, at what was then Archer River Station, won a very significant victory in the High Court of Australia which forced the Queensland Government to register the transfer of title from this former pastoral lease to that community. Subsequently, the then Bjelke-Petersen Queensland Government robbed those people of that victory in declaring the entire area to be a national park. Since the change of government in Queensland, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has had discussions with Mr Goss, the Premier of Queensland, and with John Koowarta and his community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current position is that the Queensland Premier-in my view not surprisingly-is not minded to change the status of a national park now that it has been declared, for whatever reason, but is certainly prepared to consider very closely what can be done to formally recognise the rights of the Aboriginal community whose traditional land it is and who did win that very significant victory in 1982 that was later thwarted by the political actions of the then Government. The kinds of proposals that are currently being considered in these discussions are the possibility of lease back arrangements in the national park. That would be based on similar arrangements that currently operate at Uluru and Kakadu national parks in the Northern Territory.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case, as I said in both India and Pakistan, that we would review the Mirage sale either if hostilities broke out between India and Pakistan or if the situation deteriorated to the extent that hostilities seemed imminent. The expression `hostilities' was intended to refer to full-scale war between the two countries rather than simply the exchange of fire, skirmishing or other kinds of aggravated military tension that have unfortunately been so endemic in that region for so long. I have seen quite a considerable flow of information about the current situation in Kashmir and border areas. It is not our judgment at this stage that this heralds full-scale hostilities in the sense in which I have used the term in the context to which Senator Durack refers. Obviously, we will keep the situation under close watch. The undertaking holds, but at the moment I do not regard it as being triggered by the circumstances there.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industrial Relations to the decision handed down in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission concerning the current wage system.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2502" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision was handed down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission at 2 p.m. in Melbourne yesterday. It has been widely reported in today's press. From the Government's point of view, we welcome the decision. It is consistent with the Commonwealth's submission to the national wage case hearing which, as I pointed out in answer to a question asked by Senator Giles last week, was delivered by Ms Lynne Tacy of my Department. The Industrial Relations Commission in its decision recognised that the current wage fixing principles do not prohibit unions from serving on employers claims which are designed to raise issues about a change or new system of wage fixing, nor can there be any objections by employers to discussions to clarify such claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also point out that I agree with the Commission, that both unions and employers participating in those discussions must bear in mind the obligation to avoid industrial action, the necessity for the Commission to approve any agreements that might be reached and the danger of raising in the community false expectations about wages. In case anyone believes that may be a sin of which only unions are guilty, I can cite a press release I saw the other day from the Confederation of Australian Industry which, in order to paint a graphic picture of what a wage explosion might do, could be in part guilty of creating an expectation as well.</PARA>
<PARA> The point on which the expectation founders is the pop belief in the community that a 7 per cent aggregate wage outcome equals a 7 per cent wage increase. It does not. In calculating the aggregate wage outcome, one has to have regard for the pipeline effects of wages decisions feeding into this year from last year. We calculate that to be about 4 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent. One has to have regard for the wages drift component, which might be about one per cent. As well, we must have regard for the already committed wage increases in the Government-Australian Council of Trade Unions accord, which are for the September quarter consumer price index increase to be passed on in full to workers, six months later for an increase of $12, and for a phasing-in over two years of a 3 per cent superannuation hike. From the point of view of the 7 per cent average wage outcome, I pause in explaining the decision to clarify that it does not equal a 7 per cent wage increase for the year.</PARA>
<PARA> To answer the second part of Senator Devereux's question-the Commission emphasised that there is a substantial level of agreement between the parties in terms of a continuance of the structural efficiency process. All parties are, I think it is fair to describe it, in `heated' agreement that that process of structural efficiency award restructuring workplace reform must go on. The Commission stressed that in its decision; we welcome that emphasis. We will attend and partake in next Monday's conference announced in the Commission's decision yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health to an article appearing in the Age yesterday and also to the Government's recently released attendant care review, both of which note that the average cost to the community of a place under this scheme is some $14,700 less than a place in a general nursing home and at least $80,000 less than a bed in a public hospital. As the Minister for Health has recently been expressing his concern about the increased cost of hospital care, I ask the Minister: Firstly, can the Government explain why it has only provided a mere 200 additional places under this scheme over the next four years when its own review conservatively identifies over 2,000 people who are potential clients of the scheme? Secondly, in view of the fact that the review identifies a further 51,000 people in the community with a potential demand for home based attendant care support, why has the Government provided only 350 places under the 3-2-5 scheme over the next four years to meet this demand? Finally, the Government has indicated its intention to act in part on two of the recommendations in this report. Does the Government intend to act, and to what extent, on the remaining 12 recommendations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees has raised several matters in her question and I would like to answer them in three different sections. She raised the question of the inadequacy of 200 additional places under the national attendant care scheme. The review report that she mentioned recommended that the attendant care scheme be expanded by 100 places a year and despite difficult economic circumstances the Government has been able to provide 200 places over the next two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has done more for people with disabilities than any government since Federation. Funding for services assisting people with disabilities has increased from $72.4m to $217.8m, a real increase of 52 per cent. Despite this enormous contribution the Government recently announced a further expansion of programs through a $172m package of additional accommodation, employment and rehabilitation services, including the further 200 attendant care places. This major expansion of support services complements a sweeping reform of income support in employment programs for people with disabilities and demonstrates this Government's real commitment to achieving a better deal for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees went on to claim that the 350 accommodation support places provided in the recent Budget were inadequate. The decision to increase its already substantial funding under the Disability Services Act to provide a further 350 accommodation support places represents a very significant contribution by this Government. It more than doubles the number of places previously available under the 3-2-5 places scheme at increased funding levels that will enable the new places to better meet the needs of people with more severe disabilities. The 3-2-5 places scheme will be reviewed during the year and the Government will, no doubt, consider the results of such a review in considering the future allocation of funds for additional places.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees further asked whether the Government intended to act on the remaining 12 recommendations of the review. In fact, Government initiatives announced in the last Budget anticipated six of the 14 recommendations made in the review report. A further four recommendations were already being examined for implementation by the Department of Community Services and Health. All the recommendations deserve careful consideration and this Government's decision will be announced as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. While we have heard very much of the peace dividend following the end of the Cold War, is it now time for an agricultural dividend, that is, the release of public funds from a much needed reduction in northern hemisphere agricultural protectionism? I understand that subsidies to farmers are now running at $240 billion a year around the world. I ask the Minister: Would such a call for reduced agricultural protection benefit Australian producers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2503" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is self-evident that reduced agricultural protection would benefit low cost and low subsidising countries such as Australia, which are heavily dependent on exports for their continued survival. The costs of agricultural protectionism to efficient producers, consumers, taxpayers, developing countries, the environment and the fabric of international trade relations have been documented over many years, and it is ironical to note that, while events in the East which have made the peace dividend possible have moved very quickly, pressures for agricultural reform in the West have moved far more slowly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Maguire would know, agricultural reform is now a centrepiece for the current Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, where Australia, both individually and with Cairns Group colleagues, and now in very close collaboration with the United States of America, has pressed hard for substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection.</PARA>
<PARA> The significance of agriculture for the outcome of the Uruguay Round is now recognised at the highest levels in the leading Western economies. Regrettably this recognition has yet to be visibly translated into the negotiations on agriculture in Geneva and time is running out. We will, of course, with others-as we were as recently as a few days ago with Dr Blewett in Vancouver at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Trade Ministers meeting on this subject-continue to press for a big result, which will be needed to conclude the Uruguay Round successfully.</PARA>
<PARA> It would indeed be ironical if, as Senator Maguire has intimated, with a peace dividend now in sight, the failure to deal with agricultural illiberalism were to generate tensions among the major Western countries which have so successfully pursued the cause of liberalism in the wider sense.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to yesterday's decision by the Prices Surveillance Authority allowing a further increase of 1.75c per litre in the price of petrol, bringing the highest maximum wholesale price of petrol to 71.63c per litre in Sydney and 70.77 cents per litre in Perth. Given that the forecast price of oil in the Budget was stated at $23 per barrel and that the price of crude oil is currently reported at over $31 per barrel, on what basis of assessment was the Government's forecast made? Has the Government prepared any forecasts of the impact the inflationary effect of this will have on the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to recall the Budget statements, which Senator Knowles clearly does not. As I recall it, in putting the price at $23 a barrel for the Budget year the Treasury was making what I think we would say was not even a forecast but a calculated guess at the average price of a barrel of oil over the 12 months period. Of course, that was totally dependent on the events in the Middle East, which at the time of the Budget were newly upon us. So I think it is fair to say that right from the beginning it was expected to be a difficult figure to calculate and one in respect of which, as I have said, a calculated guess was made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If potential hostilities in the Middle East were to cease, say, in the next month, it is pretty clear that the price of oil per barrel would come down fairly quickly, and in assessing an average over the 12 months it may be that the figure given in the Budget would turn out to be correct. But right from the beginning it was said that it was a risky exercise to assess such a figure. So the answer is that one has to wait and see. As to the question in so far as it relates to the inflationary impacts of the price of oil, again we will have to wait and see, because that is dependent on what happens in the Middle East.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen press reports from some writers of that type and I have heard comment-most recently in this chamber last night, as a matter of fact-along the same lines. It should be remembered that the Fraser Government, the one that preceded us, operated from 1981-82 a decentralised wages system which struck the trifecta: it had double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, and double digit wages growth, that is, inflation of 11.5 per cent in its last year, unemployment of 10.1 per cent in its last year, and wages growth of 17 per cent in its last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By contrast, the accord has provided a magnificent new opportunity for Australians. More than 1.6 million new jobs have been created since 1983. The unemployment level during the Fraser years reflected a very low participation rate. The participation rate now, despite some contraction in employment growth, is still near record levels; and that is a figure that should be kept in mind. Disposable household income per head has risen by more than 11 per cent-I think it is 11.1 per cent-during the period of this Government. Under Fraser, average economic growth was 2.1 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Fraser Government, from 1975 to 1983, real unit labour costs went up by 1.7 per cent. From 1983 to 1990, real unit labour costs have gone down by 10.5 per cent. What has to be added to that is the extension of superannuation to large sections of the Australian work force, the improvement in Medicare that has enabled health insurance and health treatment to be within the reach of ordinary Australians, the fact that pensions are now at 25.5 per cent of average weekly earnings, the fact that tax cuts have been delivered regularly, and the fact that child-care places are three times higher than they were in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission has ultimate responsibility for wage fixing, but the Government is confident that accord mark VI is a positive and responsible package, that it will achieve continuing wage restraint, and that it will also continue the labour market reforms to which I have referred. Since the accord process began, it should be acknowledged, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has delivered wage restraint. Indeed, in accord mark 5, the wages outcome for the year 1989-1990 was 0.5 per cent below the wages Budget estimates target. So not only has it delivered within target, but last year it delivered half a per cent below that level, which is an exercise in restraint that I think has been unprecedented in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I refute the allegations that the accord is not working. It has delivered those huge advantages to the Australian community. If there is a tendency to see the accord as a fixed document and not a flexible one able to be adjusted to the circumstances of the economy, there might be a retrospective view. But it is a dynamic document able to bring change and improvement to the quality of life of ordinary Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer him to his outrage at an announcement of proposed amendments to company law in 1984 by the then Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities which, as I recall, led him, as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to move for a reference from the Senate to inquire into the whole question of company law and the legislative process. Does the Minister believe it is the responsibility of Mr Tony Hartnell, as Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission, or whatever he presently is, to announce his proposed legislation, or is it properly the function of the relevant Minister to announce the legislation, having gone through the due processes of Cabinet? Does the Minister still acknowledge the role of Parliament in rejecting, amending or passing such legislation? What is the status of the proposed legislation that Mr Hartnell has announced? Has the Minister seen the draft legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot recall the incident in 1984 with the clarity which is apparent to Senator Crichton-Browne. But I can say in relation to the statement made recently by Mr Hartnell about the exposure of certain draft legislation to do with the duties of directors, that that is part of a process that was undertaken by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee-I think under Mr Mark Burrows, a leading figure in the business world-at the request of the then Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The idea is that that legislation be exposed for public comment for some three months before the Advisory Committee makes its final recommendation to government as to the best form that such legislation might take. In other words, what is being put forward by Mr Hartnell is a process which allows the greatest possible participation by business interests, shareholders' representatives and the community generally in the formulation of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> As I recall Mr Hartnell's indication, the legislation which is proposed to be exposed for comment is to deal with loans to company directors, transfer of company assets and the disclosure of remuneration pay to executives-all matters of great concern in the community. I understand, though I cannot recall specific recommendations, that Senator Cooney headed a committee which, under his distinguished leadership, did look at certain questions in relation to company directors' duties. No doubt that will also be taken into account by government, as will the coming report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs under Mr Lavarch, which is looking into certain aspects of the rights of shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA> Between those parliamentary reports on the duties of directors on the one hand and the rights of shareholders on the other and this draft Bill being exposed for public comment, I imagine that the Government will be very well placed-I think this is the purport of Senator CrichtonBrowne's question-to take its responsibilities seriously, to come into this national Parliament and to present that legislation where, of course, it will be subject to the full processes of parliamentary debate, including full scrutiny in the Senate. What is more, we will be able to do it after 1 January in a way in which we have not been able to do hitherto-that is, as a national parliament, take full, exclusive responsibility for the legislation governing these very important matters.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of a television interview in which it was suggested that Australia could not afford a project such as the multifunction polis. I must say that on the back of these press reports of the British Broadcasting Corporation interview with Mr Bannon, Senator Coulter has put out a press release yet again, which I propose to deal with in a moment. But let me say that in my view, unlike that of Senator Coulter, the MFP is an important national project, not a parochial city initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Premier Bannon got a hard time from the BBC in that it was constantly put to him that because of the spectacular failures of some of our high-flying, more colourful entrepreneurs, Australia was not a good place in which to invest. The fact of the matter is that the collapse of some of the corporate cowboys here has meant that some hard work has to be done to ensure the good name of this country with international investors and to establish that there are many solid investment opportunities in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true, of course, that the MFP is an ambitious project. But it will not go ahead, as I have said repeatedly in this place, unless the feasibility study now under way establishes, firstly, that it is in the best economic interests of this country and, secondly, that it has the support and understanding of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that Senator Coulter alone in this community is not prepared to wait for that feasibility study of the MFP proposal to be completed before condemning it out of hand. I must say the preliminary study, by the joint steering committee, concluded that there was potential to significantly benefit the long-term economic growth of Australia, and a number of industry sectors were identified in which international investment opportunities could be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say there has been considerable international investor interest in the MFP. Several international companies have recently visited Adelaide to discuss the project with the State Government. I have been approached by a number of international companies and they will be concerned to assess proposals and get involved in the MFP at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter-I mention him in passing because he is an honourable senator, a member of this Senate-says in his press release today that the MFP is a publicly funded gravy train for Japanese construction firms. Senator Coulter is never one to let the facts get in the way of a good press release and he seems to make up his press releases as he goes along.</PARA>
<PARA> First of all, there has not been a decision to build the MFP, let alone select the construction firms. The project, as I said, is truly international, and raising the spectre of a Japanese dominated project, however inaccurate, may help boost the numbers at Senator Coulter's little rallies in Adelaide against the MFP, but it will do nothing to help determine whether the MFP is in Australia's best interests or not.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter said that Mr Bannon should spare us the charade of trying to internationalise the MFP. All I can say is: What does he think the Premier is doing in Europe? There are some people in Australia who would reject any development proposal. I suspect Senator Coulter is one of them. I resent, however, the suggestion that it is, as he put it, some Japanese gravy train, because, as I said, although that may be designed to add a few numbers to his little rallies in Adelaide, it will not do anything in terms of a fair assessment of the project.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Walsh always used to describe the Australian Democrats as the `fairies at the bottom of the garden' party. What Senator Coulter is lending to that description is something new-a woodshed at the bottom of the garden, and, according to him, there is something rather nasty in the woodshed. So what we have had in the new version Democrats is a replacement of fairies--</PARA>

<PARA> As to Mr Bannon's trip to Europe, his experience in the sort of program which the BBC conducted is not vastly different from the experience to which many other Ministers in this Government and State governments have been subject, and it is largely based, as I said, on the very bad reputation that business in this country has got from the activities of some very unreliable entrepreneurs.</PARA>

Is it true that at the time the Dutch and Italian governments had not committed warships to the blockade and did not announce naval deployments until 13 August, contrary to the Prime Minister's claim? Further, is it true that the Prime Minister considered the deployment of ground support technicians and a 20-person medical team to the Gulf region to be administrative matters and, therefore, not requiring consultation with the full Caucus and the Leader of the Opposition as promised?

The Prime Minister has not misled the Australian public in respect of the commitment to the Gulf. The decision made by Australia to contribute ships to the multinational force was not, as her question implies, justified by the action of west European forces. It was justified by the actions of the United Nations and by Australia's own national interests.</PARA></TALK.START>

Any suggestion that the United Nations force in the Gulf lacks broad international support is obviously false.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to Senator Vallentine's last point: the Prime Minister considers that the establishment of logistic and medical support arrangements for our ships in the Gulf did not change the role of those ships or the nature of our commitment to the Gulf.

Mr Dharsono had been convicted in 1986 of attempting to undermine the Government and inciting and causing unrest-essentially political offences. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, reduced to seven years on appeal. He was also a prominent member of the opposition group of fifty.

While there may continue to be issues of human rights concern in Indonesia-and the Australian Government will continue to monitor closely the situation and continue to react as appropriate when those situations arise-I am encouraged by the recent positive signs in Indonesia, including Mr Dharsono's release.

Was the central office decision on two separate occasions made to protect the revenue base regardless of law, equity, environment and local employment consequences?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer in relation to the question asked earlier by Senator Alston. I must apologise to him. The wording of the index to the brief reads: ACT/NT anomalies decision. That did not give me a sufficient label to enable me to answer Senator Alston's particular query. However, I will give the answer that is in the brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government accepts the Full Bench decision of 14 September 1990 to accept a negotiated award restructuring for child-care workers in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory. There was an unusual level of support for the new rates and structures from both non-profit and commercial employers.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision is the result of an extremely detailed and lengthy investigation by the Commission over two years. The Government welcomes the significant benefits likely to flow from the decision. The new structure will give workers better career paths and training opportunities and will reduce wastage rates in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The phased increase in rates over the next 18 months will enable costs to services to be absorbed more easily. Fees for child-care places will rise to some extent but the Government has already announced that it is increasing the fee relief ceiling to $100 from 1 October 1990. These sweeping changes to fee relief will be extended to commercial and employer-provided centres from 1 January 1991. In addition, the Government has promised to index the fee relief ceiling from 1 October next year.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures will assist low and middle income families to meet any extra costs arising from the decision, except where some services in the ACT are already charging more than the $100 fee relief ceiling. The Government believes that this decision is a positive step towards the introduction of nationally consistent awards for child-care workers which will provide a more stable base for its expansion of places over the next five years.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will recall that my former colleague, Senator McGauran, secured the passage in this place of an End of War List Bill in 1989. This credit for this Bill, as the Senate is well aware, goes entirely to Senator McGauran for his unstinting work on behalf of those who served in the Vietnam war and who have not yet been recognised by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I therefore consider it appropriate that Senator McGauran's original second reading speech, which launched the Bill on its successful passage through this place in 1989, be again placed on record to commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Private Member's Bill before the Senate relates to an unfinished chapter in Australian history; that is the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA>The chapter relates to the failure of the Whitlam Government to establish an End of War List on the return home of the Australian troops from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>After every war which Australians have served in an End of War List has been drawn-up. </PARA>
<PARA>The Vietnam War stands as the exception. </PARA>
<PARA>End of War Lists are established for the purpose of recognising individual acts of valour that were overlooked in the disruption of the war. The list itself consists of a quota of awards ranging, from a `Mention-in-Dispatches' to the highest honour of a Victoria Cross. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to create an End of War List for the Australian Defence Forces personnel who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill has the full support of the National Executive of the Returned Services League and the Vietnam Veterans Association. The RSL has written to all its branches in Australia requesting its members to sign a petition of support. </PARA>
<PARA>These petitions are being presented on a daily basis to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of an End of War List has much to do with maintaining a certain spirit of Australia, a spirit born out of the Gallipoli campaign. That spirit of pride and appreciation Australians have towards service men and women in times of war. </PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of the horror and evil of war, Australians have always had an appreciation of, and respect for those who fought and died wearing the Australian uniform. That is what each ANZAC Day parade symbolises. </PARA>
<PARA>Not to recognise individual acts of valour in the Vietnam War would be to destroy that spirit passed on through time. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless the decision not to establish an End of War List is reversed, the Vietnam veterans can never be on a par with veterans from past campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody should doubt that because of the decision not to establish an End of War List, that there are now many unsung heroes of the Vietnam war. Two cases of young Australians who died in heroic service have been brought to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA>Documents released following a Freedom of Information Act request show that the three Defence Departments-the Army, Navy and Air-made two requests for the establishment of an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA>The first request was made in 1972 to the Minister for Defence in the McMahon Government, Mr David Fairbairn and was rejected upon the grounds that hostilities were continuing in Vietnam and Australian troops were still in South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted that the future establishment of such a list was not ruled out by Mr Fairbairn. </PARA>
<PARA>The second request was made some nine months later when all of the Australian troops were home. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Whitlam Government's Minister for Defence, Mr Lance Barnard, rejected the request on the grounds that it would be seen to be celebrating the war. </PARA>
<PARA>That decision distinctly lacked an understanding of the Australian people and their history. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody at the time of Gallipoli or since could claim the campaign to be an event to celebrate. Indeed, Gallipoli was both a wartime and political disaster. Yet, what we do recognise and remember from that time are the individual acts of valour and those Australians who did not come home. </PARA>
<PARA>The real hang-over and shame of the lost Vietnam War comes from the fact that Parliament has been unwilling to accept this age-old tradition, for the single reason of fearing the revitalisation of the war debate. We have had to live with that mistake ever since, as we have had to live with defeat in the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA>I am reminded of one story told to me by a veteran. He said that while his attitude was against Australians being called up to fight, he believed that once in the battle zone, every soldier was duty bound to fight with every ounce of strength for those fellow Australians alongside him. If there was one weak link in the fighting chain, all his mates would be in danger. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the atmosphere and reality of the war zone in Vietnam regardless of the opinions and demonstrations at home. </PARA>
<PARA>It is to that spirit which those who served in Vietnam were so true. </PARA>
<PARA>It was not until the 1987 Coming Home Parade, organised by the Vietnam veterans themselves some 14 years after the soldiers left the battlefields of South East Asia, that the first step towards breaching the gap between the veterans and the Australian society was taken. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a very moving event for those who watched the thousands of Australian men and women march. The marchers had been given no victory, no glory and not even any pride in having done their duty until that day. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not help but believe Australia, on that day, had begun to heal the bitter divisions of the war, that the spirit of all that had made the Australian character so unique in the world had returned-that unique spirit of unconquerable determination of Australians against adversity. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, that spirit of mateship was present that day, when stories of bravery and loss were told. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Coming Home Parade was the first step taken, the second step must be the approval of an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA>Many will say that time has passed and it is best to let such a controversial war be forgotten. `Besides', they will ask, `how could any investigation after so long reveal adequately the events of that war'?</PARA>
<PARA>To that I would reply that, in this Senate just before last Christmas, the War Crimes Amendment Bill was passed. That Bill sought justice some 50 years after World War II. The justice that was sought there was to seek out war criminals. The justice I seek is to seek out war heroes. </PARA>
<PARA>In my speech on the Bill I said:</PARA>
<PARA>As we fast approach a new century, the year 2001, we are being asked to look back to a time that for so many was a time in history books, old film footage and, indeed, museums, and I am one such person who was not even born when the atrocities occurred in the Second World War. So it is significant for me to add that my generation has never been asked to go to war. We have been privileged with an era that has not challenged our beliefs to a point where we must take up arms and defend them in war. I rise to speak for that very reason. What my generation owes to past generations is due to the will and suffering of past generations of Australians and Europeans. My generation can say that they live in a free Australia. I believe that the past era should not be forgotten. A time should not be placed on justice, nor should there be a time to forget the dead. That is what every Shrine of Remembrance in this country asks of us-`Lest We Forget' the fallen soldier and civilian. </PARA>
<PARA>I hold the same belief in seeking the establishment of an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now turn to individual aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill would establish an End of War List Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal is to consist of 3 members from each of the three arms of the Australian Defence Force: the Navy; Army and Air</PARA>
<PARA>The three members would be appointed by the Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA>The function of the Tribunal is to prepare a list of Australian service personnel who served in the Vietnam War, being persons who did not receive awards for valour in respect of the relevant military conflict but who should, in the opinion of the Tribunal, receive awards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal is also to recommend to the Minister the level of the awards that the Tribunal believes should be granted. </PARA>
<PARA>In keeping with the spirit of the original request by the defence force a quota of 30 awards can be recommended, although the Bill empowers the Minister to expand the list beyond the initial total of 30 awards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal, in making its recommendations, is not to have regard to whether or not the rigid monthly quota of awards used by the defence forces during war time was filled. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also establishes the principle that such a tribunal would be established for future military conflicts. This aspect of the Bill would ensure that political considerations could never again prevent the creation of End of War Lists. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, at a time that we are commemorating World War II 50 years since it began and are preparing to commemorate Gallipoli 75 years hence, let now be the time to put aside the arguments for and against the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA>Let now be the time to turn to the question of finally bringing our troops home. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer will finally depend upon this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek the support of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. </PARA>

<PARA> Most of the information requested by the honourable senator relates to other countries' military forces and activities in the South Pacific.
