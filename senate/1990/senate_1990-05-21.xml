<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>ORDERS OF THE SENATE</PARA>
<PARA>In debate in the Senate on 16 May 1990 on the 13th Report of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, Senator Coates expounded a view that certain orders of the Senate no longer have effect. His view appears to be that only the standing orders continue in effect beyond the session in which they were passed, and that all other orders passed in previous sessions have ceased to operate. Senator Colston appeared to support this opinion.</PARA>
<PARA> I know of no basis in parliamentary law or practice for this view. If it were valid, it would apply with equal force to the standing orders: if the Senate lacked the power to make an order continuing in effect beyond the session, it would have no power to make standing orders. There is no basis for distinguishing orders which continue and those which do not other than their terms and intent, as is pointed out in the introductory note in the standing orders volume.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact the Senate, in common with other comparable houses, has always made orders which have continued in effect beyond a session. Such orders are less common in the Senate than in other houses, because the Senate's procedures are largely codified in comprehensive standing orders, but many houses operate under orders which have continued over many sessions. The British houses regard themselves as bound by orders many years old; for example, the detailed rules of the House of Commons relating to references to matters sub judice are contained in resolutions passed in 1963 and 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be very strange indeed if the Senate agreed to an order requiring the tabling of documents in May and November each year with the knowledge that the order would cease to have effect at the end of the session (order relating to proclamation of acts, 29.11.88), or if the Senate issued a warning against any interference with witnesses with the knowledge that the warning would be withdrawn at the end of the session (resolution relating to interference with witnesses, 13.9.84).</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates' reasoning would apply with equal force to rulings of the President, which have always been regarded as binding on the Senate until altered by deliberate decision of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Coates' view were to be taken as the view of the majority of the Senate, it would have, amongst others, the following consequences:</PARA>
<PARA> the detailed procedures for the protection of witnesses imposed by the Senate upon its committees by the orders of 25 February 1988 would be of no effect, and committees would be free to ignore them</PARA>
<PARA> the procedures imposed upon the Privileges Committee for the protection of witnesses and accused persons would be of no effect, and that committee would be free to ignore them</PARA>
<PARA> the President and the Privileges Committee would have no criteria to guide them in dealing with matters of privilege which may be raised</PARA>
<PARA> the procedures whereby persons adversely referred to in debate in the Senate may make a response would not be available</PARA>
<PARA> litigants wishing to refer to proceedings of the Senate in court proceedings may not be able to do so without petitioning the Senate</PARA>
<PARA> courts and police would no longer be under an obligation to notify the President of any arrest or detention of a Senator</PARA>
<PARA> the status of meetings of committees held between 19 February and 8 May 1990 would be cast into doubt</PARA>
<PARA> statutory authorities would be under no restraint in claiming exemption from answering questions about their operations before Senate committees</PARA>
<PARA> the standing committees would not be obliged to follow the procedures formerly required of them for the consideration of annual reports</PARA>
<PARA> the Government would be under no obligation to respond to committee reports</PARA>
<PARA> the President would not be able to grant access to old committee documents</PARA>
<PARA> Senators would not be able to ask for an explanation of the failure to answer a question on notice</PARA>
<PARA> executive departments would be under no obligation to notify and explain the failure to proclaim provisions of legislation</PARA>
<PARA> the media would not be authorised to rebroadcast proceedings of the Senate, and the status of all broadcasts since 19 February 1990 would be cast into doubt</PARA>
<PARA> all the procedures relating to the reference of bills to committees would be no longer in effect, so that:</PARA>
<PARA> - the Senate should not have appointed the Selection of Bills Committee</PARA>
<PARA> - there is no time limit on motions to refer bills to committees</PARA>
<PARA> - Estimates Committees have been operating under the wrong procedures</PARA>
<PARA> - there is no limit on debate on motions for the suspension of standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA> This list, I think, sufficiently indicates that it would be most inconvenient, to say the least, if Senator Coates' view were to be taken to be that of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that early action be taken either to give some indication that the majority of the Senate does not accept that view or, if that view is regarded as having any validity, that the orders of the Senate which it is desired to continue are brought forward for debate and renewal.</PARA>
<PARA> I have sent this letter to party leaders and independent Senators.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Kerry Sibraa</PARA>
<PARA>President of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>The Clerk has sent me a copy of his letter dated 17 May 1990 which he wrote to the Manager of Government Business about Orders of the Senate. The letter commented on the views I expressed on 16 May in the debate on the Appropriations and Staffing Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a problem which needs to be faced so that there is no doubt about the status of some important decisions of the Senate. I propose that the issues be considered by the Procedure Committee as quickly as possible; I will give a notice of motion to that effect today.</PARA>
<PARA> You will not be surprised that I disagree with much of what the Clerk stated in his letter. However, I agree with him that the question of intent is crucial to whether a resolution of the Senate should have continuing effect. The problem is that there is not always a complete consensus about that intent, and it is no solution for it to depend on the Clerk's own interpretation, without even a ruling from you.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, whoever is responsible for choosing such resolutions is in an invidious position, having to make subjective decisions about intent. I would have thought it essential for there to be no possibility of disagreement about such a matter, in order to avoid uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution provides in section 50 that the Senate ``may make rules and orders with respect to-</PARA>
<PARA>(i) The mode in which its powers, privileges, and immunities may be exercised and upheld;</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) The order and conduct of its business and proceedings . . .''.</PARA>
<PARA> I assume this is the basis for, and limit of, the Senate's ability to ``legislate'' alone.</PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk claimed that, if my view were valid about so-called continuing orders, it would also apply to the Standing Orders. I suggest that that does not follow. The Standing Orders are clearly about the order and conduct of the Senate's business and proceedings and, importantly, are consciously and explicitly adopted as standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, orders adopted to modify the Standing Orders temporarily are explicitly adopted as sessional orders and such orders expire at the end of the session in which they were made.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with introducing a category called Continuing Orders is that their intent is not always clear, yet they would have the status of standing orders without being part of that discrete, numbered collection. It could be acceptable for an order to have continuing effect, if that were explicitly stated in its terms and, of course, provided it falls within the limits of section 50 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>Referral of bills to committees</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The motions as originally drafted for the referral of bills to committees included words to the effect that they were to be ``continuing orders''. In fact, they were changed to be sessional orders because the clear intention was that they were to be an experiment to last only for the expected period of sittings beginning in February 1990. Since those sittings did not eventuate, the current status of those resolutions are, at the most, ambiguous. I would argue that, as they were agreed to be only sessional orders, they expired with the end of the session in which they were adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the Clerk has used an alternative interpretation that their proposed commencement ``on the first sitting day in 1990'' should have priority over their status as sessional orders. This has had the effect of contradicting the clear intent of all sides in the Senate last December that they should operate with a sunset arrangement so that (regardless of the outcome of the election) the trial would be for only one period of sittings. It was certainly not the intent that they operate indefinitely, or even just for a whole session (which is usually equivalent to the life of a Parliament).</PARA>
<PARA> I believe those sessional orders needed to be re-adopted at the start of the new session, and I presume that when that happened, if the intent remained the same as it was in December, a limit of the end of 1990 would have been inserted.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Clerk believes that intent is always self-evident, one might ask why the reference to them as continuing orders was included in the original draft. Or, if that were not his doing, why he did not advise that the intent of a limited experiment would not have been met if those words had been included.</PARA>
<PARA>The Privileges resolutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In contrast, no doubt the Privileges resolutions (the first five `consequences' itemised in the Clerk's letter) were intended to be continuing, but maybe it would provide more certainty if that were explicitly stated, or if they were re-affirmed at the start of each session. However, I do not see why these resolutions could not be incorporated in the Standing Orders.</PARA>
<PARA>Other resolutions probably intended to have continuing effect</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Some other resolutions referred to in the Clerk's letter were probably intended to have continuing effect. Amongst these I would include the procedures for committee consideration of annual reports and for the disclosure of old committee documents. Again, I would have thought it preferable for such matters to become standing orders, rather than rely on implicit recognition of them merely by their continually being observed.</PARA>
<PARA> I would be less sure about the authorisation for rebroadcast of excerpts of proceedings. This was initially adopted as a trial and was extended, as I understood it, subject to the continued compliance of the media with the conditions. I suspect that the current session is the first in which that authorisation has not been explicitly renewed.</PARA>
<PARA>Resolutions requiring government responses</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>I believe these resolutions (such as those about responding to committee reports, answers to questions and listing unproclaimed legislation) are of a declaratory nature. They are observed (mostly!) by the Government not so much because they are `orders' but because the requests are neither eminently reasonable or not worth the trouble of contesting.</PARA>
<PARA> The one about responding to committee reports is even in terms of an opinion:</PARA>
<PARA>`The Senate declares its opinion that . . . the Government should . . . with a request . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>Resolutions expressing opinions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A problem has really arisen only because of the inclusion as `continuing orders', amongst the items I have referred to above, of various resolutions which merely expressed opinions. These include several of political contention or controversy of particular relevance at the time they were adopted. In at least some cases, if they were to be proposed again now, they could easily be judged to be no longer at issue. So such matters are particularly inappropriate to be labelled either as continuing or as orders. I suggest that such items merely expressing opinions do not fall within the limits of section 50 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> It may be significant that these matters, while they are included in the collection of so-called continuing orders, are not mentioned in the Clerk's letter. They contain such phraseology as: ` . . . in the opinion of the Senate . . .' (casual vacancies); ` . . . is of the opinion that the Government should not . . .' (ABS surveys); ` . . . no changes . . . should be made . . .' (parliamentary departments structure-the one of such concern to Senator Crichton-Browne).</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure I could find others from the past expressing opinions of just as much significance as these, but of no more and no less continuing effect. (Of those included, none dates from earlier than 1971.) It may well be useful for all such resolutions to be collected together for historical and debating purposes, but it would be wrong to characterise them as orders.</PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of such debatable items amongst the Continuing Orders has merely served to cast doubt on the rest. Perhaps, if they had not been included, no problem would have arisen. But there is no clear cut dividing line, so they are all subject to doubt.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, it is necessary to renew those orders which clearly have the status of orders and which ought to continue. The Procedure Committee should consider this suggestion, and the option of incorporating them in the Standing Orders, urgently.</PARA>

<PARA> a choice of lump sum or pension benefits;</PARA>
<PARA> flexible contribution rates for members;</PARA>
<PARA> substantially improved resignation benefits; and</PARA>
<PARA> significantly tightened invalidity provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme will be the main superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees. The scheme will cover all Commonwealth sector employees, except those of Government Business Enterprises, and other Commonwealth agencies, that have separate superannuation schemes for their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Membership will be compulsory for new permanent employees, and optional for all other staff, subject only to a three-month qualifying period. Superannuation will in future be available to around 35,000 temporary employees of the Commonwealth who are unable to join the current scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The form for the employer benefit in the current scheme is a non-commutable pension. Consistent with the Government's policy that lump sums are a legitimate form of superannuation benefit, the new scheme will provide a choice of lump sum or pension benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The standard benefit on age retirement will be a lump sum. However, members will be able to convert 50 per cent or more of their retirement lump sum to an indexed pension, at very attractive rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the new scheme provides a subsidy in order to encourage people to take a pension. This encouragement is in addition to the general tax incentives favouring pensions over lump sums, particularly the higher reasonable benefit limits available when pension benefits are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme will give Commonwealth employees access to the lump sums available to private sector employees, and be consistent with the Government's Retirement Income Policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, these reforms are based firmly on the principle that Commonwealth employees should have the same superannuation options and be subject to the same regulations and restrictions as the rest of the workforce. The new scheme will comply with the occupational Superannuation Standards, including the Reasonable Benefits Limits. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current scheme, the member contribution rate is a minimum of 5 per cent of salary. In the new scheme, members will be able to contribute between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of salary. This will enable members to tailor their contributions to suit their changing financial circumstances throughout their working life. </PARA>
<PARA> Benefits will be linked to member contributions, and will include the 3 per cent productivity benefit. The maximum retirement benefit for members on average salaries of between $25,000 and $37,560 a year will be a lump sum of eight times average salary, or a fully indexed pension of 80 per cent of average salary. </PARA>
<PARA> Members on higher salaries will have maximum benefits below eight times average salary in accordance with the Reasonable Benefits Limits. Members on lower salaries will be able to receive a lump sum of up to $200,000. This may be converted to a fully indexed pension of up to $20,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, one of the most significant initiatives in the new scheme is a major improvement in resignation benefits. This will correct a major inequity. More than two-thirds of members of the current scheme receive no employer benefits because they resign before retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> On resignation, members of the new scheme will be entitled to a refund of their own contributions with interest. They will be able either to take this in cash on resignation or leave it in the scheme until retirement. Members who resign will also receive their 3 per cent productivity benefit accumulated with interest when they ultimately retire from the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a member's entitlement to the remainder of the employer-funded benefit will start to phase in after one year's membership. After four years' membership, employees will be entitled to the full employer benefit at retirement. Thus, all members will receive a Commonwealth superannuation benefit on retirement, even if they had resigned from Commonwealth employment many years beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> These significant improvements in superannuation benefits for Commonwealth employees will be funded primarily by tightening invalidity arrangements. While many of the persons receiving invalidity benefits in the current scheme are genuine invalids, there is evidence that invalidity retirement has been abused. A significant proportion of members have been retired on invalidity grounds by their employer against the advice of Commonwealth Medical Officers. Invalidity rates in the current scheme have been five to ten times private sector rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Invalidity retirements must be brought into line with general community standards. The current scheme provides a significant financial incentive towards invalidity retirement rather than early age retirement. In the new scheme, invalidity benefits will be more closely aligned to age retirement benefits. The assumed retirement age for calculating invalidity benefits will be reduced from 65 to 60, better reflecting existing retirement patterns. </PARA>
<PARA> Administration of invalidity retirement will be tightened. To receive an invalidity pension, a member will have to meet the definition of invalidity in the Occupational Superannuation Standards. That is, a pension will be paid if the member is unlikely ever to work again in any occupation for which he or she is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience. Retraining potential will also be taken into account. The Trustees of the scheme will have the final say on whether invalidity benefits are to be paid. These measures will eliminate the rorts, while still protecting genuine invalids. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, invalidity benefits will no longer be subject to a complex administrative process which involved determining if the cause of invalidity is related to medical conditions existing at entry up to 20 years earlier. For those presently caught by this process, invalidity benefits will be improved, in some cases very substantially. For others, except for career employees, invalidity benefits will generally be less attractive than in the current CSS. In all cases, genuine invalids will be provided with an adequate pension having regard to their service to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, thanks to this Government's initiatives, less than full career Commonwealth employees will have superannuation benefits from their previous employment to supplement Commonwealth superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, current Commonwealth employees will be able to benefit from these reforms. Contributions to the current scheme, except employees of Government Business Enterprises, and other agencies, that have their own superannuation scheme, will be given an option to transfer to the new scheme over the twelve months from 1 July 1990. Others, for example, people on extended leave without pay or who have a deferred benefit, will have an option to transfer to the new scheme when they rejoin a relevant area of Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a major information campaign to ensure all members have access to adequate information to make an informed transfer decision. Transferring members will receive a credit in the new scheme based on the standard transfer value in the current scheme of 3.5 times their accumulated basic contributions, plus their 3 per cent productivity benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I will now discuss the financial aspects of the new scheme. The ending of invalidity rorts means that the improvements in the new scheme can be provided at no additional cost to taxpayers. The consulting actuaries, TPF&amp;, and the Australian Government Actuary have certified that, for existing employees, the cost of the new scheme will be virtually identical to the cost of the current Commonwealth scheme, in net present value terms, after allowance is made for tax and social security ``clawbacks''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that the 3 per cent productivity benefit will be funded from 1 July 1990 putting this benefit for Commonwealth employees on the same footing as in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of lump sums on retirement instead of pensions brings forward expenditure. If all transferees were given immediate access to employer-financed lump sums from age 55 with a full credit for past service, the impact on the 1990-91 Budget outlays would be unacceptably high. Budget outlays could increase by up to $300 million in 1989-90 prices. For this reason, it has been necessary to phase in access to lump sums in the new scheme. Lump sum benefits will be available only to members aged 64 and over in 1990-91. This age will be reduced progressively on each 1 July, until lump sums are available to members aged 55 and over in 1994-95. The proposed phasing-in arrangements will limit the impact of lump sums on the 1990-91 Budget to an increase of no more than $21 million. </PARA>
<PARA> For the new scheme as a whole, Budget outlays in 1989-90 prices are estimated to increase by $131.8 million in 1990-91, $147.6 million in 1991-92 and $179.2 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> However, while net costs for existing members are the same in both schemes, there will be significant savings in respect of future employees. The cost to employers of superannuation for new entrants will fall from 13.1 per cent to 10.7 per cent of salaries, after allowing for tax and social security clawbacks and for increased coverage of casual and temporary employees. This is a saving of 18 per cent, or 2.4 per cent of salaries. Ultimately, this saving will be reflected in the Budget outlays, which will fall significantly.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the new scheme entails some significant changes to the administration of Commonwealth superannuation. The legislation for the new scheme is comparatively simple. Details of the scheme are spelled out in the Trust Deed and Rules included as a schedule to the Bill. A part-time Board of Trustees, with equal numbers of employer and employee representatives and an independent chairperson, will be established to oversee the new scheme. This is consistent with the thrust of the Occupational Superannuation Standards legislation that responsibility for fund administration and control be placed in the hands of scheme trustees. The joint employer-employee Trustees will have an obligation to protect members' interests. This will be reinforced with an extensive internal review mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements bring Commonwealth employees into the mainstream of Australia superannuation practice, and places their superannuation arrangements on the same footing as arrangements in the private sector. However, appropriate accountability to the Parliament will be maintained. Any changes to the Trust Deed or Rules will be by way of disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the new scheme is fully in accord with the Government's social justice strategy. The new scheme will substantially improve equity in Commonwealth superannuation. Membership of the scheme will be open to almost all employees, regardless of their employment status. Benefits will be related much more directly to the aggregate period of membership, whether served in one period or in broken periods. Broken periods of service will no longer adversely affect benefits. Accordingly, the significant indirect discrimination against women in the current scheme will be substantially eliminated. In summary, the reform of Commonwealth superannuation has major financial implications for a very large number of Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The detail of the new scheme is in the Rules forming part of the Schedule to the Bill. The Rules now include the provisions relating to part-time and casual employment and the other areas that time did not permit to be included in the 1989 Bill. However, a period of examination and experience over the next few months may well suggest technical improvements in the detail of the scheme. Appropriate changes to the Deed and Rules will be made wherever necessary to ensure that the scheme operates as intended. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government's Policy Statement ``Reform of Commonwealth Superannuation'' has been well received. The new scheme has been accepted by the ACTU and affiliates, and there has been broad support for the crackdown on invalidity abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988, the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The Superannuation Act 1976 provides the current superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees. Many of the changes proposed in the Bill are associated with the introduction of a new scheme by the Superannuation Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted in the Second Reading Speech on the Superannuation Bill 1990, contributors to the current scheme, except employees of Government Business Enterprises and other agencies that have their own superannuation scheme, will be given an option to transfer to the new scheme over the 12 months from 1 July 1990. Provision is being included in the 1976 Act for the arrangements for those transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also being included for the arrangements for transfers to the schemes of Government Business Enterprises and other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Second Reading Speech on the Superannuation Bill 1990 also referred to the abuse of the invalidity retirement arrangements under the current scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill tightens the administration of invalidity retirement under the current scheme to eliminate the rorts. It will do this by adopting the same administrative arrangements as for the new scheme. This will end the rorts while still protecting genuine invalids. A critical step in this process is the creation of the Commonwealth Superannuation Board. This Board will have the final say on invalidity retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, part of the savings expected from the elimination of the invalidity rorts will be used to provide a number of enhancements to the current scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Among these are-</PARA>
<PARA> recognition as salary for superannuation purposes of the updated former salary where a contributor experiences salary reduction;</PARA>
<PARA> provision for reversionary benefits to be payable to or in respect of certain children of a contributor or pensioner for whom maintenance payments were being made by the contributor or pensioner at the time of his or her death;</PARA>
<PARA> payment of pension to a surviving spouse of a deceased pensioner at the rate payable to the pensioner for six full fortnights after the pensioner's death before commencement of payment at the lower rate normally applicable to spouses;</PARA>
<PARA> allowing contributions to be paid during a period of unpaid maternity or parental leave at the option of the contributor;</PARA>
<PARA> changing the reduction in pension on retirement before age of 60 from 4 per cent to 3 1/3 per cent of the age 60 rate of pension for each year by which age at retirement is less than 60 years; and</PARA>
<PARA> basing the retirement pension on completed years and days, not just completed years of service. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these changes improve equity in the current scheme. They are desirable changes, but could only be responsibly introduced in current circumstances in the light of the savings from ending the invalidity rorts. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the 3 per cent productivity superannuation benefit for contributors to the current scheme is provided under the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 on an unfunded basis. From 1 July 1990, this benefit will be provided under the 1976 Act and employers will be required to pay contributions to meet the cost of the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This will bring the productivity benefit for members of the current scheme on to the same basis as for the rest of the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust will continue in its role of managing and investing the Superannuation Fund for the current scheme. It will also act as investment manager for the new scheme Board of Trustees for the 5 years from 1 July 1990. The Trust will, however, lose its monopoly role in relation to the funds of contributors who transfer to the schemes of GBEs and other agencies. Given that it is losing its statutory monopoly, to protect the integrity of the current scheme Superannuation Fund, the Trust is being provided with the opportunity to maintain the quantum of funds under its control by competing in the market. The Trust will be able to provide investment services on a fee for service basis, either discreetly or through unit trust or other pooled arrangements, for as wide a range of domestic and overseas clients within the public and private sectors as is constitutionally possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with this commercialisation of functions the composition of the Trust is being changed and its membership is being increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 also provides an unfunded 3 per cent productivity superannuation benefit for Commonwealth employees with no other employer-sponsored superannuation cover. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Interim Arrangement Act to provide a funded 3 per cent benefit to these Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers of persons with no other superannuation cover will be required to make 3 per cent contributions in respect of their employees to a superannuation fund. The fund is either to be a fund nominated by the Minister for Finance or an industry or other fund approved by the Minister. As a safety net, in the rare instance where a Commonwealth employer fails to make the required payments to a fund, the employees will continue to receive the existing unfunded benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is being taken to amend the Superannuation Act 1922 to bring its provisions in relation to pensioners who are imprisoned into line with those of the Superannuation Act 1976 and to amend the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 to recognise that the Contract Officers' Benefits Scheme established by that Act is now defunct. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I address the financial impacts of the amendments. With the enhancements to the current scheme being met by the savings from the tightened administration of invalidity retirement, the only significant financial impact results from the decision to fund the 3 per cent productivity benefit from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> For the current scheme, the net increase in Budget outlays expressed in 1989-90 prices is estimated to be $46.3 million in 1990-91, $38.6 million in 1991-92 and $31.9 million in 1992-93. The amounts fall in later years because the net increase takes into account moneys that otherwise would have been payable under the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 and because the number of persons in the scheme would be reducing. </PARA>
<PARA> For those Commonwealth employees with no superannuation benefit other than the productivity benefit, the net increase in Budget outlays in 1989-90 prices is estimated to be $19.6 million in 1990-91, $5.2 million in 1991-92 and $5.0 million in 1992-93. The significantly higher figure in 1990-91 results from the need for employers to pay to the nominated or other fund the amount of the benefit accrued up to 30 June 1990 under the interim arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> In aggregate, therefore, the net increase in Budget outlays is estimated to be $65.9 million in 1990-91, $43.8 million in 1991-92 and $36.9 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS (SUPERVISORY MECHANISMS) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the supervisory mechanisms to apply to the provision of superannuation to Commonwealth sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Bill re-enacts the existing Part XA of the Superannuation Act 1976, with certain minor drafting changes. It is no longer appropriate that these provisions be embedded in legislation governing a particular Commonwealth sector superannuation scheme. They are primarily used to monitor arrangements offered as an alternative to legislatively-based schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting this Bill, it is not the Government's intention to make any significant alteration to the supervisory mechanisms originally established by Part XA. The opportunity has been taken, however, to make certain minor changes to the drafting of the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, these changes are designed simply to ensure that the provisions operate as intended when Part XA was originally introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the supervisory mechanisms contained in this Bill will be capable of being applied even-handedly to all subsidiaries controlled by Commonwealth authorities or bodies. At the present time, Part XA can be applied to certain subsidiaries only. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is also drafted in terms which will ensure that it does not apply in any way to employees of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, or authorities, companies and other bodies funded by them. </PARA>
<PARA> As the provisions of the Bill are in most important respects identical to those of the existing legislation, it has no new financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I table a revised explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the income tax law to give effect to a 1989-90 Budget announcement requiring major employers to remit pay-as-you-earn tax instalment deductions, withheld from the salary or wages of their employees, to the Commissioner of Taxation on a twice-monthly basis. The twice-monthly remittance basis will first apply in respect of PAYE tax deductions made from the salary or wages of employees on or after 1 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The measure is one step in the revised PAYE remittance arrangements that would require larger employers to remit twice-monthly but with less frequent remittances than at present by smaller employers, which could obviate the need for the tax stamps system. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members would be aware that the Commissioner of Taxation has already announced a package of changes in the PAYE area, starting in July 1990, which includes less frequent remittances by group employers who pay less than $10,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of elements in that package directed at relieving the burden on small employers and overall some 400,000 small employers or 64 per cent of those in the PAYE system may benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> When the requirement for larger employers to remit PAYE tax deductions twice-monthly was announced in the 1989-90 Budget it was proposed to apply for deductions made on or after 1 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the enacting legislation lapsed when the Parliament was dissolved prior to the recent elections and is being reintroduced to apply, as I indicated earlier, in respect of deductions made on or after 1 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers affected by the measure will be those who deducted more than $5 million in tax instalments in the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or who do so in a later financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers who are members of a wholly-owned company group may also be required to remit their tax instalment deductions to the Commission on a twice-monthly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This rule will apply where the total amount of the deductions made by all the employers in the company group during the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or in a later year, exceed $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers who are subject to the new rules will be required to pay all deductions made in the first 14 days of a month by the twenty-first day of that month. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions made in the balance of the month are to be paid over by no later than the seventh day of the next month. </PARA>
<PARA> Once employers start to remit tax instalment deductions on a twice-monthly basis they must continue to do so unless the Commissioner determines otherwise because of a significant change in their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will produce a one-off revenue gain of $550 million in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill, apart from minor technical changes, is substantially the same as a Bill that was introduced on 30 November 1989 but which lapsed when the House was dissolved following the calling of the election. It amends the tax laws in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> It contains all but one of the capital gains tax measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget. These amendments do not encompass any fundamental changes in the design of the capital gains tax. Rather, they represent a fine tuning of the provisions that the Government believes necessary having monitored the function of the tax over the past four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes amendments on the subject of so called double dipping tax avoidance arrangements announced in December 1986. Since that time the Government has given detailed consideration to various representations received in relation to the matter and to the effects of numerous other legislative changes and developments both in Australia and overseas. It has decided that the scope of the arrangements requiring legislative action now is not as broad as that foreshadowed earlier. This result is reflected in the relevant provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure included in the Bill are the amendments to the research and development expenditure provisions foreshadowed on 7 September 1989. Also included are consequential amendments reflecting a change in the basis of payment of the carer's service pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill proposes a number of minor amendments to the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains three categories of capital gains tax measures. The first category are of an anti-avoidance nature, consistent with the Government's ongoing commitment to prevent abuses of the taxation system by a small minority at the expense of the honest tax-paying community. These amendments promote fairness and equity in the system and also prevent significant losses of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> These particular amendments-which generally apply to assets disposed of after 15 August 1989-are largely technical in nature. They will, amongst other things, vary the consideration taken to have been paid or received on an acquisition or disposal of an asset other than from or to another person, and will prevent abuses of certain concessional provisions relating to transfers of capital losses and assets between companies in the same group. Certain consequential amendments in relation to exemption from capital gains on the disposal of traditional securities are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also address technical deficiencies in the operation of provisions designed to prevent ``double-tax'' on the disposal of assets, and in transitional measures that apply on the disposal of shares or interests in companies or trusts acquired before 20 September 1985 where, on or after that date, the particular company or trust has acquired significant new assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The final anti-avoidance amendment will prevent taxpayers from obtaining benefits of indexation for amounts incurred on the acquisition of an asset-where the asset was not disposed of by another person-until such time as those amounts are actually paid. This will prevent widespread abuses, particularly in the area of nominally paid shares schemes in respect of liabilities to make call payments that are incurred but not yet discharged. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category of amendments will implement a number of concessional measures which, to the extent they operate to a taxpayer's advantage, will generally apply from 20 September 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Foremost amongst these concessional measures are amendments to the capital gains Principal Residence Exemption. Broadly speaking, these changes will expand the availability of an extended exemption for the construction of a new home, or during a temporary absence from an existing home. The circumstances in which the exemption is available to a trustee for periods where a home is occupied by a beneficiary will be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure provides rollover relief-that is, deferral of tax on accrued gains or the retention of the effective capital gains exempt status of assets originally acquired before 20 September 1985-for certain strata title conversions and incorporations of associations as companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Some minor technical amendments of a concessional nature are also included. These will ensure the availability of full indexation of amounts remaining in the cost base of shares or units following the payment of an amount that is not a dividend or amounts that are tax-free. The concessional treatment for rights or options issued by a company to shareholders of another group company is to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> They will also ensure that assessable amounts on the conversion of a convertible note are included in the cost base of the shares thereby acquired. The harsh operation of one of the transitional provisions in certain situations following the rollover of a taxable Australian asset to a non-resident group company is also to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these amendments have been brought forward by the Government in response to concerns identified about the operation of the capital gains tax, and are a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to a fairer tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category of amendments will ensure that certain capital gains provisions only apply from 23 May 1986, the date of introduction of the original legislation, rather than 19 September 1985 when the new regime was announced. The areas affected by this amendment concern the deemed disposals of created assets, for example, leases, options and restrictive covenants. These amendments will address concerns expressed by bodies such as the Law Council of Australia that the original provisions could, in certain circumstances, be perceived as having a retrospective application. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it is not possible to put a precise revenue figure on these CGT amendments. Some are concessional, some are not. On balance they will prevent a substantial loss of CGT revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Double Dipping Tax Avoidance Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will insert in the income tax law rules to counter arrangements-referred to as double dipping tax avoidance schemes-under which a tax benefit is obtained both in Australia and in another country for a loss incurred by a company that, under their respective income tax laws, is resident in both countries and that is essentially financing vehicle within a company group. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures will deny a dual resident investment company the ability to transfer either ``income'' or capital losses to other group companies under the group relief provisions of the income tax law. The amendments will apply to such losses incurred in the 1989-90 and subsequent income years. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is broadly in line with measures taken in the United States of America, United Kingdom, and New Zealand to counter the double deduction of losses. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will effectively prevent a dual resident investment company from having the ability to transfer to other group companies both ``income'' and capital losses under the group relief provisions. However, such a company will retain the ability to carry forward such losses for set off respectively against future income or capital gains it may derive. </PARA>
<PARA> Although they cannot be quantified, these measures are expected to result in revenue savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Research and Development Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes four changes to the operation of the research and development tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA> As the law now stands a deduction of up to 150% of the cost of acquisition of core technology may be allowable and in addition, the original developer may also have obtained a deduction for expenditure in developing the core technology. This can lead to a double deduction in relation to the same work. This Bill proposes, therefore, that the company acquiring or acquiring the right to use the core technology be only able to claim a deduction at the reduced rate of 100% of the expenditure incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change proposes that, where a deduction has been allowed or is allowable for expenditure on an R&amp; project, receipts from granting access to or the right to use the results of the project are to be included in assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> The third change relates to commercial risk in R&amp; ventures. Deductions at the rate of 150% are now available where all or some funds may be invested at less than full risk.The Government considers that the highest rate of deduction should only be applicable where all of an investor's funds are at full risk. New provisions are therefore proposed by the Bill which will reduce the deduction allowable proportionately, from 150% to 100%, as the element of risk is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the fourth change will widen the range of potential investors by deleting the requirement that syndicates of eligible companies must include financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings from these changes to the R&amp; tax concession are estimated to be $55 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Carer's Service Pension</PARA>
<PARA>Before 1 November 1989 a carer's service pension was payable only to a relative of a severely handicapped veteran where the relative provided constant care and attention to the veteran. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension is exempt from tax where both the veteran and the carer are below age pension age and the veteran is receiving a service pension because he or she is permanently incapacitated for work. In all other cases the carer's service pension is taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> The carer's service pension is now to be extended, operative from 1 November 1989, to any person caring for a severely handicapped veteran, without regard to whether he or she is a relative of the veteran. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will ensure that the existing tax treatment of the carer's service pension will be retained in respect of the person providing the care. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue effect of the amendment is expected to be negligible. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill, which was released as an exposure draft upon the election being called, amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. Many of the taxation measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget are included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It will authorise regulations to be made which will increase and more effectively target the pensioner and beneficiary rebates that are allowable to certain pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also modify the Medicare levy provisions to provide an exemption for certain people presently liable for one-half of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains amendments that will allow general losses, film losses and foreign losses incurred in the 1989-90 and future income years to be tax deductable over an unrestricted period. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of the general mining provisions and the mineral transport provisions will be extended to quarrying operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Not-for-profit bodies established for the promotion or encouragement of any game or sport, or community service purposes will be exempted from income tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The present income tax exemption that applies to the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd. will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains amendments to the imputation system that will result in companies incurring franking debits in respect of dividends paid under dividend streaming arrangements after 30 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible securities lending arrangements will be relieved from income tax, including that payable on capital gains, from today under amendments contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Profits from the disposal of contaminated livestock will be able to be brought to account over five years or applied to reduce deductions for the cost of replacement stock. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the sales tax law to exempt imported uncut precious and semi-precious gemstones and coins, including gold coins, that are legal tender in a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> A requirement under the film industry tax concession that certain funds be deposited in a film account in the Australian Film Industry Trust Fund will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Minor amendments to the tax file number provisions are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will allow income tax deductions for gifts made to a number of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioner and beneficiary rebates</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will authorise regulations to be made to effect those changes to the pensioner and beneficiary rebates which apply, broadly, to free from tax recipients of certain pensions or benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Relevant rebate amounts for the 1989-90 income year were announced by the Treasurer on 6 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the April 1989 Economic Statement the pensioner rebate is to be increased to allow married pensioners to receive a combined non-pension income of up to $70 per week before being liable for tax in 1989-90 and subsequent years. Where one spouse does not fully use his or her rebate the excess rebate will be transferred to the other spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> Single-rate pensioners will be able to receive up to $25 per week in non-pension income before being liable for tax in 1989-90. This amount will increase to $40 per week from 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The income test alignment is the first step towards meeting the Government's commitment that from 1995 the age and service pensions will be exempt from income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of the non-pension income will be indexed for 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> As notified in the 1989-90 Budget the beneficiary rebates will be more effectively targeted on the basis of age levels. </PARA>
<PARA> These rebates are available to recipients of social security unemployment, sickness or special benefits, the Job Search Allowance, the Formal Training Allowance or allowances payable under certain Commonwealth education schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The method of calculation of the rebates and the thresholds above which they start to shade-out will be provided for in the Income Tax Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of increasing the pensioner rebate is $50 million in 1989-90 and $150 million in 1990-91. The estimated gain to revenue from more effective targeting of the beneficiary rebates will be nil in 1989-90 and $12 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare Levy</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives effect to the announcement in the 1989-90 Budget that from 1 July 1989 a person who is otherwise personally exempt from Medicare levy will no longer be required to pay half levy because he or she has dependants, where they are separately liable to the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> This concession has since been extended so that where a person who is otherwise personally exempt from Medicare levy also has a spouse who would be exempt, then only one of them will now be required to pay half levy in respect of a child who is a dependant of both parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of these changes is $2 million in 1989-90 and $4 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Losses</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also give effect to the Budget announcement that the seven year limitation on the period over which losses, other than primary production losses, are able to be carried forward be removed for losses incurred in the 1989-90 and future income years. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no revenue cost for this measure until the 1989-99 financial year when a cost of $5 million increasing to an eventual full year cost of $20 million is estimated. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarrying</PARA>
<PARA>The general mining provisions and the mineral transport provisions will be extended to include expenditure incurred on quarrying operations, with two minor variations. </PARA>
<PARA> To reflect the longer average life of quarries, development expenditure will be deductable in equal instalments over the lesser of the life of the quarry or 20 years, as opposed to 10 years for mining operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions for expenditure incurred on housing and welfare facilities will not be extended to taxpayers engaged in quarrying operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital expenditure for the transport of quarry materials will also be deductable in equal instalments over 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 16 August 1989 and the cost to the revenue is estimated to be $10 million in 1990-91 and 1991-92 and is expected to peak at $20 million later in the decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Sporting Bodies and Community Service Organisations</PARA>
<PARA>An income tax exemption will be provided for not-for-profit bodies established for the promotion or encouragement of any game or sport or community service purposes: that is, for the promotion, provision or carrying out of activities, facilities or projects for the benefit or welfare of the community, or of members of the community in particular need. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to income of the 1989-90 and all later income years and is estimated to cost less than $1 million annually. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>The current income tax exemption accorded income derived by the Australian Wool Testing Authority will be removed with effect from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will ensure that any capital gain or loss is calculated on an entirely prospective basis from 1 July 1990 under the capital gains tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue gain of the removal of the exemption is estimated to be $1 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>Imputation-dividend streaming</PARA>
<PARA>Dividend selection plans established by companies have allowed those shareholders able to benefit most from imputation credits to obtain a greater share of these credits than their proportionate shareholding would allow. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in the Bill will result in companies being treated as having franked to the same extent all dividends paid on a single class of shares as part of the same distribution, including those paid by another company under an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure will apply to dividends paid under dividend streaming arrangements after 30 June 1990 and will prevent the erosion of potentially significant, but unquantifiable, amounts of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Securities Lending Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives effect to the 1989-90 Budget announcement that securities lending arrangements where the security returned is identical to that lent and it is returned within three months will be allowed relief from income tax, including that payable on capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA> The relief provided for eligible securities lending arrangements will have a negligible revenue effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention that the Government is engaged in further consultations with the Stock Exchange and other interested parties with a view to extending relief so as to assist in the process of introducing improved settlement procedures in the securities industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Disposal of Live Stock Because of Contamination</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives effect to the proposal announced on 1 September 1989 concerning the treatment of profits from the disposal of live stock because of contamination. </PARA>
<PARA> Two options will be provided. With the first option, profits will be able to be applied for up to 5 years to reduce the cost of replacement stock. Alternatively, the profits on disposal may be spread forward by equal instalments over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments, which will apply to live stock disposed of as a result of contamination on or after 1 July 1987 will cost an estimated $0.5 million in each of the first two years. Most of the cost will be recouped in later years.</PARA>
<PARA>Gemstones and Coins</PARA>
<PARA>The sales tax law is to be amended to exempt from sales tax, precious and semi-precious stones derived from mining operations carried on outside Australia. The stones must be imported in their rough form and must not have been subjected to any process or treatment that would alter their nature or condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Coins, including gold coins, imported into Australia that are legal tender in a foreign country are also to be exempted from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were announced on 18 October 1989 and are estimated to cost $3 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Film Accounts</PARA>
<PARA>Amendments made by the Bill will remove the requirement for investors to deposit funds in a film account, pending their expenditure on the film, where the 100 per cent rate of deduction applies. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will have no impact on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax File Number</PARA>
<PARA>The second phase of the tax file number arrangements, quoting tax file numbers in connection with investments, is to commence from 1 July 1991 with a phasing-in period from 1 July 1990 for existing investments. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of extensive consultations with representatives of the financial industry streamlining amendments are proposed. The amendments relate to the reporting, quotation, exemption and deduction provisions of the file number arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, amounts deducted from accounts with financial institutions as a result of the non-quotation of a tax file number are to be exempt from debits tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will also amend the gift provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Gifts of $2 or more made after 9 November 1989 and before 1 July 1992 to The Borneo Memorials Trust Fund and the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands War Memorial Foundation will qualify for deduction. The revenue cost from the inclusion of these two bodies is estimated to be $35,000 and $15,000 respectively in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Gifts made in relation to the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial project will be deductable if made on or after 1 July 1989 and before 1 July 1990. The revenue cost of this proposal is expected to be $500,000 in the 1990-91 year. </PARA>
<PARA> Gifts made after 9 November 1989 to non-profit companies that conduct life education programs in association with the Life Education Centre will also qualify for deduction. This concession is estimated at $200,000 in a full financial year. The Life Education Centre is to be specifically listed in the gift provisions. There will be no revenue consequences of this as the company is currently treated as a public benevolent institution under the gift provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill amends the laws in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are proposed as a consequence of changes to the companies legislation permitting companies to buy-back shares in themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The thin capitalisation rules will be amended to remove the exclusion of Australian-owned non-resident companies. Other amendments will extend the special depreciation for eligible trading ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will modify the manner in which certain exemptions from quoting tax file numbers are to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also give effect to the Treasurer's announcement that the requirements for a complying superannuation fund to obtain a certificate from an actuary will be removed or modified. </PARA>
<PARA> The operation of the quarterly provisional tax system will be modified as announced in the 1989-90 Budget and the base for the calculation of instalments of provisional tax for 1990-91 will be established. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to include 3 additional organisations in the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to fringe benefits tax and the sales tax legislation are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Share buy-backs</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives effect to proposals announced by the Treasurer on 31 October 1989 to amend the tax law to deal with changes in the companies legislation that permit a company to re-purchase its own shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a company buys-back its shares the amount paid to the shareholder for a share will be taken to be a dividend to the extent that the amount is drawn from a company's distributable profits. This is consistent with the general notion that any payment made by a company to the shareholder will be treated as a dividend for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The exception to this will be where the buy-back is made on the stock exchange, that is, on-market. Because the shareholder is unaware that the company is the purchaser the sale of the shares will be treated as if it had been to a third party. No amount of the purchase price will be a dividend but will be treated as the disposal proceeds on the sale of shares with any income tax or capital gains tax consequences determined. This will also be the treatment for that part of the purchase price not treated as a dividend in buy-backs that are not on-market. </PARA>
<PARA> For the company making an on-market purchase the imputation system will be amended so that a franking debit will arise as if the relevant part of the purchase price had been a dividend paid to the shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to buy-backs on or after 1 November 1989. An exception will be the amendments to the imputation system which will apply from the day on-market purchases are permitted on Australian stock exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the amendments is such that they are expected to result in some unquantifiable revenue savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Thin Capitalisation</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will remove the exclusion of Australian-owned non-resident companies from the thin capitalisation rules with effect from 1 July 1990. Following this amendment, an Australian-owned non-resident company's investment in an Australian enterprise may be subject to the thin capitalisation rules. </PARA>
<PARA>Trading Ships</PARA>
<PARA>As announced by the Government on 1 June 1989 as part of its shipping reform strategy, the current fiscal regime for new ships is to be extended for a further five years from the scheduled expiry date of 30 June 1992. The regime is a two part incentive that provides for a 7% taxable capital grant and a special accelerated depreciation concession for qualifying ships. The Bill extends the effective termination date of the depreciation concession to 30 June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue in 1992-93, the first year of the extended period of the depreciation concession, is estimated to be $23 million and $31 million in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>Actuary Certificate</PARA>
<PARA>Under the existing law funds are required to have, in most circumstances, an actuary's certificate when claiming a deduction for the cost of death and disability cover in respect of members. This Bill will remove the need for the fund to have a certificate when the death and disability components of the premium paid for an insurance policy are specifically identified. Further, in relation to endowment and whole life policies, a deduction equal to 10% and 30%, respectively, of the premium paid, will be available also without the need of a certificate from an actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the exemption for income relating to current pension liabilities, the Bill also proposes amendments which will require actuaries to value superannuation fund assets based on the expected earnings on those assets instead of the existing requirement that the value be based on the preceding year's earnings. The existing requirement is considered to be inappropriate particularly as the rate could fluctuate considerably from year to year. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to industry representations the obligation on superannuation funds to provide actuarial certificates with their returns of income will also be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are to have effect from 1 July 1988, the commencement date of the new superannuation taxation arrangements. However, if a fund had lodged a return of income before these amendments become law the amendments will not apply unless the trustee of the fund makes an election. </PARA>
<PARA> There is expected to be a negligible revenue effect from these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax File Number Provisions</PARA>
<PARA>After 30 June 1990 persons who are investors will be able to quote their tax file number to an investment body. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a person fails to quote a tax file number in respect of relevant investments in existence on 1 July 1991, the investment body will be required to withhold tax at the top marginal rate (plus Medicare levy) from any income arising from the investment on or after that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain investors are to be exempt from these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will widen the manner in which pensioners may claim an exemption from quoting a tax file number in relation to certain investments. Under the law as presently framed, such claims could only be made in writing. The Bill will authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to allow claims to be made in other ways, for example, by telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach is consistent with other existing provisions concerning the quotation of tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar change will be made in respect of entities not required to lodge income tax returns. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarterly provisional tax</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will give effect to two Budget proposals adjusting the operation of the instalment system of paying provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold for general exemption from the instalment system will be increased from $5,000 to $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, a taxpayer whose provisional tax payable in a year of income is $8,000 or less will not be required to pay instalments of provisional tax in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA> This change applies to provisional tax payable in the current and subsequent income years. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 130,000 former instalment payers will now be required to pay provisional tax only on an annual basis. Of this large number some 45,000 are over 60 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also give effect to another proposal to preclude a too early offset of provisional tax credit in a year of income against provisional tax charged for the succeeding year. </PARA>
<PARA> Credit arises where income tax assessed as payable for an income year is less than the credit for provisional tax previously paid for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the change, any excess provisional tax credit will no longer be offset against a quarterly instalment of provisional tax for the succeeding year which has been notified but is not yet due for payment. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will apply in respect of assessments of income tax made on or after 4 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional tax instalments for 1990-91</PARA>
<PARA>Under the system for paying provisional tax by instalments, the amount of the instalments for an income year-apart from the final instalment-is ordinarily calculated by reference to the taxpayer's total provisional tax liability for the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 lapsed on the dissolution of Parliament prior to the recent election. That Bill, among other things, proposed a method for calculating total provisional tax liability specifically for 1989-90, in line with the well established practice of past years. </PARA>
<PARA> Because that Bill lapsed, total provisional tax liability for 1989 was calculated on the basis of the standing provisions in the existing income tax law where this was more beneficial to taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> By this Bill, where the amount of a taxpayer's instalments of provisional tax for 1990-91 would ordinarily be calculated by reference to his or her total liability for provisional tax for 1989-90, those amounts are instead to be determined by reference to a notional total provisional tax liability for 1989-90. The amount of that notional liability will be the amount that would have been determined in accordance with the method proposed by the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 had that Bill become law. </PARA>
<PARA>Gift Provisions</PARA>
<PARA>Gifts of the value of $2 or more made to the National Foundation for Australian Women Limited after 4 February 1990 will qualify for a tax deduction. Further, gifts made to the unincorporated body known as the National Foundation for Australian Women will be deductable when made after 9 November 1989 and before 5 February 1990. The cost to revenue from the amendment is expected to be $50,000 in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the recent announcement by the Prime Minister, gifts made on or after 1 April 1990 to Landcare Australia Limited will be tax deductable. The annual cost of including this organisation is expected to be $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the inclusion of the Foundation for Development Cooperation Ltd in the gift provisions will have effect from 12 March 1990 and is expected to cost the revenue $500,000 annually. </PARA>
<PARA>Fringe Benefits Tax Amendments</PARA>
<PARA>The fringe benefits law allows employers in remote areas to amortise the taxable value of certain fringe benefits provided under remote area home ownership schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the schemes, employees are provided housing assistance, such as a discount on the purchase price of a home in return for agreeing to enter a contractual obligation restricting the employee's right to dispose of the property concerned for at least five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the FBT legislation the value of the fringe benefits may be spread over the period running from the date a benefit was provided until the employee is free to transfer the property on the open market, subject to a maximum period of seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to extend the maximum period of amortisation allowable to fifteen years in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> To be eligible for the extended amortisation period an employer must have, prior to 31 August 1988, provided fringe benefits under a remote area home ownership scheme which restricted an employee's right to dispose of property for a period of at least seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the new fifteen year maximum period of amortisation for the employer will only apply to amortised fringe benefits provided to an employee, where the obligation restricting his or her right to dispose of the property to which the benefit relates is entered into no later than 6 months after Royal Assent to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the revenue of this change is estimated to be $150,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax Amendments-ACT Self-Government</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the sales tax law to confirm the interim exemption from sales tax given by ACT regulations for goods for official use by ACT government departments and certain ACT authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill arises in the context of negotiations between Commonwealth and State Ministers on the future direction of corporate regulation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the passage by this Parliament of the Corporations Act 1989 and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, the need for reforms of our current system of corporate regulation has become more apparent. It is now commonly acknowledged that the current co-operative scheme is not able to provide the most effective method of regulation of our markets. There is an urgent need to restore investor confidence at home and to rehabilitate the international reputation of Australian markets and corporations. The Government sees the reform of corporate law as a significant element in its program of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> To resolve the present difficulties the Attorney-General recently sought and has had constructive meetings with State and the Northern Territory Ministers responsible for companies and securities regulation. At those meetings substantial progress was made by Ministers in resolving differences as to the substance and timing of the new arrangements for corporate regulation. Negotiations are continuing in particular on the funding and staffing aspects of the proposed new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill forms an integral part of the ongoing consultation with State Ministers. The majority of the Ministerial Council have agreed to the introduction of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General and his State and Northern Territory colleagues have placed the utmost importance on ensuring that there should be an orderly transition from the co-operative scheme to the national scheme. All Ministers are also keen to ensure that corporate regulation, especially in relation to investigations and prosecutions of offences, should not lapse due to any changes in administration or law. The approach set out in this Bill will facilitate an orderly changeover to the national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will facilitate interim arrangements for corporate regulation by the ASC until the final form of a new structure is agreed by the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory and the necessary new legislation and administrative arrangements are put in place. In effect, the Bill will enable the full-time members of the ASC to be appointed as full-time members of the NCSC. The current co-operative scheme laws will continue until new agreed national arrangements come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally the Attorney-General is hopeful that given the constructive spirit in which the recent negotiations have been conducted, the matters relating to the ASC will be successfully resolved in the near future from the point of view of all parties for the benefit of Australian investors and the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would amend the social security legislation to implement many of the social security measures announced in the Government's February Economic Statement this year. Among other things, these measures will tighten administration of income support for the unemployed, encourage labour market participation by spouses of married beneficiaries and continue the development of a common allowance structure for young people, whether they are in education, in training or seeking employment. Anomalies in income support arrangements will be removed. This Bill will also recognise the need for increased income support to be made available to certain victims of major disasters, such as the Newcastle earthquake. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the changes provided for in this Bill are labour market measures that are the forerunners to the far-reaching initiatives announced in the Treasurer's February Statement which involve the total overhaul of the unemployment benefit system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it has been recognised for some time that the wives of unemployed people on social security benefits have been disproportionately represented in the unemployment statistics. By and large, they have not shared in the employment growth generated since 1983 to anywhere near the extent that others in the community have. This Bill introduces the latest in a series of moves by the Government to give proper recognition to spouses as potential labour market participants in their own right rather than as ``dependants'' of breadwinners, a dated concept now largely inapplicable in modern society. </PARA>
<PARA> From September 1990, changes to the benefits income test will mean that beneficiary couples will be able to earn up to $60 a fortnight extra where both partners have earnings from personal exertion. In effect, the maximum free area under the income test would be $60 a fortnight where neither partner has income from personal exertion, $90 where only one does and $120 where both earn this type of income. </PARA>
<PARA> This initiative will allow beneficiary couples to take advantage of labour market opportunities without heavy penalty and should increase incentives for them to move back into the workforce in greater numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes a number of adjustments to some beneficiaries' rate of payment to improve equity as between social security recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> First, married beneficiaries under 21 who have no dependent children will receive the same rate as two single people of the same age, instead of the slightly higher rate which now applies to married couples and which could conceivably encourage young people to enter into marriage or de facto relationships for monetary reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Spouses of unemployment beneficiaries will have to qualify for payment of benefit in their own right under this proposal. At the same time the Government stands ready to deliver the full range of labour market assistance which has been so successful in getting the unemployed back to work. People already on benefit when this change takes effect will continue to receive the current higher rate so long as they remain qualified for continued payment. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the intermediate rate of unemployment benefit paid to 18 to 20 year olds will now distinguish between independent young adults and those who live at home with their parents. The new rate of $69.20 a week for those living at home is in line with the AUSTUDY entitlement. It removes an obstacle to the complementary workings of the youth social security and educational allowance systems and provides an incentive to young people to continue study. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the benefit entitlement of a married person whose spouse is on AUSTUDY is to be limited to half the normal combined married rate and the spouse's AUSTUDY allowance will be disregarded under the benefit income test. This would give the same entitlement to a couple consisting of one beneficiary and one AUSTUDY recipient as currently applies to couples where both are receiving benefit or both are receiving AUSTUDY. The effect of the income test on these couples would be rationalised since the AUSTUDY allowance would no longer monopolise the available income concessions, so work incentives would be restored. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Social Security Act provides for periods for the non-payment of unemployment benefit where a person is unemployed because of some voluntary act, misconduct as an employee, refusal to accept a job offer or failure to make reasonable attempts to find work. When someone fails one of these tests, the non-payment period is 2 weeks in the first instance, 4 weeks for a second, then 6 weeks, 8 weeks and so on up to a maximum of 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill, additional criteria for cessation of payment or for periods of non-payment of unemployment benefit are applicable. Where a person refuses to comply with a request to attend a CES office, benefit will cease to be payable. If a person fails either to attend a departmental interview or to respond to departmental correspondence such as a review form or questionnaire, a period of non payment will apply. Furthermore, the existing non-payment periods applicable in such situations are to be increased and made more effective as an incentive to remain in or find new employment. A second incident will now draw a 6 week non-payment period and each successive incident an extra 6 weeks, with no maximum period prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act also provides that a person who reduces his or her employment prospects by moving to a new place of residence without a sufficient reason for the move incurs a twelve week postponement period of payment of benefit. It is a sufficient reason, however, if the person moves to live with a family member who is already resident in that new place of residence or near a family member who is already resident in the new place. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that it is also a sufficient reason, and so a person will not have payment of his or her benefit postponed, if the move is necessary for the purpose of healing or alleviating a physical disease or illness suffered by the person or a family member. </PARA>
<PARA> Both income and assets tests apply to beneficiaries aged 25 years or more. At present, there are some concessions in these tests for younger clients. The assets test is applied to only those beneficiaries aged 25 or older and a parental income test in addition to the usual income test is applied to JSA recipients who are not independent from their parents' financial and social support. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of improving equity between beneficiaries in similar economic circumstances but different ages this Bill will extend the assets test to all beneficiaries younger than 25 and to those JSA recipients who meet parental independence criteria and who, therefore, are judged to be self-supporting. Furthermore, job search allowees still dependent on their parents will now be subject to a parental assets test, a real measure, as is the family allowance supplement assets test, of the family's capacity to support itself. </PARA>
<PARA> People who leave full-time education and register for unemployment benefit or JSA have to serve a 6 or 13 week benefit deferment period depending on their circumstances. This is to avoid making the income support system an easily accessible alternative to pursuing further studies. On the other hand, there is only a one week deferment period for payment of sickness benefit to school leavers. This is anomalous given that sickness benefit is really for people who lose earnings through being temporarily unfit for work. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, people who leave education and claim sickness benefit will now have to serve the same deferment period as do unemployment benefit claimants. People who would suffer severe financial hardship through this initiative may claim special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a requirement of the Act that applicants for sole parent and class B widow's pensions pursue their entitlements to child and spousal maintenance before having access to social security payments. This concept, which puts the onus on former partners and non-custodial parents to live up to their financial responsibilities to their children, is to be adapted and extended by this Bill to recipients of all other pensions and benefits. No additional pension or benefit and no mother's/guardian's allowance will be paid for a dependent child where the parent has not fulfilled the maintenance action requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> To do this, the parent must take reasonable action to obtain child maintenance if entitled to make such a claim and if the Secretary thinks it reasonable to pursue the claim. As is the case with sole parent pensioners, this requirement may be waived in circumstances which might cause unusual difficulty or distress, such as where there might be violence or another health or safety threat to the client or child from the liable parent, where rape or incest is involved, or where the absent parent's whereabouts or identity is not known. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also corrects problems associated with the application of recent initiatives which provided for increases in the rates payable to sole parents with children in receipt of JSA and for the removal of additional sole parent entitlements to pensioners with children aged 18 to 24 years. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision to withhold pension or benefit from people who have not pursued their entitlement to compensation will be introduced. This will make sure that insurers meet their proper responsibilities and that the social security system is not required to support people who could receive the same or more substantial support from compensation payable to them by an insurer or an individual. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill makes an important amendment to the treatment of income for a deserving group of people claiming or receiving social security pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments made by the Australian Government as compensation for Nazi persecution during World War II will no longer be treated as income under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Austria makes these payments to people because of the persecution they have suffered, including loss of health, property, education and official status. The Government sees it as inappropriate to continue to regard these special payments as income. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment, which takes effect from the date of the Government's announcement on 4 December 1989, is a logical extension of the earlier decision to disregard as income restitution payments for Nazi persecution made by the Federal Republic of Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 February 1990, Spain became an important partner in the network of social security agreements between Australia and other countries. This Bill provides for implementation of the agreement with Spain. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a refinement to the provisions relating to the overseas payment (or ``portability'') of Australian pensions. As from 1 July 1990 wife's pension and class B widow's pension will be paid overseas for a maximum of only 12 months. For those pensioners already overseas at that date, payments will stop 12 months later, at the end of June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Wife's pension is paid with little requirement for residential contact with Australia. Sole parent pensioners, who are in a comparable position to class B widows, already have a 12 month restriction on the overseas payment of their pensions. The Government believes that Australian taxpayers should not have to provide income support to non-residents in these circumstances and this Bill corrects the perceived anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act currently provides for the back payment of family allowances and family allowance supplement to the date of birth of the child where a claim form is lodged within 4 weeks of the birth. In the case of multiple births involving 3 or more children, the 4 week period may not give parents enough time to lodge claims. This Bill recognises the difficulties that these parents face and will allow them up to 13 weeks in which to lodge a claim for family allowance and family allowance supplement. Where a claim is lodged within this period arrears will be paid from the date of the multiple births. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the whole country was shocked at news of the Newcastle earthquake at Christmas time last year. Part of the Government's immediate response was to make sure that emergency income support was immediately available to people who needed to claim benefit as a result of the earthquake. This was done by waiving the usual benefit waiting period and by doubling the rate of the first week's payment to meet the urgent need of the Newcastle people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill formalises the arrangements that were announced on that sad occasion. It also provides, should the unhappy need arise, for similar arrangements to be made in future where the Minister determines that a major disaster has occurred. This could include natural devastation such as fire, flood or earthquake or other disasters such as a chemical spillage or burst dam. This would facilitate an urgent response to urgent circumstances with a minimum of red tape. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>WOOL TAX (Nos. 1 TO 5) AMENDMENT BILLS 1990</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills will amended the Wool Tax Acts (Nos. 1-5) 1964 to increase, effective from 1 July 1990, the maximum rate of wool tax imposed by each Act from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> An operational rate of wool tax lower than or equal to the maximum rate may be set by regulation. The recommendations of the Wool Council of Australia are taken into account in setting the actual limit. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the operational rate applying for each Act is 8 per cent although the maximum rate is set at 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The five Wool Tax Amendment Bills are similar in their text and each amends an Act which deals with a different method of selling shorn wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for five separate Acts arises from a constitutional requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. </PARA>
<PARA> The minimum rate of wool tax may be imposed under each Act remains unchanged at 5.25 per cent. This is equal to the sum of the minimum rates for market support, promotion and research and development as specified in the Wool Marketing Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The market situation for wool has changed significantly since the days of the high prices which peaked at more than 1250 cents per kilogram in early 1988. During late 1988 and early 1989 prices fell by 30 per cent and reached 893 cents per kilogram clean at the end of the  1988-89 season. The Australian Wool Corporation stocks increased from almost nothing at the start of the season to 188,000 bales by the end of the season. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the commencement of this season in July 1989, we have seen prices fall to close to the minimum reserve price of 870 cents per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Wool Corporation stocks have risen rapidly as the reserve price scheme purchased wool to support the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently Australian Wool Corporation stocks amount to around 2.5 million bales. In the course of purchasing that stock the Corporation has used the $1.8 billion reserve of woolgrowers' funds in the Market Support Fund and borrowed additional funds. These borrowings are expected to exceed $1 billion by the end of this season. </PARA>
<PARA> The cause of the present problem is a combination of increased supply of wool, following good seasonal conditions and a build up in sheep numbers, and decreased demand for our wool. The fall in demand for our wool is largely due to the absence of China from the market and the wool processing industry's reaction to the high prices of two years ago. Uncertainty is developing about future purchases by the USSR and Eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that the wool industry is in for a difficult few years as it seeks to bring supply and demand for wool back into balance. While this balance is being achieved, Australian Wool Corporation stocks can be expected to grow, unless there is a rapid unexpected turnaround in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Wool Marketing Act, the wool industry, through the Wool Council of Australia and the Wool Corporation, is responsible for the management of the reserve price scheme. Wool growers provide the funds necessary to support the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with these responsibilities, a number of options and possible market scenarios have been examined for next season. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that if the Australian Wool Corporation continues a high level of purchases at auction, the Corporation will need to borrow additional funds. A substantial increase in the market support component of the wool tax will be required to adequately service those borrowings and the physical cost of holding stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting the maximum wool tax rate at 20 per cent, the Government is of the view that this rate is consistent with an appropriate mix of policy measures designed to ensure the continued viability of the wool industry and the reserve price scheme itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Two things also need to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the wool tax is not a Government tax in the generally accepted understanding of ``tax'', as funds raised by the wool tax are transferred to the wool industry and the Commonwealth does not benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, provision is available for the market support component of the tax to be ultimately returned to the growers through revolvements of the Market Support Fund. The timing is determined by the Wool Council. </PARA>
<PARA> At its Conference later this month, the Wool Council will be making recommendations to the Government on the apportionment of the wool tax between market support, wool promotion and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills involve no additional financial cost to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to various bounty Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's major purpose is to implement certain initiatives arising from the Australia/New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement (`the Anzcerta Agreement'). The 1988 review of that agreement resulted in an `agreed minute on industry assistance', signed on 21 June 1988, under which Australia and New Zealand agreed that, from 1 July 1990, neither country would pay production bounties or like measures on goods which are exported to the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year, as principal bounty Bills or bounty amendment Bills have been presented to the Parliament, a provision to preclude the bounty being paid on bountiable goods exported to New Zealand after 1 July, 1990 has been inserted, to give effect to Australia's treaty commitment. In 1989, the Bounty (Ships) Act, and the Bounty (Photographic Film) Act both contained such provisions, in sections 9 and 8 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to amend four current bounty acts. </PARA>
<PARA> (The Bounty (Books) Act 1986)</PARA>
<PARA> (The Bounty (Computers) Act 1984)</PARA>
<PARA> (The Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act 1985), and</PARA>
<PARA> (The Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981)</PARA>
<PARA> To similarly provide that from 1 July 1990, bounty is not payable in respect of goods which are for export to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> The desired prohibition on payment of bounty will not however, extend to goods exported through New Zealand to other destinations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments in this Bill are of a minor technical nature and are explained in greater detail in the clause notes to schedule 1 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. The opportunity has also been taken to repeal ten superseded bounty Acts and three superseded subsidy Acts, as the relevant bounty or subsidy periods have expired, the time within which to make a claim has elapsed, and there is no outstanding prosecution or recovery action under any of them. The Acts proposed for repeal are in schedule 2 of the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to participate in the debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1989-90, I have to say that it gives me no great joy to be standing on this side of the chamber again. Whilst I acknowledge that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has, in raw terms, won more seats than the coalition parties, it did so through no ability of its own, through no superior management of the economy and, sadly, not even because more people wanted it there. When one looks at the statistics, they make the opening remarks of the Governor-General at the opening of Parliament seem rather hollow and inappropriate. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On 24 March, the Australian people gave to the Labor Government an historic and decisive fourth mandate-a mandate to continue the urgent and sweeping task of national reform in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, as we know, the Australian people did not directly give the ALP a mandate to government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that, on a two-party preferred percentage based on the House of Representatives votes, the ALP failed to reach 50 per cent; in fact, with the votes of all the people who helped the ALP get into office, it got only 49.9 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator Michael Baume</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Michael Baume has said, the ALP got well less than that-it was lower than 40 per cent, if I remember correctly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 38 per cent of the vote of the Australian people, and the Government got its historic fourth term. On this side of the chamber we, in the Opposition, got in excess of 50 per cent of the vote. Obviously the Government has not quite got the mandate that the Governor-General informed us of, but it has control of the treasury bench. While it is in that position it ought to remember that its mandate is not decisive; in fact, it is not even the Government's. Having had its numbers man persuade the Green movement to vote to give its second choice to Labor, it is yet to be seen whether it now ditches the Green movement. We will see whether the new Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) gives the Green movement all the promises that were given by Senator Richardson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, there are many, including those in the Labor Party, who believe that the Party has already sacrificed too many of its principles to woo the Green vote, and that it is time to get back to the real issues. Senator Walsh is not alone in his criticism of his own political party, the Labor Party. He questions whether the Government has the intestinal fortitude to take the tough decisions. In fact, he made some comments just recently about people's spines not being quite as strong as they should be. He ought to know. Senator Walsh has been a member of the inner Cabinet for seven years. So if he thinks his former ministerial colleagues are weak, he is more than likely correct. I note that former Minister Barry Cohen has been similarly critical of his Party's performance. I suggest that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will find that he can no longer silence his back bench with promises. The Government realises that there is no point being in government if it cannot get its wish list onto the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's Speech was very typical of this Government. It had many words, but there was little of real substance. If the Speech were intended to give us all a warm feeling in our bellies with talk of the lucky country and the clever country, it fell pathetically short of its objective. Indeed, the contents of the Speech were an insult to any thinking Australian. One needs only to compare the rhetoric of that day with the reality of the appropriations-the balance sheet-to see just how hollow it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks of the strong growth in the economy, the surge in business investment and employment. It promises to continue the broad-based structural reform. I ask: Where is this strong growth? Where is this reform? The reality is that Labor's economic policies to date have failed. They have failed the Labor Party economic strategists, and they have failed the people of Australia. What we have today is an Australia not mildly out of kilter with the rest of the world, but woefully off course. While the Treasurer (Mr Keating) talks about the need to reduce inflation further, the truth is that we really need to start to reduce inflation, not just talk about it. Something has to be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The consumer price index has been rising steadily since the March quarter of last year and there appears to be little relief in sight. The balance of payments, or the numbers, as our Treasurer is so fond of referring to them, have been predictably awful for months. Every month it becomes increasingly more difficult to find something different to say about them. For two years the Opposition parties have been saying that the economy must have a change of direction. In that time the Government has been trying to tell us all to be patient, that things will get better, and that they are just taking longer than was first thought. I think it is about time that this so-called world's best Treasurer started to take a little notice of what is really happening in the economy and out in the community and did something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the ALP policy assured us that several elements of Labor's economic strategy would lead to improvements in the balance of payments. That statement was abysmally out of kilter. The Treasurer, in the 1988 Budget Speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> This year our balance of payments deficit will be halved from its peak of just three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear, oh dear! In the 1989 Budget Speech, Treasurer Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA> Last year inflation was too high. </PARA>
<PARA> And the balance of payments did not fall as we expected, leading to higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what excuses we will hear this time. It is a tired charade being played for no-one's benefit. The agenda outlined for this fourth Labor Government contains no hope for the future and no new direction, just a prescription for more of the same. In fact, It could easily have been written in a vacuum; that is the extent of its relevance to Australia in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has made no acknowledgment of the difficulty confronting farmers forced into high debt levels because of the Government's inability and incompetence at managing interest rates. The present crisis in the wool industry is a direct result of Government policy that is inappropriate and misdirected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not use those words, but the Government has caused immeasurable damage to the Australian farming community, especially the wool producers, with the interest rates impost. Our over-inflated dollar and our inflated interest rates are killing this country surer than any plague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today our wool industry is in crisis. What industry will it be tomorrow? Which industry will be next? When all the rural industries start to get hit to leg with higher interest rates, which are grinding them into the ground, what will produce the export income for Australia to give us the standard of living we all desire? By the turn of the century the number of viable farms in the rural sector will drop below 100,000. Farms are becoming non-viable at a faster rate than at any other time in Australia's history. That is occurring despite the fact that Australian farmers are recognised as among the most efficient in the world, despite the fact that technology in Australian agriculture is utilised faster than almost anywhere else, and despite the fact that we have sound management and favourable seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen if we go into a season of drought? We have just had horrific floods in the western areas of Queensland and New South Wales, which have caused untold damage. It will take those areas a great deal of time to get back on their feet. What will happen if we go now into a drought? Will Australia then ride on the sheep's back, on beef's back, on grain's back, on the back of primary industry generally?</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult not only for the rural sector; business confidence also has been shot to pieces and investment has ground to a halt. We all know what is happening in the cities around Australia. But what do Government members do? They snipe at each other and talk about ministerial discipline. It is about time they applied some discipline to the management of the economy. Where is the discipline when our net foreign debt of $23.3 billion, or 13.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1983, has blown out to $137 billion by June 1989. That is quite an achievement, is it not, Senator Baume?</PARA>

They are making it very difficult to buy even a motor car. Of course, all that follows the constant predictions during the election campaign, as Senator Baume said, that interest rates would soon be on the way down. I would like to see interest rates falling soon as that will at least give back some incentive to the people in the community who pay interest. At the moment, all incentive for people to invest is being knocked out by high interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are going broke at a great rate. Senator Baume is quite right. The policy of sustained high interest rates alone has been enough to slow down housing sales and close shops. Just recently I was in a country town in the south of New South Wales and something like 100 shops were for sale. The only problem was that there was nobody there to buy the shops because nobody wanted to invest in a shop in a country town or city anywhere in Australia because of high interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the Australian population a second mortgage has definitely replaced the first child. The social impact of the Labor Government's economic policies on Australian society is immeasurable. We have only to look at all the promises made and broken in the past to see that obviously they are going to be broken again by this Government. In the 1987 Federal election, the Prime Minister made a historic commitment to end child poverty by 1990. Here we are in 1990, and it did not even rate a mention in the Governor-General's Speech. A new underclass in society has been created by the new economic order of Australia. We are breeding a new generation of hopeless and helpless people, and we are not realistically doing anything to prevent it. This lucky, clever country has nearly 94,000 households, or 200,000-plus people, living in caravans and other temporary dwellings and nearly 30,000 living in impoverished dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the economy but also the entire fabric of Australian society that are being totally mismanaged by this Government. The social injustice caused by the Government will be difficult to repair irrespective of the financial commitment it gives to it. The same applies to road funding. It is only because so many lives were lost over the Christmas period that the Government has decided to review its priorities for roads and rail. I look forward to the Federal Government introducing initiatives to upgrade our national transport infrastructure, including roads and rail. I applaud the brave commitment of the new Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Bob Collins, to achieving meaningful reforms on the waterfront but, like any good poker player, I will wait to see the colour of his money before I believe that he can deliver the goods. So far there have been words, but he will be judged on achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriately, that leads me to the question of airline deregulation. I hate to keep quoting from the Governor-General's Speech, but many of the lines are so classic that they will become appalling reminders of the Government's failure to deliver and they must be repeated. On the question of airline deregulation, it was said that `the Government will ensure that new entrants to the airline industry have fair access to major airports'-provided they do not want terminal space because the Prime Minister's friends have that all tied up-and so the new airlines will be given a fair go. I am encouraged by the assurances that the environmental impact study on Sydney's third runway will be completed this year. I am hopeful that at last the Federal Government, having secured its members' seats around Sydney Airport for another term, will now have the courage to build the third runway and so help ease Sydney's legendary airport congestion problems. </PARA>
<PARA> On pollution grounds alone, the Government ought to be pursuing additional runway space in order to reduce the amount of fuel wasted in holding pattern exercises that have become a predictable, regular aspect of flying through or to Sydney. In fact, last night, coming in from the country, the aircraft I was travelling in was held for 50 minutes circling around the top of the Sydney area. Of course, the people who came down from Brisbane were held for a similar amount of time. It is time that the Government did something about upgrading the radar and facilities at Mascot so that Sydney, which is the gateway to Australia-as a senator for New South Wales I am very proud of that, and I am quite sure that Senator Puplick is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak today on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4), Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2), with particular reference to the challenge facing the Government in the area of the defence of Australia. I am glad to see Senator Robert Ray, the new Minister for Defence, in the chamber today, because it is on his shoulders that a heavy burden rests. In my view, he has inherited a distortion of the defence budget which is going to lead to difficulties for the defence of Australia for many years to come. Senator Ray will be judged in years to come on his ability to cope with a budget which has been heavily proscribed by his predecessor and restricted so that he is left with very little area in which to move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have great sympathy in fact for Senator Ray facing this dilemma, because it is obviously not of his personal making, but it is a situation for which the Government of Australia must stand responsible. For seven years this Government has had the defence of Australia in its hands, and the problems which we face today, when we look at the defence of Australia, are fairly and squarely the responsibility of the Government of those seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> Just before the election, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, announced that there would be cuts to the forward estimates of the defence budget for the next three years in order to pay for its election sops and that that would amount to $241m. The difficulty that we face with those future cuts is that they need to be taken in conjunction with an announcement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the election campaign that Australia would take over the administration and running of the North West Cape facility. We have not been told what the expenditure impact will be for Australia, but some authorities are suggesting that it could be in the region of $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> When one puts those two facts together, and also recognises Mr Beazley's rush to re-equip the forces all at one time without proper staging of this re-equipment, Senator Ray will be faced with great difficulties unless he is able to get his Government to put more resources into the defence area or to walk away from the decision which the Treasurer announced in February relating to the forward estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important that the Government look again at what it is planning to do in the defence area because, although there is a wind of change-one might say-in eastern Europe and there are hopes for the future of peace and stability, those disarmament arrangements have not, in fact, flowed over to our region. As the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said just recently, the changes in Europe may well have a detrimental effect on our region in that there will be arms suppliers looking for new markets. The opportunity exists for fire sale bargains to be available to nations in the Pacific and South East Asia regions, no doubt eventually adding to increased tensions in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote from an article in the most recent edition of the Pacific Defence Reporter, written by Denis Warner and entitled, `Interdependence not disarmament'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> By the end of this year Japan will be spending more on defence than any other US ally, and over the next three years there is likely to be a 10 per cent to 12 per cent reduction in the strength of American forces in Japan and Korea, where the US is already moving from a leading to a supporting role with the ROK forces. At the same time as one American speaker explained, if the Cold War is alive and well it is in Korea. The central North Korean objective remains unchanged: get the Americans out of the country . . . The situation is very dangerous and extremely worrisome. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, of course, we face the possible removal of the American bases in the Philippines. This would also, of course, remove an important element of regional stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is great economic growth taking place in the Pacific Rim, there are real problems remaining in security areas amongst our neighbours. There are changes taking place but they do not mirror the changes that are taking place in Europe. In fact, with the rise of new power centres in India, China and Japan and the increased armaments being produced by India and China we have reason to be concerned for the future stability of our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Warner concludes that for the middle and smaller powers of our region this is a time not for disarmament but, to borrow from the title of the symposium he was quoting, for `security through interdependence'. Therein lies Australia's future role, in my view-to be good neighbours, to be interdependent with our regional friends and to make sure that peace does break out all over our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Too often in the past we have been surprised by small nations in our area suddenly facing internal difficulties, some of which have had an impact directly on us, as in Fiji and the coups and in the appeals for help from Papua New Guinea. Obviously, we are not in an area in which we can take great comfort in foreseeable stability, and this could well have an impact for us. I am sure I do not need to labour this point, but I am concerned that there is an expectation in some parts of our country that, because of the changes in Europe, we should be seeing reduced defence expenditure in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of Dr Paul Dibb in the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities in 1986 and the subsequent White Paper of 1987 in their way set out the parameters we would have to address during the decade ahead. Already, in the three years since the White Paper came out, there have been so many changes that I would not think it would go amiss if the Government were prepared to do an update of the White Paper-at least a discussion paper based on the changes since the White Paper was produced. It would be in Australia's interest to reassess our region and the impact of the changes throughout the world on our defence needs. Yet the Government seems to be just treading water and, if anything, slipping below the surface. </PARA>
<PARA> The White Paper and Dr Dibb spoke in terms of 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) being needed to achieve the capabilities that Australia requires to maintain independence. Yet only last week in the Senate Senator Robert Ray told us that 3 per cent of GDP was not the eleventh commandment. It may have been a clever quip but it worries me that it may be an indication of either the Minister's approach to the subject or his expectation that his Government would not support him in getting the resources necessary to fulfil the White Paper's requirements. I think that what he meant was that the money was not forthcoming, and it would not be forthcoming, so he would be required to make the best of it. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the best of it? The current situation is that, despite having spent millions and millions of dollars, we have no real ability to protect our harbours and shipping lanes from mines. We have no proper mines countermeasure capability in this country. We have had a parliamentary inquiry into the subject, which was very damning of both the Navy and the Government and, still, we are dancing around, drifting around, and going under. It is an area of great importance. If there is any likelihood of our being harassed at sea, of being held to ransom, by any country in our region which wants to exert political pressure on us, one of the most effective ways would be to mine our ports or shipping lanes, threaten to do so, or claim to have done so. That would bring Australian trade and that from our trading partners to a standstill. I cannot think of a much more effective way in which to bring a country to heel than to stop its trade altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it is widely acknowledged that we have inadequate surveillance. We have a huge continent with vast parts of the country uninhabited. It would be easy for drug runners, gun runners or nations of evil intent to make a landing. Yet, despite spending millions of dollars on the over-the-horizon radar, we are still not in a position where we can say that our radar gives us a network of surveillance over the country. Although I acknowledge that steps are being taken in that direction, it has placed a huge demand on the defence budget and there is still no coverage in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally important is the need for a decision to be made on the provision of airborne early warning aircraft. That decision still appears to be some way down the track. During Kangaroo 89 the previous Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, had a look at the airborne warning and control (AWAC) aircraft which were lent by the United States for the exercise. The Minister seemed pretty keen to get those aircraft into place, but still no decision has been taken; obviously no resources are available. The combination of the over-the-horizon radar and the airborne early warning aircraft is vital in a country with such vast spaces, such a long coastline and such a small population. We need superb surveillance in our north. A few well-manned reserve units patrolling in their local areas, as is done by Norforce, although it is a little start and one to be welcomed, certainly will not protect us from invasion or from harassments from countries which wish to put pressure on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter facing us is the totally inadequate mobility of our defence forces. One of the issues that has been raised in recent times is the Government decision to sell the Chinook helicopters. There is no alternative in the Defence Force capital equipment to replace the Chinooks. There was an opportunity for Australia to join an upgrade program, through which the United States put about 500 Chinooks. We could have joined that upgrade program so that our Chinooks would have had their life extended by 25 to 30 years, and that would have brought down dramatically the cost of operating them. Instead, the Government decided to sell the Chinooks. </PARA>
<PARA> The helicopters are sitting at Amberley waiting to find a buyer, and in the meantime we are not even able to bring them into use to help during our floods. For the ability to get artillery into difficult areas in the north of Australia there is no equal. The Government has taken a wilful and misguided decision which has reduced our ability to support troops in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no decision yet on a helicopter platform. The absence of that was terribly evident during our abortive attempt to go to the aid of Australians in Fiji during the coup. The debacle, as one might have described it-as it would have been if they had to go into Fiji against opposition-is one that our troops should never have to face. In my view it is quite disgraceful that of all the options that are available-and there are many to provide helicopter platforms to increase the capability of our defence forces-no decision has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> We have great difficulty in being able to operate our troops in the north and to get them to remote areas. This was clearly one of the lessons learnt by exercise Kangaroo '89. Still the Government dillydallies about a decision to improve our ability in that area. It is well recognised-I have certainly helped by keeping the public informed-how undermanned our Army is. The total Defence Force has gone from 72,000 when this Government came to office seven years ago to 68,000 now. I believe that this is suiting the Government very nicely. It is a subterfuge or an underhand way of reducing the manpower costs in the defence forces. Yet when the day comes we will ask, `Why was this allowed to happen?'. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a lack of specialists in all three Services. Last week we received the last of 75 FA18s. Is it well understood-I doubt it-that we do not have the air crews and the maintenance teams to keep those FA18s in the air? The Royal Australian Navy is desperately short of ships engineers. In all three services we are unable to fill positions for computer specialists and communication specialists. We have something like 350 officers short in the Australian Army, positions that have had to be filled by reservists coming in on full time duty. The high wastage rates that we have been facing for so long have meant that over the last couple of years we have had a quarter of our Defence Force replaced by newcomers with basic training only. The difficulties that we are now having in recruiting people to the defence forces are all problems which contribute to the reduction of our defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing? As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Government is cutting $241m from the defence budget over the next three years. The Government is adding an expense of perhaps $30m for North West Cape. The Government is failing to make the decisions that are necessary. It seems to have no will, no heart, to make defence decisions. The Government is being hamstrung by Minister Beazley's contracts for the next 10 to 15 years, contracts that are somehow like a bride wanting to have the whole house furnished, lock stock and barrel, in the first year of marriage, no worry what it does to the budget-carpets, curtains, electronic gear and a video as well. Mr Beazley, without thought for the future, pushed it all along too far, too fast. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in manpower terms? We are recruiting foreign mercenaries into our defence forces and, as we discovered the other night at Estimates Committee B, no proper thought has been given to what we will do about people who come here as a result of our recruiting and who are not Australian citizens. We are recruiting Swedish pilots, for example. It is a condition of service that a member of the Australian Defence Force must be a citizen. Quite clearly, that has not been sorted out. We are faced with the situation of having people in our Defence Force whom we have recruited from foreign countries and who are not citizens. I, for one, am concerned that that should have been allowed to happen. How could the Government have allowed it to happen without proper planning and without an explanation to the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA> Just recently we announced, with quite a fanfare, that we would have Australian women on warships. I am happy to see women get a proper go in the defence forces of Australia. As honourable senators would realise, for a long time I have been pushing for them to take their place in Defence Force employment in a meaningful and planned way. Instead we have had an unplanned recruitment of women to fill the places we cannot get men to fill, but without proper organisational arrangements, without planning for their future career development, without planning for how their recruitment fits into the Defence Force's needs. In my view, the announcement the other day was, once again, totally unplanned. I asked at Senate Estimates Committee B how women will be recruited, how many women there will be at sea this time next year, what ships women will be placed on and what the cost of converting the ships will be. Nobody could answer. The implication was: the announcement has been made and we will work it out later. Clearly it was a political announcement under instructions from the Government, and it is saying, `We will muddle along and try to do something about it later on'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put on record some of the costs of having to recruit and train new people to cope with the enormous losses from the defence forces that we have been facing for the last four or five years. I am quoting from the Army submission to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Cross Committee, in 1988. The costs of training then-and that was back in 1988-included the following examples: to train a recuit, $9,396; to educate an Australian Defence Force Academy graduate, $222,000; to take that Academy graduate and give him or her training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, which is required after graduating from the Academy, a further $175,000. So we are up to about $400,000 for an Academy graduate to actually enter the Army. Duntroon training for non-Academy graduates cost $260,000. A regimental officer's basic course at the Armoured Centre cost $340,774. Apprenticeship training cost $100,000. The cost of putting an armoured corps subaltern into the field was between $600,774 and $737,774. The training of a corporal radio mechanic was assessed at about $115,259. </PARA>
<PARA> We have enormous costs in training people to replace those that we have lost. Yet this Government seems unprepared to divert that money into meaningful personnel measures which will keep those people in the forces, thus not only making them happier in the career that they have chosen but also, importantly for Australia, retaining the experience levels that we need in a defence force. A defence force is not just a question of machines; it is a question of man power and woman power. The whole equation demands capabilities in both areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should maintain the expenditure which it set out pre-February this year in its Forward Estimates. The Government should announce a timetable for achieving the capabilities, which we still so badly lack, which were set out as requirements in the White Paper of 1987. The Government should use the advice which has been long available to it to implement dramatic and sustainable personnel retention measures. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the experience levels of our forces have to be retained if we are going to have a viable Defence Force in a difficult and uncertain future in our region. Our Defence Force personnel must be made to feel appreciated because, as I said earlier, our capability does not relate just to machines. Men and women are a critical part of our defence formula. For seven years the Labor Government has produced these problems and they will not be able to be cured overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the growing manpower and weaponry of some of the countries in our region, and of the uncertainties which we face as a result of the disarmament measures in eastern Europe and their flow-on effects to our region, it is absolutely vital for Australia to be both independent of and interdependent with our neighbours in our region, to demonstrate that we have a deterrent capability, the willpower to defend our country, the men and women with the experience levels to do just that on our behalf, and that the physical capability and machinery that is required, the weapons of war and the surveillance measures, are in place. Senator Ray has an enormous challenge facing him. His Government has to listen to the needs of the Australian nation because, otherwise, I fear very much that Senator Ray will be found wanting, as has his Government to date, in the defence area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity today to address the general question of Parliament's control over the Executive. When this matter was raised when I was at school and university it seemed to be a somewhat theoretical matter that could be left to another day and did not have an immediacy that it is now clear to me it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address the question of Parliament's control over the Executive in relation to three specific areas. Firstly, I refer to Question Time, that time of our day that many people believe forms the major part of parliamentary work. Of course, we know they are misunderstanding this matter, but nonetheless that is the element of the parliamentary day that receives the most publicity and about which members of the public have the most understanding. Secondly, I refer to the question of Parliament's control over the Executive with respect to the Senate Estimates committees that have been sitting over the past week, and which will probably be tabling reports later today. Those committees have the opportunity to peruse the expenditure planned to be spent by separate departments, and that gives honourable senators the opportunity to ask quite detailed questions in relation to that expenditure. Thirdly, I want to look at the question of Parliament's control over the Executive in relation to Senate standing committees, and, in particular, to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I will commence by dealing with the Estimates committees that have been sitting over the past week. It may seem to those unfamiliar with these committees-that is probably the case with school children and many members of the public and, quite frankly, it is probably the case with many members of the Press Gallery-that these are boring committees that talk about nothing but who wants what money, and that if one was an insomniac one might attend, but otherwise not. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth, and without labouring the point I want to refer to the Estimates Committee of which I was a member this time, which gave those honourable senators who wished to avail themselves of it the opportunity to make inquiries into the cost of one of the more prominent and strongly contested pieces of legislation that this Parliament has seen in the last half-decade-that is, the legislation relating to war crimes. The expenses associated with the passing of that Act are to be found primarily in the Attorney-General's portfolio. Without going into a lot of detail I think it is fair to say that if the Commonwealth expects change out of $10m from that exercise it is barking up the wrong tree. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an interesting exercise to go to that Estimates Committee and look at the explanatory details provided by the Attorney-General's Department. We find, if we look at the special investigations unit, which is the unit set up to make these special investigations, that the total cost of the war crimes legislation is not to be found under that item. In fact, we have to go to a number of other subprograms in the Attorney-General's portfolio before we can get to the total cost. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a divisive piece of legislation. We could argue that its impact still is divisive. I do not want to raise today the merits or otherwise of that legislation. I simply want to say that it is the Senate Estimates committees that provide the opportunity to follow up legislation-after it has been passed in the House of Representatives where the Government knows it has the numbers and after it has passed through this chamber-and can pick up the detail and the cost of what it is that Parliament has chosen to do. In that way, it can scrutinise the cost of the Executive plans. Change out of $10m is not likely, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another perhaps more topical and recent example of how Senate Estimates committees can be used to ascertain the cost of Executive action. We all know that in the last couple of weeks a particular drug trial in Sydney was called off, primarily as a consequence of remarks made by a member of the Executive, Senator Tate. We had a long debate in this chamber and numerous remarks were made in addition to a censure motion of Senator Tate for the remarks he made which occasioned the trial to be called off. Through the Estimates Committee, honourable senators are able to ascertain just exactly what that cost the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> As I recall, the cost to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) was in the order of $36,000, possibly $46,000. Of course, there would be additional costs to the Australian Federal Police for calling off that matter. I do not want to make an issue today of the cancellation of a trial in progress-of Senator Tate and Yooyen-as a consequence of remarks made by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). I simply want to underline that it is the Senate Estimates committees that give parliamentarians-honourable senators and, through them, if they are courteous to their lower House colleagues, House of Representatives members-the opportunity to ascertain the cost of these sorts of actions. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters are raised in the media on a day-to-day basis. I just wonder whether members of the public appreciate the extent to which parliamentarians peruse these matters long after they have ceased to be headlines of the day. I suspect they do not have a significant understanding of that because one of the main criticisms I frequently hear of parliamentarians is that all we want to do is chase the headlines of the day. Far too little attention is given, not just by the Press Gallery but by ourselves, to highlighting the fact that the majority of our work lies in following up these matters long after the media have lost interest in them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not on the Estimates Committee that perused the estimates for further expenditure in child-care, but I hope that when I have the opportunity of perusing the Hansard of that Committee I will find significant questioning of the Government's announcements during the election of what it was going to do with child-care. Anybody who looked at the Government's press releases would see that the Government had not so much the courage but the gall to promise to the Australian electorate, `Vote for us and this is what we'll do, not just for this Parliament, but for the following parliament, and for the first year of the Parliament after that'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is how confident an Executive we have, an Executive that thinks it can go to the Australian people and make promises not for one parliament or the next, but into the one after. Those promises should be very clearly stuck on the front page of every outline of expenditure for the Estimates Committee dealing with child-care until the expiration of the time period for which this Government promised certain action would be taken. But, as I say, I have not been on that Committee. I hope that when I peruse the Hansard record of its proceedings, I find that questions were asked in respect of that matter. I raise it only to highlight the wide range of issues that can be further attacked, if you like, through the Estimates Committee; namely, the war crimes issue, the calling off of the Yooyen trial, child-care and many other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> During the hearings of the Estimates Committee of which I was a member a matter was raised that caused me particular concern in relation to Parliament's control over expenditure. One honourable senator asked the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, who was in attendance, what was the per diem rate that counsel were paid for a particular matter, As I recall, this took place during questioning of the Trade Practices Commission. The officers detailed a number of cases that the Commission had been handling. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to, I think, the Arnotts matter, the officers were asked: `How many counsel did you have? Were there juniors with senior counsel? If so, how many and how much were they paid?'. There was some consternation and a couple of tete-a-tetes between the Minister and officers before the answer was provided that, should senators wish to look to the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department, they would see how much was paid over one year by way of counsel fees to various counsel. If one did this, one would be able to see that Mr A received $200,000 and Mr B $300,000, and that, hopefully, Mrs C received $600,000 and Mrs E $100,000. Of course, that would not be sufficient because it would not enable honourable senators to see whether particular counsel were being paid a daily rate far greater than that of other counsel; in other words, the extent to which the Commonwealth was engaged in bargaining with its counsel. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanation was given, that once the total amount is known, one then knows who is getting the maximum amount and one can see whether any vested interest is being served. But, of course, that does not answer the question of whether particular counsel are being paid far more or far less than others and what sorts of deals are being entered into. I think this is a fair and legitimate inquiry of Parliament. Just how much are we paying a counsel to represent us in matters run by the Trade Practices Commission?</PARA>
<PARA> Regretfully, that matter was not resolved that night. But the attention of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, who is at the table, was drawn to the resolutions and orders of the Senate, which have continuing effect. In particular, his attention was drawn to the resolution No. 3 dealing with statutory bodies and accountability, which is outlined on page 123. The resolution states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee . . . </PARA>
<PARA>recommends . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the principle, espoused by the Senate in 1971 and 1974, that there are no areas of expenditure of public funds where Statutory Authorities have a discretion to withhold details or explanations from Parliament or its Committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise, be re-affirmed;</PARA>
<PARA>This was an area of expenditure where details were withheld. I will come to the explanations for that in a minute. The second part of this resolution states:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the affirmation, in accordance with this principle, that the right to privacy of individual counsel accepting a brief on behalf of the Commonwealth for which money is appropriated by Parliament is supervened by such acceptance, subject to the reasons for the information being clearly defined and to the proviso that injudicious or unwarranted invasion of privacy is not the intention of the Parliament or its Committees;</PARA>
<PARA>This resolution makes two things abundantly clear. The first is that in 1980 the Senate was of the view that the view it had expressed in 1971 and 1974 should stand. The Senate is still of that view because these resolutions and orders have continuing effect. So the view is that there are no areas of detail within expenditure beyond Parliament's inquiry. Furthermore, counsel, by accepting a brief from the Commonwealth, lose their right to privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sorry that the Minister at the table, Senator Cook, was not convinced by this argument and has offered to come back with a further explanation of the Department's position. I look forward to receiving that information, because the Minister was also reminded of a report from the then Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. </PARA>
<PARA> You may remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, a member of another Estimates committee in 1986 asked the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) what Geraldine Doogue's salary was. I thought it was a fair enough question. Everybody was dying to know what Geraldine Doogue was paid by the ABC. What did the ABC representative say? `I am sorry, market confidentiality applies there.' What a lot of rot. If we allowed that sort of thing to go on, what we would have is statutory authorities-and, for that matter, individual departments, to the extent that they can contract-putting confidentiality clauses in any contracts that they like and using those clauses as a shield against parliamentary inquiry. Then there would be no way that taxpayers would be able to find out how their money is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The executive arm of government is only too keen to tell the public what it wants to do with its money. The point I am making here is that the Estimates committees give other parliamentarians the opportunity to ascertain exactly what the Government has done with the money. It is simply not acceptable to have sections of the community, who may have in some other respects certain privileges, claim that it is inappropriate that the details of their contracts with the Commonwealth be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, if counsel accepts a brief on behalf of the Commonwealth knowing that it is being paid for by the taxpayer, that person has no right to say to the taxpayer, `You are not going to find out how much I am paid.' If the taxpayer is footing the bill, the taxpayer is entitled to know. I look forward very much to the Minister's response to that Estimates committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter that I said I wanted to raise, which I will deal with secondly, is parliamentary control over the Executive in relation to Question Time, Estimates committees and certain other Senate committees. I have dealt with the question of Parliament's control through the Estimates committees, and I now want to deal with the third area I raised which is other Senate committees. I have recently had the pleasure of being put on the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. This is a committee that scrutinises individual Bills to see whether the rights and opportunities of individual Australians are in some respects inadvertently being limited or trampled on by what an Act or a Bill seeks to do. In that respect it is very similar to another committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the privilege of serving on that committee as well. That committee peruses the regulations and ordinances that individual Ministers are entitled to make or proclaim. It scours through them to find whether, in making those regulations and ordinances, the rights of individuals have been trampled on. That is perhaps putting it a bit loosely, but I think it is a fair description of what that committee seeks to do. When that committee finds a problem with a regulation or ordinance, it writes to the Minister and says, `Look, perhaps you may not have realised this, but inadvertently these rights are being limited here. You could achieve your policy aim and nonetheless not tread on this individual's rights'. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a very successful committee. Ministers understand that that committee has never lost. Whenever it has said to a Minister, `Fine, if you want to dig your heels in and refuse to make this change, we will seek to get the Senate to disallow your regulations', one of two things have happened: either at the last minute the Minister has changed his mind and given in; or the regulations have been disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in a similar vein that, as I understand it, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee does its work. I look forward to the day when members and senators on both sides will, in a bipartisan way, support amendments to Bills that reflect the desires of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I think that day is probably some long way off, because while members of the opposite side of this chamber-that is, members of the Labor Party-are happy and have been happy in the past to bring in a bipartisan way an individual Minister to order for inadvertently trampling on individual rights through regulations and ordinances, I am not sure that members on the other side would be ever given the liberty to bring their whole Executive to order for doing exactly the same thing in a Bill that was coming before Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make another point with respect to that committee by giving one example that we saw last year of how effective its work is. What happened with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Commission Bill, or package of Bills, was that the Committee went through them, noticed a number of problems with them, and indicated those problems in either its digest or its report-I am no sure which. What happened? The House of Representatives noticed the content of the report and the Government, of its own volition, amended the Bill in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people would say, `Well, you know when you got the Bill up into the Senate chamber, in those respects it had been fixed up. So that was the House of Representatives doing a good job; of course, that is rubbish. It was not the House of Representatives doing a good job; it was the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills doing a good job and the House of Representatives having the brains to see that if it did not put its house in order with respect to those matters, then this chamber would. In other words, it was the committee work of this chamber that fixed up elements of that Bill, in reality, and not the House of Representatives. I raise that matter just as a separate example of how Parliament, and especially senators, can through their work peruse the work of the Executive and keep some control. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I want to raise relates to Question Time. I recall a former senator, Reg Withers from Western Australia, whom my colleague Senator Knowles knew well, saying that it was not properly titled Questions Without Notice in that it should more properly be called Questions Without Answers. In the five years that I have been here, that has certainly been the case. It is the one hour in the day here and the 45 minutes in the House of Representatives when the media are particularly interested in what happens. It is seen as being the theatre of Parliament, and certainly because of that members are encouraged to perhaps be a bit more vociferous than they otherwise might be. </PARA>
<PARA> It really is a matter of regret-this is the whole point that I am trying to make by raising these points today-that Question Time is the focus of the media's attention. If people do well in Question Time, they are perceived to have their act together. If Ministers, or for that matter those asking questions, are not so gladiatorial in their style at Question Time, then it is easy for the media perhaps to make an assessment that they are not as good as someone who is a gladiator. I think that is a mistake, because the job of being a parliamentarian and the job of being a Minister is in both cases a far bigger job, a far greater role, than simply being a big mouth at Question Time and being a winner in the gladiatorial debate that goes on in that short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no better example of someone who sees himself in that gladiatorial role than Treasurer Keating. Perhaps one need use only that example to show how unimportant Question Time, in one sense, ought to be. The media write the Treasurer up as being someone who knows how to go in with boots and all and who knows he is in charge. That is how the Treasurer has got his reputation-primarily through the manner in which he has conducted himself in Question Time. He has got a good reputation as being a tough, hard-headed political fighter who will win the day because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if we look outside Question Time at what the Treasurer has done, particularly at the moment and over the past five years, what we see is a disaster. He admits himself that we are down the Argentinean road. I am not sure whether we have given up on the J-curve and gone to some other letter. There is a view that we are beyond treating J as an L and running along the flat-that we are now running downhill badly in terms of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I provided to the media about a month ago some material which showed that, on 10 key economic indicators, we were last behind six or seven Asian countries. Our neighbours, with whom we now purport to take a senior role, must be laughing behind their hands. Either the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) or the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seek to take a senior role on the Asian stage and march up on any occasion to offer advice to these countries, which are doing far better than we are. They must think it is a huge joke. </PARA>
<PARA> When I and other senators were at school, we were taught that these countries were poor Third World nations that needed our support. Those countries have managed to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and get their act together. Yet Treasurer Keating, who has such a good reputation because of the manner in which he conducts himself during Question Time, has not been able to bring this country back together. In fact, he has pulled it further and further down. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have to ask ourselves what we achieve by Question Time. It is meant to be a time when members of parliament on both sides can peruse the Executive and find out what the Executive is trying to do. In part, the media has made Question Time almost an art form for people not to give answers at all. We frequently find very long-sometimes boring, sometimes not boring-answers that nonetheless do not address the specific points raised in the questions. Sometimes we have two or three minutes of simple abuse of the previous Government, which held office back in 1983-it should almost be part of ancient history books now. We are in a situation where this Government's Ministers come to Question Time and generally during the first few minutes of an answer the Minister says, `What would you have done?'. That is after seven or eight years. That is the vision that this Government's Executive now has. Its members cannot come through Question Time without referring to what would have happened nearly eight years ago. If this Government runs its full term we will have had a decade of Labor and it will be saying, `Well, a decade ago', and looking back into the past. That is not a productive way to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Ministers take up five or six minutes of Question Time with the express purpose of doing one of two things. Either they make some sort of statement that they could make in another fashion without taking up time in Question Time, in which case there is some particular information which they want to put forward and for which they have arranged a dorothy dixer-in a sense that is marginally excusable-or they simply take up time so that there will be fewer questions. So we have Question Time reduced to an absolute farce. The point I am making is that this is not something that has happened in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, had you and I been in this chamber in 1971-I had been out of school only two or three years-we would have heard nearly 34 questions a day asked in this chamber. In 1976, it had shifted down to about 31 questions a day. If we move on a bit, in 1979-80 there were still 28 questions a day being asked. We have now moved down to an average last year of 16 and a bit questions a day. It is a very serious reduction of the capacity of this chamber to peruse the Executive that is achieved by Ministers simply rambling on and not addressing the specific points raised by the questions that honourable senators put to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Ministers might think this is a smart way to go about it; they might think they are achieving something. But in my view, they are denigrating the parliamentary process and the institution of Question time by continually behaving in this fashion. We all understand that there will be occasions when the Government want to protect one of its members or one of its actions and it will necessarily tactically decide on that day that it has to ramble on as much as possible to keep the Opposition off the scent. No-one is complaining about that. That is a matter of parliamentary tactics. But to do it on a daily basis, to deprive honourable senators of the opportunity to ask questions, is quite another thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister, says that he is very concerned with the conduct of Parliament and with the conduct of Question Time. He has instructed his Ministers to answer double the number of questions in a day. On that basis, the Senate should now be receiving 32.8-say, 33-questions a day. In the first couple of weeks until, I think, Wednesday we were getting only 19 questions a day. That is no big deal compared with what the Prime Minister has told his Ministers: double the number of questions. Last week Senator Robert Ray said that he was not concerned with the question asked. He had the answer he wanted to give and that was the answer that he was going to give. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that the situation needs urgent attention. Speaker Rozzoli in the New South Wales lower House has restricted answers to five minutes. We could look at alternative systems where up to four times as many questions are handled in one day as are handled in this chamber, which would give far greater opportunity for Parliament through Question Time to pursue the actions of the Executive. Until this Government realises that something needs to be done about that institution of Parliament-and, for that matter, until the chamber takes the matter into its own hands and deals with those people who refuse to see the merit of these matters-we are in big trouble. </PARA>

It is very timely that I follow my colleague Senator Vanstone because she has made some very telling points about the way in which this Government conducts itself in the Senate, which also extend to the way in which it conducts itself outside the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1990 election is well and truly over and the Hawke Labor Government has a major task of tackling the problems that it has spent the last seven years creating. For the first time since 1980 a majority of Australians at a general election have not supported the Australian Labor Party. I do not say that in any way to excuse the coalition for failing to win a majority of seats. However, it means that, on the basis of preference votes, the Hawke Labor Government has been re-elected with a weak and diminishing mandate while employing campaign tactics of a very dubious nature. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia Labor won eight out of the 14 seats. It is equally relevant that, after the distribution of preferences, nearly 53 per cent of Western Australians voted against the Hawke Labor Government. This Government has a moral responsibility to take heed of this voter sentiment and act accordingly. It seems, however-sad as it may be-that there is very little intention to be honest with the people of Australia or to carry through or even consider policy changes that may be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all too clear in the stance of the new Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the political tactician has entirely taken the place of the Treasurer. We are firmly told that we live under the best of all taxation systems in the best of all possible worlds. Maybe he should talk to more individuals and small businesses that are rapidly going to the wall as a direct consequence of his colossal and ever increasing taxing policies. No thought is to be given to reforms of direct and indirect taxes that might encourage savings and productivity and lower interest rates. The only change to indirect taxes is to increase them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer can trumpet around day in and day out and say that they will not consider a consumption tax. As we well know, that is simply not true. We have a form of consumption tax at the moment. We have yet another Bill to increase sales tax even further on luxury vehicles. If that is not a form of consumption tax, what is? No recognition will be given to the candid admissions of Senators Walsh and Button that the only answer left to this Labor Government to depress demand is to engineer a recession. Yet the Treasurer, himself, on 12 February said:</PARA>
<PARA> The economy is slowing down, I mean, policy is working. </PARA>
<PARA>They are his words; not mine. Proof of just how well policy is working is evident in the latest bankruptcy statistics for the March quarter-showing a rise of 27 per cent over the same period in 1989, with a 74 per cent rise in Western Australia. Labor policy is clearly working exceptionally well in my own State, with a warning last month that one-third of our 70,000 small business enterprises are in serious trouble. It concerns me that that increase for the March quarter of 74 per cent of businesses going bankrupt does not take into consideration those businesses that have simply shut up shop before they have gone broke. That would make the figure a whole lot worse, not only in terms of the number of small businesses that have gone out of business, but also of the number of people who have lost their jobs and their security as a direct consequence. This Labor Government will not appreciate hearing from Senator Walsh or Senator Button the truth that was so carefully concealed from the Australian people during the election campaign-that the vaunted accord does nothing to give Australia what it needs so badly, increased productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> We have two senators-one an ex-minister and one a current Minister-who are saying that there should be an increase in productivity. What is happening? Messrs Hawke and Keating say `Not on. We are just going to have nominal wage increases regardless of productivity and regardless of whether that sends businesses bust'. This Government clearly has no vision at all for the future of Australia. Senator Walsh has stated that the level of nominal wage increases under the Accord remains undesirably high and that there has been a failure to deliver improved productivity. Has the Government done anything to increase productivity? No, it has not done a thing and it has no intention of doing so. Businesses of any kind do not mind paying people more as long as they get more in return, but they cannot afford to go on paying more and getting nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians were warned at the beginning of April by the Business Council of Australia that we must raise national productivity by at least two per cent annually if we are to cut our inflation rate to that of our trading partners and avoid the harsher alternative of lower real wages. Only a week later, the National Institute of Labor Studies reported that productivity growth is likely to remain sluggish and that far from improving, it has deteriorated. The blame for inflation is laid squarely at the feet of this weak productivity and the rising labor costs that the accord fails miserably to restrain. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business cannot afford any more labour costs without a comparable increase in productivity. When will the Government recognise this? The Government has had seven and a half years to recognise it and continues to ignore it. Australians will wait in vain for this arrogant, tired Labor Government to change policy so that the accord can no longer operate with its blessing to lock us into an uncompetitive inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> So, too, will we wait in vain for honesty and action in regard to the problem of overseas debt that ultimately will drive us down to the level of the Third World, if we are not already there. My colleague Senator Vanstone talked a little while ago about the countries that we were once told were way behind us and considered Third World countries. On 19 January it was reported that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures-quickly dismissed by the Treasurer, I might add-showed that Australia owed $55 billion to international banks. This puts Australia fourth in the international table, behind such notorious economies as Brazil, Mexico and the Soviet Union and ahead of Argentina. If that is not a disgrace, then what is? What did the Government do? Nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> In February we were warned by Access Economics Pty Ltd that under the continuation of present policies, in which this Government continues to have blind faith, net foreign debt will rise from 32 per cent to 42 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) within five years assuming that the terms of trade in the world economy remain stable. If, however, a more gloomy forecast prevails, then by the year 2000 our foreign debt will be 56 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> We are indebted to Professor Blainey, who reminds us that on the two previous occasions in our history when debt servicing rose above the level of 25 per cent of export income, massive recessions were the result-in the 1890s and 1920s. Foreign debt servicing now consumes 20 per cent of export income. What will the Government do? It will do nothing, because the Treasurer-the Deputy Prime Minister of this country-and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say that everything is going along just fine. Again, I respectfully suggest that they go out and talk to some people in the real world and not just talk to themselves. This is a problem that, to say the least, is not going to disappear now that the election has been won. It would seem, however, that the Government will not admit to the extent of the problem, let alone fight for a solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates continue to be a massive drain upon business and home buyers despite their much vaunted, yet marginal, easing. Improving home affordability can have little to offer those who, in this Labor-created recession, will lose their jobs and their incomes. It is a real tragedy to talk to people from some of the financial institutions at the moment who say that people are literally walking in their doors, throwing the keys down on the counter and saying, `Get me out of my home'. The tragedy is that many of them cannot afford to stay in their homes and many cannot afford to leave their homes because the value of their homes has diminished and yet their interest rates have gone up and their income has gone down. </PARA>
<PARA> A marginal drop in interest rates-which is likely to be reversed later this year-will not alter the essential position of families surveyed by the Real Estate Institute of Australia in six electorates in March. Those families quite clearly said that they needed to boost their after tax income by $100 per week before they could afford home loans. It is nothing short of appalling to think that that is what this Government has done to people trying to buy homes. The Hawke Labor Government cannot evade prime responsibility for the fact that over the past 10 years the income needed to fund an average mortgage has increased by 250 per cent while household incomes have risen by less than half that amount. One Western Australian seat included in the survey was Moore. It registered a swing, after preferences, of 6.3 per cent against Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> Another intractable problem for which the Hawke Government must urgently find some answers is health care. We heard plenty of abuse of the coalition policy during the election campaign, including the notable lie that we were going to abolish Medicare, but very little recognition of the inexorable pressure that Medicare in its current form places upon the health system. At the outset of the election campaign, on 24 February, the former Minister for Health-he is very wise to be `former' before it gets worse-boasted that Australia's public hospital system was, `getting on top of waiting lists'. I do not know what fairyland he was in when he said that, but obviously, as a Minister for Health, he had become tired and jaded like the rest of this Labor Government because he had not gone out to the public hospitals to find out whether the waiting lists existed or not. But obviously there is one person in this Government who has found that waiting lists do exist and that Medicare is rotten, or lousy-call it what you like-and that is Mr Hawke. He has not relied on Medicare. He has gone to St Vincent's Private Hospital!</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke cannot very well tell us all that Medicare is you beaut, fantastic and the best thing since sliced bread if he is not prepared to use the public hospital system himself. But then again he might have gone along to one of the public hospitals in Sydney and found himself at the end of a 100,000 waiting list. His little operation could not wait. In the final days of the campaign, the lid was just starting to come off this Medicare fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 March it was reported that a new children's ward in the Armadale-Kelmscott Hospital in Perth in the outer suburbs was empty. High patient numbers had caused cost overruns so the necessary medical staff could not be employed. Prior to the election, the State Minister for Health categorically and unequivocally denied that the 30-plus bed ward was going to close in the Kalgoorlie regional hospital. What happened post-election? It closed. On election day, all a bit too late for maximum impact, the West Australian reported that public hospitals in the State were in crisis, with the announcement of a closure of 12 beds at the Rockingham Hospital, and a restriction on elective surgery to three cases per week in one of the most rapidly expanding parts of the metropolitan area. At the Geraldton regional hospital a $700,000 budget blow-out resulted in the closure of a 24-bed surgical ward requiring patients to travel 450 kilometres to the metropolitan area. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right, Senator, the surgeons did move out, and such closures are only likely to continue. It is ironic to learn that despite the spending of $8.3m on building improvements at the Geraldton Hospital elective surgery was cancelled from 12 April. More and more West Australians are learning the hard way that they are not getting value for the health dollar under Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following day, 27 March, West Australians were told of the closure of 20 beds at the Bunbury regional hospital and the suspension of elective surgery at Bentley Hospital with the closure of a surgical ward. It is a measure of the severity of the crisis that in Geraldton-as Senator Panizza interjected a little while ago-surgeons offered to defer payments of fees for three months to avoid the closure of the surgical ward. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 February the Chairman of the State Committee of the Australian Association of Surgeons, Mr Nash, wrote to the Australian Financial Review pointing to a key factor in this increasing bed shortage as a 40 per cent coverage of the population to a level giving them surgery in a private hospital, compared with 80 per cent in 1970. So in 20 years it has dropped to half. A waiting list of 18 months described by Mr Nash, with elective surgery down to two cases per month over the last three years, I believe tells its own story. The fact that prior to this he had been able for 25 years to book one to five patients each week for elective surgery in public hospitals shows how Medicare has operated to deny hospital beds to uninsured Australians. What is probably the worst aspect of this is that people do not know that the situation is as bad as it is until such time as they need to use a public hospital, or until they have a friend or a relative in need of a public hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of the story has also been well reported since the election with 800 of the 2,000 private hospital beds in Western Australia lying idle each day while the same number of privately insured patients occupy public hospital beds to the exclusion of many of the people that Medicare was designed to help. This coming Saturday the State Government of Western Australia is facing two by-elections because the former Premier and the former Deputy Premier have seen fit to flit the State. There are many reasons why they want to do that too. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Premier before that; exactly, Senator. Former Premier Burke has also decided to flit the State. We have seen a massive exercise in pork-barrelling by the new Premier, Dr Lawrence. We have this whole scenario that I have gone through of crisis in public hospitals right throughout the State with wards closing hand over fist and, guess what? The Government has found millions of dollars-I think it is about $2.3m-to do an upgrade of Fremantle Hospital. I would not deny that Fremantle Hospital could do with an upgrade, but is it not somewhat ironic that one of the seats up for grabs next weekend is the seat of Fremantle? Here we have all these hospitals starving to death in the regional areas and Dr Lawrence, Dr Feelgood, says, `We will look after Fremantle'. It is just appalling when, as I said before, in Geraldton patients now have to travel 450 kilometres to get surgery. The Government says, `We will pork-barrel Fremantle because there is a vote in it for next Saturday'. The private sector resources are fully capable of treating many of the patients currently drawn into the public system where, of our two major hospitals, outpatient clinics at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital are cancelled one day each week and, more seriously, orthopaedic surgery is cancelled at Royal Perth Hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A week before last I asked the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who represents the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) what was being done about this dreadful state of health in the public hospital system in Western Australia. He did not know. That is a bit of an indictment as well. With the situation as bad as it is in Western Australia he did not have the faintest idea whether anything was to be done, whether anything had been done, or whether anything was likely to be done. That is the reality of the way in which the Government is treating people who have had faith in such a lousy system. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the problem between private and public hospitals. The cause of this tragic misallocation of resources was underscored on 4 May with the release of statistics showing that in the March quarter of 1990 some 12,000 Western Australians opted out of private health cover, bringing to 60,000 the total for the year, and a grand total of more than 400,000 since December 1983. The Government will tell us that is because people have faith in the system and that it is such a fantastic system. That is not the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that people are opting out of private health insurance is that they cannot afford to pay three times. They cannot afford to pay the mandatory levy, they cannot afford to pay the other 66 per cent out of general revenue, and they cannot afford to pay private health insurance. Something has to go towards keeping their houses, feeding their families and, unfortunately, private health insurance is the one that goes. They only find out that that was a wrong course of action to take when they get sick. What that really means is an extra cost of $33m to the State's public hospital system, worsening the effects that are already taking place. A 1.2 per cent drop in private cover on a national basis means that a further 182,000 Australians are now uninsured and will be the sole responsibility of the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the election the Government refused to spell out to the people of Australia what it was going to do to try to correct the ills of Medicare. Will it decrease the rebate? Will it increase the levy? Will it shift more costs onto the State governments? What will it do? If anyone can find out what the Government is doing, he is doing very well, because it is one of the best kept secrets that this Government has. All it will do is continue to watch the decline of the health system and not say what it will do about it to correct it. This Labor Government does not have the luxury of pretending that the private health system is outside its concern. Despite its socialist rhetoric, Medicare was deliberately based upon the assumption that a large percentage of Australians would maintain their private cover. </PARA>
<PARA> Maintaining private cover really does not help people all that much these days. Sometimes I cannot believe the people of Australia. If any government were to tell them that they could insure only the front ends of their cars or the backs of their houses they would go berserk. But they seem to accept the fact that they can be insured for only 85 per cent of their health costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In a situation pretty close to me a person spent time in intensive care wards in both public and private hospitals for four or five weeks. This person had top private health insurance and was paying the levy and taxes but has been hit for thousands of dollars. Why can we not have a health system such as that proposed by us prior to the election-one that allows people to insure for the gap so that they can go to the hospital of their choice and have the full options available to them?</PARA>
<PARA> A Government that removes all the incentive for younger Australians to maintain private insurance, with the consequent pricing out of others, must bear full responsibility for the inevitable collapse of Medicare. When elderly Australians cannot get elective surgery in such areas as hip replacement that will allow them to remain living independently, inevitably they end up in nursing homes or hospitals. Sadly, this costs the taxpayer even more. I do not criticise the elderly for wanting a lot of the surgery that is now capable of being done. It is to their benefit and it is to the benefit of all Australians to ensure that those who need that type of surgery can get it and continue to live independently. Early in March it was pointed out by a geriatric specialist at the Gairdner Hospital that the policy of this same Labor Government has created a serious shortage of nursing home beds in the western suburbs of Perth, with its growing elderly population. In the catchment areas for the Gairdner and Osborne park hospitals there were 59 nursing home beds per 1,000 population over 70, compared with 97 for the Royal Perth Hospital catchment area further east. In the western suburbs, 174 beds had been closed, with 44 more closures pending. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are we heading? The situation is getting worse and worse. Yet, only the week before last, Senator Tate, the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, said that he did not have a clue what would happen. The end result is 30 elderly patients with the choice of remaining in their public hospital beds or moving to a nursing home in Midland, a considerable distance away. The bureaucratic inflexibility of the Hawke Labor Government in this related area of health care worsens the Medicare mess in our public hospitals, with valuable beds occupied by those with nowhere else to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists and others who last year had dealings with the Minister for Housing and Aged Care would not be surprised to learn that the specialist, in writing three letters to the Minister, received but one fatuous reply to his suggestions of improved consultations over this question. Clearly, the Minister did not even understand the question raised by the pharmacist. But then, when we look at the way in which the Minister conducted himself during the entire pharmacy debate last year, we should not be surprised at that either. He does not understand pharmacy or the problems of the aged; he does not understand many things. It is very sad and very tragic that this whole mess is now being put before us with no possible solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced that the creative thinking that will be needed through the 1990s to tackle such problems as external debt, low productivity, declining availability of health care and the achievement of the essential balance between economic growth and protection of the environment will come only from John Hewson's coalition team. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately I have run short of time. I would like to have discussed many environmental issues. During the next three years this Parliament will be faced with the challenge of maintaining a proper balance between the protection of the environment and the sustaining of economic growth, without which Australia will not be able to protect its heritage. Unfortunately, the Government once again saw fit to pander to a special interest group and therefore make sure that proper, thorough debate on the issue was stifled. </PARA>
<PARA> A clear distinction is emerging between those of us who believe that sound economic growth and environmental protection are interdependent and the dark green lobby, which denies this truth and the practicality of any solution that involves the free market. We are beginning to realise the authoritarian agenda of the dark green environmentalists, who in Tasmania want to preserve the environment even from bushwalkers-as you, Mr Acting Deputy President would be well aware, as this is happening in your State-and they want to eradicate introduced species of fauna, including trout, and destroy existing hydro-electric schemes so that a drained Lake Pedder becomes accessible only to a selfish, fanatical elite. I think there will be a big discussion about the environment and about economic growth, because Australia certainly needs to protect both. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was historic in that the Labor Government got up a fourth time, but the word `decisive' is what I want to discuss. Even Senator Tate would agree that the words `decisive fourth mandate' are questionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the results of the election. I have a publication here put out by a government agency which states that the percentage of first preference votes for 1990 showed that nationally the Australian Labor Party scored 39.44 per cent while the coalition scored 43.19 per cent. In my State of Western Australia the Liberals alone scored 43.91 per cent and the National Party of Australia scored 2.42 per cent, giving a total of 46.33 per cent. Having got that result of 46.33 per cent, and on a two-party preferred basis we scored about 51.7 per cent, one would think that we would have held at least half of the seats in Western Australia. There are 14 seats in Western Australia, the latest being Pearce, which was well won by former Senator Fred Chaney. The Government finished up holding eight seats and the coalition six. </PARA>
<PARA> On those figures one would think that we would be somewhere near holding government; but lo and behold, Labor still has a 10-seat majority. In the days when Bjelke-Petersen was winning elections with 39 or 40 per cent of the vote, what did they call him? Using these figures, there is no way in the world that the Government could have written a speech like this saying that it had a decisive fourth mandate. It should have just left it as being an historic win and that is all. </PARA>
<PARA> What is decisive about the results? The minor parties had a lot to do with this election. I am pleased to note that the Australian Democrats scored their worst result in Western Australia. Perhaps the voters of Western Australia judged them as they should have judged them. The Greens also had quite an influence in the election by their preferences. The Greens' and Democrats' preferences held this Government in office. Those two minor groups were able to make all the promises they wanted because they did not have to deliver. Only two parties can deliver on the promises they make and they are the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition. The ones in between can deliver nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be interesting to see how many of the Government's promises will be delivered, in light of the state of the economy, over the next three years-if this Parliament lasts that long. Probably not all of us will be here at the end of those three years for one reason or another, hopefully not because of misfortune. The voters of Kingston in South Australia, which is the House of Representatives seat the former Leader of the Australian Democrats ran for, obviously did their figures. They questioned and obviously costed the Democrats' promises because the result did not come out the way the Democrats had expected. The present Australian Government did win, but certainly not decisively. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of comments were made in the Governor-General's Speech and I would like to pick up one of them, and that is, the Government wants Australia to be the clever country as well as the lucky country. I believe that this country is not clever at present because it is the country of lost opportunities. It is quite the opposite of a clever country. We have lost competitiveness with our overseas trading partners. I am afraid to say that we have lost the pride to work. We have lost industries-the Sarich industry is a good example-to other countries. If productivity has not declined it certainly has not improved. Australian industries have been selectively assisted, as in the Kodak affair. I want to see Australia become a clever country, but it has been anything but clever. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary and resource industries are the only ones keeping Australia afloat at present, yet they were hardly mentioned during the election. The primary and resource industries still have a bright future. I know that there are problems in certain industries. The wool industry is probably the one that has the biggest problem at present though this is not quite so evident to Australians during the election. Those involved in the wool industry were raising concerns 18 months ago about the problem of the high reserve in our wool market. I do not intend to enter into a debate on the marketing system right now because we will debate that later in the week, but concern was expressed that there was not enough wool flowing through to the factories overseas and that too much was being stockpiled in Australia. With the right management of the Australian Wool Corporation and better marketing research, we will get the industry going again. It will probably take two to three years for the wool industry to return to its rightful place as Australia's largest export earner. </PARA>
<PARA> A few other things have contributed to the current position of the wool industry. Overproduction is one. We have roughly 22 million sheep too many in Australia at present. This has brought about a downturn in the wheat and cattle industries because farmers and pastoralists have turned to sheep rather than wheat and cattle. This will even out in time. One of the reasons that the sheep population has grown so much in the last three to five years is that we have not had a king-sized drought. I do not wish that on any of the agricultural areas of Australia, but we have to expect one because in time they come back to haunt us. However, I can still see a bright future in the primary and resource industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy did not play a big enough part in the Federal election. For the last 18 months the coalition has been propounding in this place and in other places that the economy was not quite right, though the Labor Government obviously convinced enough voters in the last election that what it was saying was right. Although the coalition was propounding this, no-one was taking any notice. In fact, the Government was doing its best to make sure that no notice was taken. It is peculiar that on the Monday after the election everything was revealed-not quite everything, but Senator Walsh let the cat out of the bag. This is not the only election in which that has happened. There was a similar fiasco after the Western Australian State election of 1989. The coalition told the media and everyone else that there were problems in Western Australia with Western Australia Inc. No-one wanted to believe this. The Government said, `Look to the future. Don't look behind'. One always says `look to the future' when one does not want to look behind. Within weeks all was revealed. With the Federal Government, as time goes on, more and more is being revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> So where does the problem lie in this matter? I do not blame the Government for covering up its misdemeanours and misquotes or for simply getting its figures wrong, but when we were propounding and questioning there was one section of the community that certainly did not help us-that is, the media. During the Federal campaign, as in the State campaign in Western Australia the media questioned the credibility of our leaders. They questioned the credibility of Andrew Peacock and the credibility of our Leader in Western Australia, Barry MacKinnon. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of questioning what the Government was doing, the media made a big play of the supposed divisions within the Liberal Party and any divisions, if there were any, between the Liberal Party and the National Party. The media did not make a play of the divisions that existed in the Ministry of the Hawke Labor Government. There was Senator Button, Senator Richardson and Mr Kerin, all of whom probably did know what they were about and who were concerned about the situation, but there were some divisions with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and some Ministers against each other. </PARA>
<PARA> But the media failed to expose that. All the media were interested in was Andrew Peacock's credibility. Of course, as the results showed, the media convinced enough people that Andrew Peacock may have lacked credibility. But when Senator Walsh took the lid off, on the following Monday there for everyone to see was the fact that what Andrew Peacock was saying, and what we were saying, was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to what has to be done and what reforms the Government intends to undertake in the next three years, as mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech. The Government has reforms, which we have needed for a long time, high on its list of priorities, or so the Government tells us. The Governor-General's speech referred to the waterfront, telecommunications, land transport and coastal shipping. Of course we need reforms in all these areas, but we need them sooner rather than later. Although the Government has a rather slender majority after the last election, I fear that it may take things fairly easily and slowly on the reform that is so badly needed to get us into a position to compete with our trading partners. I refer especially to waterfront reform, having regard to the Inter-State Commission report that was brought down and which we discussed in this Parliament last year, for which the Government has formulated a package. The Government now seems to be slightly on the side of delay, but the waterside workers themselves are urging the Government to get on with it because of the package that they have been offered. If I may say so, it is a rather good package for the waterside workers; hence, I can see why they want to get it. </PARA>
<PARA> The report brought down cited the average age of our waterside workers around Australia as 57; it would be now 58. If the Government delays introducing these reforms, these people will get older and older when at this time they are anxious to take their packages and get out, and let younger people come in with new ideas and get things moving. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecommunications needs reform. We need some competition. One can see for oneself that because of Telecom Australia's monopoly, the average cost of a simple car phone is around $2,000 whereas overseas, including New Zealand, the cost is $100 or $200. That is why competition is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Land transport also needs to be treated with haste. Road systems around Australia are breaking down, as I have said many times in this place, mainly due to a lack of funding. But our road system is also breaking down due to an increase in the amount of traffic on it. Other kinds of transport should be used, such as shipping and rail. Coastal shipping has also got to be addressed quickly, for the reasons I have given. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to railways. The Government has mentioned what it intends doing in the next three years in that area. Australian railways have to be updated, but Australian National has to be worked on the most. I have believed for a long time that all the capital cities of Australia should be connected by a standard gauge railway controlled by Australian National. All capital cities are connected by the standard gauge, except for Adelaide and Melbourne, but standard gauge trains can go via Sydney. The point has certainly arrived in history when we have to operate one system between the capital cities and update the wagons and locomotives and the way that the system is operating, so that locos and crews do not have to be changed five times between Sydney and Perth, or whatever they do, and the cost of rail freights can be reduced so that rail can once again compete with road. There is no way on this earth that road transport should be able to compete with rail between Sydney and Perth or Melbourne and Perth. It is absolutely ridiculous and the problem has got to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> My last point relates to migration. I believe that in a downturn of the economy-I will refer to a downturn rather than a recession, or whatever the economists argue it is--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is next week. I believe that migration, whether in this climate or not, should always be suited to what Australia needs at a particular time. I believe that the accent on migration, especially at the present moment, should be on areas in which migrants are needed. Over the last so many years, migrants to Australia have been going mainly to the populous areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, some populous areas can do with a certain number of migrants, but 140,000 to 150,000 migrants a year are moving into areas of high unemployment. It is all right for professionals, who can get jobs, or business migrants who set up businesses, to move into those areas, but far too many migrants are going into those populous areas where housing, which is already tight, has to be provided, or where land has to be provided for that housing, in addition to all the support structures needed for those people, whereas parts of the country cannot fill their work vacancies. We have that much unemployment in the cities that some migrants finish up on the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has to address this matter. Senator Walsh has pointed out that a yearly increase in gross domestic product of one or 2 per cent is needed to make up for the 140,000 to 150,000 migrants coming to Australia every year. </PARA>
<PARA> I know, as Senator MacGibbon pointed out the other day that it is a bit hard to get people to work in areas in which they do not want to work. It is an Australian's right to work where he wants, but if workers want to live in an area where they cannot get a job, and they consciously do that, I believe that the Department of Social Security should not have to support them for the rest of their days. I believe that one should look for work where work is available. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of migration. If people want to migrate to this great country of Australia, I believe that they should contribute something when they come here. Perhaps arrangements can be made, for people willing and prepared to work in remote areas, whereby something is built into the points system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They should be higher. We have a problem. The problem lies not only with machinery operators, labourers or others; it also concerns the professionals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was mentioned in this place last week that there is an oversupply of doctors in Sydney and Melbourne, yet I live in an area where it is very hard to keep a doctor. The only way we have kept doctors and kept up the health side of the area in the last 10 or 15 years is, thankfully, by getting Asian doctors who have come over and are prepared to work in these remote areas for a friend. We have had an Australian doctor for only 12 months during the last 20 years. He chose to go back to Queensland, which was his right. The only way we were able to replace him was, once again, by looking for an Asian migrating doctor. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other areas. The pharmacy area is the same. Then there are remote industries. Iron ore industry operators have been supplied, mainly by the New Zealand labour that comes over. The grain industry has been helped out by United Kingdom migrants-farm workers that come out here on 12-month working visas. On we go. </PARA>
<PARA> Migration should work as to make sure that those industries in those remote areas are assisted to keep their work forces full. Some of the remote areas are not all as remote as the Pilbara, the Kimberleys or whatever. They are places within a maximum of 300 kilometres of a capital city. The same goes for the gold industry, which has its own problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a stark reality that we on this side of the chamber are in opposition for the next three years, or whatever the term of the Parliament may be, but I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we are on the other side next time. Just like after losing a grand final, especially one that we should have won, it is a bit hard to crank up next year. I had that experience in 1964, when my club was the hot favourite and did not quite get up. The year after it was a bit hard to get intensity up, but the side easily won the premiership the year after and if history repeats itself, that is what we will be doing the next time around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has looked, with as much dismay as, I suppose, most Australians have, on the brawling within this Government-not because of the brawling but because of the fact that after the election, for the first time, members of this Government have admitted the truth about the serious economic problems this Government has got us into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brawling is significant not simply because it represents a lack of discipline or an unprecedented departure from the traditions of Cabinet solidarity. It is far more important because of the fact that it not only reveals the Government's lack of will to correct the problems that so many members of the Government are now prepared to recognise publicly but also reveals, significantly, that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has an impossibly short fuse and, therefore, does not possess the person management skills to be an effective Prime Minister and that this Government's economic policies have been in disarray because this Government is in disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously, that disarray had been behind closed doors. All that has happened now is that it has become public. Now we see the brawling. Now we see the reasons why this Government has not undertaken the sorts of economic measures and has not followed the sort of economic management which are vitally needed in Australia and which this Opposition has been recommending to, and pressing upon, this Government for years. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it interesting that Ministers like the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) are prepared to say, after the election, the sorts of things they were not prepared to say before an election. In fact, this Ministry deceived the Australian people about the state of the economy. It deceived Australian people about what would happen over the next three years if a Labor Government were elected. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Ministers who are now suddenly finding-re-finding, for those who did have it before-some capacity in their personalities to tell the truth, the sudden discovery is extraordinarily timed. In fact, it is timed to meet their self-interest. We find the disputes that are emerging within this Government are related, perhaps, not necessarily to a sudden outbreak of honesty but to questions of self-interest and power struggles within this Labor Government. That cynicism which has prompted the admission of truth about the seriousness of our economic future, I believe, is something for which the Australian public will not forgive those Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for Ministers like Senator Button to get up and say, `The differences between us are simply those of emphasis'. I think the Australian public can judge for themselves whether Mr Keating's extraordinarily vindictive assault-we do not know what goes on behind closed doors, I suppose, but I mean his verbal assault-on Senator Button was clearly part of a power struggle within the Australian Labor Party which relates to Mr Keating's unbridled --</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as Senator Newman says, it is probably another part of it. It clearly indicates that the power struggle for leadership within the Labor Party is incapable of being restrained once the discipline of coming towards an election has been removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We noted that, when I asked Senator Button last week whether he would resile from or regret any of the comments he made that prompted Mr Keating's savage attack, he said no, he did not resile from them. The comments I put to him were these: Senator Button said, `In the current economic downturn of some severity it is unrealistic to talk about rising living standards'. Senator Button did not resile from that. No-one said that sort of thing before the election. A clear governmental deception of the Australian people-that is, if Senator Button is now to be believed-took place before the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point he refused to resile from was, `The economic outlook for Australia over the next few years will be very difficult'. According to Mr Keating, before the election, everything was on track; recovery was on the way; the Government had the settings right; and, if I recall, he said that one set of appalling balance of payment figures were `pretty good numbers'. The third point that Senator Button refused to resile from was his comment: `Opportunities for micro-economic reform in Labor's third term were lost and time has to be made up'. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I agree with all of those points that Senator Button has made. I commend him for making them. I am appalled that he did not have the desire to be as honest before the election. Let us have a look at how significant these--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Button does not want me to get too upset. I ask him, then, whether he will give us an undertaking that he will display the same honesty before the next election as he displayed post-election now. That is an interesting challenge, and I offer it to Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the great achievements of Senator Button's adversary, the Treasurer. I must say that by commending Senator Button, I am by implication saying that Mr Keating has led us into an economic disaster and that the policies that he has implemented have deepened and worsened Australia's economic position, despite the fact that he was rescued partially by an unprecedented increase, an unexpected increase, in our terms of trade which has prevented a much more disastrous situation hitting Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the Australian Financial Review David Clark has a reasonably sound analysis of `the world's greatest Treasurer'. He asks us to look at the achievements of Paul Keating. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Consider the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the state of the economy. Australia currently has:</PARA>
<PARA> An inflation rate more than double the average of our major trading partners and up to three times as high as that in those economies to our north with whom we are trying to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> The highest mortgage rates in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> Lending rates to business up to three times as high as those in most similar economies. </PARA>
<PARA> Wage growth 1.5 to two times that of similar economies. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the highest gross debt interest payments to export income ratios-over 20 per cent-outside of Latin America and Eastern Europe and one of the highest principal plus interest payments of export income ratios anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Over the 1980s, Mr Keating was quick to put the boot into any commentators who doubted his Budget forecasts but how many treasurers in Australian history have a record like his 1988-89 one?</PARA>
<PARA> Take his current account deficit forecast for 1988-89. The forecast was for a CAD of $9.5 billion. The outcome was a mere $17.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As a percentage of GDP, the CAD was forecast to be only 3.0 per cent. The outcome was 5.2 per cent-</PARA>
<PARA>Almost double-</PARA>
<PARA>As a percentage of GDP, only Thatcher's Britain had a CAD as bad as this in the advanced world. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Clark goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Note that Mr Keating's overall forecasts were far worse than expected, even though our terms of trade . . . were far more favourable than expected. The forecast was for a 9.0 per cent improvement; the outcome was a 15.6 per cent one. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Clark goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Keating has proven himself to be the greatest media manager in Australian political history. Look at the army of commentators, editorialists, and economics editors who believed that the J-curve would come to our rescue--</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that the Opposition continually said that it would not, and the Opposition once again was totally right. It is about time some of those hot-shot economic commentators recognised that the people who have been consistently right in the economic debate have been those in the Opposition-and ever since we have been in Opposition. It is the Treasurer who has created this atmosphere, created this situation which Australia now faces, as Senator Button says, a very difficult economic outlook-an economic downturn of some severity. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating assured us all in 1988 that we had finally solved our foreign debt and current account problems. All the economic commentators said, `Yes, he is a very clever fellow'. Mr Clark goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Keating told us that the replacement of a large Budget deficit with large Budget surpluses would guarantee a significant and permanent fall in interest rates and our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>Look at what has happened: we have record interest rates and a disastrous current account deficit, which is forecast to continue for quite some time. Mr Clark concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> In short, Australia has never had a politician with such blind faith in simple Economics I style geometry and with such ability to pass on such a faith to the media. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, it is more than time that the media recognised that its faith was misplaced. The Opposition has been calling for a long time for major corrections to the Government's economic policy, in particular, in micro-economic reform. The Treasurer stated that Government Ministers, particularly Senator Button, should be lifting their ambitions for a change-not just talking about actually getting them done. I suppose that when one looks at Senator Button's achievements one can understand Mr Keating's impatience. What we have to recognise is this: the power struggle between these two men over the pace of economic reform and the nature of economic reform has been going on for years. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer Senator Button-I am glad to see him at the table-to our debate on the Industry Commission Bill of 5 December last year in which I dealt with the fact that Mr Keating stole control of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) away from Senator Button, over Senator Button's dead body in the Cabinet, because he clearly did not want Senator Button to have control of the micro-economic reform inputs that the IAC was responsible for. In fact, we had lots of stories in the media about how the IAC had been a flop under Senator Button and that Mr Keating was going to put it right. In fact, what Mr Keating did was to try to kill off the IAC. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that Senator Button did a far better job with the IAC than did Mr Keating. We can see by looking at the IAC report for last year just what Mr Keating did to destroy this vital element in our trying to fix up what was wrong with the Australian economy. In the last year in which Senator Button was the `responsible Minister', the IAC received 10 references from him. In both the years that Mr Keating was responsible the number of references was five-exactly half the work load that Senator Button had got the IAC to do in this vital area of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see the extent to which it was running down, and being run down, because in the last year in which Senator Button was responsible 11 reports were completed by the IAC. By last year Mr Keating had run it down to four-almost a third of the number of reports presented by Senator Button. Of course, Senator Button is the Minister who Mr Keating says is not pulling his weight in terms of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see that these personality battles between Senator Button and Mr Keating are one of the reasons why this Government has been unable to come up with coherent micro-economic reforms. The IAC's effectiveness was not only blunted; its staff disappeared and its leader left. As was stated in the article in the Business Review Weekly by Chris Wallace:</PARA>
<PARA>The IAC suffered a prolonged period of drift after Keating took it from Senator John Button's Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce . . . after the 1987 election. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that the Industries Assistance Commission had a vitally significant role in restructuring this country. But, as a result of deliberate Government policy, it was put into the political wilderness for the last two years. Chris Wallace went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Initially, Keating pursued his micro-economic reform program without much recourse to IAC resources. Perceptions of the Commission's power and significance slid as it was obviously bypassed in the policy-making process, and many good staff left. </PARA>
<PARA>This was all as a result of these battles between Mr Keating and Senator Button extending over two years. That is the important point. It is no wonder that the Government cannot get its reform package right when the Ministers themselves cannot agree and when they fight over the mechanisms and who should control them, the mechanisms that are supposed to be an important part of this reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if just the Opposition has been calling for a better job by the Government. Since the beginning of this year the following organisations and institutions have called for significant policy changes: the Reserve Bank, the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Bureau of Industry Economics, various State employer organisations, including the Victorian Employers Federation and the Queensland Employers Federation and leading members of the Government. The Australian Labor Party, including Senator Button, Mr Dawkins and the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has also called for significant policy changes. Where are they? When is the Government going to tell us what it is going to do?</PARA>
<PARA> So far we have had a clear indication from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday 12 May that one of the people vitally involved in this micro-economic reform of getting Australia's costs down, of getting us on the right track, is already preparing his excuses for failure. I am referring to Senator Bob Collins. In that article Senator Collins agreed with some wharfies he saw that it was not good enough to look at the wharves when looking at things that have to be done to correct our balance of payments problems. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Collins said later: `I got it delivered to me right between the eyes, there and then on the wharves of Melbourne. And, of course, they're right.'</PARA>
<PARA>What are they right about? They are saying it is not fixing up the wharves that matters; it is a whole lot of other things. Of waterfront reform Senator Collins says:</PARA>
<PARA>`The thing about waterfront reform is there always has to be a sexy issue in politics. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That issue becomes the benchmark in measuring the success or failure of the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . during our last term, interest rates and overseas debt became the issues. Now these have translated into the new catchcry of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> `You see, it's very easy to understand, it's also easy for the Government's opponents to exploit. It's a highly visible issue-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, reform of the wharves-</PARA>
<PARA>to measure success or failure by. And yes, of course it's silly to think waterfront reform is the be-all and end-all of getting our balance of payments right. </PARA>
<PARA>He then tries to downgrade the significance of waterfront reform by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . reform of broadcasting, the issue of foreign ownership of television, the question of Telecom's monopoly-all those are potentially more important to micro-economic reform . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is just incredible. Unless we fix up these basic elements that affect the costs of exporting and, in particular, reform of the wharves we face an economic disaster. Yet here is Senator Collins trying to downplay the significance of it by saying that it is not of all that much consequence, and trying to suggest that the current wool issue is far more important than the fundamental one of fixing up the costs of exports. I was intrigued to see that Alan Ramsey, who wrote this article, went along with that view. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia's current account deficit is still going sour at the rate of $1.9 billion a month . . . By comparison, reform of the waterfront will mean annual estimated savings of some $620 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA>This was clearly an attempt, no doubt assisted by Senator Collins, to say, `Look, waterfront reform is only minor compared to the big problem'. Let me stress to Senator Collins that the extraordinarily unnecessary costs, $620m a year, that is added to the costs of our exports is pricing them out of our markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. Will the Government agree to a joint Commonwealth-State royal commission, called for by both the Government and Labor Opposition in New South Wales, to investigate the activities of the Mafia in the terms agreed by the New South Wales Parliament, that is, the involvement of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the New South Wales Police with the Mafia in the illegal growing of marijuana crops in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and in the Brindabella Ranges in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT); corruption involving the cultivation and distribution of marijuana in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and, in particular, the Griffith area; and the relationship of all the above with the death of Assistant Federal Police Commissioner Winchester, and related allegations of police corruption and any commonality of personal interests involved therein?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="623" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is, of course, aware of the resolution passed in the New South Wales Parliament and has also received a letter from the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Nick Greiner, concerning this matter and embodying his call for a royal commission to be supported by both the Federal and New South Wales governments. I think honourable senators will be able to accept readily that the Government has no desire whatsoever to sweep any matters under the carpet and, through various mechanisms, has taken the matters surrounding the growing of marijuana in this country extremely seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real issue, I believe, is not whether the matters raised by Mr Hatton have needed or do need investigating but, rather, the most productive way to proceed from this point onwards. I think it is important to reiterate some of the points I have made in answers from time to time, both last May and again in this session, about what has happened and is happening in regard to these particular plantations and the involvement of the so-called Mafia.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, of course, honourable senators will be aware that Mr Ron Cahill, the Chief Stipendiary Magistrate for the ACT, has been conducting since August 1989 possibly the most comprehensive and detailed coronial inquest ever held in this country to determine the cause and manner of death of Assistant Commissioner Winchester. Mr Cahill has already indicated that he will be examining the relationship of Operation Seville to Mr Winchester's death, commencing in the middle of next month.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators, and particularly Senator Hill, would be aware also that since 30 May 1986 the National Crime Authority has had a national reference, codenamed Vigilante, into the Mafia and its activities in Australia. Since that reference commenced it has preferred 641 charges against 103 people. Honourable senators will recall that, in relation to Operation Seville, some 11 persons were subject to committal proceedings-the Queanbeyan proceedings-and, though no prosecutions followed, the magistrate himself indicated, as I have, that this was due chiefly to the failure of an indemnified witness to live up to the undertakings he had given.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have advised the Senate previously-in fact, last May-the National Crime Authority has investigated Australian Federal Police involvement in Operation Seville and concluded that there was no evidence of criminality involved. It did recommend to the Commissioner of the AFP that appropriate disciplinary action be taken, and I am advised that that was indeed undertaken. I should also point out that all police forces around Australia have made significant seizures and arrests in relation to marijuana cultivation and distribution over the past 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that background let me return to the coroner's inquiry into the death of Mr Winchester. No-one can deny that it is a serious and detailed public inquiry. Indeed, Mr Cahill is leaving no stone unturned in his examination of all matters likely to have some relevance to Mr Winchester's death. A number of people, including Mr Hatton, have claimed that the Coroner has insufficient powers adequately to undertake his task, which is to determine the manner and cause of Mr Winchester's death. But, of course, an Australian Capital Territory coroner can summons persons' papers, can call persons to answer questions on oath and grant a certificate which renders admissions of self-crimination of a person inadmissible against that person in a subsequent criminal trial. In addition, the Director of Public Prosecutions has a general power to give undertakings that evidence given in proceedings will not be used in criminal or civil proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> Since this very thorough process, bearing directly upon the concerns expressed in New South Wales by the Parliament, and the Premier, is already under way, it is the Government's view, after careful consideration, that the coroner's inquiry should be allowed to run its course rather than that we duplicate this with a totally new mode of investigation-a royal commission. I do, however, give this Government's commitment that if at the end of Mr Cahill's inquiry there are remaining issues or if new issues come to light they will be investigated. If, in our view, that requires a royal commission, that is what we shall have, but at this stage that requirement is not clear. In the fight against organised crime Federal cooperation with the States and Territories is vital. We welcome the New South Wales Government's willingness to cooperate and we reciprocate that willingness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I thank the Minister for his answer. I ask him a supplementary question: Does he not accept that the coronial inquiry by Mr Cahill is limited to matters relating to the death of Mr Winchester whereas the inquiry called for by the New South Wales Parliament-the Government and the Opposition-goes far beyond the scope of the coronial inquiry, including, as I said, into matters involving corruption, the cultivation and distribution of marijuana in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, and in particular the Griffith area, and generally speaking into the activities of the Mafia and organised crime in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have indicated that the coronial inquiry does have a specific object, that is, to find, if possible, who is responsible for the death of Colin Winchester. It is an inquiry into the manner and cause of his death. It will be very clear to honourable senators, and indeed to the whole Australian population, that Mr Cahill has adopted a very exhaustive examination of all matters which might have any bearing on the manner and cause of Mr Winchester's death and has indicated his desire to undertake a complete examination of the relevance, if any, of the matters loosely titled the Seville matters to Mr Winchester's death, and that will commence next month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also indicated, as to the broader issues which Senator Hill refers to, that the National Crime Authority has been undertaking, under the Vigilante reference, a very exhaustive examination of precisely those matters-the Mafia and its activities in Australia, particularly in relation to the cultivation of marijuana crops and their distribution. It is in that situation, where there are two different types of inquiry under way, with different rules of evidence and objectives--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, that is a major distinction. The Government has indicated that if, at the end of the coronial inquest, further matters need examination, the question of whether one goes down the route of a public inquiry or a royal commission is one that we will very seriously consider. But, this Parliament, indeed this chamber, was most insistent on setting up the National Crime Authority precisely to avoid the recurrence of royal commissions, which hold their hearings in public, so there would be a continuing royal commission, if you like, conducting its inquiries in private, which is the National Crime Authority. The Parliament-indeed the Senate-insisted on that distinction and therefore it would be a very grave matter to undertake a royal commission. Naturally, we will, as I have said, await the end of the coronial inquest before we decide whether a royal commission is warranted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support to an article which appeared in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald entitled `Runway EIS Firm May bid for Work'. The article quotes Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd director, Mr Bill Woodhead, as suggesting that Kinhill was likely to tender for some engineering work on the third runway. In the light of these statements, and the very serious concerns of the many people who stand to be affected, can the Minister give an unequivocal guarantee of the integrity of the environmental impact statement being undertaken into the proposed third runway for Sydney Airport?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="625" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can give that guarantee. I did note the article in the Sydney Morning Herald and indeed the adjournment debate speech from Mr Punch in the House of Representatives last week. The fact is that the processes that were adopted in appointing Kinhill were proper and scrupulous. The thing is, of course, that the number of companies in Australia that are capable, that have the engineering and other professional resources available to conduct an investigation of this complexity, is very limited. It would be fair to say that most, if not all, of them would have the potential for having a role to play at least in tendering for a work, in an engineering sense, on an airport because that is where their expertise lies. Kinhill has a very high reputation in this regard and in fact was responsible for the environmental impact statement (EIS) work and site location work on behalf of the Government when Badgerys Creek was selected in 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comments that have been made are not surprising. It is traditional for this to happen. Certainly from considerable experience, I know that prior to the release of an environmental impact statement all of the parties involved in the matter, particularly those on the anti-side of whatever particular development is being investigated, position themselves prior to the release of the document. That is precisely what is happening now. There is no great front page news attached to that.</PARA>
<PARA> On the current timetable, the EIS will be released on 31 July. But all of these comments entirely miss the mark, of course, in respect of the credibility of the result. The environmental impact statement will stand or fall on its own merits. As I say, Kinhill has a well-established reputation that I am sure it is not likely to put at risk by producing a flawed document. As I explained in the Senate last week in response to another question on this issue, the reason for the delay in the production of the EIS is the need to conduct scrupulously further investigations, particularly in the area of potential noise problems at Sydney airport. That is being done.</PARA>
<PARA> In concluding this answer, it might be instructive to remind the Senate of the process. When the document is produced on 31 July, it will be subjected to an intense period of three months scrutiny which in fact is in excess of the statutory requirements. It will be a very open process indeed. The Government has bent over backwards to ensure that the process will be as open and effective as possible in that it will be providing $100,000 to parties that have a close interest in the third runway to ensure that the EIS will be subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of that time the proponents will prepare a response to those objections. Those responses and the original draft will go to the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. That will result in the responsible Minister, Mrs Kelly, sending to me any comments or recommendations that she has on the final EIS before I make a decision as to whether the runway will go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore it can be seen that all of these side issues that are being raised, predictably enough, at this time are side issues. The credibility of the EIS will stand or fall on the document itself.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs and relates to the National Crime Authority (NCA) and its knowledge of death threats. I refer to the failure of the National Crime Authority to inform Mr John Hatton, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, of a death threat against him in 1980 which it allegedly became aware of in 1987. Given the likelihood that the conspirators are still around and given Mr Hatton's continuing interest in organised crime, does the Minister condone the NCA's excuse that it did not feel obliged to inform Mr Hatton of the threat because of the historical nature of that threat? Does the Minister consider that this is an acceptable practice?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that if any person in Australia is subjected to a death threat and a competent authority can make an assessment of that threat and pass on knowledge of it, that should be done. Particularly where a person as prominent as Mr Hatton has taken certain risks in exposing his knowledge of the activities of organised crime in Australia, then that sort of threat, if it has any basis, ought to be made known to him as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many of us who are subjected to such threats and I believe that it is extremely important, not only for the person concerned but for the family and others, that measures be taken as soon as possible once a proper assessment of the threat is undertaken. So, in answer to Senator Vanstone, I do believe that such threats ought to be notified to the person concerned as speedily as possible and the National Crime Authority, in my view, should have done so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade inform the Senate of the outcome of the meeting in Nigeria last week of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa so far as the question of sanctions is concerned? Is there any support for the view being promoted in Europe in recent days by President De Klerk that now is the appropriate time for sanctions to be relaxed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="626" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most important outcome of the meeting which I attended in Nigeria last week was a very strong recommitment made there by the Commonwealth to maintaining sanctions against South Africa until such time as there is clear and irreversible evidence of profound change in the apartheid system, not just the hope or the promise of such change. The Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on South Africa is comprised of representatives of nine countries; Joe Clark, the Canadian Foreign Minister, is chairman and Australia is a member. There are two members from Asia-Malaysia and India; four Foreign Ministers from Africa-Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Nigeria; and one from the Caribbean. So it is a very representative group. I think it is fair to say that the views of this group stand for those of the Commonwealth as a whole, with the conspicuous exception of one country, the United Kingdom, which, of course, continues to take a very different view about sanctions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That meeting had the benefit of a quite substantial dialogue with Nelson Mandela who made very clear the African National Congress's concern and its assessment of the situation that continued pressure is necessary if the very welcome progress that was made a few days ago at Groote Schuur is, in fact, going to be maintained. The Committee was concerned that, as a result of the charm offensive-I suppose it can be described-of President De Klerk and, to a lesser extent, of his Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, in Europe in recent days, there is a view going around that the battle against apartheid is essentially won, or at least won enough to justify the resumption of commercial contacts between these countries and Southern Africa. With that in mind--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Hill can put it in those terms if he likes and I will respond to that. Faced with expressions of this kind, the Committee wrote to European Community (EC) foreign Ministers and, to the extent that they are not caught up in that, other members of the Group of Seven, to put the case in favour of the continued application of sanctions. On Friday last week I delivered that letter to the current EC President, Ireland, which was very timely because there has been a meeting over the last couple of days of all the EC foreign Ministers. I will incorporate the full text of that letter in Hansard for the information of honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make, as quickly as I can, some of the central points in it because they go to the heart of the present debate about the applicability of sanctions. The point that we made is this: while this may be a time of unprecedented opportunity in South Africa, it is not yet a time of change. Not one of the fundamental pillars of apartheid has, after all, yet been dismantled. The Constitution itself has not yet been rewritten. Nelson Mandela has been released from prison but he is still denied the vote in his own land. The Population Registration Act, which classifies everyone by race at birth, remains wholly intact and its repeal is not in immediate prospect. The Group Areas Act, which determines where those of different race may live, remains fully in force with no timetable set for its repeal. The Lands Acts which underpin the whole indefensible Bantustan system, also remain unrepealed and unamended. Even the foreshadowed repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, which goes to determining access to facilities on the basis of race, has not yet been accomplished, although it may well be within the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, nor have the preliminary obstacles to substantive negotiations been removed. I am talking about the obstacles that have been identified as such by the Commonwealth and by the United Nations. Only a very small fraction of political prisoners have been released and the immunity from prosecution of returning exiles has not yet been guaranteed. Troops do remain in the townships and the State of Emergency remains in force. Other legislation such as the Internal Security Act, which is designed to circumscribe political activity, remains unrepealed.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, despite the lifting of bans and restrictions on individuals and organisations which occurred on 2 February, repression does continue. According to South Africa's own Human Rights Commission, 324 people were being held under the State of Emergency as of the first week of May, with a further 74 detained under internal security and other legislation. Of course, it is the case that hundreds of people have been wounded and over 100 killed in confrontations with police since 2 February.</PARA>
<PARA> There may come a time, and we all hope it will be sooner rather than later, when substantive change has occurred, clearly and irreversibly, and when it would be appropriate to consider easing some of the external pressure that helped bring that change about. The very strongly held view of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers, reinforced by our close consultation with Nelson Mandela and others, is that that time for considering such action simply has not yet arrived. We understand but we do not accept the argument that good intentions should themselves be rewarded. We also understand but do not accept on the basis of the evidence before us the suggestion that white South Africans would be encouraged to accept necessary fundamental change by relieving them now of the economic and psychological pressure.</PARA>

He is also incorporating the text of a letter in order to inform honourable senators of the substance of the matters which he is now further canvassing.

<PARA>While this is a time of unprecedented opportunity, it is not yet a time of change. Not one of the fundamental pillars of apartheid has yet been dismantled:</PARA>

<PARA> There may come a time, and we all hope it will be sooner rather than later, when substantive change has occurred-clearly and irreversibly-and when it would be appropriate to consider easing some of the external pressure that has helped bring that change about.</PARA>
<PARA> But our strongly held view, reinforced by our close consultations this week with Nelson Mandela and other leaders of the opposition forces in South Africa, is that the time for considering such action has not yet arrived. We understand, but do not accept, the argument that demonstrably good intentions should be rewarded. We also understand, but do not accept, the suggestion that white South Africans will be encouraged to accept necessary fundamental change by relieving them now from some of the economic and psychological pressures so manifestly still pressing upon them.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe rather, on all the evidence before us, that the way to advance the process of normalisation and democratisation in South Africa is to maintain intact the full range of sanctions now applying; to reduce that pressure, before any of the necessary changes of substance have yet occurred, would be to run a very grave risk of aborting that process.</PARA>
<PARA> Nelson Mandela made the point to us this week, dramatically and forcefully, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>``We call upon you, in your capacities as representatives of conscientious governments and peoples, as representatives of concerned and sovereign states, to impress upon your governments, and those governments you could influence, to halt and reverse the effort to untimely and wrongly lift sanctions against the South African Government. If this trend is not stopped all our gains will be reversed''.</PARA>
<PARA>We can only echo his words, and ask you to give them every possible weight, in the days and weeks ahead, in your own Government's consideration of how to respond to the rapidly unfolding developments in South Africa.</PARA>

I am sorry to load this matter on to him in the absence of his colleague but it is pretty urgent. In the Sydney Morning Herald this morning a story appeared which said that the Government is considering a proposal that age limits for children eligible for family allowance would be cut from 16 to 12 years. I ask whether the Government has changed its view of family allowances expressed clearly first of all by Senator Grimes, a former Minister for Social Security, to the National Economic Summit Conference in 1983 in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . family allowances are not and were never meant to be a welfare program in the strict sense. Rather, they are designed to achieve a broad measure of equity in the tax transfer system between those with and those without dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, I ask whether the Government contests the description used by the Institute of Family Studies only last year in its paper entitled Families and Tax, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances are the major policy measure that recognises the reduced capacity of people with children to pay tax because of the expenses involved in raising children. Because family allowances were introduced as a replacement for tax rebates for children, it is more appropriate to regard them as part of the tax system, and as such, a `negative' tax payment.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I ask whether a cut in or removal of family allowances for 12- to 16-year-olds would amount to a discriminatory tax hike for families with children-in short, the acceleration of an anti-child tax regime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators would agree that it is very important that there be no erosion of the high level of confidentiality and secrecy which normally attends counselling sessions in relation to the strain or stress involved in the possible breakdown of a marriage. Indeed, it is essential to successful counselling that that confidentiality be a part of the counselling process. However, it is clear that there are occasions where a counsellor can become aware of serious criminal offences revealed during those counselling sessions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A clear set of guidelines has now been agreed between law enforcement authorities, Family Court counselling services and the three national peak organisations involved in marriage counselling to try to enable counsellors in certain restricted cases to make law enforcement authorities aware of the serious criminal offences that I have indicated. Where an approved marriage counselling organisation has knowledge of a serious current threat to life or limb of any party, where it has knowledge of the commission of a serious crime against a person, including rape, assault or murder or an ongoing serious threat of physical or emotion trauma to a child, then that matter will be immediately reported.</PARA>

This matter was first raised at the Australian Police Ministers' Council some two years ago and has been subject to very extensive discussion. I believe these guidelines will be very helpful; but of course they have to be put into operation. To that end, training courses are proposed in each State to enable discussions to take place between counsellors and police authorities to ensure that the guidelines are sensibly and sensitively adhered to in a way which enables confidence to be held in those seeking counselling in the general confidentiality of the discussions held.</PARA>

However, the question of a general roll-over provision in the capital gains tax does go to the fundamental design of that tax which seeks to tax capital on the same basis as income.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services. On 1 January this year Mr Staples announced a community accord involving the three tiers of government-unions, business and the community sector-to deal with the national shame of homeless youth who are treated by government as out of sight and out of mind, as described by the Burdekin report on youth poverty. My question to the Minister is: What initiatives has the Federal Government taken since the Minister's speech on 1 January to set up this community accord as a matter of urgency to ensure a community-based response to the problem rather than a bureaucratic one, which has largely failed in the past and led to further juvenile detention and alienation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite clearly the Australian Government does not treat Australia's homeless youth as out of sight out of mind. Homelessness has been a matter of continuous concern to this Government with the special assistance program (SAP) being expanded continually since its introduction in 1984-85.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that Senator Vallentine is aware that in 1989 the Commonwealth Government announced in the Budget that new broad spectrum initiatives for disadvantaged young Australians would be delivered over the next four years involving some $100m. This supplements funding already available under SAP which I have already mentioned. In respect of young homeless Australians these initiatives focused on improving their chances of achieving independence or at least moving to a more stable lifestyle. It sought to achieve this primarily through the programs offered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training for training and education, through the Department of Community Services and Health by providing more intensive support in medium to long term accommodation services, as well as health services for young people who would otherwise not have access to traditional medical services, and by social security measures designed to enable more sympathetic and flexible income maintenance provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department has also been involved with family mediation initiatives to assist in returning homeless young people to their families where appropriate. Mr Staples, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, did not announce the community accord but said that what was needed was such an accord on youth homelessness. He did so in the context of the Commonwealth's social justice strategy. One of Mr Brian Burdekin's criticisms of the delivery and availability of services for homeless young people was the lack of coordination at the bureaucratic level. What Peter Staples and other Government Ministers have put in train, firstly, is this bringing together at the Commonwealth level of all the departments involved in providing services to disadvantaged young Australians. At the second level it involves coordinating and planning the delivery of services and assistance through consultation with State governments, local governments, unions, service providers and consumers wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The major responsibility for the welfare of children lies first and foremost with the parents and then, as a last resort, the State government. The Commonwealth has had some difficulty in getting some States to accept the extra funds where matching is involved and also to allow the necessary degree of Commonwealth involvement. The Commonwealth is very keen to see responses to youth homelessness being community based rather than bureaucratic.</PARA>
<PARA> Seminars to promote the youth social justice strategy were held in all States with a view to disseminating information about the package of initiatives and to gain input from community groups. Coordination committees have been established in all States and Territories with membership comprising all relevant funding bodies and in some States including consumers or advocates. Most States have now put forward their strategies for 1989-90 and had projects approved. The concern was to coordinate these new services with existing services, to fill gaps and to expand the range and types of services available. Initially, this was done by identifying high need areas and then developing a strategy tailored to meet the needs of those areas. The types of services approved have ranged from additional support workers to advocacy services with a special focus on more intensive support within medium to long term accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, planning is currently under way for approving further new services in 1990-91. This will involve similar targeting and consultation processes to those which have occurred this year but should be more effectively carried out because of the experience gained this year and because there will be more time to undertake these activities in 1990-91.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going on to say that of course the rationalisation of the trade union structure in this country would be a significant help in achieving the micro-economic reform agenda set out by the Hawke Government for its historic fourth term. The rationalisation of union coverage, award coverage, in industry centres would also create career paths for workers in those industries, would break down the possibility of demarcation disputes and would create a number of other benefits such as the ability to introduce multiskilling. So in answer to the first question, there is considerable advantage in micro-economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go to the central question posed in this group of questions, and that is the proposal by the ACTU for federations of unions to be registered. The ACTU proposal is to amend the Australian Industrial Relations Act to provide for registration of organisations of workers in the form of federations so that in one industry one registered organisation could appear representing a group of unions and that federation, as it would then be termed, could hold the award on behalf of that group of unions. This would be, in the ACTU's submission, an interim step in achieving industry unionism or unionism embodying a great number of unions.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that is an admirable suggestion. I have not yet concluded my consideration of all the ACTU's suggestions, or indeed the suggestions of other peak bodies, for amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, but of this one I can say that I have had direct experience in Western Australia. The Western Australian Industrial Relations Act provides for a similar facility. It works well, particularly if the federation is an interim and not a final step towards true industry unionism.</PARA>

There has been a great deal of talk recently about the Soviet-Jewish immigrants to Israel-their right of entry to Israel and their right to settle in occupied Palestine against the wishes of the Palestinian residents. I ask a question about the rights of another group-the Palestinians who were resident in what is now Israel and who fled or were forced out during the fighting which followed the United Nations partition of Palestine in 1947. What rights do these refugees, and their children, have to return to their original homes in Israel? What has happened to the property they left behind when they fled? Is it still theirs, or have they been fairly compensated if it has been expropriated? What is the attitude of Australia to these matters?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a good question from Senator Hamer which does draw attention to an often neglected element in the tragic situation we are now witnessing in Israel and the occupied territories. I cannot answer his question now precisely as to the formal rights such displaced persons have or may have, but I will seek further information to see what I can say on the record in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Australia's general position on this whole issue is by now well known and well appreciated to the extent that what we are talking about here are essentially political conflicts rather than contests of legal right. We take the view that the situation in Israel and the occupied territories is long overdue for reasoned resolution by a proper, negotiated settlement between Israel, its Government and the proper representatives of the Palestinian people.</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that all the efforts that have been made in recent times to enable those negotiations to commence, even in the very preliminary way that is involved in the Bush-Baker plan that has run into so much difficulty in recent times-all those possible avenues of progress-have so far come to nought.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's position remains one of very strong support for a resolution of the problem of the Palestinian people in a way that, of course, not only recognises Israel's right to exist within secure borders but also produces a just solution for the displaced Palestinian people. We will continue to add Australia's voice around the world in the appropriate forums and to appropriate governments to ensure that that comes about. I will seek further information and see what it might be possible to add by way of detail to that question.</PARA>

In particular, we look forward to the meeting giving further content to President Bush's comment made at the beginning of this month that the revolutionary changes and transformations in Europe are moving us from a post-war era to a new era in Europe, beyond containment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is evident from recent ministerial level consultations between the two superpowers that both sides are committed to concluding a strategic arms reduction talks (START) agreement. Discussions at the 4-6 April Washington meeting between Secretary of State Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze made some progress in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> We now have reports in the last 24 hours that the latest round of such talks, held in Moscow from 16-19 May, did succeed in removing some remaining substantial obstacles to a START agreement, in particular the treatment of air- and sea-launched cruise missiles. President Bush has now been reported as saying that this should allow the completion of the major substantive elements of a START agreement during the forthcoming summit.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the START agreement, which is of course crucial to nuclear disarmament, there is now an excellent chance, it seems, that a bilateral chemical weapons destruction agreement and verification protocols for the threshold test ban treaty and peaceful nuclear explosions treaty will all be ready for signature at that summit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise some comments in relation to the annual report of the Australian Institute of Health. This Institute, as people might know, is not a very old organisation, having been established, I think, in 1987. It is essentially an organisation that deals with statistics relating to health. It is a very interesting read because some of the things it alludes to highlight the importance of such an institute so that we do have adequate statistical databases on which to make the sorts of claims we do and also, very importantly, the sorts of predictions we need to make in the area of health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the headings in this volume could give one considerable pause but I suppose in some ways if it has been established to address the sorts of issues that are drawn to our attention then it is serving its purpose. I note for instance on page 13 under the heading `CSIRO Division of Plant Industry Laboratory Study' it says that in 1988 the staff in a research laboratory at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Division of Plant Industry became aware of what they thought seemed to be an undue proportion of people who had worked in that laboratory developing cancers of one kind or another. After consultation with staff associations the CSIRO approached the Institute for assistance. A study is now being set up to try to compare the incidence of cancer for those workers to that in the general Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure that I have missed somewhere in the report a further development of that study or whether it is in the process of being set up. I would have thought that that kind of collaboration would have been very constructive. The idea of being able to appraise statistical analysis to try to be more accurate rather than working off a best guess is the sort of raison d'etre for just this Institute. Indeed, it is not only occurring in that area. A number of the headings here point out a whole range of studies and proposals that are being put in place. Those of us who have any interest in matters of health in the community would appreciate how important it is to have that adequate data. </PARA>
<PARA> One other point that is raised in this report that I would like to allude to briefly is described under its external programs, as reported on page 18. There is a reference there to the national perinatal statistics unit. As I was speaking to the Home Births Australia association very recently and had this matter drawn to my attention I am pleased to refer to it again today. The research studies, under the heading of this unit, deal with things like national trends in obstetrics care by obstetricians and general practitioners, look at national trends of perinatal mortality and, in collaboration with Home Births Australia, analyses data on home births and related perinatal deaths. The unit also surveys neo-natal intensive care units. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly interested in whether or not the statistics and the data collected by this unit would be user friendly. It is a point that was raised at the Home Births Australia association conference last Friday with me. One of the points raised with me was that the association wanted a breakdown hospital by hospital of obstetric practice in this country and the related statistics. It is not much good knowing that Australia has a very low neo-natal mortality rate but not knowing that one hospital has a rate that is five times that of another hospital. I sincerely hope that the data that is being collected by this unit would be available on a hospital by hospital breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports that have emerged recently include a report on New South Wales findings of hospital studies in that State and, more recently, one from Victoria. While they do provide a lot of very constructive information they do not seemingly give a hospital by hospital breakdown. For the concern and appropriate comfort of anybody involved in seeking obstetric or gynaecological care it is important that we actually have this kind of data provided on a hospital by hospital basis. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that in some ways this report, the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) report for the period  22 August 1988 to 30 June 1989 is remarkably timely. Last Monday, 14 May, the first of the Australia Prizes was presented in the Great Hall of this Parliament. One of the recipients of that prize was Professor Allan Kerr from the Waite Institute in South Australia. Indeed, on page 14 of the report there is a fairly detailed description of the work of this Committee in relation to Professor Kerr's work. </PARA>
<PARA> Reading this report should be of some comfort and consolation to people who are interested in or concerned about the release of genetically manipulated material into the environment-and serious concerns about that matter have been raised with particular pertinence to the recipients of the Australia Prize. It is not as though all of that has happened without the questions and anxieties raised by people in terms of the environmental consequences of the release of genetically altered material being dealt with. They have been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, giving an outline of the steps that were taken to test as far as possible the prospect of releasing into the environment genetically altered material, is, or ought be, of great assistance to those people who have that anxiety. It is curious to note that this report has arrived in the Senate about a week after last Wednesday's lengthy article in the Melbourne Age about just this matter and the environmental concerns in relation to the second recipient of the Australia Prize, whose name, I think, is Professor Schell in the Max Planck Institute. At the time his prize, for the changes he was attempting in petunias, was being accepted, the environmental lobby and people with great concern about this matter were actually demonstrating outside the Max Planck Institute. There was a lengthy article describing the concern in the community to the point where it was claimed the media of Germany no longer felt confident or free to report scientific matters of genetic manipulation and proper research. </PARA>
<PARA> I think they are matters of the gravest concern. First, we have to be properly alert to the consequences of releasing into the environment genetically altered material. We also have to be very concerned about the consequences of one part or other of the community being so prepared to demonstrate that, if the claim in this article is true, the press feels itself gagged in relation even to reporting scientific steps or processes. It is a matter of great importance that we do two things if there are areas of anxiety: firstly, establish a committee such as the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee to try to do the appropriate research; and, secondly, ensure that there is full and frank discussion in our media. I do not know that what was claimed in that article in the Age is true, that any restraint is practised by the German media, for example, as was cited, in reporting these matters. But if the community, and in particular our community, wants to tackle issues of the benefits, let alone the negatives, of genetically manipulated material in terms of increased productivity of food, resistant strains to diseases and so on, we cannot possibly do that if we are cornering certain groups of the community so they do not feel they can speak openly and fully about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever there is occasion for the community to act as watchdog through its institutions and media on matters scientific, then it is on these sorts of issues. I commend this report to anyone who has a concern about genetic manipulation or the release into the community of genetically manipulated material. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In general I think the report of the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee is not highly informative, although it is a good starting point, as Senator Crowley has suggested. It is obvious that, because of claims that the information is commercially sensitive and must remain confidential, the public does not have adequate access to the information which is due to it. The whole issue of the public's right to know needs to be addressed. The community must be offered a more active role in evaluating genetic engineering and determining beforehand whether to approve its products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some specific concerns about this document, related generally to the introductory section. On page 1 the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee's functions are outlined. But I believe this Committee should not only provide advice on safety procedures to researchers, institutions and government regulatory bodies but should also consult with companies. Now that genetic manipulation has moved out of the laboratory and into the marketplace, these companies should definitely be scrutinised. The institutional biosafety committee (IBC) system is weak and open to abuse. A few examples will highlight the problem. First, the IBC was not told of the unauthorised release of pigs at a joint facility run by the University of Adelaide and Metro Meat Ltd in South Australia. Example two relates to the company Bio-care Technology Pty Ltd, which has commercialised the product No-Gall. According to appendix C of the report, Bio-care has no IBC. This raises the question of who is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day work of producing the commercial product No-Gall and reporting to the GMAC as required. Example three: another problem that shows the weakness of the system is that it is usually the researchers doing the work and then seeking approval who are better informed than anyone else; therefore, their advice is essential to approval being given. This obviously creates a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of concern is the advisory system. Its major weakness is that it relies on weak sanctions and unfavourable publicity to control companies. However, when it comes to reporting accidents or intentional releases of engineered organisms the Advisory Committee does not name the company. Therefore, we question how the company can receive unfavourable publicity. For example, in the pig case, the Advisory Committee has still made no public statement, even though it has known of the incident for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to legislation, the advisory system is also questionable. The so-called responsible authorities at both the State and Federal levels have no legislation which refers to genetically engineered plants, animals or micro-organisms. In June 1989 the Victorian Law Reform Commission recommended that a national system of uniform regulation, based on new laws specifically to control genetic engineering, should be negotiated. No action has yet been taken on these recommendations. The GMAC is simply going through the motions but not doing anything concrete. The enactment of laws is of extreme urgency. When will the Advisory Committee accept the need for new laws? Then there is the question of the Advisory Committee Public Liaison Subcommittee. This Committee has never met and has no agenda for informing the public or receiving public submissions. How long will it be before this Committee is not just words on paper?</PARA>
<PARA> My remarks relate only to the introduction of this GMAC report. The whole area of genetic engineering raises many contentious issues in the community, and I am representing some of the concerns of community groups who are lobbying for the establishment of an independent public inquiry into all aspects of genetic engineering and its regulation in Australia. The inquiry would need to have the broadest possible terms of reference. The membership of the inquiry should be very diverse, with public, non-government organisations and government membership. The sources of professional advice to the inquiry must be also broadly representative. The Government, of course, plans for a parliamentary committee on industry and commerce to conduct the inquiry which, as it would set a narrow agenda, focused on the commercial potential of genetic engineering, would not be acceptable in relation the community input that is required. A parliamentary select committee may be a suitable compromise. </PARA>
<PARA> Recombinant DNA and other genetic manipulation technologies can be used to alter the basic structures of all living organisms by the transfer of genetic material between unrelated life forms. Their use could have major impacts on both the natural environment and human societies, and many of these could be harmful and irreversible. All citizens therefore have the right to be involved in deciding which applications will be rejected and which approved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak to the report of the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee but I did hear a number of comments that have been made to date and I certainly wish to add my comments to some of those. I think the difficulty in this area is that there is a significant amount of misinformation around. This Parliament has enacted legislation with regard to a number of these matters. I think that the previous speaker, Senator Crowley, indicated that there might not be any, but there is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember during a debate in this place I moved over 30 amendments to legislation-all of which were defeated, unfortunately-which would have given the public the ability to have input regarding the release of genetic material into the marketplace. The problems we had at that time related to alerting the public to the imminent release of, for example, biological control mechanisms which may be directed at controlling a particular disease or a particular agricultural product. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the public does not get involved. The public does not have to know. I think that when we are dealing with the simple release of biological organisms, whether or not they have been manipulated, the public does have a right to know. Unfortunately, the amendments that I proposed in this place were defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite a number of people have come to me-and I am sure they have approached a number of other members of parliament-asking for the very things that we should have included in the legislation when it passed this place, that is, that the public be informed in the normal way in the media, by way of advertisements, well prior to the release of any biological organism which is aimed at controlling any mechanism, whether it be agricultural or otherwise. Members of the public have an inherent right to know, even more so when there is the release, not of an organism which is naturally developed, but of one which is artificially developed. It is not a matter of fuelling paranoia or any element; it is a matter of whether in a democracy it is not inherent in the rights of individuals to have that information prior to the release of any such organism. I believe that it is. I argued for it but, unfortunately, that was not what ended up in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that when this matter is looked at by the parliamentary committee system, another look will be taken at the whole mechanism of the public's right to know. If we do not involve ordinary citizens, as distinct from the specialist and those who may have a financial or professional interest in these matters, I believe we are abrogating the rights of those ordinary citizens to be aware of what is happening in that wider sphere. I do not refer only to citizens who may have a generally disinterested position but also to many of those citizens who may have a very interested position. I have had put to me from the rural area, for example, why it is that certain organisms are allowed to be released without our knowing what is going on. I think that is a perfectly reasonable proposition for someone to put, particularly when the release of a certain organism can cause inherent damage to the agricultural product that is being put on the market. I think there should be a prior right to know, so that there can be a prior right to object. </PARA>
<PARA> There ought to be mechanisms in place which enable a citizen of this country to object to the release of an organism into the environment, particularly where that may affect them. But even if it does not affect them, I still think that they have the right to object. Objecting after the event is, of course, pointless. In almost every other area the public has a right to dispute what the Government is doing. Unfortunately, in this area, this chamber decided not to give Australians that right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to make a very brief comment on the report of the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC). I will not detain the Senate for long. I agree with a number of the things said by previous speakers. Senator Macklin referred to the fact that we, as legislators, represent the constituents who, of course, are concerned about major matters of public policy. This is a major question of public policy. I agree with Senator Vallentine-indeed, it was also implied by Senator Crowley-that this is a major matter of public policy and it should not be left to be determined by scientific elites or by commercially motivated research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need not to be paranoid, as Senator Macklin said. One way to overcome paranoia is to be quite open about things and to lay all the cards on the table, and particularly to direct knowledge. Parliamentarians have a responsibility in this area to receive information and to represent the views of their constituents. How can constituents express views if they are not fully and adequately informed. </PARA>
<PARA> The document that is before us is a very brief document on the activities of GMAC during the period 22 August 1988 to 30 June 1989. I think that it is rather too thin. There is not sufficient information in this document. Certainly, it does not contain the information that is available to the members of the Committee and I believe it should be made available to the Parliament and through the Parliament to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reference in the report as to when it was written. Normally, the introduction section of other reports that come before us contain a letter to the appropriate Minister and the date on which that letter came from the chairman of the particular institute is shown. The previous report that we considered, namely, the Australian Institute of Health report, was dated 22 December 1989. We do not know whether this report was written in December 1989 or in the first half of this year. It is unfortunate that we are now debating a report for the period 22 August 1988 to 30 June 1989. That may not be the result of any dilatoriness on the part of GMAC; it may reflect the fact that the Senate did not sit until May of this year. Nevertheless, the point that I want to make is that I have noted the membership of GMAC, and I am interested to know why two or three people are on that Committee. I am also concerned lest people on the Committee consider that these are questions which should be reserved for scientific elites. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>In this year's Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) report, I wish to address very briefly chapter 5, which deals with accountability and information access, because one of the bodies to which ASIO is accountable is the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO. The Committee was set up under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, as amended, and it began operations in 1986. The Committee has a good reputation in operating in what is a very difficult field. It must be a bipartisan committee; it must operate non-politically; and above all it must have a very responsible approach to the security information that it receives. As I said before, the Committee has operated very well over the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference under which the Committee was appointed are covered by the Act in part Va from section 92a onwards. I was therefore very concerned to read in Saturday's Courier-Mail an article reporting statements by the new chairman of the Committee, Mr Keith Wright of the electorate of Capricornia, and again in today's Townsville Bulletin two articles reporting remarks by the chairman which I believe are quite out of order. I seek leave to have these articles incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The articles read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>FEDERAL PROBE OF OLD ASIO LINKS TO SPECIAL BRANCH</PARA>
<PARA>From GLENN STANAWAY in Canberra</PARA>
<PARA>ASIO's links with Queensland's former police Special Branch will be investigated by a new joint federal parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee chairman, Queensland Labor MP Mr Keith Wright (Capricornia), said yesterday he understood the branch had given information on security matters to the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright said he accepted this was a legitimate role for the Special Branch but he wanted to investigate what files were passed on to ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA> As a former State Opposition Leader, he said he had serious reservations about the way the previous National Party State Government had used the Special Branch for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> `My personal view is the Queensland police force had been totally politicised and the Special Branch was the centrepoint of this politicisation', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> `I intend to pursue what records were passed on to ASIO and what records are still held by ASIO that are linked back to the Special Branch's sordid days. </PARA>
<PARA> `I think the Queensland people really would like the rest of the (Special Branch) story told.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Goss Government has disbanded the branch and thousands of files on the affairs of Queenslanders were destroyed just before the State election. </PARA>
<PARA> For years the branch was alleged to have been used to collect damaging information on critics and political opponents of the National Party, instead of gathering intelligence solely for police and security matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright said that despite police harassment of him and Special Branch inquiries, he was not planning any witchhunt through ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee will also resume its inquiry into the ASIO's obligations under the Archives Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act requires federal departments to release documents more than 30 years old; but many complaints had been made that ASIO had either blocked or delayed the release of documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee would also welcome community views on ASIO's operations. </PARA>
<PARA>ASIO FILES PROBED</PARA>
<PARA> Brisbane-A new Federal Government committee will investigate claims that copies of files kept by Queensland's infamous Special Branch were passed on to ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA> ASIO committee chairman Keith Wright (ALP, Capricornia) said last night that if files of non-national importance were being kept by ASIO they should be destroyed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> He said this was one of the areas to be looked into by the all-party committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright, a former Queensland ALP leader, said this would have to be done before public perception of ASIO improved. </PARA>
<PARA> He said he wanted the committee to clarify and put an end to the suspicions. </PARA>
<PARA> He said Queensland senior police officers had last year stated publicly that ASIO had accessed Special Branch files. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright said he believed files were passed on long before any decision to destroy them was made. </PARA>
<PARA> `This committee wants to put an end to this chapter in ASIO's history, and if files not in the national interest do exist they should be destroyed', he said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I have not had time to read these articles but I will highlight some of the key points in them. The opening article in the Courier-Mail says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ASIO's links with Queensland's former police Special Branch will be investigated by a new joint federal parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on it quotes Mr Wright as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I intend to pursue what records were passed on to ASIO and what records are still held by ASIO that are linked back to the Special Branch's sordid days. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Townsville Bulletin this morning under the heading `ASIO files probed' the statement is:</PARA>
<PARA> ASIO committee chairman Keith Wright (ALP, Capricornia) said last night that if files of non-national importance were being kept by ASIO they should be destroyed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> He said this was one of the areas to be looked into by the all-party committee. </PARA>
<PARA>For Mr Wright's information it is not given to him or any member of the Committee to select the terms of reference for any inquiry of the Committee. The Act is very specific in that. Section 92c subsections (2) (a) and (b) onwards deal quite explicitly with the fact that the Committee can deal only with matters referred to it either by the Minister-who is the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy)-or by either House of the Parliament. It is not possible for an individual to pursue any personal vendettas or interest as a subject of inquiry of the Committee and it is absolutely improper for the Committee chairman to so propose. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it is not possible for the Committee to make public any of the findings of its reports. That again is defined in section 92n of the Act. It is not possible, as Mr Wright claims, to inquire into these matters and make them public. As a member of that Committee, I am quite alarmed that Mr Wright, who is a well-known publicist of emotional issues that appeal to the lowest common denominators in the community, should take it upon himself as chairman of one of the very important committees of this Parliament to go public to pursue what is simply a personal vendetta against the former Queensland Government. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few remaining minutes of this debate I want to express how disturbed I am by aspects of this report of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation which brings to the attention of the Parliament the fact that in the last year ASIO has detected higher levels of representation and activity by some hostile foreign intelligence services than was previously known. Honourable senators should bear in mind that last year's annual report brought to our attention the fact that ASIO was observing some 50 agents within this country. It appears that the number has now increased, although we do not know to what number. It also brings to our attention `a trend towards more violent activity in the activities of domestic racist groups' and `an illicit attempt by a member of a terrorist group to be granted resident status in Australia'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These findings, as I say, are of considerable concern to us in a country that has had a history largely devoid, I am pleased to say, of politically motivated violence. But when we read here of the efforts that were made by one person, a member of one of the most dangerous currently active terrorist groups, seeking to get into this country through a marriage whilst he was already married to another-so obviously coming illicitly into this country-one must be worried and ask what the ultimate consequences of this are. </PARA>
<PARA> The ASIO report brings to our attention the danger of letting down our guard whilst recognising that there is less stress and tension within the world. But whilst that might well be the case, ethnic conflicts are increasing. I remind the House that the thaw that is occurring in eastern Europe certainly has not reached this end of the world. The bottom line of all that is, as I said, a need to keep the guard up and in ASIO's terms, as it says to us in this report, the likely future demand for a significant additional funding in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> People in Australia do not always adequately appreciate the work that ASIO does in helping secure our way of life in this country and I draw the attention of this report to the Parliament for serious debate at some appropriate time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the Senate for lunch I was pointing out the vital importance of fixing up the infrastructure in Australia so that we can get ourselves out of this economic mess which the Government has, largely by its own efforts, got us into despite the fact that some Ministers in this Government are pretending that there is no problem. I think most Australians have seen the headlines in today's papers. An article under the heading `Banks rule out soft landing', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two of Australia's top bankers yesterday contradicted predictions of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, of an economic soft landing, claiming that the economy was already technically in recession and that tough times lay ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review, for example, had as its page one lead last week the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Mr Keating, is fighting a battle with his own senior colleagues to maintain the credibility of his claims that the economy is undergoing only a moderate slowdown as it adjusts to export-driven growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we all saw the headings last week such as, `Button says Labor must try harder' and `Button paints blacker picture of economy than Treasurer'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the only way to get ourselves out of the mess is to start off on the policy that the Opposition has been pressing this Government on for years, that is, fixing up the infrastructure, the wharves and the other things that not only add enormous costs to Australia's exports and price us out of markets but also delay those exports and which, as a result of ludicrous go-slow tactics and, in some instances, massive overmanning, create continual problems for our exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now becoming accepted that what the Opposition has been saying for years is right. For example, last month Ross Gittins, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to our intractable inflation problem lies as much in micro-economic reform as in better macro management. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We need micro reform to achieve higher productivity, increased international competitiveness, higher savings, more exports and fewer imports. </PARA>
<PARA> But that's only half the story. We need micro reform to make our economy less inflation prone. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very area in which this Government is not performing. It is the very area in which Senator Button said that the Government had failed to deliver and had missed opportunities. Of course, that is absolutely correct. The last report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) for last year says it all very clearly. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Altogether, sustained real GDP gains-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, growth in our economy-</PARA>
<PARA>of almost 5 per cent, or just $16 billion a year . . . are projected to flow through in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA>These gains will come from the sorts of micro-economic reform that it recommends, namely, transport, communications, electricity supply and assistance to agriculture and manufacturing. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> These gains accrue from improved productivity, increased competition and better domestic pricing policies. </PARA>
<PARA>This IAC report is absolutely damning of the Government's failure to act. For example, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the removal of major inefficiencies in domestic water transport, international liner shipping, the transport and handling of bulk commodities, domestic and international aviation, road and rail transport could collectively increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by about $9 billion annually. Improved efficiency in the postal, telecommunications and electricity sectors could provide a further stimulus to GDP of around $3 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . assistance to the passenger motor vehicle and textiles, clothing and footwear industries-</PARA>
<PARA>this is Senator Button's area in which Mr Keating says that he is working too slowly-</PARA>
<PARA>continues to impose major costs on the community. If manufacturing and agricultural assistance which will exist in the mid-1990s at the end of the current program of reductions were removed, GDP would increase by nearly $4 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly an urgent need for Australia to go down this track at a faster pace than this Government has managed to. As the IAC report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The efficiency gains from opening up currently protected sectors of the economy to competition depend in large measure on improvements in the productivity of labour in those sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that that is why the Opposition's labour programs, labour policies and industrial relations policies are absolutely vital for the achievement of any kind of real and lasting economic recovery. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Overmanning, restrictive and inflexible work practices and inefficient union structures would be more difficult to sustain in a more competitive market environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The IAC report states:</PARA>
<PARA> These constraints must be addressed if the benefits of microeconomic reform are to be fully realised. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the report says that a start has been made in this area, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, management, unions and government face a major challenge if they are to achieve the labour market flexibility necessary when currently protected areas of the economy are opened to competition. </PARA>
<PARA>It is almost as if the Opposition had written this report. It is a shame that the Government has not taken nearly enough notice of it. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> By highlighting the costs to the community of inefficient arrangements, independent public inquiry can provide an impetus for necessary change. </PARA>
<PARA>We hope that this Government will take notice of what the Opposition has been saying. But, this is the problem. The IAC says:</PARA>
<PARA>A commitment from all levels of government is therefore essential if the benefits of microeconomic reform are to be maximised. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no commitment from all levels of government, not even from within this Government, to this absolutely vital need for reform of our basic disaster areas. As we have seen, Mr Keating thinks that Senator Button has not done enough, Senator Button blames others and there is a lot of finger pointing all round. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), whose area includes the wharves, is, as I mentioned before the break, already finding excuses for why he has not achieved enough in this area and why he will not achieve much. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, by the look of things the Government has some kind of solution to it all. Honourable senators will have noticed in the newspapers recently that a lot of concentration is being placed on the enormous increase in activity among accountancy and legal firms relating to receiverships and bankruptcies that are now inundating so many Australian companies. There is, in fact, a boom going on in Australia and it is a boom in liquidation. One has only to look in the newspapers at the lists of items being auctioned, at the for sale notices, which are the result of people being forced off their land or out of their businesses, to see where the boom is. It is almost as if this huge increase in business for accountants and lawyers reveals the Government's solution to our problems. It is a receivership-led recovery; it is the only booming part of the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend says, it is very good for some accountants. But many other accountants are having to spend a lot of time advising people, who they know will not be able to pay their bills, on how to cope with the disastrous high interest rates and the credit disaster that they and so many people in Australia now face because they are being forced out of business as a result of deliberate Government policy to dampen down demand through massive high interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost of this bankruptcy to Australia is quite appalling. For example, the Australian Financial Review  of today deals with a story which is headed, `Forced property sales top $3 billion and squeeze prices'. So here we have clear indications of assets being reduced in value. Australians, many of whom have struggled to pay for their home, are now finding that, for the first time, home prices are falling as a result of this Government's deliberate polices. Consequently, their asset against which they have borrowed, is becoming less and less valuable. Of course, this same thing is happening to so many people on the land. An article which appeared the other day in the Sydney Morning Herald reported:</PARA>
<PARA>Corporate collapses could cost the Australian economy up to $10 billion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Not only the Sydney Morning Herald is saying that; it is also according to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). The Sunday Age of a couple of months ago reported that:</PARA>
<PARA> 10,000 companies have gone to the wall since Christmas. Bob Ansett-</PARA>
<PARA>who I suppose knows all about that-</PARA>
<PARA>says there must be a better way. </PARA>
<PARA>A report, I think last week, in one of the newspapers stated that the sheer weight of liquidations and receiverships is up from 4,836 businesses in 1987-88 to 6,189 in 1988-89 and is expected to top 10,000 in the year ending 30 June-more than double what it was only two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have this dreadful situation of a government that has brought about this kind of disaster by its concentration on the wrong policies. It is a government that cannot even agree within itself about what sort of policies it should be following. It cannot agree on microeconomic reform policies, tough fiscal policies, whether the clear things that this Opposition has been saying should be done to the economy should proceed, or whether the Government should continue in chaos. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I look forward to the challenge and privilege of serving my State in the Senate, to serve in my third tier of government at a time when Australia is a fragmented and nervous nation. The electorate at large is searching for a national identity and a feeling of unity to be able to go forward to security. It is surely our duty as politicians to work to satisfy those needs with guidance and with vision. But, as recent State and Federal elections have shown us, the people of Australia feel politicians are more concerned about themselves and with winning and keep power than with the good of our country. The people believe they have been let down. They have been promised the world, but they have been delivered lower living standards. That is hardly surprising in a climate where our Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating) owns a unique dictionary which describes acute pain as effervescence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government contracts have been awarded to States and cities where political gain, not people gain, is the criteria. In a time of acute debt problems, when small business is struggling with high interest rates, Federal Cabinet has cynically spent millions of dollars to rescue Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, not as a business decision, but as a purely political decision to shore up Labor's tumbling stocks in Victoria. Is it any wonder, therefore, that we have a disillusioned and confused electorate?</PARA>
<PARA> But neither major party has anything to be proud of from the results of 24 March. I firmly believe that the people of Australia are looking for a government of broad vision and balanced judgment to rescue them from the economic trough into which we have sunk. Labor has shown the world that it cannot do it, but has been returned to power by default because, as Liberals, we were not able to show on 24 March that we should be given the opportunity to do it. We must work to repair that view if Australians are to have the government they deserve, a government which will go forward with one united Australia, making decisions for the good of one nation and its people, not decisions based on holding on to individual seats for party power, as has been clearly illustrated in the past few years. We need to prove to Australians that politicians are indeed working for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to use my time in Canberra to work towards some fundamental changes-changes that I hope in time should help to deliver a feeling of national unity in working together towards both social and economic goals. They are changes that in time may rekindle a feeling of trust in the work politicians can do. </PARA>
<PARA> As a small businessman, it was the excesses of the Dunstan and Whitlam era that galvanised my determination to be part of the political process and influence policy direction. Mr President, that determination is undiminished. In 1985, as leader of my Party in South Australia, I put privatisation on the agenda. It is a policy as relevant today as it was then. The only variation is that it has become more urgent in the restructuring of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that vested interest or pressure groups have interfered with the deregulation of our financial and labour markets. Despite John Howard's best endeavours, the last Liberal Government did not deregulate the financial market. After initially opposing the move, to its credit, Labor finally did. But it only did half the job. It has refused to deregulate the labour market because of interest groups, and particularly the union movement, applying pressure to the Labor Party in government. It will take a Liberal Government to balance that equation. </PARA>
<PARA> My view has always been that the basic responsibility of government is to help create an environment which is conducive to change, to innovation, to investment, to increased productivity, and to better dialogue between employers and employees where freedom and incentive are the basics. Again, put simply, it should be a government of broad vision and balanced judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I come from a State which suffers because that kind of government is not being delivered either on a State or a Federal level. It is a great State, as many of us today in this chamber can attest to, but it could be a much greater State if Australia were governed for the good of one nation-if Labor here in Canberra would stop making industrial and economic decisions based solely on keeping pockets of voters happy for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> A good example of misplaced Federal attention affecting South Australia is the Government's disinterest in the Murray-Darling. It is not a sexy subject for the media, nor is it seen as green vote catching by Labor's environmental gurus. While the green vote is being chased through Kakadu and Tasmania, through rain- forests and pulp mills, the heart of Australia is being left to die. Its main artery is clogged with the salinity and pollution of the States through which it passes, with my State of South Australia, in consequence, condemned by a political inertia to being in effect the sewer of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Murray-Darling is worth a staggering $10,000m a year to the economy of our nation. Despite this, its condition has been allowed to deteriorate so much that it has become an environmental disgrace which needs $100m annually spent on it for the next 10 years to rectify its salinity problems. If this valuable resource is not rescued now, it could be too late. With Labor at the helm, it may well be. Where is the unity, and the one Australia identity and commitment to solving a national environmental problem? It is absent, while the Federal Government delivers cosmetic surgery to environmental problems which provide short-term votes and gain media coverage through picture opportunities. Through the Senate, I want to spend some of my time working towards the clean-up of the Murray-Darling. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, I am a strong advocate of States rights and will fight for their retention wherever necessary. However, my years as Liberal leader in South Australia showed me that States rights can no longer be used as an excuse for the fragmentation and duplication of the legislation we see in so many areas across Australia. We have gone forward but we have happened rather than evolved logically. Government is causing enormous problems to small and big business alike, and families who regularly change States have been battling with social hassles that are of the Yes, Minister legislative variety. It has been estimated that in the past 20 years, Federal and State Parliaments have passed more than 17,000 Acts, 36,000 regulations, and over 30,000 statutory instruments-many of them unnecessary duplications. We have fragmented, confused and over-governed our nation. Have we really forgotten that whilst we are big geographically we have a small population base?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to unify and simplify. Can we really excuse, for example, with a population such as ours, having the fundamentals and education systems vastly different in each State-where one can have a South Australian five-year-old who has been to school, can read and write, locked out of school in Queensland until he is over six; or send a NSW junior pupil to South Australia and find she is a year behind in some lessons of a completely different structure and years ahead in others? What do we do with a Victorian senior pupil whose family moves to Adelaide to find the years at senior school are five, not six, and the courses and matriculation so different? When we drive through different States in a day should we really have different speed limits and rules? These issues need full and frank debate not in isolation but in cooperation, with the Commonwealth being the catalyst. From the Senate I hope to work towards making Australia a country free of some of that bureaucratic nightmare of different rules and regulations that is stifling and inhibiting free enterprise in this country. That is not taking away States rights. It is saying, `We are one country; let us be one country'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate I also hope to work towards paring down costly Federal and State duplication in the big spending areas of health, education and housing. We can no longer afford to have massive Federal and State government departments undertaking basically the same work. It is a vital issue and surely we are old enough and mature enough to accept that we ought to tackle the issue. Bureaucratic duplication must be reviewed. Doing so will provide much greater efficiency in the delivery of such services. Instead of having governments anxious to maintain and extend their spheres of responsibilities, we must have a comprehensive and cooperative attempt to eliminate administrative duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> We must be one Australia. We must be one nation. That does not mean listening to scare tactics which talk about grabbing all power to a central source based in Canberra; it is a two-way street. It means deciding on the right tier of government for the appropriate service delivery. The end result has to be a better country for all Australians. It means Canberra and the States working together to identify those areas of cost-cutting. We are living in times when politicians are constantly urging electors to tighten their belts. In many instances the States have, but the Commonwealth has not, by example, tightened its belt to the same extent that it has expected and required the States to tighten theirs. We know that Australians are tired of being overgoverned, so we need to be sensible enough to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> As we go forward thinking of one Australia, we should be able to deal with the problem population pockets in the eastern States, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. South Australia is one State which would benefit greatly from an increased population. It would benefit from economic decentralisation also. We have country towns and cities ripe for an injection of new blood. We have country towns and cities able to sustain new industry and being able to meet its infrastructure needs. But we have neither people growth nor industry growth. We need government strong enough to commit, to breaking down the monopoly of the eastern States. That area of economic decentralisation is one I want to follow during my time in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also work towards changes which must be made to ensure a strong and understandable immigration policy. It is my view that South Australia suffers because today it receives just one-third of the share of immigrants that it welcomed 25 years ago. It receives just 4.1 per cent of new immigrants, half of what it should, on a per capita basis. Yet many politicians sit back and wonder at increasing resentment towards immigrants in the already overpopulated cities. How can we wonder when the problem has been created by a lack of broad vision and balanced judgment? Would we have such resentment if the families we welcomed to Australia had been spread more evenly across our nation? We took the easy way out, usually leaving those who wanted to head for our main cities of Sydney and Melbourne, where they claimed friends and distant relatives. That way, without any far-reaching structure for assimilation, we left them to sink or swim with other migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The result in some instances has been enclaves and certainly resentment. Is that any way to welcome immigrants, to make immigrants feel Australian or to make Australians realise the long-term benefits of our immigration policy? To me, it sounds exactly the way to go for flashpoint confrontation. In the Senate I hope to work towards a fairer share of migrants for each State so that it is looked on as a national economic project rather than a State problem. At the same time as I am an advocate of a healthy immigration policy and believe that our 140,000 a year figure ought to be maintained, I also believe that, if we are to aim for a national identity for one Australia, changes need to be made, not to numbers but to methods and as much for the people yet to arrive as those who are already here. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to now admit that in accepting the tag of a multicultural society we have to a certain degree lost the feeling in the soul of being Australian. That has nothing to do with race or creed; it has a lot to do with saying, `welcome, we are pleased you have come to be part of Australia'. We have left it at that-full stop. We should have gone and we need to go much further. I see it as imperative for the future, if we are all to work together in trust and without fear, that immigrants should become Australian citizens. That is something I hope to work towards achieving. I also believe that for the sake of future generations born in Australia English should be compulsory for immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to build that love of a nation, that patriotism that the United States of America did so successfully from such a diverse group of migrants. It is abundantly clear that so far we have not managed that. It seems logical that those who wish to be part of us need to be seen to be giving of themselves as we work together for the future prosperity of our country. They can make that commitment by becoming citizens. If Australia is the country in which to build one's family and future, it is time to show willing to become true Australians. It means a change in psychological commitment. It is not a case of ignoring the individual customs of each country which have woven such a rich fabric through the Australian way of life and our country. These customs make us a true multicultural society and are to be admired and encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrants are isolated through language difficulties and enclaves because we have no decentralisation policy. So they are literally dumped where they can afford to fall. That should be neither admired not encouraged. I intend to push forward saying, `Let us not forget the future of one's birthland or the culture of one's birthland but let us also be one Australia; let us work together as Australians, not as Scots, not as Greeks, not as Vietnamese who happen to be paying the same taxes in the one country'. I am also saying, `Let us have the courage to debate the immigration issues now without fear of being labelled racist or bigoted and before they reach a flashpoint where the wrong decisions may well be taken'. </PARA>
<PARA> While it may be true that we have never at any time had the majority of Australians in favour of immigration policy, perhaps we need to recognise that such policies may never have been explained properly. Ignorance breeds fear. So it is surely government's duty to explain so that knowledge, not ignorance, can be the basis for debate. I have a belief that a healthy immigration policy and a healthy economy go together. Our immigration methods so far, like those which have left us with a fragmented and duplicated legislation, have happened rather than evolved. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to my years in Canberra. I look forward to being able to make a positive contribution to this Senate and to the Parliament of Australia. If, in my time in the Senate, I can work towards a fairer distribution of government contracts in Australia, the removal, fragmentation and duplication in our legislation, the revival of the Murray-Darling, and the need for decentralisation of our population, and am also able to help keep alive my belief in a strong and considered immigration policy, I will feel that I will be doing what I was nominated to do here: that is, to work for the benefit of Australia, and South Australia in particular. I hope that I can help achieve the government Australia so badly wants and needs-one of broad vision and balanced judgment-so that we can go forward to economic prosperity, growth with style and, above all else, do so with compassion and harmony in Australia. </PARA>

The last time I did so was after Senator Vanstone's maiden speech and, as she had ceased being a maiden when she sat down, I felt that she was fair game for contribution from my side. I draw the Senate's attention to some of Senator Olsen's remarks. As they were made in a maiden speech, we listened with dignity, but I certainly take issue with him on some points. However, we congratulate him and welcome him into this place and will keep him on his toes on behalf of South Australia. In terms of economy decentralisation, I am sure that Senator Olsen would want to support the Government's decision to place the submarine project in South Australia-an excellent example of decentralisation to the benefit of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Puplick. I thought it would get a cheer from somewhere. As for the Murray-Darling River, the Government is addressing that issue. In fact, it is a fine and famous South Australian as far as I am concerned, the past member but one for Hawker, Ralph Jacobi, one of those South Australians who endlessly pushed for a change in approach to the Murray River and now for the new Murray-Darling Basin Commission to incorporate both complex river systems and deal with the problems confronting people living along them. Those of us in South Australia know full well the contribution of our New South Welsh and Victorian colleagues because we get to drink it. Fortunately they filter it, but nobody living in South Australia is unaware of the importance of clean, good water because we do not have it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Water is a challenge for our State and is the prime concern of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. There is also the salinity problem and the problems of the death of growth either side of the river, the complexity of farming and the chemicals needed to maintain growth and produce. The new Murray-Darling Basin Commission is taking into account the importance of native vegetation and revegetation along those river complexes. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that we have a long way to go to understand water in Australia. We still do not understand what made it rain this year and not last year, nor yet what makes the rain fall where it does. For those of us who live in South Australia, the driest State in the driest continent, water is something we certainly think about. </PARA>
<PARA> The points that Senator Olsen raised are well worth our deliberation. No doubt from time to time we will remind him of what he has said-particularly all that stuff about duplication in appropriate arms of government in regard to doing things. I guess that is the nature of the sport here. One would also say, no doubt, that Senator Olsen is well placed to observe Federal and State differences. We will not say this today, but in the future we may well say, `But did you not in South Australia?'-and he can take it from there. </PARA>
<PARA> In my speech today I want to make a few comments under three headings and pick up on the challenge spelt out for us by the Labor Party during the election campaign and by the Governor-General in the Speech he made in this place-the challenge this country faces. That challenge has been spelt out in the Governor-General's Speech in terms of program and priority ordering of Government initiatives for the current term. In particular, the Governor-General-if not the Governor-General then certainly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-alluded to the importance of this society moving from seeing itself as a lucky country to becoming a clever country. I will use that heading to talk a little about the importance of the Government's education policies to this point, in particular its concerns in the area of science. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I elaborate, however, I want to highlight what we mean by a clever country or what we must mean. We have to make sure that when we say `clever' country we mean wise country. It is not sufficient to have people with lots of qualifications but no perspective on what those qualifications are for, nor what they address. Any country that is clever but that fails to be caring is in danger of being no better than just a lucky country. By using the words `clever country' we are talking about taking a sense of direction for our own people rather than just benefiting from the good luck that has befallen us to this point. It is very important that the people of Australia appreciate their responsibility for the control, management and care of this country. In particular, it must have care for its people. It is not very clever to be uncaring or to disregard consequences. We have come to that time in our history when the things this community has done over the last 150 to 200 years can no longer be conveniently ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> One area that we must face-and I think we are facing it-is the massive disregard for, indeed the acts of cruelty practised on, Aboriginal people. If ever there is a shame this country has to admit, it is that. That is not part of a clever or lucky or wise or caring country. I am pleased to be part of a government that will not tolerate that kind of treatment, abuse or ignorance of its Aboriginal people any more. </PARA>
<PARA> Our community still has to come to terms with what we mean by science and what our attitude is to science. We are in two minds about it. We appreciate very much that science is the solution. Science is clever, to be admired, to be appreciated and to be paid for. But at the same time many of us, indeed most of us in the chamber, can say, `But science has also caused the problems'. So we have a great degree of scepticism or suspicion about things scientific. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about the importance of using science to address the problems of environmental pollution; but the greatest pollution this world has known in nuclear weapons. They are clearly the creation of science-perhaps the ill-direction of the achievements of science. But there is no doubt that it is the scientists of this world who have created these things for us, and to this point they have not been asked sufficiently to address the consequences of some of those scientific decisions. We have also seen the benefits and now the enormously damaging consequences of the industrial revolution-the smokestacks and the polluted water; the dirty air and the poisoned ground. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested that Senator Michael Baume has interjected in that way. No country can be complacent. There is no virtue in saying that we are cleaner than them, when we are filthy. There is no point in saying that they are dirtier than us-that the Eastern bloc is filthy. It was not the Eastern bloc that poisoned the Great Lakes in North America; it did not bring that pollution on us. It was not the Eastern bloc that had to pay for cleaning up the Thames River, which was polluted over many years. We know who did it. There is no point in Senator Baume attempting that cheap point scoring. He highlights just one of the problems. Senator Olsen was just asking for a bipartisan, bilateral approach to these things. Senator Baume has just shown that his mind is not directed in that way. There is no virtue in working out that we are less evil or more wholesome. What we have to do is define the problems, and the problems are very large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problems have been created by science and now will be solved by science-at least by the wise application of things. But again, we have to be cautious in what we are talking about. We need to be clearer in our definitions. I believe this community is still a little puzzled about what is meant by science-whether it is a good thing or a thing to be suspicious of. That debate is still ahead of us. It requires extensive community education and clear definitions. It also needs to look at the place of science in the scheme of things. For example, I find it very disappointing that if we talk science we are in danger of talking anti-art-that we have a separation of things scientific and things artistic. I do not believe that distinction is valid or useful. Certainly, it is something that we should cease to promote. The breaking off in our thinking of things scientific from things artistic-of things that are human and compassionate and caring-creates precisely the sorts of difficulties that have led to some of the problems we now confront. </PARA>
<PARA> I highlight this because of a recent visit to the National Science and Technology Centre, a place of sheer joy and delight. Anybody who walks in finds him or herself caught up in the excitement and interest of finding out about all sorts of things that go on in our community and, in a way that makes the scientific principles, the mathematical principles, underpinning that very accessible. It also highlights the excitement of knowledge for almost anybody who has the opportunity to meet it. Indeed, I hope that our educational system will continue to develop the sense of wonder and excitement in finding out about things. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly strongly endorse the intention and the practice of the National Science and Technology Centre. I think that encouragement for our young people, let alone our old people, to appreciate science and mathematics has to be put into this debate about where science is in our world, what it can do for us and, at same time, the excitement of science also has to be qualified by its appropriate use. We cannot go on totally believing in science or totally opposing it. I believe we have to pick up on the benefits and the excitement of things scientific and develop that into a constructive debate in our community over the next number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that science brings to mind is the endless discussion about how women are not able to do science. In times past they were defined as not having sufficient or appropriate brains. I probably have not put on the record in the Senate-but I have certainly said it in many other places-that the opposition to women studying or getting to learn at all has been a battle that women have fought over the last couple of hundred years. In Victoria in the late nineteenth century very senior men in the community argued that if women went to university their uteruses would shrivel. That is a matter of the utter nonsense. I do not think Senator Newman or I would like to paraphrase that or even turn it around. We would be laughed out of school for suggesting such a crazy thought. Yet that is the kind of attitude that women have had to contend with in claiming their place in educational institutions and their opportunity to learn and be educated in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I think the struggle still goes on. It is partly emphasised by the claim at the moment-it is still very current that girls are not good enough to do maths and science, they do not really have the right approach, and they do not think in a logical and coherent way. I urge honourable senators who are faintly of that view to go to the National Science and Technology Centre and visit the mathematical room. They will notice huge posters on the wall highlighting famous mathematicians down time. Every second poster features women who have made great contributions to mathematics over the centuries. The interesting thing is that women have made contributions but they are not acknowledged in our history books, classrooms, or in our public forums. It is time we actually pull those names out into the public arena and make sure that they become as much household names as any of the men who have contributed to mathematics. I will resist the temptation to cite some names because I do not think I can remember all of them, but I urge people who have the view that women are not good enough to have a look at their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the Senate's attention to two women in science organisations that I know about, one is Wisnet, Women in Science Network and the other is WIMS, Women in Medical Science. Both of those organisations have a huge number of very qualified women at all sorts of levels of scientific endeavour and yet they are still not publicly known or acknowledged and their talents are not drawn upon quite often. I think we know that women are able. We have to appreciate that still more encouragement should be given to our girls in primary and secondary schools to take up scientific and mathematical careers if they have the slightest interest in them. I suspect that, left to themselves, many young girls will follow those careers. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, and by way of justification for this case, I recently attended the mathematical and computer science prize night at the University of Adelaide. I went partly because one of the prize winners was one of my sons, but I was also delighted to note that 50 per cent of the prizes that night in computing and mathematics went to girls. They were achieving at the highest level in all four years of undergraduate mathematics and computer science and in the honours years. We do have that ability amongst our young girls, as well as our young men. I think that in encouraging further participation in science for our girls we will see a new and extending contribution to the scientific debate into the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> From speaking about girls and science I am pleased to move to the media and the media images of our society as presented to us, particularly in terms of shaping our view of ourselves. Senator Newman is quoted as saying in Portfolio magazine in November last year that she thought in times of economic constraint it was not appropriate to be funding women in sport or worrying about how the media portrayed women. I strongly take issue with Senator Newman on both of those points. If she wanted to argue that sports expenditure was not appropriate at this time, why not cut back funding for both men and women in sport; why pick out women's sport? I think that is a quite inappropriate action and is totally unjustified. Who has won more gold medals for this country? The answer, of course, is women. So women's contribution in sport is absolutely splendid and until recently they had not enjoyed adequate funding or media coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the media portrayal of women, I think it is absolutely vital that we continue to argue for a fair, reasonable and proper reflection in our media of all the capacities, abilities, and achievements of our women. As the Senate knows, I have certainly fought for a fair representation of women in the media in the area of sport-I have fought in other areas as well-and I know and appreciate the trivialisation, let alone the insufficiency, of the coverage of women in sport. Lest any honourable senator doubt that, I refer them to the recent Stuart Littlemore Media Watch program. He ran my argument very splendidly with wonderful pictures pointing out that if members of the media still want to cover women in sport they can do that only by trivialising or making a joke of it. The media portrayal of our society is very important; the media portrayal of our women is equally as important. If we are to understand the sort of society we live in, and if we do want to advance and understand what it means to be a clever, comparing, compassionate society, we have to ask the media to begin to reflect a whole range of images and not a limited or insufficient selection of them. </PARA>
<PARA> While flying the other day, I read a very interesting interview in The Australian Way, a magazine of Australian Airlines Ltd, with Sister Veronica Brady. Many honourable senators would know that she is a lecturer in English at the University of Western Australia. She is also on the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Many of us have been interested to hear or read her views over the years. She is a thoughtful, provocative and splendidly challenging person. She has an extensive view of what society means when it talks about itself, what it means to reflect on society, what sorts of values and attitudes a compassionate society would hold up and what sorts of views Australians would say they were proud of in talking about themselves. I commend this article to people to read. It is a very nifty little summary and has some very useful views. In particular, I was interested in the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA> In the Brady view, Australia's self-perception is shaped by the media. And therein lies the greatest difficulty in bringing about change. </PARA>
<PARA> `The media monopoly in Australia is profoundly disturbing', she argues. `Since there are only two or three sources, we are told whatever they want us to know'. </PARA>
<PARA> The result, says Veronica Brady, is an Australia which sees the outside world through American-European eyes and which is astonishingly ignorant of its own culture and the injustices on its own doorstep. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to pick up all those points, but I do take the point that Australia's self-perception is very significantly shaped by the media. Indeed, we have to make sure that we keep an eye on the media so that it presents an ever-extending view of Australia's range of talents, the issues that Australians want to raise, and the sorts of people Australia is home to. We should be looking for diversity and a recognition of our range of talents and skills. We should be asking the media to reflect those aspects of Australia, to pick up on the proposals for Labor's fourth term which are contained in the Governor-General's Speech and to indicate what sort of country we are and will become. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight some of the Government's policy commitments in the Speech, particularly those relating to women, not just because women are a separate category but because in the past women have been talked about so little that they are not yet adequately reflected in the media's image of Australia or, indeed, in Australia's understanding of itself. The Prime Minister said in another place-I can only paraphrase him-that any country that ignores or overlooks 51 per cent of its people's intelligence, imagination and energy is taking a very big risk and is certainly being very wasteful. Our Government is no longer prepared to do that. With the national agenda for women and particular policies about women, those women with talent, energy, initiative and imagination are being given the opportunity to take their place in the mainstream of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies for women come under two headings-the ones that benefit women generally and the ones that specifically benefit women. Quite clearly, the economic policies of this Government, which have brought about a dramatic increase in employment, have been of great benefit to women. More than 50 per cent of those jobs have gone to women, and for the first time there is a more than 50 per cent participation rate by women in the labour force. The number of women in our tertiary institutions has risen to 50 per cent plus. We have seen the benefits to society of that unlocking of talent and opportunity. Certainly we see the benefits to women, who in a different way now feel responsible and responsive to their community. I appreciate too the importance of child-care in the Government's strategy for economic restructuring and for rights and opportunities for women. Indeed, the child-care program spoken of in the Governor-General's Speech is a very significant extra development and commitment to the child-care policy that was put in place in the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The extra 50,000 community child-care places to be provided by 1995-96 over and above the commitment of 30,000 in last year's Budget certainly makes absolutely clear, beyond any doubt, the Government's commitment to child-care: all this because of its appreciation of the importance of accessible, affordable quality child-care as being critical to families, and in particular women, who want to exercise their opportunities to study, to work and to do a whole variety of things that previously they were not able to do without that child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also proposed an extension of fee relief to private child-care centres. This will bring on stream a significant increase in the number of places for people who are still looking for access to child-care. Associated with the extension of fee relief will be the requirement for accreditation of all child-care centres so that we can be sure that all child-care places meet minimum standards of adequacy and quality. This is absolutely critical and something those of us on the Government side have been insistent about since child-care first got on to the political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to talk about some of the items specific to women, particularly the ratification of the International Labour Organisation Convention 156 relating to workers with family responsibilities. Quite clearly, that is not limited to women, but it has significant relevance to women in the work force. We appreciate the ratification of this convention as it relates to the rights of workers in the work place and access to child-care. It is interesting that the other day Senator Cook answered a question from Senator Zakharov spelling out just how that is being developed and what further steps will be taken to ensure that Australia conforms to the intent of that convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also concerned about and committed to extending our national school curriculum-partly to deal with points raised by Senator Olsen, though he has not been the first to raise them-so that there is some understanding of the relevance of five-year-olds, 10-year-olds or 16-year-olds moving across State borders. I and my colleagues-Senator Zakharov being one who is in this place at the moment-have put this matter on our education agenda on a number of occasions. Indeed, they are issues that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has already addressed and will continue to address. As well, we have argued that any educational curriculum has to be expanded to make it particularly relevant to girls and young women. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also highlighted the total unacceptability of domestic violence. But we have some years to go before society changes its view in large enough numbers so that domestic violence becomes totally unacceptable. Indeed, it is Senator Tate, who is in the chamber at the moment, who is responsible for overseeing the inquiry into violence. This inquiry has taken its own course and gone places that some proposing it were not expecting it to go. It is a remarkable examination of a dimension of our society that perhaps we have not wanted to face up to in times past. Despite changes there are many places where violence occurs more frequently than anyone finds acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into violence in sport took many people by surprise. They were quite shocked that the inquiry looked at sport. We have seen some very bizarre and some very reasonable arguments about the importance of what sport reflects. This particularly relates to my earlier point about the metaphors, its symbolism in our society. Sport is a very important ingredient in how a society sees itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, that inquiry into violence has challenged our sport to see just how violent it has been-if not now, at least in the past-and to make sure it continues to reduce the gratuitous violence in sport and to appreciate that it is no longer an acceptable attitude or standard in our society. Much more has to be done in changing attitudes about domestic violence. Though a number of us would argue that it is totally unacceptable, surveys still show that while attitudes are changing we have a long way to go before we can expect that society regards domestic violence with total abhorrence. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the benefits of science. Last week I spoke to Home Births Australia. I was interested to be reminded that there are places where science really ought to advance very slowly. We have actually turned something as normal and as natural as childbirth into a highly medical and technological event, which is contrary to what most pregnant women find appropriate. Indeed, there have been some quite worrying statistics about the number of medical interventions in the childbirth process. These were reported in a New South Wales Government inquiry last year. While we should look at where science in Australia is going, we should not forget to take with us those things that are of benefit and which have been tested over time. Whether they are traditional, whether they are family inheritances, whether they are tried and tested methods and schemes, whether they are ways of presenting challenges, treatments or managements to the next generation, we must make sure that we do not sell our souls to technology but try to incorporate the best of both worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that further analysis of statistics will help people in the childbirth area to return childbirth to those who manage it best-the mothers. We appreciate the assistance of medical technology-preferably, though, only when it is needed, not as a matter of course. I look forward to this term in government to see implemented not only these ideas but also the full program of reform as outlined by the Governor-General. </PARA>

During her speech Senator Crowley purported to paraphrase from an interview which I gave last year with Portfolio magazine in which she gave us to understand that I said that in difficult economic times the Government should not be spending money on women's sport or on the portrayal of women in advertising. She gave the impression that I was being discriminatory vis-a-vis women's sport and funding for men's sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is far from the case. My view is consistent and it is non-discriminatory. My view is that spending on sport for men and women and the portrayal of men as sex objects are all serious matters. My view is that in difficult economic times, there must be priorities in government spending and they must be carefully set. If the Government believes that to spend $43m on women's sport, or men's sport for that matter, is a priority--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must assure Senator Newman in passing, that nobody has ever treated me as a sex object, perhaps more is the pity. This afternoon we are dealing with a number of Bills-the Appropriation and Supply Bills. Before dealing with several specific matters which arise out of those Bills, I would like to make some general remarks in relation to the cast of both the Government's and the Opposition's economic policies because recently there has been a great deal of talk about a recession. The Opposition has sought to use the technical observation of `three terms of no growth in the economy' as a basis for the claim that the economy is in recession and, by implication, that the Government is a bad manager and the country is heading for disaster. The converse is also implied, that is, `if the economy was growing, we would not be in a recession and we would be okay'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Neither the Government, the Opposition nor the economic commentators in the media seem to be aware that a large number of things which enter the calculus of growth of gross domestic product (GDP) are costs and not benefits. Despite the fact that this has been repeatedly pointed out in this chamber, many senators and most economic commentators seem completely unaware that in the measurement of economic growth we are looking at the growth of GDP. Included in GDP are many things which are costs and not benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> All commentators seem to have become so besotted with the index-the measurement of this index and whether the index is rising or falling-that they have forgotten that there is no clear nexus between the index and human welfare. It is the latter around which the economy should be based-not whether the GDP index is going up or down, but whether the quality of life and the welfare of people in this country are improving or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Some senators may remember a question I asked of Senator Walsh more than 12 months ago in relation to motor vehicle accidents. I asked him where the costs-I stress the word `costs'-of these accidents appear in the national accounts. After explaining that the costs of these accidents are added to gross domestic product-in other words, gross domestic product is increased by the amount which is spent on repairing the damage to humans and to property caused by these accidents-Senator Walsh went on to recount how removing these costs from gross domestic product `may start a spiral in which the whole of the gross domestic product gradually disappeared'-the very point that I wanted established in that question. </PARA>
<PARA> In a like manner, as Sydney and other rapidly growing Australian cities expand and the new arrivals travel ever greater distances to work on increasingly expensive roads, these costs-I stress `costs'-borne by ordinary people, and correctly perceived by them as costs, are added to the national accounts and cause the index-gross domestic product-to grow. A growing economy is not necessarily one which better serves the needs of its citizens. Conversely, an economy in which gross domestic product is falling is not necessarily one in which the lot of ordinary people is being compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> As our cities grow, the cost of providing a whole range of services to people on the periphery of those already large cities increases disproportionately. The costs of generating electricity from suppliers of fuel which are ever further distant, transporting that electricity over greater distances, and reticulating it on the periphery of an already large city increase disproportionately. They are perceived as costs by ordinary people, but they enter the national accounts as an addition to the gross domestic product so the economy appears to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a bit disappointed to hear Senator Olsen's remarks earlier in relation to the size of Adelaide. At present Adelaide is suffering very acutely from extremely poor quality water which is very expensive. For some months this year massive algal blooms on Lake Alexandrina have prevented the use of that water by local residents. Even farmers have been unable to use the water for cattle. Yet the costs of providing at least potable, safe water, in bacteriological terms, for the citizens of Adelaide add to the gross domestic product. Therefore, they enter the national accounts as an index of growth. I do not think anybody in this chamber would believe that the people of Adelaide are better off because of growth of that sort. </PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, if we introduced measures to improve the efficiency with which we generate electricity, the `contribution' which electricity generation makes to gross domestic product might fall substantially. I do not think anybody would argue that we were worse off because gross domestic product had fallen as a result of our using electricity much more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> So overreliance on this one index disguises a lot that is wrong with the allocation of resources. Money spent on buildings is added to GDP. The more we spend as a nation, the greater the `contribution' which the building industry makes to economic growth. But GDP-even per capita GDP-tells one nothing about the equity of this activity, the equity of building. It is said that about one in every six central business district buildings throughout Australia is unoccupied. There has been furious activity in all the central business districts throughout Australia for some years. Indeed, visit any Australian city at the present time and one sees the skyline festooned with cranes-not of the bird variety but of the mechanical variety-something which the South Australian Minister for Tourism says she rather enjoys seeing. One wonders about the shape of the cranes and whether there is some interesting pleasure that she gets from seeing them. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, there is an acute shortage of housing for ordinary Australians. We have considerable building activity, which is adding to gross domestic product, but we have an acute shortage of housing for ordinary Australians. Indeed, Mr Bannon, the Premier of South Australia and the National President of the Australian Labor Party, was speaking only over the weekend of having urban ghettos in Adelaide if more is not spent on public housing. He went on to point out that 40,000 people are on waiting lists for public housing in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the economy grows or not tells us not one thing about the distribution, equity or fairness of building activity which contributes to that growth. I believe that the cause of the housing problem is not to be found in the growth or non-growth of gross domestic product but in the Government's adherence, with Opposition support, to a deregulatory `leave it to the market' approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I was interested to hear Senator Olsen speaking about the desirability of decentralisation and pointing out, as did the Premier of South Australia at the weekend, that Sydney was overcrowded. I am not too sure how he is going to regulate the movement of immigrants into Australia; I would have thought that it was self-evident that people who come into this country are free to move to where they wish, and it would be quite untenable and reprehensible to attempt to direct people into particular areas. I also point out that the second Dunstan Government in South Australia was the Government which bought the area at Monarto-the only serious attempt at decentralisation in this country in recent decades-and that it was Dunstan's successor, the former Liberal Premier of South Australia, who dismantled that project and resold the land at Monarto. So I was disappointed to hear his remarks in relation to decentralisation, in view of that history. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the point about the market system-much welcomed and desired by both the Government and the Opposition-economists and members of the Government and the Opposition have assumed for too long that the abstracted world of the market is coterminous with both the natural world and the real world of people. The market may be an efficient instrument for the allocation of resources, but it is not necessarily fair or equitable. Efficiency is determined by price-quite clearly, that is how economists have to calculate it-for only by rendering all things into dollar amounts can apples and oranges or houses for people and empty office blocks for speculating entrepreneurs be compared and judged. Human or environmental qualities that cannot be specified in dollars are judged by this system to be either irrelevant or, worse, non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before in debates in this general area, it is not just that the Government spends too much here or not enough there; there is a fundamental flaw in the way the Government thinks about the economy. That flaw is shared by the Opposition. It is most unfortunate that the Government's claimed success at `educating' the public in matters economic has, in reality, been successful in hiding the real world behind a great deal of economic mumbo jumbo. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear the Governor-General's Speech at the opening of this Parliament, because frequently throughout the course of the previous Parliament we heard spokespeople for the Government speaking about sustainable growth. After repeatedly writing to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others pointing out that sustainable growth is an oxymoron, I listened very carefully to the Governor-General's Speech and, despite the fact that there was a great deal of discussion on various economic matters, not once did the Governor-General talk about economic growth, much less about sustainable growth. Perhaps the understanding that there is an absolute contradiction between sustainability and economic growth is slowly percolating into the heads of some Government Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> For a clearer understanding of economic reality-and I am referring here to the claimed success by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of educating the public in matters economic-I suggest that honourable senators read Professor Herman Daly's most recent book entitled For The Common Good: Redirecting the Economy Toward Community, the Environment and a Sustainable Future. I point out that Professor Daly is professor of economics at Louisiana State University and a senior economist in the environment department of the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning specifically to some of the detail of these Bills before us, I note that this year is International Literacy Year. After paying lip-service to the need and desirability of literacy and, indeed, after an extensive advertising campaign encouraging those with literacy problems to seek help, this Government has not provided funds which will allow people to receive that help. Money spent on education by government is clearly seen as a cost whereas the Democrats believe-and we have pointed this out repeatedly-that education should be seen as an investment in the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice under the appropriation for education that in 1989-90 there is an additional expenditure of $2m and a further additional expenditure of $40m for adult migration education. While this is welcomed, it must be seen against the fact that, while some 68 per cent of non-Aboriginal students now complete year 12, only 18 per cent of Aboriginal students are so successful. We would certainly like to see a great deal more funding, and more effective funding, going into Aboriginal education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In another matter, the Australian Democrats have consistently attempted to increase the support for those Australians who suffer disability. Indeed, Senator Macklin in particular has repeatedly sought the removal of sales tax on computers adapted for use by disabled people. All senators will recall that he has put up amendments in that area on a number of occasions and each time that proposal has been defeated. It is heartening to see that the Government is providing an extra $22m for assistance to people with disabilities. But in this same appropriation an extra $239m is provided for the Department of Defence. One wonders again about the priorities of this Government when 10 times as much is spent in an area which ultimately, if ever used, will produce much greater levels of disability while such a small amount is spent on treating disabilities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to turn to another area now, that is, the area of disaster relief. In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1989-90, $25m is provided for what is described as natural disaster relief. Again, I have some difficulty with this word `natural'. These disasters are in no sense natural. They would not be disasters if humans had not intruded into these environments. They would be natural occurrences and they become disasters because human beings happen to be in the way of those events. The Minister's speech makes clear that `the bulk of the assistance is in respect of the recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland'. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a country in which the chief characteristic of the weather is its unpredictability. We live in a country notoriously subject to drought, bushfire and flood. For most areas of Australia we now have over 100 years of records showing the return times of these-here is the word again-natural disasters and an indication of the costs involved. The proposal I want to mention here is that, rather than set money aside on an ad hoc basis when these disasters occur, it should be possible to create a permanent fund out of which these relief costs could be borne and, thus, smooth out the costs of disaster relief over time. It is especially important, I believe, to clarify and regulate the circumstances for the relief of damage costs associated with these occurrences. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to briefly detail the history of what has happened in South Australia in relation to the two Ash Wednesday bushfires. As most honourable senators will know, there have been two bushfires on Ash Wednesdays-one in 1980 and the other in 1983-in South Australia. The first was found by a coroner to be caused by a fire burning in a rubbish dump used by the Stirling District Council, and the fire getting out of control on a day of high temperature and very strong north winds. Tens of millions of dollars worth of damage were caused and neither the Council nor the owners and operators of the dump had insurance sufficient to cover the damage. The State, unfortunately in retrospect, did not declare the fire a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Those affected by the fire have fought for 10 years to reclaim costs from the Stirling Council and, indeed, partly from the owners of the dump. The claims have essentially bankrupted the Council. The lack of an established procedure has resulted in a great deal of unresolved anguish all round. Indeed, many millions of dollars and an enormous amount of time have been spent in legal wrangles in relation to responsibility, claims of negligence, counterclaims that those operating the dump and the Council were not negligent, and so on and so forth, all of which has reflected very harshly on the people who in many cases lost everything they owned. </PARA>
<PARA> The second South Australian Ash Wednesday fires-and I say `fires' in the</PARA>
<PARA> Insurance companies have traditionally called these acts of God-a rather peculiar term which I find a somewhat disparaging reflection on the Almighty. Under these circumstances it would seem appropriate to limit to a reasonably foreseeable level the amount of insurance cover required by individuals and companies to protect against these occurrences, and for a national disaster fund to be created as insurance cover against the additional cost. The way of settling these matters in times when one of these so-called natural disasters occurs would be quite clearly set up and established beforehand. A reasonable level of insurance cover would be borne by the individual and perhaps a further level might be borne by State utilities-in this case, the Electricity Trust of South Australia might be required to carry a certain level of insurance-but beyond that, because the particular outcomes of these circumstances is beyond the control of the owner of the initiating cause, those extra costs should be picked up through a natural disaster relief fund. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that actuarial data already available should allow a calculation to be made as to how much the Federal Government would need to set aside each year. As I indicated earlier, this would smooth the cost of dealing with these things so that, instead of having some years when there would be no costs borne and other years when very heavy costs might be borne, the costs could be smoothed out over time. This procedure would surely be easier than the ad hoc arrangements and, indeed, the very socially damaging arrangements which obtain at the present time for meeting the costs of these national disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn briefly to the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1990-91. We have recently been dealing in this place with the regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act. Honourable senators will recall that these regulations were disallowed on a motion from the Democrats, supported by the Opposition. One of the points that was briefly made in the disallowance speeches was that the costs to be borne by those who sought to have therapeutic goods registered or listed and the costs in relation to inspection of premises and so on would sit unfairly on some of the manufacturers of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting, having dealt with that matter so recently, to turn to this Supply Bill (No. 1). In the discussions leading to the setting of those charges and fees it was stated that the costs of administering this scheme were be be approximately $30m, and that the Government had arbitrarily set the cost for recovery at 50 per cent. In other words, it was expecting industry to pick up approximately $15m and the Government would pick up $15m of the costs.</PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to Supply Bill (No. 1) we find that there is information which says that $11.1m is to be provided for the administration of therapeutic goods legislation. I point out that this legislation was clearly drawn up before the regulations were disallowed. The regulations envisaged that this Act and its regulations would come into operation on 1 July, so there is no question that we are not dealing with a full year's costs and cost recovery. In setting the fees to be paid by those covered by the therapeutic goods legislation, the Department claimed that it would recover half the costs; and as these expenses were expected to be $30m, half the cost would be $15m. We have now learnt that the departmental running costs are expected to be $11.1m, almost $4m less than was told to the therapeutic goods suppliers. It would seem from the information contained in the Supply Bill (No. 1) that the Government has somewhat overestimated the overall costs; it certainly overestimated its own portion. Presumably, if we are looking at 50 per cent cost recovery, there can be a substantial cut in the fees to be charged to those who are seeking registration of therapeutic goods while still staying within that formula of a 50 : 50 split. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I point out that, while it is interesting to look at the detail of these Appropriation and Supply Bills, the main thing that one observes in looking at the Bills is a continuation of an economic model which is based on a misconception of the true nature of society and the needs of society. It is based on an economic model which, as I said earlier, assumes that the abstracted model is the same as the real world-that the abstracted model can deal with the environment because the model is synonymous with the environment; that the abstracted model can deal with human welfare because human society is totally described by the model. That, indeed, is a fallacy. Humans are far more than economic units which relate to each other through market forces. We relate in much more complex ways than that. Attempting to deal with people in that way, as this Government has done and indeed as this Opposition would do even more firmly, not only is wrong but is not going to lead to the improvement in human welfare, improvement in the protection of the quality of the environment, which the Australian Democrats seek. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the debate on the Appropriation and Supply Bills I want to make some comments on Australia's future directions in light of both Government and Opposition policies which seem to promise, at best, a piecemeal approach which is disappointing because ad hoc decisions are inadequate to meet the challenges facing not only Australians, but the global community. The greening of Australian politics is a gradual process that is now firmly entrenched in both State and Federal parliaments. In Western Australia, we have achieved political unity within the Greens movement and we will show other political parties what real grassroots democracy is all about by putting the community needs first on the Federal parliamentary agenda. The Western Australian Greens will turn Green philosophy into political reality-a task that will involve the greening of industry, unions and government as quickly as possible to catch up with the high level of community awareness. The success of the Tasmanian Greens is a role model for other States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a historic time for the Australian Parliament and for Australian politics at all three levels of government as more independents and non-major party representatives, such as the Australian Democrats, appeal to the electorate. I am happy to continue the work towards linking the environment and the economy in political terms, as the Australian Democrats have worked towards that end as well, and I look forward to continuing cooperatively in that process. Globally, members of the European Economic Community joined in the Green debate many years before the environmental crisis became part of the everyday parlance in Australia. The grassroots Greens movement was instrumental in the western European process of awareness of the urgent need for action. This awareness led to an acknowledgment of the Dickensian industries and terrible pollution of eastern Europe. Concern about this, of course, has been a very significant factor leading to the rapid process of democratisation in many countries in the Eastern bloc. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government now has a chance to take a leading role through acknowledging the link between the environment and the economy, rather than continuing to depend on growth economics based on ripping up and exporting primary resources and a reliance on the old order with all its attendant environmental problems and social inequalities. The Government, bureaucracy, industry and the wider community must acknowledge that we do not inherit the earth and its resources from our parents; that we merely borrow it from our children. If the path of unfettered economic growth and industrialisation continues, in economic terms we are borrowing against the capital of the earth-a price neither the Australian public nor the global community can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Greens are working on a new sustainable economic order which incorporates the conservation ethic through a Green budget. Sustainability is about radical changes to lifestyle and challenging the present cancerous rate of consumerism. A Green budget will have a macro-economic perspective but it will also come down to individual responsibility and a new ethical structure for the individual and community. The existing monetarist policies on both the left and right of the political spectrum do not adequately address the environmental crisis or our moral bankruptcy and lack of community spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has not made the hard decisions on the environment. It has made reactionary and populist decisions that the Greens are thankful for but which we see as largely piecemeal. The political agenda for this Parliament, established in the Governor-General's Speech, was to make Australia the clever country rather than the lucky country by funding export oriented science and technologies and boosting employment and training in this area. Traditional science is not the answer, as aware scientists like David Suzuki have told us. When will the Australian Government listen?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of the nuclear and genetic industries which have through their amoral and technocratic nature got the industrialised world into a fix. We are pumping radioactive wastes into our environment and we are tampering with human embryos. Where will the future take us from here?</PARA>
<PARA> I take exception to the Australian Government's belief that science and technology is the best or only way to go. Once again, the Government is demonstrating its shortsightedness and dependence on free market forces without a holistic ecological and social perspective. Ecocare is not just a buzz word of the moment. It means communal approach to sustainable economics and environmental care, an underlying ethical structure which will link global communities from east to west. If our Government continues in its monetarist vein, I shudder to think of the global damage that the underdeveloped world could inflict if it takes the path that Australia has chosen. The cumulative effects of accelerated use of energy and resources cannot be sustained at the present rate. This is not supposition but a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> A communal response to the environmental crisis is what is needed based on a new ethical structure which will carry over into government and industry. The Green vision for the future is based on grassroots democracy, social justice, environmental custodianship, disarmament and non-violence. This is a holistic vision for a planet in crisis. It is an exciting process because it is about individual empowerment which can lead to massive and urgently needed changes. If we were to acknowledge the spiritual unity of the Aboriginal community with its so-called economic capital-that is land, water, air and forests-we of the developed-industrialised world would learn of the importance of an ethical structure which sees the environment as an intrinsic part of existence and not solely, or even mainly, as a means of making profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The social inequalities of our society with its immense poverty, continued environmental degradation, the alienation of the individual in an empty consumerist world and the waste of precious resources on weapons of mass destruction, all carry an intrinsic message: the old order is destructive and a new order must emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there are numerous references these days to sustainable development by government, opposition and industry, there is little attempt to put this reference into a framework of anything new in terms of economic policy. What is being increasingly understood, but not yet by major political parties, is that the economy and the environment are one issue; they are inextricably linked. There are some contradictions in the Government's position which I want to mention. I want to put on record some of the ideas which are now being explored by those Australians who, while they may have given their preferences to the Australian Labor Party in the recent election, first voted Green. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable development is a term that has been tossed about by politicians and business people from all sides of politics. I would suggest that there are three different schools of thought on sustainability. The first is the productivity or economic school of thought in which the primary concern is to meet society's demands for material goods in a way which yields an economic return on a continuing basis. The second is the stewardship or ecological perspective which is concerned with maintaining the health of natural ecosystems. Thirdly, there is the community or social perspective in which the conservation of social phenomena such as community structures and lifestyles in terms of quality rather than quantity of material possessions is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA> These perspectives should not be regarded as mutually exclusive but I want to stress that Green voters will not be satisfied with policies that continue to treat the environment as though it were something inert, as a background in our lives, something to be cleaned up for convenience. This is the point of view expressed by free market ideologists such as Margaret Thatcher who made explicit this idea of property when she said that we have a `repair and maintenance lease upon the planet'. It is indeed a limited view. </PARA>
<PARA> The same politicians have also pointed out that the inclusion of environmental costs into economic systems, from which they have hitherto been rigorously excluded, will demand a high price. To afford their price we will need even more wealth making activity. Thus, we are told that economic growth and a life enhancing environment can be reconciled. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainability may be the word of the moment but this version means sustainability without social justice. The term has been either deliberately or inadvertently misunderstood. No wonder it has passed so easily into existing political rhetoric. The monetarist approach can mean only a hardening of present inequalities, if not a significant exacerbation of them. This is why no effort has been spared to obscure the contradiction between sustainable development and a market system that depends upon an acceleration in use of energy and resources in the production of more and more commodities which is what the growth economy is all about. The real costs of economic development have never shown up in balance sheets because such costs, like those to the environment, do not occur in the realm of economics at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to outline an alternative Green approach to economics and development but before that I want to challenge the conventional wisdom which lies behind the way in which we measure growth and the values behind the United Nations (UN) system of national accounts. Few economists will acknowledge openly the villainy and incompetence of the UN system of national accounts. However, as Marilyn Waring, a well respected New Zealand economist, has pointed out, many economic commentators openly recognise three areas of difficulty in the United Nations system of national accounts-the hidden economy, the integration of environmental pollution costs into accounting and the measurement of leisure time. The principal objection to this system of accounting is that it reduces everything to a market price and consequently leaves out so much. In Australia, a relatively pollution free environment-I use that term advisedly-clean running water, old forests and the absence of commercial and nuclear power, all count for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Hand in hand with dismissal of the environment in the account system is the invisibility of women. As homemakers and mothers, if we choose those roles, we are non-producers and so are the increasing number of men who choose a homemaker's role. The work value is now measured only in monetary terms, a total abuse of its original meaning. The things we really value count for nothing in this system. This initial system of accounting was revised in 1968 to add some non-monetary activities but it still excludes the carriage of water, the collection of firewood, subsistence crop production and housework, activities which take up a vast percentage of the time of women around the world. Reasons given by men for their failure to account for women's work are conceptual problems and the practical difficulties of collection data. It seems not to occur to them that if one has a conceptual problem about the activity of half the human species, then one has a conceptual problem about the whole. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that one exception to this situation is a small west African country which many honourable senators will never have heard of-Burkina Faso, the Upper Volta as it used to be called. Burkina Faso, where a women is the chief statistician, has simply altered its census to record the unpaid work of women, a very timely move in the right direction. Over the years there have been proposals to change the system of general accounting, most of which have gone unheeded. One system proposed by an American economist, Hazel Henderson, views the economy as a layered cake, where the unmeasured non-monetary section of the economy and environmental degradation are not seen as some peripheral part of the economy but as an intrinsic and measurable part of it. Even this proposal could be abused if the top layers are given greater weight than the bottom layers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth considering a model proposed by the Finnish feminist activist Helka Pietila, at the United Nations end of decade conference on women in Nairobi in 1985. Her concept is based on three overlapping circles-the non-monetary part of the economy which she describes as the free economy, the protected economy which consists of production and work for the home market as well as public services, and the fettered economy which covers large scale production for export, the terms of which are determined by the world market. With this system of accounting the nation's annual budget would become a realistic description of the well-being of the community and its environment, a reflection of real wealth and different values. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a budget would answer the following questions: who does what work and where, paid and unpaid; what are the positions of the nation's children and the aged; who is not housed adequately; who has the poorest health; what changes have occurred in water and air quality levels and why; what is the nature and what are the causes and regions of pollution and what are the health costs associated with that pollution; what national resources have been harvested or conserved; who relieves the state of the burden of care and dependency of others; what is the scope of subsistence production and what are the nutritional results; and at what price does the nation currently value war and the preparation for war?</PARA>
<PARA> What I am driving at is the necessity of viewing the economy as merely one aspect of a whole ecological and social fabric. Economists tend to divide this fabric into fragments, ignoring social and ecological interdependence and the perspectives which we need to see as part of the whole. All goods and services are reduced to their monetary values while the social and environmental costs generated by all economic activity are ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide economics with a sound ecological basis, economists will need to revise their basic concepts in a drastic way. As Hazel Henderson has pointed out, the gross national product (GNP), which is supposed to measure a nation's wealth, is determined by adding up indiscriminately all economic activities associated with monetary values while all non-monetary aspects of the economy are ignored. Social costs, like those of accidents, litigation and health care are added as positive contributions to the GNP rather than being subtracted. </PARA>
<PARA> It was Ralph Nader who commented, `Every time there is an automobile accident, the GNP goes up'. In the same vein, Henderson insists that the concept of wealth must shed some of its present connotations of capital and material accumulation and give way to a redefinition as human enrichment, and that profit must be redefined to mean only the creation of real wealth rather than private or public gain won at the expense of social or environmental exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> The same could be said of concepts of efficiency and productivity, which have been similarly distorted. It is quite clear that economic and institutional growth are inextricably linked to technological growth, which is patently not sustainable. Growth has to stop somewhere. I borrow a phrase from Hazel Henderson when she referred to macho technology, that is, a technology bent on manipulation and control rather than cooperation, self-assertion rather than integration, suitable for centralised management rather than regional and local application by individuals and small groups. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result most technologies today have become profoundly anti-ecological, unhealthy and inhuman. They need to be replaced by new forms of technology, technologies that incorporate ecological principles and correspond to a new set of values. Many of these alternative technologies, small scale and decentralised, responsive to local conditions and designed to increase self-sufficiency, are already being developed, as Henderson testifies in her book Creating Alternative Futures. These soft technologies are so called because their impact on the environment is greatly reduced by the use of renewable resources and constant recycling of materials. As Herman Daly has clearly pointed out, we should be aiming for a steady state economy in which there is plenty of lateral mobility but not open-ended vertical movement in growth because of our need to account for the renewable and non-renewable resources available to humanity in both the short and long term. There is not an inexhaustible supply of resources; neither is there an unlimited absorption of toxic waste churned out by a high-tech society. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most crucial issue involved in the sustainability debate is that of energy consumption. The key question here is whether it is possible to have reduced energy consumption per capita in the Western world and have economic growth as well. The immediate answer is that it is not only possible but that it has happened in recent years. During the past 13 years many industrial countries saw the energy content of growth fall significantly as a result of increases in energy efficiency, averaging 1.7 per cent annually between 1973 and 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it could be argued that we have taken the easy energy conservation measures already and that further advances will be difficult to make. In this debate two schools of thought can be identified. The first suggests that the capacity to reduce energy consumption per capita without affecting national income significantly is so great that ecological sustainability can be achieved without sacrificing the goal of long term economic growth. On the other hand, there is a school of thought that maintains that economic growth and sustainable energy use are fundamentally inconsistent. In this view, major reductions in energy consumption are not possible in the current economic system. As long as there is exponential growth in economic activity, reduction in per capita consumption merely postpones the day on which fundamental energy resource constraints will be encountered. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions I have asked about energy use can also be asked of other resources. Here the technical optimists are on a firmer footing than with energy when they suggest we can maintain living standards in the future with greatly reduced material consumption. In terms of employment creation, it depends on one's assumption about the nature of job creation in the future. Barry Jones, former Minister for Science, has suggested that employment in the future would shift increasingly away from making, selling and servicing of goods and towards such areas as education, home-based employment, leisure, tourism, and craft and nature related work, a trend that has fundamental implications for the nature of jobs with which society is currently ill equipped to deal. His view reflect the views of British economist James Robertson, whose book Future Work indicated many opportunities for lateral thinkers who are prepared to challenge creatively the traditional concepts of full employment, a situation to which we cannot hope to return. But we need to rethink our notions of full time work linked to the notion of a guaranteed minimum income. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue is crucial, especially for the growing number of disillusioned young Australians who cannot relate to the materialistic lifestyle they have had foisted upon them, particularly if they are, for whatever reason, on the fringe of that materialism. We owe it to our youth to do more than continually put them into training programs, leading them ever onwards towards commercialism and consumerism. We need to be educating our young people for quality lifestyles where their creativity will be encouraged and valued and where they can make positive contributions in community decision making about their own futures. The question is not only what is the product of work in a sustainable society but what is the resulting lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I come to the vexed questions which have to do with the relationship between Australia and the rest of the world. The Labor Party's current record on overseas aid is not good. In fact, in setting the agenda for the fourth term of office of the Hawke Government, one of the sad aspects of the Governor-General's recent Speech was that it contained no reference to overseas aid, no reference to the Labor Party's pledge to try to restore our level of overseas aid to a higher level than that to which it has now sunk, and no reference to the recent Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report recommending that Australia's overseas aid should once again stand at 0.5 per cent of GDP by 1992. Obviously the issue is not simply one of the level of overseas aid, but I cite this as an example of the way in which the Government is not prepared to take seriously concerns on aid and international debt raised by members of its own Party, let alone non-government critics like me. The best use Australia can be to the rest of the world is by example. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often said that Australia has one of the best chances of any country to develop a sustainable economy because of its natural resources, its low population and its environmentally concerned population. There are two approaches to how this might be achieved. One approach suggests that we need to consider seriously Australia's future optimum population level and our use of resources, to become less dependent upon external forces by becoming more self-sufficient, and to restructure our economy to become more sustainable, behind the protective walls of tariffs if necessary. If we can move towards sustainability here then other countries will see that it can be done and begin to adapt our experience to their own. If we continue to allow unlimited population and resource use to grow and let our economic affairs be determined in international markets, we have no chance of achieving sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA> An alternative, and from my point of view more acceptable, view is that it is unethical for Australians to put up trade barriers against the rest of the world in these days of spaceship Earth. The best thing we can do for the developing world is to keep our tariffs low, so that they have a market for their goods, and help them follow sustainable development paths different from the ones the West has taken so that the world's environmental resources are not depleted altogether or overburdened. The crux of the issue appears to be whether there is a beneficial relationship between increased international trade and sustainability. Obviously there will be an ongoing debate on these topics but it is crucial that these international perspectives be central to the debate and not sidelined. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions to do with Australia's role in the world also raise the issue of income distribution and its relationship with environmental degradation. Indeed, it is probable that inequality of income distribution is the greatest single cause of environmental damage. In that case we are in big trouble because the gap between the rich and poor is widening, both between countries and within countries. Sustainability for Australia therefore carries with it some thorny international issues. Probably the hardest issue concerns the ethics of Australia's role in a sustainable world. Is sustainability a subtler form of imperialism in which the First World tells the Third World what is best for it? In which case we will probably get some pretty negative responses. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the kinds of concerns the Greens will be raising as the debate on Australia's future continues. I would argue that, as far as the mainstream parties are concerned, the debate is simply about continuing unlimited growth and the victory of the free market approach or growth with a certain level of environmental responsibility tacked on. I repeat: the environment, the economy and social justice are one issue. The Green approach presents a new option, already under attack, as visionary, cautionary message heralding changes always are. There is a great deal of work being done globally by people whose only vested interest is in rescuing the future, people who want to present a viable vision for the right sharing of the Earth's resources, people who are beginning to convince business and industry that there are lots of opportunities, as well as imperatives, in turning away from the exploitative mentality towards an ethical framework which is truly sustainable in every dimension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address my remarks to a few separate and specific issues in this debate on the Appropriation Bills. Firstly, there can be no doubt that there is an urgent need for electoral reform and electoral education and that the democratic process which we have in this country would be further enhanced by such reform and education. Two key areas in which electoral reform is needed concern how to vote cards and the fact that the right to lie is entrenched in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Honourable senators will no doubt recall that last December the Australian Democrats tried to remove the right to lie from the Electoral Act. It is unfortunate that that amendment was not passed by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Views have been expressed in the electorate, from representatives of all political parties, that how to vote cards should be abolished. There was a case for how to vote cards in the past because the names of political parties were not permitted to be placed on the ballot paper. However, that is no longer the case and voters can now clearly see to which party each candidate has an affiliation. Each political party could have its recommendations for preferences clearly displayed both outside and inside polling places and, indeed, inside each polling cubicle. The electorate is becoming increasingly informed and sophisticated. The big hoax about preferences and how to vote cards has begun to be understood. People are beginning to understand that preferences are theirs to distribute and to give in the order that they wish and not to be manipulated by political parties. The how to vote card is merely a recommendation by a political party of how it would wish its voters to place preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> The preferential system was set up so that each voter could have another bite at the cherry if his or her first choice candidate was not elected. The lower House seats, that is, seats in the House of Representatives in the Federal Parliament, and in Legislative Assembly seats in State Houses, elect single members. They are single member constituencies. If a voter has his or her first, second or even third choice candidate eliminated from the count, their next choice is taken into consideration until one candidate has more than 50 per cent of the vote and is elected. </PARA>
<PARA> Political parties have hijacked preferences which in reality belong to the people. Political parties, particularly the two big political blocks of the Labor and Liberal parties, now frenetically negotiate to gain preferences, particularly in seats in the lower Houses in which, of course, the Government is decided. We Australians need to realise that we can decide who forms government by the way in which we place our preferences. Indeed, I am surprised that in the forthcoming by-elections in Western Australia the Liberals are giving their second preferences to candidates who are on the public record as having stated that they are not interested in calling for a royal commission into Western Australia Inc. They are giving their second preferences to the Western Australian Greens. This is admirable because, of course, the Western Australia Greens stand on strong environmental issues which are supported by the Democrats. However, when we consider that the Liberals are standing on the call for a royal commission into Western Australia Inc., this might seem to be a little surprising. It may well be that Liberal voters need to consider and take into account what decisions have been made in this regard. I believe that it is very important that people of independent mind do act as independents in the Parliament and sit on the cross benches, as the Democrats have done very successfully for the past 13 years in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that voters are in charge of their preferences the Australian Democrats run for the most part on split tickets in most elections. In this way the voter can choose whether to give his or her further preference to the Australian Labor Party or to the Liberal Party of Australia. Nonetheless we normally also recommend that second and third preferences immediately after the Democrats should go to sympathetic Green candidates who stand generally on environmental and social justice issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In some ways it is an insult to the intelligence of voters for political parties to direct the preferences of a voter. It is also difficult for voters if they feel that they have a Hobson's choice. The Australian Democrats also have a tradition of occasionally running on open tickets, that is, in not assigning or recommending preferences as such, but in totally giving back to voters their opportunity to put their preferences exactly where they want to. The Democrats are doing that in the forthcoming by-elections in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the problem that we have in Western Australia, and a very great problem it is, is the problem of Western Australia Inc. This was flagged way back in the early 1980s, indeed as far back as 1984, when the Western Australian Government introduced the Western Australian Development Corporation Act. I was very surprised that that particular Bill was allowed to pass through the State Parliament without any amendment, because it could be quite clearly seen in that Bill that there was no accountability of the Western Australian Development Corporation to the Parliament. In fact it would appear that WADC had more power than the Parliament itself. I am very surprised, considering that the Opposition parties had the numbers in the Upper House, that that Bill was not amended at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the subject of electoral education. It is very disappointing that the Australian Electoral Commission does not take it upon itself to conduct more education as far as our electoral systems are concerned. There is a great need for people to be educated in the matter of preferences. The Electoral Commission goes out of its way to show people how to register a formal vote but all too often that vote is an uncomprehending one because too few people understand how the preference system works. </PARA>
<PARA> Television is a superb medium as far as education is concerned. I would certainly encourage the Electoral Commission to use the medium of television to educate the people of Australia as to how our preferential system works. In the recent half Senate election a fair proportion of voters in Western Australia chose not to vote `1' above the line, that is, not to surrender control of their own preferences. A large number of people voted below the line and therefore retained control over their preferences and assigned them as they wished to. The statistics here are very interesting. The highest proportion of votes of people who voted below the line, with regard to both the percentage of votes for the party and also as far as the raw scores are concerned, went to the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats achieved over 20,000 votes below the line. Next in line were the Western Australian Greens, with over 18,000 votes below the line. The Liberal Party was next with over 17,000 votes and then the Labor Party with nearly 10,000 votes below the line. A number of people who wished to take control of their preferences voted below the line and therefore placed their preferences where they wished them to be. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of appropriations money is currently spent in the area of public funding of election campaigns. This is becoming inordinately expensive, mainly because of the very high cost of electronic advertising. This is something which has to be faced. </PARA>
<PARA> A report was brought out last year by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Parliament and this Committee advocated that this was an issue that needed to be addressed. The report was called Who pays the piper calls the tune. The title was chosen because it was perceived by the all-party Committee-although I must say that not all the recommendations of the Committee were unanimous-that certainly the issue needs to be addressed; that is, if political parties need vast sums of money in order to be able to advertise during election time, the possibility is there for electoral corruption, and this is the last thing that we want in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> An issue that I have raised before and raise again briefly today is that of the epidural use of the drug Depo-Medrol. In addressing the Appropriation Bills I want to point out that the financial cost to the public purse of Depo-Medrol epidural injections that go wrong is absolutely enormous. I spoke on this issue last year and I have continued to do a lot of work on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I last spoke many new cases, including a number of particularly severe ones, have come to my notice. Some of these cases are from States other than Western Australia. I remind honourable senators that this issue relates to the use of a drug for spinal injections which is not approved by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee for that particular use. It is not approved for that particular use by the manufacturer. It is approved for the use of injection into muscle tissue and not into the spine. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue of importance is that this drug is being brought into the stores of government hospitals and is being used in these hospitals for epidural injections. Thus the Commonwealth is paying for supplies of a drug to be used in a way not sanctioned by the Commonwealth's own relevant medical authority. Further, doctors who give these injections are currently able to claim payment for the procedures from Medicare. Thus the Commonwealth is paying for the administration of this drug in a manner it does not sanction. Further still, when subsequent to the administration of the drug a patient is affected by serious adverse reactions it is Medicare again which stands the cost of hospitalisation and treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of one patient-not one of the original group from whom I received affidavits last year-whose adverse reaction was immediate and devastating. His blood pressure dropped to zero. He technically died and had to be resuscitated. During the next several hours he had to be resuscitated on two further occasions. He spent three and half months in intensive care and three full years in hospital before he was well enough to go home. </PARA>
<PARA> A rough estimate in respect of this case is that the bed alone cost in today's dollars in the order of half a million dollars. These costs were borne by Medicare, that is, by the taxpayer. It is probable that if all other costs of this one case were taken into account-theatre costs and the costs of consultants, medications and so on, the cost would exceed a million dollars, and this is just one of many cases. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that we had a major investigation into this particular issue. It must be resolved one way or the other. Either the drug must be approved for that particular use or we must change the way in which it is administered. Indeed, I would state that it is high time we had a major investigation into the prevalence of iatrogenic disease in Australia and the effective measures to combat it. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking on that relevant point, I would like to pick up some of the remarks made in the chamber earlier today by Senator Crowley. Senator Crowley referred to a report which was brought out in April of this year, Home Births in Australia 1985-87, a report brought out by the National Perinatal Statistics Unit Homebirth Australia. In order to summarise some of the conclusions in that report I refer to a recent newspaper article headed `Babies less likely to die in home births: study'. It reported that the first comprehensive national report on home births found that childbirth at home was also less likely to involve medical or surgical intervention than that involved in hospital deliveries. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The analysis of 3400 home births planned between 1985 and 1987 was held by the national perinatal statistics unit based at Sydney university . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It found the caesarian rate for home births was 2.2 per cent, about an eighth of the national rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also found that one in seven home births resulted in the mother being taken to hospital for the actual birth, but even when that happened the intervention rate was very much lower. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The perinatal mortality rate for home births was 5.9 a 1000 births, compared with a national rate of 10.7. </PARA>
<PARA>These statistics are very interesting. The background to the statistics also needs to be considered very carefully. The home birth movement has been severely criticised. It was severely criticised before because statistics were not available right across the board and in every State. Now those statistics are available and they are there to be examined by all and sundry. It is not enough to use anecdotal information; we must turn to statistics, but we must also turn to the meaning of those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> On the same subject-that is of the rate of medical intervention in childbirth in Australia-I refer to a book by Stephen Rice titled, provocatively, Some Doctors Make You Sick. Rates of caesarian intervention are given in the book. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of caesarian section births has tripled in just 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> A recent Australian study found that of 120 women having their first baby, 23 per cent had a Caesarian section. The study was carried out at a large Sydney teaching hospital . . . Of the women who gave birth vaginally, . . . Some 81 per cent had an episiotomy . . . forceps were used on 43 per cent of the women who gave birth vaginally. At least one reason for this is the widespread use of epidural anaesthesia, which prolongs the second stage of labour and makes it less efficient. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, caesarian sections are necessary on occasions and there can be tragic consequences if a caesarian section is not performed when it is necessary, but caesarian sections are not necessary for all births by any means and the percentage of their use in Australia is particularly high. The book also states:</PARA>
<PARA> In Holland, the survival rate of newborn babies is better than in Australia, yet the caesarian section rate is between a quarter and a third that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Another Australian study was on infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), this again in a major Sydney hospital. The book states:</PARA>
<PARA> Of 116 infants with RDS, 28 were found to have been born premature as a result of elective induction (18 cases) and elective Caesarian section (10 cases). Each suffered severe respiratory distress, and several needed help in breathing . . . The two researchers pointed out that it was becoming increasingly common-and socially acceptable-for doctors to plan deliveries for the ``daylight hours''. </PARA>
<PARA>Stephen Rice states in this book:</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of surgical intervention can be reduced. With careful assessment and monitoring of pregnancy and labour, one Dublin hospital has been able to significantly lower its rate of Caesarian sections. In 1980 its rate for 8742 patients was only 4.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is considerably lower than the percentage currently in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly I would like to direct some remarks to immigration. Tabled today are the two reports put out by the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations and the Government's response. When honourable senators see those reports they will see that the all party Committee in these unanimous reports was very critical of the Government's first draft of the migration regulations. The regulations have already been changed a few times. I commend the Government for making those changes. They were necessary and the Government has made them. </PARA>
<PARA> What is not to be commended is that the Government put itself in the unnecessary position of having to make those changes last year by rushing through immigration legislation and the regulations which were part and parcel of that legislation and not taking advice which was given to it from a number of sides that legislation which depended on regulations which codified, or attempted to codify, prospective migrants right down to the very last little dotted `i' and crossed `t', simply cannot work. Indeed, had the coalition stuck to its guns when the legislation was introduced last year and not caved into the Government, the Senate and the Parliament at large would have had the time to consider properly the changes that were brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the changes were simply a patch up yet again to the 1958 immigration Act and not what FitzGerald and his committee recommended in respect of reforming immigration policy-that is, that it was time we had a new brand of immigration legislation which was not tied to the 1958 Act which, of course, dates back to the White Australia policy days. So this matter is very clearly connected with the appropriations because work which is done, then undone and redone, with manuals having to be rewritten and reprinted, puts an extra burden on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> The immigration debate is on the public agenda. That debate is welcomed provided that it is full, open and all-embracing and is not limited to single sector interests. One of our problems is that Australia has no population policy as such. We have a sort of de facto population policy which is decided by the immigration officers and immigration bureaucrats of the day. But that cannot be satisfactory and it is to be hoped that a valid policy will emerge as a result of research currently being carried out by the Bureau of Immigration Research. The Bureau is investigating the relevant components and ingredients which must, of necessity, be examined before a population policy can be arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, there must be some in-built flexibility to account for changes which will occur both inside and outside Australia. The issue of immigration must be seen as relevant to, but also apart from, population policies as such. After all, population and immigration policies affect all Australians. Population policies are concerned with numbers of people and the associated demographics-where people live and how they live. This has already been touched on by a number of previous speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government and State governments espouse policies of decentralisation and regionalisation but these policies are not borne out by positive incentives and actions. Indeed, those of us here from Western Australia know full well that in our State it is very hard to get proper hospital treatment, even in a public hospital, in some of our country towns. In fact, if not privately insured, there is no way that a person will be treated in a hospital in one of our country towns. </PARA>
<PARA> As with all policy areas, words are not enough. So despite all of the words that will emerge during this debate on the appropriations, I hope that the Government will properly put into place suitable actions for the reforming policies which it espouses and which have been flagged in the speech of the Governor-General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the appropriation debate tonight to raise an issue that I think has implications on Australia's balance of payments. It is only a small issue but it is a fairly relevant one. A number of marine cruise services operating along the Great Barrier Reef, with headquarters in both Mackay and Cairns, offer three- and four-day cruises. Some of these people have been in the business for up to 25 and 30 years. They suffered badly during the pilots dispute and, of course, as with every other small business, they are suffering from the Government imposed 23 per cent interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cruise rates have fallen from around 80 per cent some five or six years ago to between 20 per cent and 45 per cent now. About 80 per cent of the customers are overseas travellers who go out to look at and inspect the Barrier Reef. One of these Australian cruise operators recently purchased a multi-million dollar cruiser, built here in Australia, which demonstrates that company's commitment to the industry. These operators have been prepared to struggle over the last couple of years, through the pilots dispute and high interest rates that have deprived them of high cruise rates, hoping eventually to realise a profitable return on their considerable investments in the extended cruise market. </PARA>
<PARA> This market is over-stretched at present and the current operators are finding it difficult enough to stay in the business without the threat of a government company coming in and taking over, and that is precisely what Qantas Airways Ltd is working towards. A joint venture project has been proposed between Qantas Airways subsidiary, QH Tours Ltd, and Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd, a Sydney cruise operator. I have a joint press release which says that QH Tours, which is a part of Qantas, is promoting the ultimate Great Barrier Reef marine cruise. So we have a Government instrumentality building a first-class cruise liner earmarked for service on the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> This joint venture is building a boat called the Reef Endeavour. According to the press release the boat will be 3 3/4 thousand tonnes and will carry 156 passengers on three- and four-day cruises from Cairns to the Reef. The current cruise operators are more than happy to compete with any private enterprise that wants to set up in a narrow market. But they are extremely upset that a government-funded company, such as Qantas, is setting up in their own territory to muscle in on their business. Quite frankly, I do not blame them. It is hard enough to compete in the current market but to have to fight government-sponsored competition from Qantas Airways is quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Qantas that it should be promoting existing Australian tourism and helping the operators, not setting up in direct opposition to them. Qantas is believed to be the financier of the project with Captain Cook Cruises being up front. Qantas is very worried about the possibility of losing business from Jetabout Cruises which markets its tourism packages. We now find that Jetabout will be directly selling the QH Tours and not promoting the other tourist operators that have been in the market for 25 years. Jetabout is the Qantas travel arm, and it is not likely that once the taxpayer funded cruiser opens for business Qantas will utilise its vertically integrated companies to fly tourists in on Qantas planes, book them on Qantas tours and Qantas cruises, and fly them out again on Qantas planes. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the local Australian tourist operators. They will be squeezed out of the market. Already QH Tours is flexing its marketplace muscle and demanding higher commission fees from the tourist operators. Operators that are now paying a hefty 25 per cent or more commission are now being told to come up with more than 30 per cent commission if they want to retain the business. Yet Qantas and its partners are supposed to be promoting Australian tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of questions that need to be answered. The local industry believes that this Government funded cruiser is being built in Fiji. I have had it confirmed tonight that the Qantas cruiser-it is not a cruiser but a 3,500 tonne ship, which is quite a considerable sized ship-is going to be built in Fiji because labour is cheaper. It will then cruise into Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, what we have, if we boil it right down, is Qantas, which is an Australian Government instrumentality, receiving a $5m subsidy from the Fijian Government to compete against Australian private cruise operators. That is quite wrong, particularly when we are told by Travel Australia, which is a prominent travel magazine, that Qantas is expected to have lost another $150m when its financial report comes down in 1989-90. The carrier could face debts of around $3 billion by mid-year, an airline source said. Qantas has estimated a $100m loss due to the pilots dispute, and a rise in fuel costs has contributed to another $100m loss. In the 1988-89 financial year, the airline reported an operating profit after tax of $177m. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is supposed to be in dire need of a huge capital injection to keep it flying. We find now that it is diverting its capital into purchasing a boat-I will not call it a boat as it is a fairly substantial 3,500 tonne ship-and it is going to use that ship to compete against Australian cruise operators. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is facing such financial debts and is building up such debts for the taxpayer that it should be asked why it is investing millions of dollars in a cruise liner to run in an oversupplied market. Qantas is already responsible for blowouts in our import bill with its expensive imports of aeroplanes. Now it is going to import boats. I cannot believe that the Government is letting this happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing the cruise operators in north Queensland need is a depressed market due to Qantas elbowing its way in by using taxpayers' money. The local industry is already concerned at the clandestine way that Qantas is manoeuvring into the market. Operators believe that Jetabout has done much of the negotiating to date-particularly with the Fijian Government-to secure subsidies in building the liner. Yet Jetabout and Qantas have appeared extremely surprised, if not concerned, that anyone knows anything about this project. </PARA>
<PARA> The local operators say that they would not be able to sustain the competition that Jetabout would cause in the limited market. Jetabout has the financial backing of Qantas and the Government to sustain losses that they could not. The operators are also concerned that Jetabout as a wholesaler knows of their 1990-91 rates and the statistics of past and forward bookings. They wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories at the time, Mr Holding, and received a thank you letter in reply, but nothing positive. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious matter. It is not only a matter of governments using taxpayers' money to take over private enterprise, but it is also a matter that should concern the Government when one of its quangos is purchasing ships from an overseas government-in this case the government of Fiji-and that government is subsidising that particular boat so as it can go in and compete against private enterprise; that is, the tourist operators in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Government does take this on board because this action is quite wrong. It is wrong that these operators in north Queensland have had to maintain their own industry in very adverse conditions over the last six or 12 months of the pilots dispute. They are holding on, trying to maintain their businesses, and there is no way in the world that they can offset a business that is prepared to come in with Government funds and undercut their rates and drive them out of business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this appropriation debate as the Australian Democrats spokesperson on defence to pass some comments about the defence appropriations. I think most honourable senators are aware that since I have been in this place I have been questioning at the rationale upon which we are planning and funding our defence every available opportunity, and I am going to continue to do so this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will start by stating the obvious: I have not been able to identify anybody in Australia who argues that we should not move to secure our nation and a totally secure Australia. The debate centres on how best to do this. That is the first starting proposition I would like to make-that we all favour a secure Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposition I believe it is necessary to state initially is that we do not foresee any serious threat to Australia in the near future. That is the second proposition which should be underpinning our defence planning. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all acknowledge that there is some possibility of low level instability in our region, but I do not think any defence thinkers and analysts argue that we can foresee a major threat to stability such as we faced, say, in the 1950s with Korea, or in the 1960s and 1970s with Vietnam. In other words, it is generally conceded by the defence analysts and on all sides of this chamber that we are in a period of stability, allowing for the fact that there may be minor instability within the region such as we have seen in recent months in two or three locations throughout the south-west Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those opening observations, and we are seeing an emerging India-there is no doubt about the fact that India is rationalising and increasing its defence force-but there is no real suggestion form any quarter that India is adopting an aggressive posture in the southern Asian region; we all acknowledge that the Chinese population is exploding, but historically China has not been an outwardly aggressive nation as it tends to address itself internally to the implications associated with its billion or more people; and we all accept that Japan is economically dominant in the region. But even acknowledging these three things, there is general acceptance among defence analysts that we are in a period of stability. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also observing unprecedented global military thawing. We have seen unprecedented military de-escalation, as opposed to what we have witnessed in the last decade in Europe. A decade ago it would have been unimaginable that one-third of Soviet troops in eastern Europe would have been withdrawn within twelve months. We are witnessing massive dismantling of defence industries around the globe. In these contexts we have to analyse what is happening in terms of Australia's defence appropriations as they are before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I begin by making a couple of factual observations about defence expenditure in this country-right now, today. We spend approximately $8.6 billion a year on a Defence Force which by any standards must be regarded as demoralised and by some standards is regarded as impotent, as of today. In other words, it would be incapable of defending our shores against a major conventional attack. The concept of our defending Australia against any sort of nuclear threat is laughable. We are spending $8.6 billion a year on an impotent, demoralised Defence Force. Members of that Defence Force are voting with their feet and the shrinking of our service numbers has reached crisis point and is occurring at unprecedented rates. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the $8.6 billion a year expenditure on this impotent, demoralised Defence Force is occurring, we fund our volunteer coastal patrols, our bush fire patrols and our State emergency services literally by selling lamingtons on street corners. I illustrate this quite dramatically by citing the example of the State Emergency Services in the Newcastle region. I recently spoke to the director of the State Emergency Services operation who headed the post-earthquake operation in the Newcastle region. He told me that literally now-this day-he is attempting to raise sufficient money to purchase a four-wheel drive vehicle and communications systems for the State Emergency Services by selling chook raffle tickets in the pub on Saturday mornings. Yet we have witnessed an unprecedented series of major natural disasters in the last six months. We have not had-or been assured that we have-the capacity to react to a number of disasters simultaneously. We have been fortunate through nature sparing us simultaneous disasters. Were we to be confronted with multiple disasters, we simply would not be able to respond effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting that we now have an opportune time during a period of emerging global peace, during a period of regional and global relative stability, to completely rethink what defence is all about as we move into the next two or three decades. On every available opportunity I have urged the previous Minister for Defence, Minister Beazley, and the current Minister, Senator Robert Ray, to seriously put before Cabinet and the Government the proposition that we should be thinking laterally in our defence modelling and our defence funding and completely re-examining what we consider to be the threats to Australia and the needs in terms of defence structures. We have been advocating alternative defence models which would place emphasis upon civil-military defence models as opposed to the prevailing traditional, historical military-civil defence structures which we have had in this country. Now is the time to do the re-thinking. We have never had more striking evidence of the need for such re-thinking as we have had in this country in the last three or four months. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this extraordinary situation where our State emergency services are funding themselves literally by selling lamingtons on street corners. We have the farcical situation in respect of the National Safety Council of Australia, Victoria Division, so-called which by virtue of its name undertakes a capacity to respond on behalf of the community to ensure its safety. Quite extraordinary things are alleged to have occurred within that organisation and are now being inquired into. We have the situation where a company which bidded for, and had been chosen by the Government to undertake, the surveilling of our northern coastline was unable to get five aircraft in the air simultaneously on the day on which it was to demonstrate its capacity to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities are that we are locked into traditional thinking and we are undertaking massive expenditures in models which are utterly irrelevant. We are turning away from the essential requirements and not addressing moneys to them. It is a fact that anybody who becomes a member of a volunteer bush fire brigade in New South Wales is required to purchase his or her own protective clothing. Those people take time off work to undertake training in this country-a fire prone country-to defend their local community against bush fires, but they are not entitled to payment for their time. The Government in no way supports them in their training process. Quite obviously, these are ludicrous contradictions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to cite some of the clear examples of what we, in the Australian Democrats, see as being extraordinarily inappropriate commitments within these military appropriations to undertake expenditures which are massively burdensome upon the Australian community. In recent days we saw virtually a celebration by our Minister for Defence and senior defence officers because we had taken delivery of the last of our 75 FA18 fighters at a cost of about $5 billion-or, it is estimated, as much as $60m each, once they are piloted and provided with the necessary spare parts, basing facilities and operation and maintenance costs, which will be on top of the purchase price of the aircraft. Yet, I am told by the officer who commands those aircraft that it will be nine years before they are all piloted-and then with inexperienced pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a ludicrous undertaking on the part of our Government to commit us to that level of expenditure when, as I am also told by reliable authorities, the whole of our Army would be required to defend the airfields from which these aircraft operate, were they dispersed in northern Australia. This is an outstanding example of Australia, having committed itself to traditional models of defence and to the highly potent technological armories that are now associated with the pursuit of those models, being lumbered with this enormous expense of $5 billion. That is an initial outlay to purchase aircraft which are irrelevant to our needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was addressing, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, comments towards the defence appropriations. I was arguing that at a time when, globally, levels of threat are decreasing and we are living in a very stable region-although I acknowledge some possibility of low level instability-this is an excellent opportunity for those who are responsible for the defence of Australia to do some profound lateral thinking and to put in place, for the next several decades, a defence structure and defence force which is more appropriately addressed to what we see as the future needs of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I argued that nobody in this place would say that we should leave Australia defenceless. The argument centres around what is the most appropriate defence structure. The Australian Democrats vigorously argue that the former Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, and the current Minister, Senator Robert Ray, have committed us to defence structures which are essentially based on obsolete historical models that conceive armies, navies and air forces as being the appropriate structure of our defence. The Democrats argue that the time has come to shift from a military/civil model to a civil/military model. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite the following extraordinary and ridiculous contradiction. In Australia today we spend $8.6 billion a year on a defence force which is demoralised and largely impotent. Yet at the same time we fund our volunteer coastal patrols, State emergency services and bush fire brigades-all of which we use on a month by month, week by week, and certainly year by year basis-by selling lamingtons on street corners. I cited the profound example of the Director of the State Emergency Service in the Newcastle region, the man who headed up the post-earthquake operation, who told me just a few weeks ago that he is currently attempting to buy a four-wheel drive vehicle by running chook raffles in the pub on Saturday mornings. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we are confronted with those ridiculous contradictions the Australian people have a right to cry out that the time has come for us to seriously address other alternatives. I was citing the fact that Minister Beazley, and now Minister Robert Ray, who is committing himself to the same course of action, have said to Australia, `We want you to undertake massive expenditures and commit us to defence outlays for decades ahead which are largely irrelevant and which cannot be justified'. I gave the example that we celebrated just last week the arrival of our final F18 fighters. We have 75 of them. We have bought them at a cost of approximately $65m each, and yet it will be nine years-so the commander of those fighters tells me-before they will all be piloted, and then it will be with inexperienced pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a two-year lead time on spare parts for the F18 fighter. We got our order wrong. We had to guess right. The challenge was to guess correctly what spares would be required for this fighter two years in advance. Our current experience indicates that we have got that wrong and that a considerable number of them will be grounded. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that these highly technological weapons are like anything. A chain is as strong as its weakest link. The more sophisticated it becomes, the more vulnerable it becomes to breakdown and systems failure. Just a few months ago in this country our F111 bombers, now becoming a little dated but nevertheless still very powerful weapons systems, were grounded because there were no cannisters for the ejection seats. Therefore, pilots could not be expected to fly those sophisticated weapons systems because that sophisticated technological chain was only as strong as its weakest link-a simple cannister to blast an ejection seat from a cockpit. </PARA>
<PARA> We have ordered six Kockum-471 submarines which are now being built in Adelaide. The estimated project cost cited by the Government varies from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. If basic facilities and other special requirements are added, to the cost of $5.4 billion, according to Department of Defence documents, the total amounts to $900m per vessel. So we have bought 75 F18 fighters at $65m each and we have ordered six submarines at $900m each. This is when we are funding our volunteer coastal patrols and State emergency services literally by selling lamingtons on street corners. Two extra submarines which may still be ordered would cost another $800m at today's prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The project cost is certain to continue escalating well above the inflation rate, having almost doubled from the $2.6 billion cited by Paul Dibb in 1986. None of these figures includes the cost of operations, refit or maintenance. Therefore, we cannot begin to truly estimate the cost of that commitment to those submarines. Eight Meko ANZ frigates are to be built at Williamstown at a project cost of $4.4 billion-that is $550m per ship, excluding basic refit operations and maintenance costs. The modernisation of our three guided-missile destroyers is now under way, at a project cost of $570m, that is, $190m per warship. Sixteen Seahawk helicopters are now being assembled for $620m-that is, $39m per helicopter. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Government cancels major equipment contracts it is locked into the Beazley vision of a high-tech military force structure for decades to come. It is locked into what we would argue is utter irrelevance to the real needs for the defence of this country. It is a force structure at odds with the strategic guidance upon which it is based. It flies in the face of the strategic advice and model upon which it is based. The only conceivable threat facing Australia is of low level harassment and attack. The big ticket items are of little use for chasing small bands of hostile guerillas across the north of Australia. It is a reality that if we disburse those 75 F18 fighters in the northern part of this continent it would take the whole of our Army to defend the airfields, to render then secure for use. </PARA>
<PARA> We have committed ourselves, therefore, to a force structure which is designed to fight yesterday's wars-wars which are well away from our shores. In an attempt to give them contemporary relevance, Kim Beazley tried to transform warships and bombers into instruments of peacetime diplomacy in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities are that we are not capable of even surveilling let alone protecting our northern shores or the whole of our coast line. At present a total of roughly $50m per year is spent on Coastwatch. This could be increased by about 50 per cent just by retiring two of the existing Oberon submarines. Honourable senators should remember that the figures I quoted earlier were in billions of dollars. Thousands of millions of dollars were committed to the purchase of fighters which are potent, but unnecessary; submarines which are potent, but unnecessary, and yet we commit only $50m annually to the surveillance of our most vulnerable coast. </PARA>
<PARA> It is widely felt that the funding for land care should be doubled requiring an extra $300m over 10 years, one-third of the cost of a new submarine. Next year $5.4m will be spent on research into the greenhouse effect and about $3m on renewable energy research, development and demonstration. This compares with over $200m on military research alone. The fact is that this Government is committing us to three decades-former Minister Beazley was particularly responsible for this-of massive debt for the procurement of hardware which is structured within defence models which the Australian Democrats would argue are dramatically irrelevant to the needs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We would argue that it would be possible, even within the existing framework of the Army, to create a conservation corps built from and around the Royal Australian Engineers which could undertake the treatment of our polluted rivers and harbours, the desalination of our river foreshores and the planting, for instance, of the one billion trees which Prime Minister Hawke has boasted will be planted in this decade. Yet we have made no provision for these fundamental defences of our environment and resources, nor have we made adequate provision for the day by way and week by week civilian defences of people who are exposed to danger from flooding, fire and earthquakes. The Australian Democrats argue that the funds which were appropriated within these Bills are misdirected and utterly irresponsible for the future needs of the defence of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just 12 months ago I spoke in this place about the fact that Mr Keating's support for a consumption tax in 1985-remember that option C-was scuppered by Mr Hawke and the Australian Council of Trade Unions at the Taxation Summit of that year, and why Mr Keating had gone off that idea. To quote from my speech of 24 May last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Remember Mr Keating's choice of option C at the summit conference that was to introduce a consumption tax of 12 3/4 per cent? We all remember what happened to that. We all know that Mr Hawke, in a motel room, along with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, scuppered that proposal in a hurry and left Keating high and dry. But that did not stop Mr Keating. He has still, very surreptitiously, gone down that road. Sales tax revenue-and this is on top of personal tax-has more than doubled. It has gone up by over 147 per cent under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I said that just twelve months ago; it has gone up a lot more since then. I note that on 15 May in the Bulletin David Barnett picked up the theme of my speech, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> The debate on whether we should have consumption tax is highly embarrassing for the Treasurer, Paul Keating. You will recall that he pressed mightily at the Tax Summit in 1985 to bring in a broad-based consumption tax. Then he was rolled by his Prime Minister after a late night talk with the Australian Council of Trade Unions' general secretary, Bill Kelty. So that was the end of the broad-based consumption tax, wasn't it?</PARA>
<PARA> Well, no, it wasn't and here lies the source of Mr Keating's embarrassment. He sneaked the easy bits in anyway. He `reformed' the sales tax system in the 1985-86 Budget and he has been reforming it ever since, fixing up `anomalies'.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> About one-third of the products for sale in your average supermarket now attract sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has, indeed, introduced a type of consumption tax-not Mr Keating's 12 3/4 per cent, but a sales tax many items of which are levied at 10, 20 and 30 per cent, and even the proposed 50 per cent. Of course, under this scheme pensioners and other disadvantaged groups have not been compensated for the enormous increase in their supermarket bills as they would have been if a consumption tax had been introduced, and Mr Keating knows this well. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just give five examples of the sales tax that many pensioners are forced to pay for items because they are levied at wholesale prices. The first is washing powder. We all wash our clothes in washing powder. One and a half kilograms of washing powder attracts a 20 per cent sales tax. Because it is levied at the wholesale price, when the retailer gets it he puts his profit on the wholesaler's mark-up and a tax of $1.08. The tax component in that price is $1.17. So instead of paying only $5.87 for the washing powder, the pensioner has to pay $7.04. That is a considerable amount on the supermarket bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just run very quickly through the amount of tax that is paid for other items. Seven hundred and fifty millilitres of washing liquid is taxed at 20 per cent and the tax component is 55c. So instead of paying $2.82, the pensioner pays $3.37. If the pensioner has a pet and is buying dog food, 700 grams of dog food attracts a sales tax of 20 per cent and instead of paying 92c, he pays $1.10. Instead of paying $1.82 for toothpaste, the pensioner pays $2.18. The same thing applies to packs of toilet rolls-instead of paying $3.18, the pensioner pays $3.81. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not told about this tax. There are many other items that attract this tax. One of the largest wholesalers told me that approximately 33 per cent of his grocery lines attract sales tax. At the last Budget of the coalition Government in 1982-83, revenue from sales tax alone was $3,490m. The total tax taken was 8.47 per cent. The estimate for this financial year is $10,500m, an increase of 200.86 per cent-over 200 per cent. It represents 11.5 per cent of the total tax for this financial year. When we left government the total tax taken was 8.47 per cent. Sales tax has now gone up to 11.5 per cent of the total tax taken-a 286 per cent increase in revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Total tax for these years has increased enormously. The total tax take by the Government has gone up 32.6 per cent-and that is in 1988-89 dollar terms. I also stress that sales tax has increased this year-I really want to press this home-from 8 3/4 per cent of the total tax taken to 11 3/4 per cent of the total tax taken. Is it any wonder that Mr Keating is not interested in a consumption tax of 12 3/4 per cent? If he did introduce it, he would have to give a pay-off to all the pensioners, low income earners and disadvantaged people. Because the Treasurer has never acknowledged the enormous increase in the sales tax, pensioners have just paid up, blaming the manufacturers and supermarkets for enormous increases. They do not know the Government is applying the sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> To enforce this myth that it is all the supermarkets' fault, the Government set up, prior to the election, a price watch committee of Labor members, which went around the States abusing manufacturers and supermarket owners for the increases, never once mentioning the increasing Government taxes on many of these goods-increases put on by Mr Keating, their Treasurer. The five articles I have chosen are just some in the price watch list which Government members used to berate manufacturers and supermarket proprietors for the price increases. We all remember that Mr George Gear was chairman of that national price watch network. He came to Hobart, had a public meeting at the Town Hall, and he and Mr Duncan Kerr got stuck into the supermarkets and berated them for their large increases. Mr Kerr said that the escalating cost of basic grocery items was an increasing burden on families and that it was important that the ordinary members of the public and interested groups had a say in developing ways of curbing this trend. `Concern about rising prices is increasing and not a day passes without people raising this matter with me', said Duncan Kerr. On not one occasion did either Mr Gear or Duncan Kerr inform the public that it was not the supermarkets increasing the prices; it was this Government, because of a 20 per cent sales tax that automatically went up as the prices went up. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was this hypocritical action taken when the Government has extensively increased the range of items covered by this tax? I have touched on only a few food items; there are many other items that the Treasurer has lured into his net, which each year he casts further and further into the taxpayers' pockets. Again, I quote from my speech of last year:</PARA>
<PARA> How many of the families are aware that they are paying . . . 20 per cent sales tax on articles such as watches, clocks, cameras, film and slide projectors. There is 20 per cent sales tax on beer and wine. Of course, there is an excise duty on top of that . . . Every time a woman puts on lipstick she pays an additional 20 per cent to the Government . . . Every time she buys a wheelbarrow or garden fork she pays a 20 per cent sales tax . . . When people buy blankets they pay 10 per cent to the Government. If they buy a tea-towel they pay 10 per cent to the Government . . . Every time they buy a packet of potato chips, the Government grabs back 10 per cent. Every time they buy a cup and saucer or a glass they pay 10 per cent. Every time people strike a match they pay 10 per cent . . . They pay 10 per cent on all soft goods such as curtaining . . . brooms, buckets, rubbish bins, fridges, heaters, stoves, kettles, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, sewing machines and knitting machines . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, 10 per cent goes to the Government. They are just a few items. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) had added sales tax to thousands and thousands more. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 Mr Keating took a new direction. For the very first time, he imposed sales tax on services. Sales tax exemptions and customs duty exemptions were withdrawn from many government service enterprises. Australia Post and Telecom Australia are just two. This has resulted in an estimated $320m being added to Government revenue. Again, pensioners and low income earners have not been compensated for the increases caused by those decisions. For example, we know that, since 1987, Australia Post has increased its basic postal rate from 36c to 41c. Another increase is due later this year, bringing the rate to 43c. We all know that Telecom has also been forced to increase its charges. These are charges well above those that should have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> As the present sales tax operates, there are arbitrary and very confusing anomalies which result in some retailers having a considerable competitive advantage over others. The big retailers with the wholesale arm are able to purchase goods from the manufacturers sales tax free. They then add the sales tax prior to the sale at the consumer level instead of at the wholesale level. This has a considerable advantage over those that follow the usual method in which the retailer marks up the wholesale invoice price of goods, which already includes the sales tax. The retailer's mark- up applies not only on the wholesale price but also on the wholesale and sales tax component of the goods. So the consumer ends up paying much more for the goods than he or she would otherwise have done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for Mr Keating to say that he will try to review the legislation by simplifying it to reduce the costs imposed on small business by this tax. This tax also severely disadvantages consumers. It is not only small business and the Australian consumer who have been fleeced by this Government; this sales tax also applies to the inputs of exporters. Consequently, the disincentive to our exporters because of this tax is enormous. Something must be done. The Treasurer must take action to overcome the problems he has created. The burden on those disadvantaged groups is enormous. I have already pointed out that it is obvious that the Treasurer is getting too much tax through this secret method to move to a consumption tax, which would force him to compensate the low income earners and the pensioners. He has already created a sales tax of great proportions-that is, $10,500m to Consolidated Revenue-without any compensation being paid. He is most unlikely to change. However, he must make his sales tax system more just. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the election three Ministers have spoken out in frustration, telling the Treasurer he has to change his direction. They have said that he has to start making the hard decisions, that the Australian economy is in a disastrous situation. Yet, they say, this Treasurer will not take steps to bring matters under control. Senator Walsh tells us that he has wasted opportunity after opportunity. Senator Walsh assures Australians that Mr Hawke should have a spine transplant to help him make those hard decisions. What was the name Senator Walsh chose for the Prime Minister? It was Old Jellyback. We are told that Mr Keating is relying on high interest rates as the sole method of trying to stop people building their own homes because they have to import goods to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has joined Senator Walsh in a sudden rush of truthfulness. We all know the result of that. We all know how Mr Keating, to press home his superiority and his assurance that he is going to follow Mr Hawke to the leadership, told Senator Button a few home truths and made it extremely public. And now the new Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, has admitted that the Government has made times just too tough for small business. He has admitted that the Government's capital gains tax is part of the hardship of small business, and he has promised to defer the capital gains tax for small business under certain circumstances. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very essential to defer it as part of making small business grow. </PARA>
<PARA>During the election, we told the people of Australia that a capital gains tax would inhibit small business growth. After the election Mr Beddall, in his new ministerial portfolio, said that he would defer capital gains tax under certain circumstances. It is not only Ministers who have been taking Mr Keating and Mr Hawke to task. All the major banks, one after another, have also been berating the Government. In today's newspapers we see the following headlines: `Hard times ahead, says bank chief', `Banks rule out soft landing' and `Warning of interest rate hike'. Today's  Sydney Morning Herald reported Mr Nobby Clark, the National Australia Bank's Chief Executive, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the economy has not bottomed, tougher times were ahead, and interest rates were `highly likely' to rise next year. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He described economic conditions as the worst he had seen in his history at the NAB, and predicted the recession, which he described as `Patchy', would stretch into next year. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Nobby Clark said that people would find various types of landings. In respect of some people he said:</PARA>
<PARA> They will find it won't be hard, it'll be terminal. For some people it [the landing] will be hard, for some people it'll be soft, and for some people they'll have a great time and make a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA>He emphasised that for some the conditions would be terminal. I notice the Deputy Government Whip, Senator McKiernan, nodding his head. He agrees with Nobby Clark. I would like to add the Deputy Government Whip to all those Ministers who have been warning the Government of the hard decisions it must make. The best Treasurer in the whole wide world has wrought upon Australia the worst economic conditions that Nobby Clark has seen in the history of the National Australia Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Barry Jones said today that the Ministers are tired. He said that they have all worked too hard for too long and they are tired. He also said that Mr Hawke is showing the signs of battle fatigue. The new Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, horrified at what his public servants told him about the detrimental effects that the Australian waterfront has on the economy, rendering it completely uncompetitive, has promised to resign if in 12 months time he has not made substantial changes in his policy area. This Government has been in office for seven years, and we now have a new Minister offering to resign in 12 months time if changes are not made. What has occurred in seven years on the waterfront that has suddenly made this Minister so horrified? What has he been told by his public servants? We will see. The Government has never been game to take on the wharfies. While many promises have been made previously, nothing has ever been done. </PARA>
<PARA> In the March quarter, the number of bankruptcies in Australia was the highest on record. The figure of 2,142 was 26 per cent higher than that for the last March quarter. Mr Nobby Clark predicted a second wave of middle ranking business bankruptcies following the collapse of a number of leading Australian entrepreneurs. The sad thing is that Mr Keating, trying to save his credibility and trying hard not to back down or admit failure and take a change of direction, will create the dreadful unemployment that we will see in the next few months. Unemployment is increasing daily. As I have said, the March quarter was the worst quarter on record for bankruptcies. We know that they are going to increase in number. We know that we are now in a recession. Unemployment must be the most devastating thing that can happen to any Australian family. For the breadwinner suddenly to find that he is left without a job must be the most devastating thing a man could face. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Treasurer does not consider his reputation and credibility to be more important than at last admitting that he was wrong. The J-curve is never going to turn up until he changes his tactics. Unless we face up to that dreadful term `micro-economic reform'-which simply means making the waterfront, for example, perform so that Australian exporters can compete-and unless the Government is willing to take on those challenges, Australia will not recover. Mr Keating will go down in the history books not as the best Treasurer, but as the worst on record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak about illegal drugs, about corruption which has been claimed in relation to these drugs and about one citizen's concern that his complaints have not been adequately investigated. One of the privileges of serving in the Parliament is that occasionally one can act to bring the grievances of individual citizens to the Parliament, demand that action be taken upon those grievances, demand that action be taken to follow up any demands that citizens have and, in short, act as a channel for the airing of grievances, the testing of constituents' complaints and the relief of perceived injustice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not really an easy task. Many of those with whom one has to deal in these circumstances are not easy people to relate to. Sometimes that may be why they have troubles in the first place. Some people are, by nature, prickly; some people are, by nature, difficult. That does not mean that they are necessarily wrong in what they allege. Some people lack balance in their attitudes and views; they lack balance in the way they express things. That does not mean that they are necessarily wrong, although that is often an ad hominem ground on which what they say is attacked. Sometimes the troubles which people have make them difficult. The case I will set out tonight will indicate one person's troubles, and if he was not difficult at the end of it I do not think he would be normal. But, in fairness, I think one has to admit that it is often difficult to remain balanced and reasonable in view or outlook when one believes that one has been subjected to very great injustice.</PARA>
<PARA> When one is faced with material which alleges injustice and corruption, as a parliamentarian I think one has the duty, and the opportunity as well, to examine and assess it and determine whether or not it needs to be aired here. I have seen such material, and I have presumed that it should be aired here. I remember my colleague John Dowd airing some material in the 1970s in New South Wales. He was laughed out of the parliament and out of the leadership, but he was proved to be right. We have had in New South Wales in the last few days revelations by Mr John Hatton, who has tried to bring together some of the allegations about drug use. </PARA>
<PARA> I have got such a matter for the Senate tonight and, as will become clear, I indicate that I have done Senator Tate the courtesy of advising him that I will be speaking. I have spoken to him personally. He knows what I am speaking about. He knows the case very well. He is not disposed to respond, but I am going to raise it anyhow. </PARA>
<PARA> The case concerns a Mr Mehmed Skrijel. He was formerly a fisherman of Southend in South Australia and before that he lived at Digby in Victoria. Mr Skrijel has several complaints which I think should be made known to the Senate. They are so serious that it is not possible to ignore them, and neither is it proper to take them lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Skrijel alleges, first, that he witnessed a fellow fisherman in South Australia picking up drugs which had been dropped at sea off a passing ship. Mr Skrijel saw them picked up and put on a fishing boat which then landed at Southend, the port from which it was operating. He was informed by his deckhand, who knew what was going on, that the package contained heroin. We understand that there was a distribution network extending from Southend into Adelaide. We understand that there was an organised drug importing operation, operating from Southend, in which the drugs were picked up by fishermen. The first allegation is that when Mr Skrijel made this known to the appropriate authorities nothing was done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, Mr Skrijel asserts that the allegation was ignored by those who could have done something about it. He says that when the matter was finally investigated it was by policemen, one of whom turned out to be corrupt himself-and I will just take the Senate through that little episode. The then Premier of South Australia, Mr Corcoran, said that some investigations should be carried out, and he sent two policemen to Victoria, where Mr Skrijel then lived, to interview him. One policeman was the head of the Drug Squad, named Superintendent Lean, and he had with him a Detective Senior Sergeant named Barry Moyse. The interview which they conducted, having been instructed by Premier Corcoran, lasted two minutes, according to Mr Skrijel, and they then reported back that the allegations which Mr Skrijel had made had no substance and should not be investigated further. </PARA>
<PARA> The third allegation that Mr Skrijel makes is that pressure was brought on him to be quiet, to forget the whole affair, and that when those suggestions were ignored and failed he was harassed and driven out of the fishing town in which he worked. His boat and his home were burned. He was bashed, and his family was harassed. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing that Mr Skrijel alleges is that he was then framed by the police. I had better say something about that. Mr Skrijel was certainly arrested by police in Victoria. He was certainly charged by Victorian police with growing cannabis at his property at Digby and with an explosives offence. There is no doubt about that. He was certainly convicted in the County Court at Ballarat on 1 April 1987. He was certainly sentenced on 10 July 1987 to serve two years imprisonment with a minimum of nine months to serve in gaol. He certainly served a prison sentence for that offence. But he says that he was innocent, that he was framed by the police, and he alleges that they were police working with the involvement of the National Crime Authority (NCA)-a most serious charge. </PARA>
<PARA> What else do we know with certainty? We know that Mr Skrijel appealed against the conviction. We know as a matter of fact that the appeal succeeded, that the conviction was set aside and that a retrial was ordered on 6 May 1988 by the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of Victoria. We know for a fact that the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered, and we also know for a fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria has now entered a document known as a nolle prosequi, which means that there will be no retrial of Mr Skrijel's case. </PARA>
<PARA> So here is a man who is arrested, charged, tried, convicted, sent to gaol and has his conviction quashed, but who is told that there will be no retrial; there will be no chance for him to test in public again the allegations against him. Mr Skrijel alleges that not all his property held by police or the NCA has been returned to him. In particular, six tapes prepared by a private investigator named Matthews who was commissioned by Mr Skrijel to prepare the tapes, which contain vital information, were taken by a Sergeant Iddles and have not been returned. Receipts are held for them. Correspondence exists concerning the tapes, and we understand that they are in the possession of the National Crime Authority. They have not been returned to Mr Skrijel, even now that we know there will be no retrial. So where are the tapes? The tapes are very serious. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Skrijel has served a term in gaol for a conviction now set aside. I imagine that his legal advisers would now wish to discuss with him the real questions as to whether he has any right to compensation. But it is up to them to pursue this matter; it is not a question for the Senate. He has had no recompense of any kind. I believe that the policeman, Barry Moyse-I do not know the rank he finally held-is now in gaol. So one of the police who interviewed Mr Skrijel and said that there was nothing to his allegations is now in gaol-I think, from memory, serving a term of 25 years for drug related offences. But his dismissal of Mr Skrijel's original allegation still stands; it has not been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not for one moment hold myself out to be an Emile Zola or anything like that, but I cannot help remembering that history of the Dreyfus affair where a scapegoat went to prison until someone would speak up on his behalf. Honourable senators will remember the story of Alfred Dreyfus, an officer in the French Army who was accused of selling state secrets to the Germans, was convicted and sent to Devil's Island but who continued to maintain his innocence until the matter was re-examined and he was cleared completely. Other culprits were identified and he was restored to a place of honour. </PARA>
<PARA> We really cannot ignore this material. We have had in Australia a mass of occurrences-leaving the Skrijel matter to one side-which have involved official and police corruption. What I am talking about follows a mass of episodes of corruption around Australia. The latest has been the behaviour towards Mr Harry Blackburn by his fellow police officers. That is now a matter of public record. I have already mentioned that as long ago as the mid-1970s my friend John Dowd was detailing corruption in New South Wales. He was laughed out of the leadership then, but he has been vindicated since. Of course, he is now the Attorney-General in New South Wales and investigating these matters with some vigour. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had demonstrated to us in this country over some years that there is corruption in the police-well demonstrated; corruption in politics-well demonstrated; corruption in the magistracy-well demonstrated; corruption in the Australian Customs Service and corruption at judicial level. It has all been demonstrated. It is not as if what I am suggesting is new. We are seeing today the fallout from investigations in Queensland and we have yet to see the end results of the investigations carried out by the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. We should start from the premise that it is more likely that there is corrupt behaviour going on than that there is not. The inquiry into the Winchester murder remains incomplete. I do not know what result that is going to reveal. Mr Hatton raised last week in New South Wales other matters which should concern all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Skrijel believes that the system is corrupt and that he has been treated unjustly and unfairly. He believes-and, on the surface, with good grounds-that the corruption which affected him is related to drug importation. He believes that the corruption which has affected him involves the police force in South Australia, the police force in Victoria and the National Crime Authority. That is what Mr Skrijel believes. </PARA>
<PARA> He believes he was set up deliberately with false evidence and perjury and that this was done because his determination to air his original observations of a drug pick-up at sea was inconvenient and threatening. That is why he thinks he was set up. That is why his boat was burned. That is why his house was burned. He believes, further, that his claims to this effect have been ignored, turned aside, trivialised, given only scant and superficial investigation or dismissed because he is seen as a prickly and difficult person. He believes he has been given bland assurances without any good reasons to accept them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I have an enormous series of letters here which I will come back to in a moment. I am going to seek to incorporate some of them in Hansard. One is a letter dated 3 February 1989 from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) to Mr Berthelsen, who was the attorney for Mr Skrijel, setting out Senator Tate's view that there is nothing in Mr Skrijel's story and containing, in the final paragraph, Senator Tate's assurance as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make clear that the Government has full confidence in the integrity of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have that letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Justice</PARA>
<PARA>Senator The Hon. Michael Tate</PARA>
<PARA>3 February 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Berthelsen</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letters of 6 September 1988 and 10 November 1988 concerning the trial and conviction in the Victorian County Court of Mr Mehmed Skrijel for drug and firearm offences. </PARA>
<PARA> As you stated in your letters, the Full Bench of the Victorian Supreme Court, in upholding Mr Skrijel's appeal, ordered a retrial. I am advised that no decision on whether to proceed has been taken by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions. As this is a State matter, any further queries should be directed to that office. </PARA>
<PARA> Your letters also contained allegations of corruption in the National Crime Authority's handling of Mr Skrijel's case. The information concerning alleged illegal activities in Southend which Mr Skrijel provided to the Costigan Royal Commission was passed to the National Crime Authority in October 1984. The Royal Commission had made preliminary inquiries but did not undertake any further investigation of the matter. In November 1984 the National Crime Authority resolved to undertake an ordinary investigation into the allegations. The outcome of that investigation is of course known to you. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that your letter of 10 November 1988 (paragraph 11) implies that there was inaction by the Commonwealth Government with respect to Mr Costigan's recommendations for a Royal Commission into the matters discussed in confidential Volume 7 of his report. The facts of the matter are that the Government passed these matters to the National Crime Authority under formal reference for full investigation. The outcome of this investigation was several successful prosecutions of key drug trafficking principals with resultant lengthy goal terms and current legal action directed at the recovery of the proceeds of their criminal activity. I should add that there is no mention of Mr Skrijel's allegations in Volume 7 of the Costigan Report. </PARA>
<PARA> At the specific request of the South Australian Government and following full agreement by the Commonwealth and all State Governments, the National Crime Authority has recently established a full time office in Adelaide. The Governor-General has appointed Mr Mark Le Grand as an additional member of the Authority specifically to investigate allegations of corruption including drug trafficking in that State. Mr Le Grand's appointment commenced on 1 January 1989 for an initial period of twelve months. In the circumstances, I have decided to forward a full set of your documentation to Mr Le Grand for his attention. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to penalties for drug trafficking, the Government is satisfied that penalties ranging from life to ten years for indictable offences depending on the nature and quantity of the drug involved, are appropriate at the present time. Sentencing of offenders is a matter for the courts and it would be improper for the Government to interfere in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to make clear that the Government has full confidence in the integrity of the National Crime Authority. I have no evidence to suggest the need to conduct an inquiry into its activities in relation to Mr Skrijel's case or any other matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>Michael Tate</PARA>
<PARA>Mr David Berthelsen</PARA>
<PARA>GPO Box 1991</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2601</PARA>
<PARA> The second letter is also from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, dated 13 October 1989. I interpolate here that there has been a fair bit of correspondence going backwards and forwards on this matter over some years. This letter again is an effort by Senator Tate-who has tried to respond to some of these representations-to set out some of the matters raised by Mr Skrijel. I seek leave to incorporate that letter in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Justice</PARA>
<PARA>Senator The Hon. Michael Tate</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Berthelsen</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 10 November 1988 concerning allegations by Mr Mehmet Skrijel against the National Crime Authority (NCA). </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in my letter of 2 February 1989, I passed a full set of the documents you provided to the National Crime Authority for their advice. As a result of my request, the NCA undertook an internal review of the allegations raised in your letter. The Authority is of the opinion that nothing in the material forwarded by you justifies it commencing a new enquiry into either the allegations concerning drug importations and corruption in South Australia made by Mr Skrijel or the allegation raised in your letter that evidence put forward in the trial and subsequent appeal of Mr Skrijel was fabricated by the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the NCA obtained the advice of Mr Ian Robertson, a Victorian Counsel, on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) whether there had been any failure on the part of the National Crime Authority to properly investigate the Skrijel allegations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) whether there is any evidence of a `frame up' by officers of the National Crime Authority in relation to the offences in respect of which Skrijel was charged and stood trial. </PARA>
<PARA> After reviewing the whole of the material, Mr Robertson has concluded in respect of (i)</PARA>
<PARA> ``Because of the extraordinary difficulties surrounding the investigation of the Skrijel allegations I found it exceedingly difficult to sort out fact from fiction, or perhaps even from fantasy. This factor must have presented as a formidable obstacle to the investigating officers. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion no further investigations into the allegations made by Skrijel are warranted but I have no doubt the file remains open in the hope that at some stage some substantive evidence might be obtained to support the allegations and thereby warrant further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have the greatest sympathy for the tragic plight of Skrijel and his family I have the distinct impression upon reading the material that many of his problems are of his own making, influenced by his diagnosed mental condition''</PARA>
<PARA> And, in respect of question (ii):</PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no evidence from the documentation before me to suggest a `frame up' by officers of the National Crime Authority. Neither is there any apparent motive for such a frame up on the part of such officers. </PARA>
<PARA> If indeed there was a `planting' of evidence on Skrijel it would seem to me to have been a pretty amateur attempt, and lacking all the hallmarks of organised crime. However, I repeat that in my opinion there is absolutely no evidence in support of such an allegation, which allegation is commonly raised by way of defence in criminal trials. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the long and complex history of this matter and in view of Skrijel's obvious and stated distrust of all members of law enforcement agencies I am unable to recommend any further investigations into Skrijel's allegations of a `frame up'. Such an investigation at this stage would I feel be totally unproductive and would not in any event satisfy Skrijel.''</PARA>
<PARA> I am further advised by officers of my Department that after reviewing the above mentioned reports they are in agreement with their substance, and recommend that no further action be taken on this matter. I accept their advice. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in my previous letter, the question of Mr Skrijel's retrial is a matter for the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions to determine. In the circumstances, I do not think it appropriate to enter into any further discussions concerning Mr Skrijel's allegations at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Your Sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>(Michael Tate)</PARA>
<PARA>Mr D. Berthelsen</PARA>
<PARA>GPO Box 1991</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2601</PARA>
<PARA> What has happened to the claims made by Mr Skrijel has an uncanny resemblance to the treatment meted out, say, to those who first raised claims of corruption in Queensland or New South Wales-claims that have been shown subsequently to have some substance. The people who raised them are not necessarily wrong. I put this to the Senate: If Mr Skrijel did see some drugs being picked up off Southend, why was that not investigated with more vigour? Why will anyone not acknowledge that there is some substance to it?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Skrijel complained to the police in South Australia again and again about the drug-running operation. He complained again and again about the harassment of him personally, he complained about the harassment of his family, and he complained about the damage to his property. He says that this was all due to his refusal to become part of the system and to take part in an illegal business of drug-running. </PARA>
<PARA> There was actually a coronial inquiry into the burning of Mr Skrijel's home and his boat. The coroner, Mr Kevin Rheam, stated on both occasions that it was not accidental, but was arson caused by persons unknown. That does not sound like a person who does not know what he was talking about. Mr Skrijel was right. He was the subject of the deliberate burning of his home and his boat-that much has been determined in a coronial inquiry. When Mr Skrijel finally had his claims investigated by the South Australian police, one of the men in that team was a man now in gaol for a long time for his own involvement in major drug affairs. Why should Mr Skrijel have any confidence in that investigation? I do not. </PARA>
<PARA> It was soon after this that the police managed to raid Mr Skrijel's home in Digby, Western Victoria, to arrest him, to charge him with marijuana cultivation and trafficking and to have him convicted. But then they were unable to have the conviction stand and, when the case got to the Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Victoria, that conviction was quashed. But Mr Skrijel served a sentence in prison. I will read what one of the judges said in allowing Mr Skrijel's appeal. Of the evidence used to charge him with cultivating cannabis, the judge said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . wholly circumstantial and the defence was that the applicant had been set up by persons anxious to discredit him as reliable in his constant and vociferous allegations of heroin smuggling by sea in the area. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is that the judges believed Mr Skrijel and they set the conviction aside. </PARA>
<PARA> At the trial when he was convicted, Sergeant Iddles, one of the police officers, told the court-and this is in the transcript-that he had actually investigated 26 allegations made by Mr Skrijel. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some things he says I've substantiated as being correct. </PARA>
<PARA>The police themselves acknowledge that what Mr Skrijel was alleging in court had some truth. That was sworn evidence at the trial and it is available in the transcript. It is not as if there is nothing to the allegations. With the jury absent, the Crown prosecutor, Mr Lee, acknowledged that the events described by Mr Skrijel had occurred; he only questioned Mr Skrijel's interpretation of them. And that is an open matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria has decided not to take the matter further-not to have a retrial and not to give Mr Skrijel the opportunity to have a verdict of not guilty entered? Why was that decision made? That would have required the various witnesses to be cross-examined again. A nolle prosequi is a neat way of ensuring that there is no further court appearance on this matter in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are concerned about here is whether those whom we have set up to protect us are themselves free of corruption. Those of us who are Latin scholars and have studied Juvenal will know the phrase quis custodiet ipsos custodes-who is to guard the guards themselves? This is a very apt phrase. We are told when we ask questions about the National Crime Authority that we cannot be given any detailed answers-that the operations of the Authority are matters not to be aired in the Parliament. I do not necessarily disagree with that. I happen to have high regard for the Minister, Senator Tate. I know that he has been concerned about this case. I say to Senator Tate that it does not compute, it does not add up. It is not sufficient just to say that this is a difficult, prickly man; of course he is. I would be difficult and prickly if I had gone through what he has gone through. It is not enough to say that there will be more investigations. There is a difficulty. I understand that Senator Tate would say to me, `I cannot release the operational details of the NCA operations in public'. I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am asking him is what is going to be done to investigate what seemed to be quite serious and not unfounded allegations by a citizen who served a term in gaol unnecessarily without a conviction standing against his name? What is going to be done to investigate those allegations now when the man believes that the NCA has been part of the frame-up which caused him to go to gaol. If the NCA is afraid of what he is saying, that is one thing; but I do think it is. What we have to find is some mechanism by which it is possible to investigate Mr Skrijel's allegations properly to ensure that he is treated fairly, and to ensure that the authorities against whom he has made the allegations have to explain what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to propose to the Minister that he might consider finding some independent party, acceptable to both sides of the argument-acceptable to the NCA, acceptable to the police and acceptable to Mr Skrijel-so that that person might be able to get a complete briefing on the allegations made by this citizen and to advise both Mr Skrijel and the Parliament, perhaps, as to whether there is any substance in them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Skrijel has different wishes. He has five wishes: First, he wishes to appear as a witness before the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority; that Committee exists and he wants to appear before it. I will certainly pass this speech on to that Committee. Secondly, he wants the National Crime Authority to report on all his accusations and allegations in detail, rather than just send us a brief letter such as the one we received from Mr Justice Stewart-again a person I know personally and for whom I have a lot of regard-that simply says in half a page that there is nothing to it. Mr Justice Stewart has sent me a letter as well, and in about half a page has said that there is nothing in the allegations. We want a detailed response to each of the allegations. Thirdly, Mr Skrijel wants the NCA to list each of the allegations and to respond to each allegation separately, because he thinks at the moment that he is just being given the flick. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, he wants the NCA to return to him the six tapes which are legally his and which are held by the NCA-tapes which Mr Skrijel paid for when he commissioned a Mr Matthews to make them but which have been taken and held by the NCA. Fifthly, he wants to ask a question about one particular piece of property; it is a shotgun. It is a shotgun which Mr Skrijel does not own but which the police seized; they say they seized it from his property. What is interesting is that he was arrested on 29 October 1986 but the gun appeared only some three and a half months later. Why do they allege it is his gun? He wants to know where it came from, whose it is and what it has to do with the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I have used the occasion of the Appropriation Bills to raise a question of a very serious grievance on behalf of a citizen. I have done it after about a year of soul-searching. I cannot investigate adequately to any end point the allegations of Mr Skrijel. I cannot decipher the claims, counterclaims and details. I do not try to; I am not a lawyer. What I do ask is that this Parliament take seriously the claims of this citizen who believes that he has been ill treated by authority and who believes that there is evidence of official corruption in what has happened to him. If the Parliament would do that, I would be well satisfied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take some time tonight, in speaking to the Appropriation Bills before the Senate, to deal with the appropriations for the Department of Defence. I will make a general point at the start and then deal with several specific points as they relate to capability and equipment for the Australian defence forces. I welcome the appointment of the new Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). He will be a much more rational Minister than his predecessor, Mr Beazley, who had a charmed life with the press, whereas the reality is that few people have done more damage to the Australian defence forces than Mr Beazley did as a Minister because he was driven by his emotions and an ideology he had, not by the evidence presented to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Beazley had such an infallible belief in his own judgment that he could not brook any criticism or debate about what he was doing. One of the sad consequences of this is that he has locked Australia into a way of responding for the decades ahead by the massive equipment purchases he made, some of which are quite inappropriate. He has narrowed the response capability that Australia can make in a defence way in a totally unacceptable manner for the years ahead. I know Senator Robert Ray reasonably well. I have a lot more confidence that he will be led by the evidence that is before him and not by his emotions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I welcome is the appointment of both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in the Senate because the Senate traditionally, is the home of these two issues, with its more inquiring air and more time to debate the issues, as opposed to the tyranny of numbers which prevails in the House of Representatives. One must remember that under our Westminster system many of the decisions relating to defence and foreign affairs are traditionally matters of executive judgment and flow from the executive of the day. In a democracy it is proper that they are debated. It is very hard to run a decent debate if the Minister is not in the chamber. Decent debates are impossible in the House of Representatives because, as I have said, of the tyranny of numbers. They are possible in the Senate. I hope that now that we have both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Senate, we will see the development of debate on these subjects which really are very important to Australia because the most fundamental of all tasks of the Government is the security of the nation. It is one thing for the Government to have a view on what defence capabilities the Government should have and what actions it should follow in its foreign affairs, for the security of the nation. But the matter goes beyond that because it involves the development of the will of the nation so that when the Government speaks on an issue it knows it has the support of the community. The support of the community can be developed only if the community understands what is going on and it is absolutely essential that debate on defence and foreign affairs matters takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have a very modest defence capability. There is a need to improve that. Because of the changing circumstances that the world finds itself in that need is more pressing than it has been in the past. It will be a lot harder for the Government to do that in the years ahead. We are going to have a campaign run by the heirs and successors of the peace groups campaigning in the public arena for a reduction in defence expenditure. It is not only a matter of entering the debate and countering that by the Government; it is a matter of staying in it for the long haul. One of the things the Labor Government is not good at is staying in something for the long haul. One only has to look at the way it handled the narcotic drug debate in this country. We had a great splash some years ago on the drug initiative. All that money was wasted on a splurge of advertising campaigns based on a scare technique rather than developing understanding. What has happened? There has been a crashing silence since then. We simply cannot afford that in either the defence of this country or issues such as the drug education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there has been a lowering of superpower tension. Australia has played a very honourable part through the last 45 years in supporting the Western democracies and in opposing communism and its expansion around the world. Despite vocal minorities at the time of the Korean war and the Vietnamese war, the will of the Australian community has basically been unquestioningly to support the Western democracies. Now we are seeking the success of that with a breakdown of communism in eastern Europe and around the world. That reduction in superpower tension will hopefully lead to the point we have always argued for on this side of the chamber, to merit mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in arms amongst the superpowers. But that does not apply to Australia. As I have said before, our capabilities at present are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem we face is that whilst things may be approaching a level of stability in Europe they are certainly not approaching any stability in the region in which we live. If we look at the revolt in Fiji, the troubles in Vanuatu, New Caledonia, the recent problems in Bougainville, the wars that are going on in the Philippines tonight, to say nothing of the reckless expansion of India in the South Asia region, we cannot come to any conclusion other than that all the cardinal signs are out, that instability is brewing in the region. I cannot predict what form it will take or at what time it will occur.</PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the signs that are emerging at the moment, we see the Pacific Rim as an expanding and rapidly developing economic area. History tells us that economic rivalry often leads to military tensions and military conflicts. It would be a very foolish person who looked at the region in which Australia is situated and did not see and take some prudent action to protect Australia's essential interests through the next decade or two. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility of the Government is to enter the debate against the disarmament groups that are at present running around the Australian community. The anti-nuclear groups are no longer fashionable but they have shown their true colours. They used to react very much in the debates conducted three for four years ago when they were accused of being unilateral disarmers and pacifists. They denied that very strongly at the time but it is the same group who have now come on the public scene talking about the reduction in superpower tension and talking not about the reduction in armaments, but about the total disbanding of any defence capability at all. They are using precisely the same arguments they used to deny they possessed at the time they were running the anti-nuclear campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> This argument is an irrational one. I was in the United States and the United Kingdom in January. The degree of irrationality by some of the proponents of the disarmament cause in the United States, and to a lesser degree in the United Kingdom, is really quite staggering. The Secretary of the Defense Department, Mr Chaney, in the United States is talking about marginal reductions in expenditure over the next five years. In total they are of the magnitude of $7 billion or $9 billion. Given the size of the American defense budget that is really just trimming the edges. It is not a massive winding back at all. There are people out there in public places with the expectations of up to $300 billion or $400 billion a year suddenly being available to put everyone in luxury and ease, to get rid of every bit of sickness and hardship within the community. It really is getting a little out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The lessons that this Government should draw from that are that it has to get into the public educational field and put a rational case for Australia to maintain and, indeed, improve, its defence capabilities. At the end of the day a mature society has to accept the responsibility for its own security. That security cannot be developed when trouble starts. Just as one must insure one's property, not wait until the floods come or the house is on fire, and pay an insurance premium for many years of which one sees no return, at least one has the security of mind of being prepared when the worst eventualities occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing that Senator McLean did not say earlier tonight as part of the new disarmament group was that Australia was embarking on a new round of militarism. I suppose he left that for Senator Vallentine. The Government has rationally and cogently to put the case for Australia to look after its own security. I am reminded of the problems we had five years ago when the peace movement was at its height. This Government just sat on its hands and did nothing at all. The battle against the peace and unilateral disarmers was carried on by the Liberal Party. It was the Liberal Party that organised the national peace through security campaign. It was organised on an individual State basis with an agreed central philosophy, talking about the importance of deterrence and about the need for mutual, verifiable and balanced reductions in arms. We held public meetings and wrote articles and the rest of it and fought the case and won it but nothing was done by this Government. My fear is that precisely the same position will take place unless the Government sees the danger of the position it is in and starts to move in a sustained and coherent way to educate the Australian public and gain their cooperation for the need for maintain our own security. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of specific points in relation to defence estimates that I wish to deal with. These have been triggered off by some of the discussions that took place in Estimates Committee B. The first point I want to talk about is the retention of the Chinook helicopters. Much has been made about the way the Chinook helicopters could have been used in the recent floods in April in western Queensland and western New South Wales. As the Minister said, the reason for retaining helicopters is for their military use, not for their civil use. If we have them for military reasons certainly it is possible and proper for them to be used in an emergency such as a flood, cyclone or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been involved in the floods in western Queensland and having seen at close hand what the Australian defence forces did it would have been useful to have the Chinook there. It may well have been cheaper for the Government to have used those helicopters and not the other airlift facilities-the Hercules, the Caribou and the Iroquois-but maybe it was not. Certainly no-one's life was lost and no property was damaged because the Chinooks were not used. It just may have been more convenient if we had them. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing that came out in the Minister's public statements about the use of those helicopters was the fact that their sale is under review. I applaud the Minister for this. He has taken a very important decision there. I would argue very strongly the case to retain all of those Chinook helicopters. The Minister is quoting the Department of Defence and saying that the proposition is to explore whether it is feasible to keep three or four and upgrade them to the later standard or whether to get rid of them. But it is simply not practicable to retain only three or four. The Chinook CH-47C is a successful helicopter because it is a heavy lift helicopter. It will lift a great deal more than the Iroquois, which is the other common service helicopter. We can get roughly six fully armed soldiers into an Iroquois; we can get better than 30 into a Chinook. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with the Chinook is that it is a bit of a mechanical nightmare, it is very manpower intensive to keep flying, and it is expensive. Because of that the rest of the air forces in the world have changed from using them. In the early 1980s the United States Air Force did an upgrade program when it converted the three C models to D models. Essentially it doubled the horsepower of the engines, put in new transmissions, rotors and instrumentation, and ended up with a helicopter which had twice the lifting capacity of the C model and therefore gave about twice the range, and required about half the maintenance man-hours in supporting it. This is a very successful helicopter. There has been a great demand for these helicopters around the world and most of the C models have been converted to Ds. </PARA>
<PARA> The original project study was done in the early 1980s and USAF and other air forces have seriously got into it from about 1987 onwards. The proposition that the manufacturer, Boeing Vertol, put to the Australian Government was that it could convert the Cs to Ds at a cost then of about $9m per aircraft. Even if it is double that, it is still very cheap. If it costs $16m or $18m, we must remember that the Black Hawk helicopter the Army is getting is costing around $14m. The Government said it simply could not afford that sort of money. That is not correct. Out of a Budget of $8 billion a year it can certainly afford a couple of hundred million for helicopters. Under this Government the budget for defence has been contracting and it is simply a cost saving exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 May 1989 the then Minister announced that the helicopter squadron, 12 Squadron, would be disbanded on 1 July 1989. There was no reason for the squadron to have been closed down then. We would have had enough spares holding in the country to have kept it in operation for probably a year or two before it would have run down. It really was a cost cutting exercise. The squadron was closed down on 1 July 1989 and the aircraft have been mothballed at Amberley ever since, pending sale. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question in the Senate last year Senator Richardson put the Government's point of view. He said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Chinook's tasks can be performed by the Black Hawk or by other elements of the force in being . . . the retention of the Chinook can be neither afforded nor justified. The Chinook costs about $7,080 per hour to operate, and the serviceability rates, despite the best efforts of the RAAF, have been very low. Australia's new battlefield helicopter, the Black Hawk, which will provide improved troop mobility, costs only $2,390 per hour to operate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the project cost to upgrade the 11 Chinooks would be of the order of $200m. I think the figure would be considerably lower than that but I am quite happy, for the purpose of debate, that that figure be accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> It is really very dishonest for Senator Richardson-and he is only quoting the figures in a press release from the then Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley-to say that it cost $7,000-odd an hour to operate a Chinook and only $2,300 to operate a Black Hawk. The point is that if he were operating a truck it would be cheaper still. The fact of the matter is that the earning capacity or the work capacity per hour of a Chinook is very much more than two or three times that of a Black Hawk, and a Black Hawk simply cannot do the job. The Chinook is an essential part of the Australian Army's operational system. It is the only helicopter we have which can lift the M198 155 millimetre Howitzer, a gun that weighs 7,163 kilograms. The present Chinooks, without the upgrade, will lift a gun, its crew of 11 and 35 rounds of ammunition. It is an essential part of the Army's mobility. Since we do not have any self-propelled artillery, it is essential that we have that mobility. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing about it is that it lifts heavy loads-heavy pallets of ammunition, very big rubber bladders full of fuel-and can deploy them at reasonably high speeds over considerable distances. The whole of the Australian Army's mobility pattern is built about having the Chinook. The new one will operate at a gross take-off weight, if the upgrade takes place, of 22,000 kilograms-somewhere in excess of 50,000 pounds that is; all up weight at take-off. The Black Hawk has a maximum take-off weight of only 9,900 kilograms. Its maximum payload is less than 5,000 kilograms. It is simply not in the same league, and there is no way we can equate two or three or four Black Hawks with one Chinook. They are simply designed to do different tasks, and we have a requirement for both. We have a requirement for a Black Hawk and we have a requirement for the Chinook. </PARA>
<PARA> The thinking behind the Minister's proposal-that we modify only three or four and sell the rest-is that what we get for the seven we sell will pay for the update of the other four. That is not a feasible thing to do. If we have only four helicopters, even though the maintainability of these will be very much better and they will last for 25 years when they are modified, we could not expect to have more than two on the line at any one time. If we start using them intensely we will lose one. We just do not have a viable fleet size to do anything with at those numbers. It is also economic nonsense to try to support only three or four aircraft. We cannot do it. By the time we train the crews, the maintenance crews and spares holding, the whole thing becomes wildly unbalanced. We have to do the eleven. It is simply a matter of rearranging some of the equipment priorities. We can easily find that $200m, even if we only space out the equipment delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that emerged in the defence estimates was debate about a helicopter platform. The Chief of the Naval Staff is pushing this rather strongly at the present time. I have spoken many times in the past about the need for maintaining the amphibious capability we had in this country which this Government has now disbanded. But it is quite wrong, in my judgment, to be talking about buying a new purpose-built ship. The correct procedure would be to modify not one but a number of the bulk carriers or container ships that are used around the Australian coast and to pay a subsidy to the owners to modify those ships so that we can put modules on board in an emergency which will provide the stores, the accommodation and the helicopter platforms for the operation of these ships in a supporting role. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, with the new ships that are being built-and we will be building new ships for the Australian coastal trade, as economic arguments about lower crew size, more efficient hull forms and the rest of it take place-the Government should be talking to the owners of these ships and, at the design stage, paying them a bounty to incorporate modifications which enable those ships to be used in an emergency as a helicopter support platform for an amphibious capability for the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this country have not had a very good record of using civilian assets for the Defence Force, but if we go back in history to the 1920s and 1930s it was quite common for the merchant marine in those days to be paid a subsidy by the government of the day to build in some defence capability. To a limited extent the Navy is doing this at the present time with COOP, the craft of opportunity minesweepers program, taking trawlers and modifying them slightly so that in an emergency they can be used as minesweepers. It is by far the preferable course, if we are in the market for a helicopter platform, to be looking at a civilian hull rather than a dedicated naval hull. It is far more cost effective to be doing that; but the provision of a helicopter ship happens to be a low priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The highest priority we have at the moment is the one that the Government does not address-that is, knowing what is going on in the air and sea space around our shores. I first spoke in 1979, and I have spoken consistently since then, on the need to develop and acquire an AEW capacity, that is, an airborne early warning capability, or preferably, an AWACs capability, that is, an airborne warning and control system. In 1982 I visited the Grumman aircraft corporation to look at its AWACs aircraft. In 1983 I visited Boeing to look at its E3A program and I have been twice to Lockheed. There are systems available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government keeps saying that it would cost far too much and it would be beyond us to buy an AWACs aircraft. But I do not believe that. We do not have to buy the capability that the British, French and Americans need for the intense electronic warfare atmosphere of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries. We can get by with a simpler and cheaper system. I estimate that the cost for a fleet of four would be somewhere around $800m, which is not an enormous amount of money when one looks at the amount being expended. At the present time the French are buying four E-3D AWACs aircraft from Boeing at a project cost, all in, of $US715m. That includes the price of simulators, spares, ground support training and the rest of it. That would be the upper limit of the cost to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of an AWACs capability is absolutely essential for all three Services-the Army, Navy and Air Force-because we must know what is going on around this country, even to use properly the new FA18s, the order for which was completed last week. That is the best contract the Government has ever entered into. It was written by a Liberal government after exhaustive investigation. The contract was delivered ahead of time and below cost. Despite the fairies at the bottom of the garden talking about a cost of $60m per aircraft, the true cost was about $24m per aircraft and it was extraordinarily cheap at the price. The only tragedy is that we did not buy more. It would be quite easy to pay for an AWACs capability by cancelling, or spreading out, the Navy contracts that we have at present. There is absolutely no argument for adding to the present order of six submarines, and the Government ought to kill that straight away. We certainly do not need a fleet of eight antique diesel-electric submarines. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the eight Anzac ships for which we have signed a contract, that contract has a break point in it at four. Those ships have a rather unfortunate design. They are simply of no use for what we require of them in the Pacific region. They are very expensive and functionally quite useless. They have a representational role. When Mr Paul Dibb first wrote his report and called for patrol frigates what was envisaged was a ship costing one third of these and about half their size. It would be quite proper for that program to be either spaced out or preferably reduced to four ships because our top priority is to be able to have knowledge of what is going on in our region. Unless we know what is going on we cannot effectively use the forces that we have. It is absolutely crucial, with a land, sea, and air area as vast as Australia's area of essential interest, that we know precisely what is going on, otherwise we dissipate all our forces by chasing will-o'-wisps over the whole area. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary need in relation to the Defence vote is for the Government to embark on an educational campaign regarding the need for this country to look after its own security. It should not only embark on a program, but sustain the argument and develop it, because we are going to be arguing this case for at least the next 10 years. I also propose to the Minister that he reassess the priorities that he has inherited with respect to the equipment program. Some of the equipment he has inherited is inappropriate. Clearly, we do have higher priorities. Even if the Minister is not prepared to cancel some of it, he, as the Minister, certainly has the ability to see that it is spaced out to allow more essential equipment to come on line at an earlier rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the lexicon of political terminology a new meaning has been given this year to the term `decisive mandate'. This Labor Government has made much of the fact that since 24 March it has achieved an `historic decisive mandate'. I would like to point out to the Senate just what this mandate represents. Final figures are not available yet, but Malcolm Mackerras estimates that, Australia wide, the Australian Labor Party obtained 49.4 per cent of the vote and the Liberal and National parties 50.6 per cent. In other words, Labor once again failed to obtain the majority of votes in percentage terms, with the coalition winning about 60,000 more votes than Labor. Of the first preference votes Labor won 39.7 per cent of the primaries, its lowest level since the 1977 election. The coalition gained 43.3 per cent-the Liberals 34.9 per cent and the Nationals 8.4 per cent. A decisive mandate? These are not precisely the figures I would have used to describe the word `decisive'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia today there are six Labor governments and five of these won government with a minority of the vote in percentage terms. In the last Victorian State election Labor received 49.5 per cent of the two party preferred vote; 47.5 per cent in Western Australia; and 48.1 per cent in South Australia. In Tasmania, which has a different voting system for State elections, a minority Labor government in terms of seats governs with the support of Green Independents. In South Australia the Liberals recently won 51 per cent of the primary vote and could not achieve government. In Queensland, in the most recent State election-and I remind honourable senators that it was fought on exactly the same boundaries as the 1986 election-Labor won 51.4 per cent of the primary vote and gained 59 per cent of the seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest anybody quickly resurrects that dreaded beast the gerrymander, let me remind the Senate that in the last election in which my husband led the National Party to victory in Queensland, in 1986, it gained 39 per cent of the primary vote. The two party preferred vote never dropped below 51 per cent while my husband was Premier and, indeed, went as high as 59 per cent. It averaged 53 per cent during the 20-year period of government-a record unparalleled in Australian political history. We have to remember that in the Senate, where one cannot gerrymander the electorates, the swing to the Opposition is clearly shown by the fact that three coalition senators were returned in each State except New South Wales, where Senator Chris Puplick lost by only 450 votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Hawke at present rules this nation with a comfortable majority on a primary vote of 39 per cent. Clearly, at the national level, and in Labor States, there is a gerrymander through the one vote, one value system. But where are the cries of gerrymander from the media? One could even be sarcastic and suggest an inquiry into this matter. Let us put to rest once and for all this gerrymander nonsense. I only trust that this Government will use its so-called `decisive mandate' or `comfortable majority' to recognise what the true majority of Australians need and are asking for. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the present three-year term of this Government I believe that even with one vote, one value the people of Australia will indeed vote for a change of government. I fear that this Government is already presenting a despairing future for the livelihoods of our fellow Australians, whether they be in the cities, provincial towns, or rural areas. As my colleague Senator Tambling described it, this Government has come up with a barren and bleak vision for the future, one that offers more to Cambodia and Antarctica than it does to northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently this Government failed to truly acknowledge the impact and cost of the recent devastating floods in western Queensland and New South Wales. This is on top of the fact that since coming to power in 1983 it has consistently failed to acknowledge the escalating costs of living for families in rural areas. It will be weeks before the full extent of the flood damage is known because over one million kilometres, the size of Germany, France and Britain combined, were flooded and significant additional areas will be flooded in the next few weeks as the floods move down the Cooper Creek into northern South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The severity and extent of the floods was highlighted by the need to evacuate Charleville and Nyngan; Cunnamulla almost suffered the same fate. There has been a magnificent response by the State Emergency Service, police, armed forces, council personnel, farmers and volunteers generally. Evacuees have shown courage and forbearance. Unfortunately there has been significant loss of crops, particularly vegetables and cotton, thousands of cattle and already thousands of sheep, with more to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Evacuation would have been easier and fewer livestock lost if the Government still had Chinook helicopters available. There is widespread support for retaining two or three for national disaster work. Unfortunately, 11 Chinooks are mothballed at Amberley air force base and the Government has advertised for a management consultant to sell them and their related spare parts. I was very interested too to listen to Senator MacGibbon, who spoke just before me, giving us some very important and interesting details about the Chinook helicopters, particularly of course in relation to their defence capability as well. However, I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Robert Ray for his commitment in answer to a question that I asked him the other week to review the sale of these helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said the Australian Taxation Office will be sympathetic to requests by farmers and small businessmen for extensions of time to pay tax or complete provisional tax variation applications. However, there are two areas of taxation which are of considerable importance to the viability of the affected farmers. The first is the ability to obtain provisional tax rebates, even after the tax has been paid, as the floods have dramatically changed the potential income of many graziers, and a more realistic tax deductability for new fencing following a natural disaster such as flood or fire. In relation to that, I know from experience the tremendous damage that can be wrought to fences after a flood because we suffered the same problem on the Mackenzie River with a flood just a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> These floods are of course only a continuation of the trials that rural Australia has been facing in recent years. This Government proudly proclaims that it is in tune with the man on the land, that it is listening to and heeding the calls of average Australia. I say that it is not. As I have noted in the Senate many times before, there is not much point producing a product if it cannot be sold profitably. Similarly, it is not much use to so rationalise our rural sector that eventually we see the demise of the family farmer, the person who spends unrecognised hours and efforts producing that end product. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary industries and energy sector of our economy is usually represented by regions far outside Australia's major population centres. They represent about 80 per cent of Australia's merchandising exports which have a major role to play in meeting two important national challenges: these are the current account deficit and related foreign debt level and the management of our natural resources to provide for ecologically sustainable longterm development. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators would know, I represent a State which is very proud of its place in helping Australia to meet its economic challenges. Queensland is a very decentralised State. It is a State which is at least 1,500 miles to the north and then 1,000 miles to the west. I have made many trips over the years throughout the State and realised the value of primary industries and the tremendous contribution they make to the economy. However, it saddens me that too often people, especially many in the Government, fail to realise the tremendous cost to rural industries in trying to meet the challenges of giving Australia a buoyant economy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government chooses to penalise those who work in our primary industries and sometimes, I think, deliberately, fails to recognise not only the physical hardship of working in that environment, but also the tremendous financial burden being placed on the shoulders of the man on the land. Perhaps I had better say on the woman of the land too in most cases, because the woman really does stand behind the man in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to have the land and the seed to grow the crops or allow the livestock to graze, but often what is forgotten is that to get to the end product, to make ends meet, the man on the land has to rely on things over which he has no control. First of all he has to hope that he has rain to let the crops grow. He has to hope that there will be good markets and prices for his goods, that interest rates will not cripple him, that fuel prices will not be prohibitive and that the roads to transport those goods will be passable. After he plants the seed and waits for rain, the farmer then would possibly have to clean up the crop for weeds and spray for bugs. Finally, if he does get a crop to harvest he either looks at using large machinery which costs an enormous amount of money to buy or otherwise employs workers to come in and help with the harvesting. This is where a lot of expenses come into being on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> So many expenses are often multiplied by the cost of fuel. If all the tax on fuel were used on roads, rural people, indeed people everywhere in Australia, I believe, would feel much better. We all recognise that road funding is becoming increasingly critical to Australia as the consequences of the current government cutbacks are becoming more and more apparent. These consequences do not show up in the short term. They occur progressively as a result of lower maintenance standards and an inability to increase the capacity of the roads system to meet growing demand. Ultimately they produce higher vehicle operating costs, less efficient industries, and more road deaths and injuries.</PARA>
<PARA> Unprecedented publicity campaigns by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) and the Queensland Local Government Association show the seriousness of the situation at grassroots level. I am sure that many honourable senators are aware of road deficiencies in their own localities, which need urgent attention. Cuts have had a major impact, particularly in country areas. It has become impossible to keep up with the demand for new and improved roads to cater for the needs of the transport industry and the individual motorist. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year the RACQ undertook a State-wide survey of roads and found that country roads are so rough that motorists are often forced to drive on the shoulders rather than on the potholed bitumen. It found that many roads become impassable when it rains and that they are deteriorating more rapidly than city and shire councils can repair them. Existing networks are rapidly falling into disrepair because of the decline in maintenance allocations. While the Federal Government continues to tax road users at discriminatory levels it must take major responsibility for funding roads. </PARA>
<PARA> About half of the money spent by motorists on petrol goes to the Federal Government. For every litre of petrol or diesel purchased, the Government takes about 23c in tax, returning only about 5 3/4c to the motorists in the form of road funding. This has a particularly draining effect on the financial capacity of people in rural areas to survive. Not only do these people pay higher costs for that fuel, as it has to be transported to them, but they use far more fuel in order to travel the further distances. Yet I am sure that if most Australian motorists were surveyed we would find that they would not complain at the high level of tax they pay for every litre of petrol if they knew that that money went into improving our current road network. However, sad to say, it does not. Instead, it goes into Consolidated Revenue, never to be used on roads but rather on social engineering programs of a dubious and, perhaps, questionable value. </PARA>
<PARA> Often, when assessing the rural industries, we talk only in terms of how much they have contributed to Australia's growth and not of the effort made to achieve exports. However, I would like to remind the Senate that in an effort to achieve low cost internationally competitive industries, the Government has to be aware that it could be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. If in the process to achieve cost efficient industries we push the small family farmer off the land, we, in the long run, are serving no real good purpose for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Only late last year many honourable Senators would have read of disturbing figures which show that farmers are losing money fast with costs increasing at twice the rate of income. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics September quarter index showed an average 1.2 per cent increase on prices received, whereas this was heavily outweighed by a 2.1 per cent increase in the costs paid out. This has occurred under a Labor Government which then has the effrontery to claim that farmers are pleased with the Federal Government and that it is aiming to provide a cost efficient farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what criteria the Government would use for such a claim but I can assure honourable senators that if a person's income is being steadily eroded at a rate where the costs to earn it are twice the rate of actual income, any thinking Australian would know that that person is going backwards and would not be too happy with that situation. Perhaps that is what this Government means by cost efficiency in the rural sector! I do not believe that any honourable senators in this place would be happy to see their income eroding quickly like that. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be ever vigilant that we do not allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to replace the needs of people. This is what is happening in many industries today and it is at the expense of one of the most important sections of our community-the economic survival of the small family farmer. I am very pleased, indeed, to have this opportunity in the Senate tonight to put down some of the problems that so many rural people are experiencing at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I come from the south Burnett region where a task force has had to be set up to look at all of the problems of the peanut industry, the navy bean industry and the soya bean industry. We have had so many bad seasons in that area that farmers are unable to find enough money to carry on. They are in a situation where they really need some substantial financial help. If they cannot get it from the banks I would like to think that the Government would be willing to help in situations such as that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Senate is debating cognately a series of Bills relating to sales tax. When governments amend sales tax legislation, they must actually amend a series of Bills to conform with the constitutional requirement that separate taxing Bills are necessary for each item subject to tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate tonight must be described as unusual. I use that word for a particular purpose, because this legislation offends the Government's own dogma in two important respects. Firstly, this legislation runs counter to the Button car plan, which is about the lowering of tariffs. The legislation before us actually introduces a new level of tariff. That is effectively what it does. Secondly, it is in breach of the guidelines of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which are set out in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Handbook, to the effect that legislation by press release is only to be, to use the words of that particular handbook, issued under the Prime Minister's pen and justifiable to correct an abuse of or a deficiency in revenue laws. The principle in that is that, inherent in legislation by press release, there is a retrospective practice which is to be abhorred by all who wish to be governed by the rule of law. Legislation by press release makes a mockery of the rule of law. Tonight, before we debate this legislation, it offends on two counts: it runs contrary to the Government's own Button car plan and it is in breach of the Government's own guidelines in respect of the need for a press release to conform to the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> These sales tax Bills were not part of the 1989 Budget, but rather were part of a so-called February economic statement following an accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) which was approximately accord mark six. This was produced in a hothouse atmosphere leading up to the last election. It is often referred to as the politics of envy. The success of these so-called accords which I have referred to is rather dubious. The Institute of Public Affairs has reminded us of the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Latest OECD figures show that during the period of the Accord the rate of growth in Australian labour costs increased much more than in other OECD countries. After falling below the OECD rate in 1984, the growth rate in Australia's labour costs has now jumped to twice that for the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA> Other results of the research show that, although the average growth rate in Australia's labour cost was slower during the Accord period than in the previous seven years, OECD labour costs slowed even more. As other OECD countries did not have accords, this could suggest the Accord may not have been a significant influence in reducing labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation before the Senate increases from 30 per cent to 50 per cent the rate of sales tax on motor cars and station wagons, which also includes four-wheel drives, with a wholesale value of over $28,793. When calculating depreciation values, this is an upper limit of $42,910. It has a brighter side, in that the legislation also contains provisions to reduce from 30 per cent to 20 per cent the rate of sales tax on motor vehicles that have been specifically fitted out for the transportation of disabled persons who are seated in wheelchairs. These vehicles are generally referred to as metrocabs. This reduction is indeed welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation should produce a net revenue gain of $105m in a full year. However, the Federated Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Motor Trades Association of Australia believe that the revenue effect will be neutral because of an expected downturn in sales arising from the increased tax. This tax was to have first applied from 1 April. It has been deferred until 1 May, the date in the proposed legislation before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems so far as the industry is concerned. It is not surprising that the industry is complaining that it cannot impose a tax at the higher rate until the legislation is passed, yet will be liable for the tax when the retrospective law is passed. However true this may be, the Australian Taxation Office has intervened and indicated that no penalties will apply to dealers who impose the higher charge because the new impost will be easy to avoid for some months and it may even provide some windfall gains to some unscrupulous dealers, as I will explain later. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of these particular problems with the commencement date, I now foreshadow an Opposition amendment which will be moved during the committee stage and which will delete the operative date of 1 May. This will have the effect of the Bill coming into play 28 days after receiving royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that the sales tax is levied at the time of the last wholesale sale-that is, from wholesaler to retailer. Car dealers for many years have deferred sales tax by adopting what is known as a floor plan arrangement whereby the dealers do not obtain legal title to the vehicles until immediately before they sell them. However, if the dealers buy the luxury vehicles before 1 May, the new sales tax will not apply even though the car may not be sold to a consumer for many months or even years afterwards. Indeed, some not necessarily unscrupulous but perhaps forward thinking dealers could overcome the problems of future sales by this mechanism. But some unscrupulous dealers could even charge customers the full 50 per cent of tax even though they bought the vehicle at the current 30 per cent impost, as a result of the arrangements which I have mentioned before, through the operation of separate wholesale and retail companies. The Government would be blamed, with the car dealer making enormous profits. </PARA>
<PARA> The luxury car market has surged prior to the announcement of this imposition date, with many prospective sales crystallising prior to 1 May. A severe lull is now expected, except for those who purchased forward using this mechanism of interposed companies. The legislation actually runs counter to the Button car plan and causes certain legal problems faced by dealers. I wish to draw attention to the article in the Australian by its legal correspondent David Solomon, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that the Government has put Australia's new car dealers in an impossible position. Apparently if dealers charge the 50 per cent tax rate due to their customers, they are clearly acting illegally and would be subject to heavy penalties. If they charge customers only the existing 30 per cent they will be later hit by the Tax Office for a retrospective tax of 20 per cent and possible penalties which they cannot legally recover from their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is just not good enough for the Government to put dealers in a double jeopardy situation by trying to make them collect taxes from consumers which are illegal and must remain so until and unless the Parliament legislates to change the present law. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the Opposition proposes an amendment that has the effect of deleting clause 2, which means that the provisions of the Bill, if it is passed, will come into being 28 days after the Bill has received royal assent. It is indeed an inequitable tax. It is very selective. It is a tax of envy. It is a tax to placate the traditional Labor vote, brought in not at Budget time but immediately before an election. Why does the Government not choose other commodities-champagne, perfume, caviar? Why cars at a certain rate? The legislation will cause a number of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are debating this item of sales tax, I must say that it is pleasing that the Australian Taxation Office is rewriting its sales tax rulings to remove so many of its inconsistencies and to standardise the rulings in line with the current law. The Government should go a long way further. Sales tax needs a complete revision because of its arbitrary classifications, its ad hoc composition and the difficulties of finding a proper wholesale value in an age when wholesale merchants are so few in number compared with, say, 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition has rightly put on the agenda for community debate the reform of the indirect tax base. In fact, the coalition leadership shows in this consumption tax debate that the coalition continues to set the political agenda. Debate on our side of politics acknowledges that pensioners and low or fixed income earners need to be appropriately compensated in any discussion relating to a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Government is peddling the admirable concept of simplifying the tax laws, we have before the Senate legislation which adds a new dimension, a new scale, a new rate. We are lifting the sales tax on luxury cars from 30 per cent to 50 per cent-an election ploy, as one newspaper said, to consolidate Labor's traditional vote. But it is another example of a quick fix solution to the hard task of trying to mend an economy that is increasingly moving into recession. Unfortunately, this quick fix mentality, appealing to traditional voters, is no way of overcoming the current dilemmas faced by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement during the election campaign of the imposition of this dramatic increase in the sales tax on luxury cars is a prime example of a practice which has caused much concern. The choice of the effective date-1 April, moved to 1 May-all the complications and legalities that dealers will have to face and the unfortunate but necessary intervention by the Australian Taxation Office to indicate that it would not be implementing penalties make for a bad case of tax legislation; it is a bad example of tax administration. </PARA>
<PARA> This example of legislation by press release under these circumstances is most abhorrent. It is abhorrent because it runs counter to the principle that we should not have retrospectivity, particularly in areas where there is no special justification for it, for example, to correct an abuse or deficiency in revenue laws. Not all would agree with that concept, but the Labor Party does. It runs contrary to its own written statement, to its own dogma. So we have an example of legislative expediency which makes for poor legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Only two makes of cars produced in Australia fall into this category, the Ford LTD and the Holden Statesman Caprice-vehicles that do not have a high share of the luxury car market. The effect will be a new tariff imposed on cars, although it is written into sales tax legislation. It will raise the cost of imported cars because they are a large component of the Australian luxury car market. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is bad legislation. It was introduced through press release. It is retrospective in nature. The concern is that the new level of tax may not raise anywhere near the amount of revenue claimed by the Government. It could have a negative impact on employment and business viability. The practical effect of it will be to impose a de facto tariff on imported vehicles in direct contravention of the Button car plan. The new tax may also impinge on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations which this Government has been so proud of in raising Australia's profile. I believe that the introduction of those Bills is unfortunate. It is bad legislation and it is unnecessary. </PARA>

It mirrors the decision by a previous government to place an upper limit on the price of a car which can be claimed through depreciation, coincidentally the very same level at which this iniquitous tax cuts in, which for this financial year will be a retail price of $42,910. That was a limit without any justification when it was introduced, just as is this proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is described as `a tax on luxury cars'. I would say `so-called luxury cars', because what really defines a luxury car? Is it to be price? The price of the cars on which this tax will be imposed, with a couple of exceptions, is set by the Federal Government because they are all imported. There is only one reason why most of those cars are above the threshold for the imposition of the tax and that is the effect of tariffs and quotas which are increasing the landed cost of those vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> So what, in effect, we are saying-through the imposition of this legislation to increase this tax-is a tax on a tax. Do we define a luxury car by the quality of the car, by the standard of safety or performance or equipment that the car provides? Is it the lack of equivalent quality in Australian vehicles? Is not that lack of quality in domestically produced vehicles one of the major problems of the Australian car industry? The cars which are to be attacked by this tax represent that to which the Australian product should aspire-the quality of performance, the quality of safety and the quality of equipment and finish which those cars offer. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the use of the term `luxury' with regard to the cars which will be affected by this tax is a pejorative attempt by this Government to arouse the politics of envy, as my colleague Senator Watson said a few moments ago. It is an attempt to justify the introduction of this iniquitous charge. As I said, this arbitrary imposition of tax is totally without justification, just as was the earlier introduction of the limit on depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth referring to the issue of the depreciation limit as part of this issue. Just as this new tax is totally unjustified, so is the continuation of the limit on depreciation. The new cars to which that depreciation limit now applies under the fringe benefits tax and substantiation rules, which this Government introduced, no longer can be used to escape taxation in the way that applied when the depreciation limit was introduced. So those vehicles ought now to be fully depreciable. Instead of increasing the present 30 per cent sales tax on those vehicles above the price limit which applies-the $42,910 retail price, as is provided in this legislation-the Government ought to be legislating to reduce to 20 per cent the level of sales tax charges, which is the rate charged on all other motor vehicles. At the same time, it ought to initiate legislation to withdrawn the depreciation limit on those vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> To justify the imposition of this tax, the Government has to answer three questions. They are three questions which it totally failed to answer in the debate in the other place on this legislation before it came up to the Senate for consideration. Firstly, is an increase in what is already a discriminatory tax on quality cars justified? Secondly, is the tax consistent with the direction provided for the car industry in the Button plan, although one wonders, with the events of last week, what the direction of that plan really is. Thirdly, are the revenue assumptions of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) correct with regard to the imposition of the tax? The short answer to every one of those questions is no, no and no. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to place on record the contribution to the labour movement of Cecil Thompson Oliver-better known as Charlie Oliver-who died on 24 February this year at the age of 88. Charlie's life was, in modern terms, an amazing one. If it were offered up as a film script it would probably be rejected for being too far fetched. Before he settled full time into union politics he had been a farm labourer, steel worker, fencer, well sinker, gold miner, horse breaker, and farmer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was born on 23 December 1901 at Bangor in Wales. As a boy he also lived in Chester and Ellesmere Port near Liverpool. His life centred around unionism and politics from the age of 13 when he joined the Agricultural Workers Union after leaving school with a permit to work on farms driving horses for, as he said, two and six a week and all his tucker. Even at this young age he worked from daylight to dark and, remember, this was as recently as the First World War. At the same time he attended his first British Labour Party meeting and although he was too young to join, this marked the beginning of his life long commitment to Labor's cause. </PARA>
<PARA> As a teenager he also worked at the steelworks at Ellesmere Port where, as was common, he lost his front teeth in the acid steam of the mill. Just after the First World War, when he was in his late teens, he and his elder brother Jack decided to come to Australia. Jack had been seriously wounded at Gallipoli and they thought that Australia's warmer climate would assist his health. They disembarked at Albany in Western Australia and Charlie started work in the goldmine at Meekatharra. He was an active member of the Miners Union there and became a delegate to the Murchison District Labor Council of Unions. His career in the Australian Workers Union (AWU) began in 1923 when the Miners Federation amalgamated with the AWU. He was secretary of the Murchison District Trades and Labor Council by 1928 and a member of the AWU Executive in 1934 and then Secretary of the mining division of the Australian Workers Union from 1944 to 1948. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well worth noting, as former member of the House of Representatives, John Armitage, did when he delivered Charlie's funeral oration in February, that Charlie Oliver started the fight to gain adequate compensation for the many miners he saw around him suffering the dreadful consequences of silicosis. This becomes doubly significant when we know that Charlie himself contracted silicosis and, in fact, finally died from its effects. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1948 Charlie Oliver was elected to the Western Australian Parliament. He easily won the seat of Boulder-in fact that was Labor's safest Western Australian State seat-and in that election he defeated Billy Mackie Snedden who was later to become the Federal Leader of the Liberal Party and also Speaker of the House of Representatives. At the subsequent general election Charlie Oliver was re-elected unopposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I read Charlie's contributions in the Hansard of the Western Australian Parliament and I was struck by the consistent theme of empathy for the battlers in our society. Of course, he continued through the parliamentary forum to fight for the rights of workers to decent wages and working conditions. His commitment to Aboriginal people was already evident in his speeches and this commitment continued throughout his life. For example, he was a board member of Tranby Co-Operative College for Aborigines in Glebe until his death. </PARA>
<PARA> In mid-1951 Charlie Oliver resigned his seat in the West Australian Parliament, at the request of Tom Dougherty, the General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, so that he could become Secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the AWU. He moved to Sydney and back into the trade union movement full time. As John Armitage said at the funeral, Charlie's first love was the Australian Workers Union. I might say that there are not many politicians who would resign their seat in Parliament to serve the trade union movement, and Charlie Oliver was certainly a rare breed. </PARA>
<PARA> Charlie Oliver served as an officer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party from 1956 to 1960 and as President of the Branch from 1960 to 1970. He also served on the ALP's Federal Executive for many years. Right through the 1950s and 1960s, Charlie Oliver played a pivotal role in Labor politics. When I got to know him in the early 1970s he still exerted considerable influence in the Party. In 1975-I am sure you would recall, Mr President-he was responsible for ensuring that the Party conference in New South Wales remained a large and significant forum and his resolution to maintain the conference was carried against the opposition of both the established right and left wing factions of the New South Wales Branch of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1975, when I was a young delegate to the State Congress of the New South Wales Branch of the ALP, Charlie Oliver gave me this booklet, which is the official report of the sixty-ninth annual convention of the Australian Workers Union held in Sydney from 24 January to 4 February 1955. I treasure this rare booklet. In my view it is, without doubt, the best expose I have read of the activities of the industrial groupers-also known as `the Movement'-that operated in the ALP in the early and mid-1950s. It contains a very long address from Charlie Oliver who was at that time New South Wales Branch Secretary of the AWU. Over the years I became used to long speeches from Charlie Oliver. Charlie spoke regularly at the New South Wales ALP annual conference and he was such a dominant figure that no-one in the conference from any faction, be they friend or foe, would object to the length of his speeches even though he usually was in breach of the conference orders. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not. Charlie, like all other delegates, was entitled to a five minute speech but usually spoke for over 20 minutes before some courageous individual got up to move for an extension of time. But in the AWU conference in 1955 he delivered a stinging attack on the activities of the industrial groups. His speech at that time must have taken some three hours to deliver as he dissected the groupers and their activities bit by bit. Like a number of others, including some from the Left of the Labor Party, who became bitterly opposed to the policies of the groupers, he initially supported the Groupers because of his anti-communist feelings. However, in the mid-1950s he became appalled at their comprehensive and ruthless grab for power in the union movement and the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Charlie Oliver was hardly regarded as a lefty within the Labor Party, so I think it is important to place on record that he played a significant role in preventing the Groupers from gaining total control of the New South Wales Branch of the Labor Party and influence in the Australian Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> What also came through in Charlie Oliver's speech was his extraordinary commitment to the labour movement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is only right and proper when you are given a position of trust in the labour movement, you should carry out its policies; don't you think it is reasonable to expect that of people put into high positions. That is our task-to straighten them up. </PARA>
<PARA>Charlie Oliver was a man who believed in balance in the Labor Party. He was always uncomfortable with those of the extreme left or the extreme right. He fought against any faction or tendency gaining untrammelled power. He summed up his philosophy in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> I go straight up the middle. If the Labor Party swings left, I go right. If it swings right, I go left. </PARA>
<PARA>This is why it was so difficult to put a simple ideological tag on Charlie Oliver. He was a tolerant man. He accepted that differences in views and emphasis were part and parcel of Labor politics. I maintained a personal friendship with Charlie for many years, even though we often differed in our political views. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish briefly to pay tribute to Necia Holloway. After Charlie moved to New South Wales, he was always able to depend on the support of his secretary and friend, Necia Holloway. Necia's great commitment to Charlie continued right through his retirement and she nursed him with loving care until his death. Charlie Oliver was a towering figure in the Labor Party in New South Wales. His contribution to our Party will never be forgotten by those of us who were privileged to know him and who have benefited from our association with him over the years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very rarely that I use the adjournment debate. When I do, it is to air views or issues that I believe are important. Tonight is one such occasion. I wish again to draw the attention of the Senate to my call for a parliamentary inquiry into family law. Those who involve themselves in this subject generally fall into one of two groups-professional interest or personal interest. I have no training in law and I have no involvement in the Family Court of Australia. My interest over the past 12 months is simply as a result of the many hundreds of calls, letters and visits that I and my office have had from people who are so thoroughly disenchanted with the administration of family law that they have urged me to do something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could recount to the Senate horrific tales of injustice. I could regale honourable senators with long, detailed histories of the most unbelievable, cruel and petty acts perpetrated by people seeking revenge. I could show the Senate legal bills from otherwise thoroughly respectable solicitors who have managed to take in fees people's entire property settlements and still not achieve a result for the people they are meant to be helping. These stories appear daily in newspapers across the country. They cause great headlines for a day but few people bother to look behind the story and remember that it is not some soap opera being played out but a real life drama. Frankly, it seems that society has become either desensitised to these things or bored with the frequency of the stories. </PARA>
<PARA> One such story appeared in the Sun of last Saturday, 19 May. I will not go into the details but, in essence, a man cut short his legal battle to win custody of his son because he could simply no longer afford to keep fighting. That does not alter his belief that the child's mother is unfit to have custody; it simply came down to what he could afford. He was told that it would cost another $75,000 if he prolonged his action. That is simply out of the reach of the average Australian. The wife was told it would cost her the same amount. That story is not particularly unusual. Some of the aspects of the case made it sensational, but it or a version of it occurs daily in our Family Court. I have evidence of another person who has already spent $160,000 and has been told that it will cost at least another $100,000 before his case is concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> People are now finding that it is too expensive to fight for justice. This is not just a criticism made by dissatisfied litigants. Justice Elizabeth Evatt has also publicly questioned the zeal with which some solicitors fix their fees for family law matters. We are told that in family law there is a notion that the interests of the child are paramount. Clearly, the child's best interests are not always paramount. In the case I have just quoted, the child's interests were buried amongst the side issues and the cost of the matter. The criticisms of the Family Court are not just of its costs. We are told that, on the issue of custody, the Family Law Act does not favour either parent. Yet I have on file literally hundreds of letters from fathers which, if only half of them were true-and I am not suggesting for a minute that any of them are false-would give rise to grave misgivings about our system of justice. Lest it be thought that I am promoting the cause of fathers at the expense of mothers, I add that I have also had similar, but not as many, letters from women who have had difficulties with custody. For women with custody the complaints concern maintenance. The difficulties in obtaining maintenance from fathers who do not wish to pay are equally frequent. Again, the present system has failed them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that under current family law legislation access is provided for and can be set down as a ruling of the court. Yet, once again, I have hundreds of letters that detail breaches of access orders on which no action can be or has been taken. Last year I called for a thorough review of the administration of family law in Australia. I know that I have the support of many honourable senators in this chamber for such an inquiry. The Opposition parties felt sufficiently strongly about it to have it specifically written into our law and justice policy. I have no hesitation in saying that had we won the election the inquiry would now be a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> There are thousands of people outside this place waiting for such an inquiry to be called so that they may air their grievances and put to us their views on revision of the Act. Their ideas ought to be heard. While ever they are not, we are allowing a volcano to build up in the community. I call on all parties in this chamber to do more than mouth platitudes. We have been elected to this place to represent our constituents. Establishing an inquiry into family law administration would be responding to our constituents in a positive manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate and the people the regrettable situation that exists in New South Wales, where the State's environmental planning procedures and the responsibilities of State environmental agencies are being undermined by the actions of the Greiner-Murray Government. These concerns are illustrated by the involvement of the New South Wales Premier and his Ministers at various stages in the consideration of a proposed residential development on the slopes of Mount Jerrabomberra, near Queanbeyan, promoted by one Mr Alex Brinkmeyer. Mr Brinkmeyer was until recently the President of the Queanbeyan Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia. At least four other office bearers of the branch have held substantial shareholdings in a company which owns land on Mount Jerrabomberra, promoted by Mr Brinkmeyer as the Jerrabomberra Heights Estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mount Jerrabomberra covers an area of about 300 hectares. During European settlement, disturbance to the vegetation on the mountain has been minimal. This is reflected in the number of original species present and a limited invasion by weeds. Detailed studies have revealed Mount Jerrabomberra to be an environmentally significant area, supporting communities of natural grasslands. The mountain also supports Rutidosis leptorrhynoides, a rare and endangered plant, and the largest population in existence of Diuris semilunulata, a rare orchid. Other significant plant species are Grevillea ramossisima and Dillwynia cinerascens, the rare parrot pea plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The mountain also supports rare woodland associations and has an intact understorey. These diverse plant communities support a wide variety of wildlife, including 94 species of birds, 16 species of reptiles and 15 species of mammals. The natural and other heritage values of Mount Jerrabomberra are of such significance that Mr Michael Calkovics, the Secretary of the Mount Jerrabomberra Preservation Society and a resident of the Australian Capital Territory, has nominated the site for listing on the Register of the National Estate. I understand that the Australian Heritage Commission will soon be considering the nomination for an interim listing. In addition, I have been informed by Mr Calkovics of the concern of his Society at the likely effects of the proposed development at Mount Jerrabomberra on the adjacent Jerrabomberra wetlands, which provide habitat for the latham snipe, one of a number of migratory bird species which the Commonwealth has an obligation to protect under the provisions of the Japan-Australia migratory birds agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> As long ago as December 1963, a request was made by the Queanbeyan municipality to J. W. Sieffert, MLA, to establish Mount Jerrabomberra as a national park. In May 1964 the district surveyor from the Lands Department, Goulburn, sent a report to the Director of Parks Services in the Lands Department recommending resumption of the area for `passive recreation' purposes. This recommendation was supported by the Minister for Lands, the Yarrowlumla Shire and the Queanbeyan municipality. The value of the 632 acres of Mount Jerrabomberra in 1964 was put at #10,500. This was to be paid in equal parts by the Lands Department, the Yarrowlumla shire and the Queanbeyan municipality. The proposal, unfortunately, did not go ahead due to insufficient funds within the Yarrowlumla shire. The land was not purchased in subsequent years due to insufficient data on the biological status of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1986 Jerrabomberra Estates Ltd, whose principal was Mr Alex Brinkmeyer, made a submission to the Queanbeyan City Council for the development of a housing estate on the slopes of Mount Jerrabomberra. This development, if allowed to proceed, would affect about 200 hectares of open woodland on the mountain. Within this area there are several important plant communities. These are, firstly, button wrinklewort-Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides-which is listed as an endangered plant species. A report by Anutech Pty Ltd, consultants to the developer in 1988, confirmed that about 300 to 400 individual plants of this species occur on Jerrabomberra Heights Estate. All are on the lower slopes and within the proposed development area and would be largely eliminated by development. Secondly, the orchid Diuris semilunulata which, according to Anutech, is likely to be listed in the near future as a rare species. Mount Jerrabomberra is the type locality from which the species was originally described. Thirdly, the parrot pea Dillwynia cinerascens, which I am informed by Mr Calkovics has only recently been discovered in New South Wales, the only know locality being on Mount Jerrabomberra. Fourthly, the golden wattle Acacia pycnantha which is Australia's official floral emblem. I am informed that Dr John Briggs of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Division of Plant Industry has expressed the opinion that whilst uncertainties remain regarding the taxonomic status of the Mount Jerrabomberra Acacia pycnantha, there is certainly merit in preserving the population. Fifthly, the Grevillea ramossisima which, according to Anutech, occurs only at Mount Jerrabomberra in the immediate region. It does not occur, according to Anutech's knowledge, in a proposed reserve which is to protect 100 hectares on the summit of Mount Jerrabomberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Anutech further reported that if the development was to proceed there appeared no possible way of mitigating the loss of vegetation on the eastern and southern fringes of the development, which are already surrounded by areas of land put to agricultural and urban use. These consultants said that as far as fauna is concerned the values of minimising the clearing of native vegetation were of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA> To offset the effects of the proposed development, an area of 100 hectares on the summit of the mountain was proposed to be set aside by the developer as an environmental protection area. This proposal was outlined in the draft local environment plan (LEP) under which the rezoning of the land to permit residential development was to be effected. That draft plan is known as draft local environment plan No. 54 for the City of Queanbeyan. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am informed by Mr Calkovics that a submission was also made by Mr Alex Brinkmeyer's company for a major tourist complex on the same land and was rejected by the Department of Environment and Planning in 1987. I am informed that the Department rejected a proposed cable car with tourist facilities on Mount Jerrabomberra after coming to the view that a certificate was unlikely to be issued for a plan permitting such a use. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, there are large water storage tanks and associated clearing of vegetation for pipe laying has been carried out on the proposed summit reserve with undetermined environmental effects. This work was carried out by the Queanbeyan City Council. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 May 1985 the Queanbeyan Age reported Mr Alex Brinkmeyer as saying he wanted to `apply for initial rezoning of the land below the 640 metre line'. However, I am informed that in a submission to the Queanbeyan City Council relating the draft LEP for the rezoning, a rezoning of land up to the 670 metre line of elevation was contemplated. Concern that the environmental significance of the area would be seriously compromised led to the formation of the Jerrabomberra Preservation Society by Mr Calkovics and other concerned citizens of Queanbeyan and surrounding areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that when Mr Alex Brinkmeyer's company originally purchased the land on Mount Jerrabomberra it was comprised in an estate which was subdivided in 1928. This was only a paper subdivision. The land was zoned under Yarrowlumla interim development order No. 1 as rural 1 (a) which gave no development rights on individual lots. When the Mount Jerrabomberra area became part of Queanbeyan, a local environment plan was implemented. This was local environmental plan No. 27. This plan identified and protected land on the mountain which was considered to be environmentally sensitive. It provided for preservation of hillscapes and ridgelines and the protection of Jerrabomberra Creek. The subsequent draft local environment plan of May 1988, draft LEP No. 54, changed the zoning of land which was previously zoned for environmental protection and upon which residential subdivisions were prohibited to land zoned to permit residential subdivision. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brinkmeyer's company sold land to the public before the land was rezoned to permit residential development. The contracts of sale with purchasers stated that in the event that rezoning approval was not obtained owners would be able to rescind the agreement, but at a cost. I am informed that in the event that there were more lots sold than were permitted under the zoning of land the company would effectively be charging purchasers for their speculation at the rate of $500 or more per block. Large numbers of blocks are involved which could mean a substantial windfall to the company from a paper subdivision at the expense of unwary purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA> While this situation may be a case of caveat emptor-buyer beware-such an approach is questionable, I believe. The Council could face enormous problems in having fragmented ownership over a large area with no urban potential while the owners press for approval to develop in accordance with a premature subdivision of 1928. I suggest this may be a case warranting the attention of the New South Wales Department of Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmental study submitted to the Queanbeyan City Council supporting the rezoning of Mount Jerrabomberra was prepared by a consultant, Don Fox Planning Pty Ltd. The principal of this company, Mr Don Fox, was as at 18 February 1988, the owner of a substantial shareholding in Jerrabomberra Estates Ltd, owner of the land which was the subject of the environmental study. The environmental study prepared by Don Fox Planning Pty Ltd has been criticised by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service for inaccurately describing the vegetation on the subject land and for failing to mention fauna. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmental study prepared by Don Fox Planning Pty Ltd in its assessment of the land's vegetation said:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the land has not been formally developed, it is traversed by an intricate network of informal roads and tracks, with the inevitable rubbish dumps and introduction of `exotic' species, resulting in extensive modification of the indigenous vegetation. As a general rule vegetation on the steeper slopes (generally above Jerrabomberra Hill Road beyond the water reservoirs) retains marginally better integrity than the lower, more accessible land. </PARA>
<PARA>The Don Fox study also said that `the high degree of disturbance demonstrates that the significance of the vegetation cover is aesthetic only'. I am informed that no public notice was given for the exhibition of the environmental study and although it was exhibited it was not properly identified as an environmental study. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1987 the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service notified criticisms of the environmental study to the Queanbeyan City Council. The criticisms were made on the grounds of inadequacies in the flora and fauna study. The National Parks and Wildlife Service in its objections noted the lack of any description of the fauna in the study area despite the fact that Mount Jerrabomberra appeared to the Service to be a refuge for many species of wildlife, including native mammals, reptiles, amphibians and many bird species. The Service also criticised the study on the basis that only broad vegetation alliances had been listed and no mention had been made of either the understorey or ground cover communities or of particular species of significance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Service expressed the view to the Council that vegetation communities on Mount Jerrabomberra were of interest botanically, with at least two plant species of special scientific significance being present. The National Parks and Wildlife Service went on to describe the endangered daisy and parrot pea. The Service advised the Council that there were many other plants in the area which are of botanic interest and that it was quite possible that other rare species may be found in the study area and also that certain communities themselves may be of a high conservation status. </PARA>
<PARA> The Service informed the Council of its continuing objection to the exhibited draft local environmental plan until it was given the opportunity to review any detailed flora and fauna studies and the specific measures proposed to protect significant biological values identified in those studies. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1987 Anutech completed and submitted a further environmental study of Mount Jerrabomberra to the Queanbeyan City Council. This was, I believe, as a consequence of complaints about the inadequacies of the previous environmental study prepared by Don Fox Planning Pty Ltd. Anutech was commissioned to do the study by the Queanbeyan City Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1988 the National Parks and Wildlife Service sent a letter to the Queanbeyan City Council commenting on the Anutech fauna and flora study. The Service described the study as helpful but, in view of the impact on residual vegetation communities, it disagreed with the Anutech recommendation that the development should proceed. The Service retained its objections to the proposed development and sought further consideration of the protection of the plant and residual animal communities on the site. I believe that the National Parks and Wildlife Service was not alone in maintaining its objections, similar reservations having been expressed by the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning. </PARA>
<PARA> In February 1988 the Jerrabomberra Preservation Society nominated Mount Jerrabomberra to the New South Wales Heritage Council for protection under the New South Wales Heritage Act. On 24 February 1988 the Society requested that the draft local environmental plan not proceed due to what it believed to be misleading information in the plan and the inadequacies in the environmental study. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1988 there was a State election in New South Wales. The Greiner-Murray Government was elected. Jerrabomberra Estate's fortunes improved noticeably thereafter. I am informed that a meeting was held on 30 March 1988 to resolve differences between the developer, Alex Brinkmeyer, and the Queanbeyan City Council concerning the extent to which the draft local environmental plan would protect the rare and endangered flora. At that meeting Mr Brinkmeyer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Nick Greiner has given me the undertaking that this development will go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Later Mr Brinkmeyer authorised the bulldozing of part of his company's proposed development site at Mount Jerrabomberra. The work was carried out on 6 April 1988, and I believe that areas in which rare flora occurred were affected. Although the New South Wales Heritage Council recommended in April 1988 the making of a temporary heritage order under section 136 of the Heritage Act, and one was made, it remained in effect for only 10 days. </PARA>
<PARA> Near the time that the bulldozing of part of the subject land took place the new New South Wales Minister for Planning in the Greiner-Murray Government, Mr David Hay, intervened in favour of Mr Brinkmeyer's proposed development. </PARA>

<PARA> On 12 April 1988, the Minister for Planning, Mr Hay, met with Brinkmeyer and Peter Cochran, the National Party member of parliament for Queanbeyan, in the absence of any departmental officers. The National Parks and Wildlife Service was at that time interested in preserving the plant communities on Mount Jerrabomberra and were considering purchase of the land. In the event of the failure to acquire the land, the Service considered seeking an interim protection order under section 91b of its Act. The interim protection order would have prohibited any disturbance to the site in question. Had such an order been made, it would have been the first implementation of this new provision in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the Jerrabomberra controversy the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service gave every appearance of support for preservation of the mountain's environmental values and pressed its concerns about the proposed residential development with the Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr President. I draw your attention to standing order 187, which says quite precisely that a senator shall not read a speech. For 15 to 16 minutes we have all been sitting here closely observing the fact that Senator Dunn has not been referring to copious notes but reading her speech and, as Senator Sheil has already said, at a staccato pace which could not possibly be delivered by a senator giving an extempore speech. She is clearly in breach of standing order 187 and I ask you to rule accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There was a meeting on 20 April 1988 involving Peter Cochran, the State member for Monaro, Alex Brinkmeyer, an employee of Don Fox Planning, an officer of the Department of Planning, and Mr Tim Moore, New South Wales Minister for Environment, who attended unaccompanied by any National Parks and Wildlife Service officer. Mr Moore gave every indication that the National Parks and Wildlife Service would not press for the establishment of a reserve. The Minister accepted the addition of a clause in the draft plan which provided some rights for the Service to be consulted about the development as it proceeded. On 6 May 1988 the New South Wales Planning Minister, Mr Hay, made the Queanbeyan local environmental plan No. 54. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 May 1988, the New South Wales Premier, Mr Nick Greiner, left the opening of Federal Parliament which he was attending, to open Mr Brinkmeyer's Jerrabomberra housing estate. On 19 August 1988, Mr Richard Jones, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, filed an application in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court seeking a declaration of invalidity of Queanbeyan local environment plan No. 54. Later in the year, on 23 September, Mr Michael Calkovics applied to be and was substituted as the applicant in place of Mr Jones by order of the court. Mr Calkovics then applied to the court on his own behalf and on behalf of the Jerrabomberra Preservation Society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The allegations of the applicant in his points of claim were many and substantial. Among these were, firstly, that the environmental study was not objective and was so inadequate as not to amount to an environmental study; secondly, that the Minister in making the local environment plan failed to take into account numerous relevant considerations, many of them raised by New South Wales Government agencies; thirdly, that the Minister took into account irrelevant considerations, including the relationship between Alex Brinkmeyer, the Liberal Party and the New South Wales Premier; fourthly, that the Minister acted in breach of the rules of natural justice by secretly meeting with Alex Brinkmeyer on 20 April 1988 to consider objections to the draft plan without affording the Council or the objectors the opportunity to make submissions; and, fifthly, that the map with the local environment plan did not properly describe the land to which it applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The last, and the least substantial, of the points that I have just listed has the appearance of being seized upon by the respondent Minister as a means of avoiding a searching investigation of the other allegations in a court. The Minister admitted the invalidity of the local environment plan due to the lack of an adequate map, and the court made a declaration to that effect on 19 September 1989. The court victory was not won without considerable effort and sacrifice by those concerned over those two years. Scurrilous and unjustified remarks have been made about Mr Calkovics for his efforts on behalf of the Jerrabomberra Preservation Society. </PARA>
<PARA> While he has been subject to verbal attacks, they are not the worst attacks that have been made on Mr Calkovics. In the latter part of 1988 Mr Calkovics was admitted to Queanbeyan Hospital after an incident which occurred when he was out driving in Queanbeyan with his uncle, who was visiting from overseas. In a statement to the police Mr Calkovics said that he and his uncle were stopped by another vehicle which drew up in front of them. A person then approached the driver's side of his car and punched through the closed window, smashing the glass and striking Mr Calkovics on the face a number of times. Apparently, no statement was taken by the police from Mr Calkovic's uncle, who witnessed the incident and was available at the time but who has since returned to his homeland. Charges brought against Mr Calkovics based on a statement from the other party to the incident were later dropped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a point of order. I would normally be the last person to get to my feet on this particular point of order because there are so many senators who do, of necessity, from time to time, read speeches. But I must say that I do take a little offence at the honourable senator's claim that she is reading from copious notes when she is not only reading from a prepared speech but also doing so in a very staccato fashion that is almost impossible to understand. I think that perhaps a sensible distinction could be made in respect of read speeches in the adjournment debate. It is understandable that honourable senators read from copious notes on legislation, particularly on technical Bills, but I must say that it does try the patience of everybody when this sort of speech-which, in fact, if it is written out can be sensibly incorporated in Hansard to precisely the same effect-is read out at this late hour and for such a long time on the adjournment. I am moved to raise this point of order as Senator Dunn did tell us seven minutes ago that she was about to conclude.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I am sorry that this may be boring to honourable senators present, but I am sure that it will be very interesting to a great number of people outside the Senate, particularly those in Queanbeyan whose properties are affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 23 February 1990, that is, just recently, a circular was sent by Jerrabomberra Estate to people who had purchased lots from the company's proposed Jerrabomberra Heights Estate explaining what was termed in the circular a `short delay' in the issuing of titles. This was due, it was said, to the uncovering of a `trivial technical flaw in the legal documents'. The circular went on to state that the Queanbeyan Council had `immediately assembled a task force of its most senior officers and aldermen to oversee the preparation of a new local environmental study and plan to correct the flaw', and estimated the rezoning `may be completed by the middle of this year'. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the impending consideration of the Jerrabomberra nomination by the Australian Heritage Commission and the possibility that the site may be listed on the interim listing of the National Estate register, one hopes that the proposed development will be reviewed in a substantial manner by the authorities concerned and by the proponent. One could even hope that, in the event of listing, the Commonwealth Government might do more than sit on its hands as it has done so often in relation to National Estate matters and, particularly, National Estate in the south-east of New South Wales. However, I am not particularly optimistic about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr Alex Brinkmeyer, the principal of Jerrabomberra Estate, resides in Queanbeyan and controls substantial holdings in the ACT and the Queanbeyan area. Senator Collins may be interested to know that he controls as much as 90 per cent of the available residential land in the Queanbeyan area and more than 30 per cent of the available residential land in the ACT. He apparently also controls very substantial holdings in Florida in the United States of America. I note that he must be an Australian citizen because his name is on the electoral roll at a Queanbeyan address. His willingness to be involved in community affairs is evidenced by his membership of the Liberal Party branch at Queanbeyan. A gentleman of such substance and with such influence in civic affairs would of course be sensitive to community opinion, and could not fail to appreciate the importance of the environmental and heritage values of Mount Jerrabomberra. I look forward to seeing some evidence of this in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I seek your indulgence for one moment to say that there ought to be some reconsideration of the processes of the adjournment debate-not because the time allocated is used improperly or ought not to be available, but because Senator Dunn has opportunities, as does her soulmate Senator Vallentine, to present their arguments, however discursive, however inadequate, however incompetent and however failing in logic, during the normal course of the day's proceedings. I am reminded, as I stand now, that on the one occasion that Senator Vallentine had an opportunity to be here to speak and vote-on the South Pacific nuclear free zone legislation-not only was she not here to speak, but she was also not here to vote because she was over in New Zealand--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She remembers clearly when it was. She was in New Zealand haranguing the poor souls of that nation. Senator Dunn and Senator Vallentine are now abusing Standing Orders or, at least, certainly using the Standing Orders to allow themselves to circulate their speeches and, in the process, abusing-and, certainly, in many respects, in my view, misusing-the essential elements of decency, the goodwill of the President and the cooperation of the Senate for the purpose of putting down a political statement. They do so not because they much care what the Opposition or the Government thinks, or what is thought by those who might be damned by the rare occasion they would read their speeches, but rather for the purpose of circulating their propaganda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view, there is an argument that a speech on the adjournment is a speech which dwells on a particular matter expressing the manifest views of a senator on that occasion, and that there ought to be, more particularly, a reinforcing of Standing Orders in respect of the reading of speeches. Under normal circumstances, in particular matters, copious notes might be acceptable during a debate. </PARA>
