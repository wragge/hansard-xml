<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<TITLE>Family Allowance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain electors of Queensland points out to the Senate that the 1990-91 Federal Budget stipulates that from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. Family Allowance will be withdrawn if net assets excluding the family home and debt exceed $300,000. Furthermore the parental assets test threshold for Family Allowance Supplement, Austudy and Assistance for Isolated Children has been severely slashed in the 1990-91 Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the economic crisis facing rural communities in Australia, assets tests of such a nature are not viable because the assets are incapable of generating enough income to sustain families and send children away for schooling.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate to exempt the family farm from the assets test for Austudy, Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>

<PARA>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA> gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association;</PARA>
<PARA> gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5;</PARA>

<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>

An immediate decision to construct the third runway is essential to ensure that regional air links are maintained to Sydney Airport.

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes that any person who has committed a War Crime should become subject to the provisions of the War Crimes Act 1988. That Act was drawn specifically to restrict its scope to war crimes alleged to have been committed in Eastern Europe between the years 1939-45. This was achieved by specific references to these years in the Preamble, and in section 5 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This has had the effect of making the War Crimes Act more limited in its scope than the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 which deals with similar matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The more limited scope of the recent Act was justified for some by asserting that most alleged war criminals now resident in Australia came from the areas covered in the Amendment Act and that there are no known instances of alleged Soviet or Japanese war criminals now resident in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, believing that there can be no real justification for the restriction of the pursuit of war criminals to limited theatres or to limited times, this amendment Bill is designed to widen the compass of the legislation to any war crime committed by any person in any theatre at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> To give effect to this, the Bill proposes three simple amendments, two to remove references to Europe and to 1939-45, the third to effect a simple amendment to S9 of the Principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> No one who has not committed a war crime need fear the application of the proposed amendment. It does not seek to override the so-called doctrine of military necessity, nor does it seek to invite frivolous prosecutions. On the other hand we have widened our immigration practices to include migrants from a number of countries in which war crimes are alleged to have occurred, and there is no real argument in principle to seek to quarantine anyone alleged to be a war criminal, from any country, or from any conflict, from the application of the principles agreed to in the War Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Amendment Bill will achieve the desirable effect of making the alleged perpetrator of any war crime subject to the application of the Principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue flows from the principle underlying the amendments to the War Crimes Act passed in 1989, namely that no Australian resident who has committed a war crime should be able to escape the consequences of that act by virtue of the effluxion of time and his or her residence in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1945 there have been many wars and there is evidence of the committing of many war crimes in many of these wars. If any of the perpetrators of those crimes live in Australia, then it is desirable and necessary that they be subject to the provisions of the War Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> While the High Court is being asked to judge the constitutionality of the Principal Act, the Parliament is still able, even while awaiting the determinations of the Court, to make declarations of principle and intent about the way we should regard war crimes and pursue war criminals. </PARA>
<PARA> This Amendment Bill, by removing the limitations of date and place, will permit the wider pursuit of anyone who has committed any war crime in any place. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed are logical and necessary and I commend them to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Robert Ray) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> That the report be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the ninth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 11 December 1990, the President, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, referred a letter from Mr C.H. Cannon relating to remarks made by Senator McLean during discussion on the banking industry on 12 November 1990 to the Committee of Privileges as a submission under Privilege Resolution 5. The Committee has considered the submission and recommends that a response agreed to by Mr Cannon and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA>RESPONSE BY MR C.H. CANNON</PARA>
<PARA>AGREED TO BY MR CANNON</PARA>
<PARA>AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</PARA>
<PARA>PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5 (7) (B) OF THE SENATE OF</PARA>
<PARA>25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>In the Senate on Monday 12th of November last I was the subject of an attack on my character which I believe was unfounded and extremely damaging to my wife and family and myself. </PARA>
<PARA>During an address by Senator McLean (New South Wales) on the Banking Industry, I was accused of fraud and deceptive conduct amongst other things. I found all of his remarks to be totally without substance and most offensive and since Star Television in Toowoomba used the article as the lead item in their news on Thursday 22nd November and the Toowoomba Chronicle printed articles on Friday 23rd and Tuesday 27th November my name has been blackened all over the Darling Downs, which is most disturbing since I was Manager of The National Australia Bank at 441 Ruthven Street, Toowoomba for 5 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is another important piece of legislation being guillotined through this place in far too short a time to do any justice to the importance of the subject. It is yet another indictment of the contempt in which the Government is holding the Parliament in respect of the whole legislative process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill 1990 proposes to increase haulage charges of gas through the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system as part of the Government's plans to sell off the pipeline next year. The coalition opposes this Bill very strongly indeed. We do not oppose it because of the proposed privatisation or sale of the pipeline; we oppose it because of the basic proposition that governments should not breach contractual obligations and that the whole approach of the Government to the sale of the assets of the pipeline is in deliberate breach of the Government's contractual arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Implicit in the whole structure and content of the Bill is the breaking of contractual obligations between a government instrumentality and a private sector firm. A large proportion of this Bill, parts 3 to 5, deals with compensation and legal issues in relation to the existing contract between the Pipeline Authority and Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL). While that deals with compensation and relates only to AGL, other people and parties will be gravely disadvantaged by this Bill. For example, the producers of the gas in the first instance, Santos Ltd, and suppliers such as municipal authorities-in particular, authorities such as the Wagga Wagga City Council-are not considered at all in the compensation arrangements in this Bill. Indeed, they would be deliberately excluded from any compensation provisions in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been wide opposition to this Bill. For the first time that I can remember five of the major organisations in Australia got together recently and put out a joint press release. These were the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry. Those peak bodies in Australia said in the press release that the Government should rethink its approach to the pipeline sale because it has:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . attempted to deny explicit contractual rights to a contractual partner of the Pipeline Authority;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . attempted to abrogate a long term contract between the Pipeline Authority and its contractual partner so that it can increase haulage charges above their economic level . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and for other reasons. That very strong statement includes words with which the Opposition totally concurs:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's behaviour is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the coalition opposes this Bill not because the assets of the Pipeline Authority are being sold but because of the inept, underhand manner in which the whole deal has been done. The Government has been rebuffed on numerous occasions now in relation to this Bill; in particular, it has been rebuffed in the courts. In relation to the legal matters surrounding the sale of the pipeline, although it is not an aspect of this Bill as such, the courts threw out a proposal by the Government that it could deny AGL the right of first refusal on the sale. In a judgment on 16 November, the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Justice Rogers, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not for me to suggest how the Government should conduct its case-or what it should do, but I think it is appropriate for a commercial court to draw attention to very serious commercial consequences of a certain line of argument. I do not think that any government would wish to put an argument which could imperil the reliability or the reliance that the commercial community can place on agreements entered into and rights extended by government instrumentalities. Those are very strong words. They were directed absolutely and totally at the way in which the Government is handling this matter because the right of first refusal, whilst not a part of the Bill before us today, is part of the total process of which this Bill is an integral part. The Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, in his second reading speech, actually acknowledged that the Government was overriding an agreed contract and went on to try to explain why the Government is deliberately breaching contractual arrangements between a government instrumentality and the contracting party. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a wide range of opposition to the Bill. I mentioned the major industry organisations. A wide range of companies have also been opposed to the Bill-not just for particular vested interest reasons but also for reasons very similar to the reason we are opposing this Bill-that is, the way in which this matter is being handled. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of the Pipeline Authority has been on the coalition's agenda for some time and it remains on the agenda. We differ from the Government in the way in which we would go about handling these matters. We would handle them in a way that takes full account of the normal commercial, legal and political relationships that ought to operate between government and the private sector. If governments take actions which destroy the public confidence in the word of government, the damage caused is very great indeed. I can think of no more striking example of that than this case of a government destroying its credibility and its integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the Opposition do differently? Let me set out what the Opposition would do, how we would tackle this matter. The Government's quite scandalous suggestion that we are deliberately trying to undermine this exercise needs the fullest possible rebuttal. We would approach the matter in a logical, stepped process. We would first of all create a regulatory framework within which the privatised pipeline would operate, recognising the inherent natural monopoly that the pipeline enjoys at this stage. We would establish an agreed process of sale by negotiation with the contracted parties, not by government dictate and fiat. The haulage tariff rates would have to be included in that process of negotiation. Any outstanding legal matters flowing from those negotiations would have to be resolved. There is no reason why they should not be. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the agreed sale process should proceed with all information as to future revenues, ongoing legal obligations, if any, and other commercially necessary information being made available to all bidders. There are many other points that if time permitted I would wish to reiterate, but I think the coalition has made the points that it considers important in this matter over a lengthy period-from the day last month that it was decided that the coalition would oppose this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel very strongly about this matter because it goes to the whole process of the operation of government, the credibility of government, the integrity of government and, therefore, the role of government in relation to the community. If the community does not have confidence in the word of government then the whole parliamentary process, the whole democratic process, is put under severe threat. We will be opposing this Bill at both the second and third reading stages as an indication of the strength of feeling that we have about this Bill. I absolutely condemn the Government for the approach it has adopted in this process. I did not believe that I would see a government act in a way that would so undermine its integrity as it has with this operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the Government went back to the drawing board and rethought this whole process. If it does it correctly it will have the support of the coalition. But there is no way that the Government's approach to this process even starts to get towards the bounds of normal acceptable commercial relationships between government and the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also will oppose the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill, and for two reasons. One of the reasons coincides with that enunciated by Senator Short. I shall not go into detail and repeat the arguments he has advanced, except to say that, firstly, the Democrats do not believe that a government should use its position to vary contractual obligations vis-a-vis a commercial entity in the community which does not have the same powers. The Government has been rebuffed in the courts and, as a result, if this Bill were to proceed it would face legal action for considerable compensation. Secondly, a particularly important reason is that this is a crucial facility that should remain in public hands. If it went into private hands it would be quite clearly a private monopoly in an area where public control is imperative, namely, the distribution of energy resources throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that we cannot afford as a community to put future potential, as well as the current reality, in terms of providing energy to both domestic and industrial consumers, into the hands of a private monopoly. Whilst we acknowledge that the Opposition would probably not subscribe to that particular reason, seeing that it has enthusiastically embraced the privatisation principle, on this occasion I am glad that it is supporting opposition to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced in the August 1989 Budget that it wished to sell the Sydney-Moomba gas pipeline owned by the Pipeline Authority. The sale did not proceed because the existing contractual arrangements, which were negotiated by the Whitlam Government, do not allow the Authority to earn any overall profit until the year 2006. In fact, the arrangements provide for charges to be made on a cost recovery basis; in other words, only those costs which go towards the maintenance of the pipeline may be recovered by any increases in charges. This completely eliminates the possibility of a commercially based pricing system for gas haulage, and thus makes the value of the pipeline to a prospective purchaser much lower than it otherwise would be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced in the 1990 Budget that it would press on with the privatisation regardless of these existing contractual arrangements, and that it proposed to increase by this legislation the existing haulage tariffs which are charged to the owners of the gas, Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL). The proposed increases are 25 per cent from 1 January 1991 and a further 25 per cent from 1 January 1992. This will flow through to a rise of approximately 9 per cent over the two year period for domestic consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> AGL claims to have a pre-emptive right over the pipeline, and the Government has recently confirmed that. This, and a possible loss of sales of gas, may lead to compensation claims of quite large proportions, amounting to several hundred million dollars. The Federal Government has announced an intention to appeal such a decision, although it is difficult to see what grounds it would have. The Government should have withdrawn the legislation, given that both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have stated from the outset that they would oppose this legislation; the time of the Senate could have been saved on this particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it relates to gas haulage charges, the purpose of the Bill clearly is to facilitate the privatisation of the pipeline. Apart from the increased gas costs that would occur, the longer term structural implications of private sector control over energy conveyancing systems must be considered. This is especially so given the possible future connection of the pipeline to the North West Shelf project, interconnection to other States, and to future hydrogen fuel utilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that my colleague, Senator Coulter, will address this particular question in much more detail because I believe it is of considerable importance for the community at large. Mr Willis, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Without adjustments to the haulage tariff of this order the Government would withdraw the pipeline system from sale and not support a future sale until the current haulage agreements are appropriately modified. </PARA>
<PARA>Hopefully, this commitment will be honoured after the Bill is rejected by the Senate, because a sale under the current conditions would not obtain anywhere near the value of the pipeline. The Government should reverse its crazy assets stripping policy and build the current system into a national pipeline system to help to satisfy Australia's energy needs in the twenty-first century in a sustainable manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, because of the provisions of the guillotine applying, by agreement I have but five minutes to put a few points concerning the sale of the pipeline. Specific points that I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate came out of Estimates Committee A hearings which were complementary to the hearings which took place in Estimates Committee F. I think the thing that was central to many of the questions asked in Committee A was why the task force, charged with the responsibility of selling the pipeline, had not firstly put a cost on the pipeline if it had to take into account honouring the heads of agreement, which were clearly in evidence at the time that it was making its calculation, and which the court has subsequently upheld.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing it did not do was make any proper provision for compensation because it very arrogantly asserted that it was not its problem, that the Government would pass some other form of legislation and that it would not have to be taken out of the proceeds of the pipeline sale. Two elements came through very strongly in those hearings: one was arrogance; one was cynicism. It was a very cynical exercise simply to introduce legislation to sell a pipeline and abrogate the legal liabilities which it had under previous agreements. Fortunately, the court of Mr Justice Rogers upheld that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the discussion and at the time the Opposition made it quite clear we would be opposing this legislation, it was quite evident that litigation was going to ensue and that any calculations that the Government had made about the proposed benefits that would flow from the manner in which it was handling the sale of the pipeline would indeed be quite small in the wash-up. But, worse than that, because of the proposed increase in the charges, the consumer would be paying more for the product, and inflationary effects of the increase would be felt right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> When I specifically asked Mr Heinrich about the manner in which he had gone about seeking a price that he might expect and asked very specifically why he had not costed the option of honouring the heads of agreement, he replied to me:</PARA>
<PARA>We did not think it was relevant to the process that we embarked upon. As I said before, we do not consider the Commonwealth Government is bound by the express provisions of the 1985 heads of agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a pretty arrogant statement, and one that has been held to be incorrect. The reason that my colleague Senator Short stated that we are opposing the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is a straightforward one: very simply, the action of a government in attempting to abrogate contractual obligations is simply reprehensible and, accordingly, we are pleased to see that this legislation will be defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Spindler pointed out, I will be addressing our opposition to the sale of what was originally conceived to be, and is on the way to becoming, a national pipeline grid which will serve a very important long term interest in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rex Connor, who had a lot to do with the Pipeline Authority, had a dream of which there were two components: one was that we should buy back the farm and own the land and resources of this country ourselves. Part of that dream was that one of the resources we should own was a national pipeline grid-that it should be in public ownership. Indeed, it is a great pity that the present Government does not have such visionary attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seventeenth annual report, 1989-90, of the Pipeline Authority one reads that Rex Connor, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy in 1973, introduced the Pipeline Authority Act establishing:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an authority with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of Australia's natural resources available to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>The original concept provided for a national pipeline system and took account of long term issues-we should note the phrase `long term issues'-such as defence, decentralisation, population growth, national development, interconnected supplies, emergency situations, exhaustion of particular regional energy resources, and possible future export of liquid natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA> We know today that we could add to that the exigencies of greenhouse and the demands which that will place on us to develop alternative energy strategies in the very near future. Indeed, even in this 1990 annual report, one finds the statement that the next five to 10 years are expected to see a fundamental change in the balance of Australia's petroleum resources, with natural gas taking over the dominant position now enjoyed by oil. </PARA>
<PARA> The very best evidence that we have available at the present time is that, by early in the next century, Australia will need to look at reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 92 per cent. In that connection, we are a world leader in the development of photovoltaic technology. We were a world leader in the development of ideas in relation to a hydrogen economy-a mechanism by which we could store and transmit photovoltaically generated electricity to remote areas through the electrolysis of water and the transmission of hydrogen through a national pipeline grid. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also a world leader, with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's developments in Victoria, in the technology of turning the energy in hydrogen back into electricity through the development of the solid oxide fuel cell. It needs to be stressed that those technologies are not being adequately supported by this Government because it lacks the vision to see where we need to go in the future. Fundamentally, the Australian Democrats are opposed to this legislation because we believe that in the very near future it will be absolutely vital that we have a publicly owned national pipeline system in this country which will be able to transmit the energy exchange material of the future, namely, hydrogen, from remote areas in Australia, where photovoltaic arrays will be erected, to those centres of population where that hydrogen can be used directly as a source of fuel for transport, cooking and for all those things for which we currently use petroleum or natural gas and for conversion back into electricity in our centres of population. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, as well as the reasons advanced by Senator Spindler and initially by Senator Short in relation to the breaking of contractual arrangements, we will oppose this legislation. I point out to Senator Short that we will vote with the Opposition and that he will not need to vote against the third reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. I do not think we need prolong this matter because the views of honourable senators are clear. Senator Spindler opposes this legislation, first of all, in relation to the Government's alleged interference in contractual obligations and, secondly, because of his longstanding commitment to uneconomic public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short, on the other hand, in a speech which varied between a sort of horror video and the dreamland, made a number of points of more detail relating to the legislation. The burden of Senator Short's remarks was that this was quite an easy matter and that, if the Opposition had the handling of it, it would take account of-as he put it-the proper legal and political relationships. I want to say something about that in the course of my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA> I might just turn to the essential purpose of this legislation, which may have been somewhat lost sight of in the discussion which has transpired to date. First of all, the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is the first step in the implementation of the Government's decision to commercialise and sell the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system. As Senator Short acknowledged, court cases relating to other steps in that process, with the greatest respect, are not relevant to the debate on this particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale, as has been said in other places, is an essential component of the Government's program of major asset sales. The rejection of the possibility of this sale taking place-because it will not take place unless this legislation is passed-flies in the face of utterances by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others. Indeed, it was implicit in a question to me from Senator Short yesterday that the Government should have a tougher fiscal policy than it currently has, which flies in the face of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from being a component of the Government's fiscal policy, it is also an important component of the Government's micro-economic reform program. The opposition to it must place a question mark over the Opposition's commitment to rationalise the Commonwealth's assets holdings and to micro-economic reform in general, because there are some difficult decisions which have to be made about this sort of thing. One cannot wish all the difficult problems away by saying, `We will consult with various people about all these issues' and somehow the problems will go away. That was the dreamtime section of Senator Short's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to this particular Bill and the scheme of things relating to the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. Under the current arrangements-and Senator Spindler should be aware of this-the Australian taxpayers will effectively continue to subsidise the consumption of gas in New South Wales, unless the current haulage charges are increased. The purpose of this Bill is to provide scope for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for the proposed increase in haulage charges is to put the Pipeline Authority's operations on a commercial footing. Under the current arrangements, the Authority is unable to earn any overall profit on the bulk of its business until 2006. That might be nice for the Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL) and for some consumers in New South Wales, but it is a burden imposed on the Australian taxpayers as a whole. Even after the year 2006, unless legislation of this kind is passed and appropriate charges introduced, the Authority will not be able to earn anything like reasonable profits for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority is a significant community asset. It has a total replacement value of approximately $1.3 billion. The Government's view is that it would be an abrogation of its responsibilities to the major equity holders, namely the Australian community, were it to let this situation continue. Putting the Authority on a commercial basis would enable taxpayers to earn a fair and reasonable return on their investment in the pipeline system, valued at its current worth. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a brief word about overriding existing contractual obligations, which was adverted to by Senator Short and by Senator Spindler in his opening remarks. There is no question that overriding the present totally unsatisfactory pricing provisions in the existing contractual arrangements between AGL and the Pipeline Authority is a big step for a government to take. We have admitted that right from the beginning. It is not a step which was taken lightly. In normal circumstances the Government would be very reluctant to alter contractual arrangements of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point to Senator Short that the imperative of achieving economic reform means that difficult decisions have to be made. It is no good indulging in windy rhetoric about these things; when one finally has to face up to the problems, difficult decisions have to be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I was looking in Senator Bishop's direction when the analogy came to my mind. Apart from that, it is difficult to negotiate some of these matters when there are many vested interests involved. As I say, it is just rhetoric to say that these things can be negotiated with everybody being happy and satisfied. The tariff adjustments proposed by this Bill are the only feasible way to ensure that the economic efficiency of the gas marketing arrangements are improved. That makes for a proper basis for a sale which is fair to the taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short on behalf of the Opposition has claimed that if it were in office it would go ahead with the sale of the pipeline. He has to say that because the born-again privatisers on the Opposition side have to continue with that rhetoric irrespective of the difficulties which they might encounter. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask rhetorically: is it seriously claimed that it is possible that, instead of pursuing an increase in haulage tariffs by legislation, a voluntary agreement be negotiated for an increase in tariffs? Or should the asset, the Pipeline Authority, be sold under the current totally uneconomic contractual arrangements, which are a burden on taxpayers and do not give them an adequate return on their investment, for a price well below its true worth? These are some of the hard questions which governments have to address; oppositions do not, and particularly Democrats do not-Democrats, who are essentially given to `green cliches over the chardonnay'. The Australian Democrats do not have to address these sorts of questions-they are all care and no responsibility. They never have to exercise any responsibility about anything, even in respect of what they say. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is in a position where, theoretically at least, it might have to exercise some responsibility in these matters. These hard questions have to be addressed. If responsibility is to be exercised, the hard questions have to be addressed. We cannot waffle about them; we cannot indulge in cliches. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cannot indulge in the sort of rhetoric that Senator Bishop indulges in by interjecting. It is all right to be tough in opposition. Sometimes we have to make hard decisions which are a little more than the rhetoric. An asset such as this has to be sold for something like a fair price to the Australian taxpayers. We cannot sell it below its true worth if we have any sense of responsibility at all. This legislation pursuing an increase in haulage tariffs is absolutely necessary. On the basis of experience, we do not believe that a voluntary agreement of the kind referred to can be negotiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other issue which has been very much blown up in this debate, and that is the question of tariff charges for New South Wales consumers. In view of the time available, I will not go into all the figures on that issue. We are confronted with a proposition by the Government to get a proper return for the sale of a taxpayers' asset, and the argument put is: that will be unfair to some consumers in New South Wales-a relatively small section of Australian taxpayers-because they have had the benefit of a totally subeconomic activity for a very long period. That is what the Opposition is saying and what the Democrats, by implication, are saying. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put that into perspective. The effects of the proposed haulage rates on a domestic consumer in New South Wales have been calculated as meaning an average 9 per cent increase by 1992. This would amount to 40c a week for a domestic consumer or less than the cost of a daily newspaper and, I think -not being a drinking man-about a third of the cost of a glass of beer in Sydney. Or does a glass of beer cost more than that? Perhaps Mr Clerk would know, or Senator Bjelke-Petersen-a well known bar fly in Sydney-might be able to help me! It would amount to probably a quarter of the cost of a glass of beer per week. That is the estimate of the cost to the domestic consumer. There is ample capacity within the system to negotiate appropriate and proper rates for industrial consumers. I mention that issue because it has been vastly overblown in the public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, this relates very much to government fiscal policy; it is an important part of government micro-economic reform. It involves the obligation of a government to sell a taxpayers' asset, if it has made the decision to sell it, at a fair price to Australian taxpayers. It involves that as the prime obligation as distinct from any other obligations to sections of the Australian taxpaying community who, as consumers, have been beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is essential to get the Pipeline Authority on a proper commercial basis so that taxpayers can get a fair return from its sale. I do not want to sound like Senator Short-I do not want to sound horrified by what the Opposition is saying about this matter. Horror comes to me only late at night. I think what we have heard is just irresponsible in terms of an important piece of legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate for the reasons which I have given. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Today we are debating cognately the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990, the Taxation (Interest on Non-resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990. Whilst the Opposition will not be opposing these Bills, the legislation is very complex. My colleague Senator Watson will be raising later in this debate a series of specific issues which he raised last week during consideration of the legislation by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990 aims to give legislative authority to comprehensive double tax agreements which Australia has already signed with China, Sri Lanka and Fiji respectively. The irony of this legislation is that, through the tax sparing concessions, it effectively overrides the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill which we are also debating today. However, we support the reasons for extending tax sparing to these countries, particularly because this will allow Australian investors to compete in these countries on equal terms. Therefore, we fully support the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill aims to introduce an accrual system of taxing foreign source income that has been derived in low tax countries by Australian controlled entities and that has been accumulated offshore, thus avoiding Australian tax. The Taxation (Interest on Non-resident Trust Distributions) Bill introduces measures to achieve parity between the tax treatment of resident and non-resident trust distributions. The Bill will ensure that the net income of non-resident trusts will be liable to tax either in the hands of the trustee or the beneficiaries in the income year in which it is derived. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills aim to support the foreign tax credit system by closing off the leakage which could have occurred through foreign source income derived in low tax countries being diverted and accumulated offshore in foreign companies and trusts. The Bills set out to tax foreign income and capital gains derived by Australians through foreign companies at a rate of at least 25 per cent when derived. Foreign companies satisfying the active income exemption will be exempted so that Australians carrying on genuine business activities in low tax countries will not be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the Bill relate to controlled foreign corporations (CFC's). A foreign company is defined as a CFC if it is controlled by Australian residents. An attributable taxpayer is, broadly, an Australian resident who alone or with associates directly or indirectly holds an interest of 10 per cent or more in the CFC as at the end of the CFC's accounting year. For the purposes of the Bill, countries have been divided into listed and non-listed countries. Effects vary depending on whether countries are listed or non-listed. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition has no qualms about the intentions of the Bill, I am not nearly so confident that the approach adopted in this Bill will meet the desired outcome. For example, in trying to ensure that tax is paid on income which has been held in such a way as to avoid tax there is a danger that people will be required to pay tax on income which is not their income and to which they will never have any rights. They may also be restricted in their access to information about that income if it is necessary to dispute an assessment. However, I understand the difficulties in trying to cast a tax net so wide as to cover all the income it is intended to cover but not so wide as to cover income which it should not. This is not a new problem in the field of taxation. The old chestnuts of residence and source will remain in dispute as long as tax is payable, and the complexities of this legislation revolve around conceptually similar problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available today it is difficult to present even an effective overview of the Bill. However, there are a couple of broad areas to which I would particularly like to draw attention. The issue of information which must be provided to the Commissioner of Taxation on request is one area of concern. The Bill authorises the Commissioner to issue an offshore information notice in respect of information held offshore. Where the information is not made available to the Commissioner within the time required-generally 90 days, though there is scope for the Commissioner to vary the time limit-any information which is not supplied cannot be used by the taxpayer as evidence to dispute the assessment. This restriction on receiving evidence has been copied from overseas countries such as the United States of America. However, it is notable that the taxpayer protections available in the USA, such as guarantees of due process and prohibitions against searches and seizures, have not been copied in our legislation, and that could leave taxpayers unfairly exposed. That is a matter that the coalition will be monitoring carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the comments made in the other place by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, when this legislation was being debated-that this is pretty heavy-handed stuff. It potentially denies taxpayers natural justice and goes to the very heart of the separation of government and the judiciary-in this case, the separation of a government agency, the Australian Taxation Office, from the law courts. I also have some concern about the Commissioner's powers to call for multiple assessments. The Commissioner is under no obligation to limit the amount taxed to 100 per cent of a foreign entity's income. Again, this is a factor that we will watch closely once the legislation becomes effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has no quarrels with the aims and intentions of these Bills, but we have serious concerns about the way in which the legislation has been handled, or in some respects mishandled, and the manner in which this Government has chosen again to try to circumvent proper parliamentary scrutiny of its tax legislation. In essence, these Bills carry on a number of traditions which have become hallmarks of the way in which this Government has come to mismanage tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills are extremely complex and very lengthy. The explanatory memoranda alone run to over 400 pages, and the Bills themselves to over 230 pages. This is on top of the already greatly overburdened tax system with which Australia is saddled. It is yet another addition to the 26,000 pages of Acts, regulations and court rulings which have been added to taxation material in the last few years. The complexities of our taxation system defy even the highest qualified and best tax experts in the land. Of course, one way of doing away with much of this paperwork in the tax area would be to abolish the anomaly-ridden wholesale sales tax system, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions and fails to tax the services sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has pledged to do just that on its return to office. A broad-based, single rate tax will remove the need for many of the tax rulings and regulations which cannot be avoided under our current ramshackle, indirect tax system. At least on this foreign income Bill the Government has consulted with interested parties before bulldozing ahead with ill-considered proposals. Changes to the tax treatment of foreign source income were first announced in the economic statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 12 April 1989. The changes were then modified by press release on 17 December, a year ago almost to the day, and further modified by press release on 3 June this year. The draft Bill was released on 29 June-whilst Parliament was in recess, I point out-and it contained still further changes to the 3 June press release. In the Budget on 21 August, further changes to the proposed legislation were announced. Finally, we have these Bills before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> This consultation process has had the advantage of highlighting areas in which the June 1990 draft legislation had to be altered. Those consultations led to changes to ensure that opportunities for tax avoidance were closed off and to provide relief in certain circumstances where double taxation would have occurred. This consultation is very welcome, and I hope very much that the Government, through the Tax Office and the Treasury, continues with effective consultation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance, though, it is not only the consultative process which has slowed finalisation of the legislation; the time it has taken to produce this tortured piece of legislation raises questions about just how necessary it was to make it so complex. There is a question to be looked at and answered. I am not sure what the answer is, but the obvious question is whether we have in fact produced here a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. </PARA>
<PARA> As has occurred with so much other tax legislation introduced by this Government, even taxpayers with the best of intentions will have difficulty complying with the law because not all of the changes announced to the draft Bill of June 1990 have been included in this Bill. As has so often occurred in the past, taxpayers will be forced to operate on the basis of announced changes which have not yet been put into the legislation. We are seeing, yet again, the abhorrent practice of legislating by press release; a practice which has become the rule rather than the exception under this Government, particularly under Treasurer Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues are also still under consideration. They are not minor issues which businesses can disregard in making important decisions about their operations and investment strategies. For example, the Treasurer still has to decide on the application of the trading stock and depreciation provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act to a controlled foreign company. He has also to decide on whether the special deductions for capital expenditure associated with domestic mining activities should apply to foreign mining activities that generate assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> How long will it be before Australian businesses can operate in an environment of certainty? The Treasurer, in trying to remove the inequities and inefficiencies caused by a tax system which did not effectively address foreign source income, has created inefficiencies and possible in- equities of his own by leaving so much still undecided. I am concerned that the complexities of this legislation may well lead some businesses to re-incorporate outside Australia or hive off their international operations. This legislation could well distort the locational choices of some businesses. Of course, that ought to be anathema to a country, such as Australia, needing to produce more. It is also contrary to the requirements of an efficient tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I also quickly draw attention to a number of issues of serious concern with have been raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. A number of provisions in the Bill effectively reverse the onus of proof, requiring the taxpayer to prove matters which would normally be considered to be matters for the prosecuting party to prove. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee quite correctly drew attention to these provisions because of the possible implications in terms of trespass on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note, as did the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that the Bill contains a series of provisions which give varied proposed amendments retrospective effect. Importantly, the retrospectivity appears to have the potential to operate prejudicially on taxpayers. This is not the first time, by any means, that the Treasurer has been brought to task by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for serious breaches of personal rights and liberties in tax legislation, for which he is responsible. The fact that the Treasurer has failed to take account of the legitimate concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is just one more piece of evidence showing his neglect and disregard for the normal parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude with a quote which, I think, sums up the major concerns that the coalition has with the way that this Treasurer has handled changes to the tax system. Many of these problems are, again, evident in the legislation that we are debating today. I quote from a Sydney practitioner who is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He wrote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably the Treasurer has no idea whatsoever or chooses to ignore the time frame necessary to implement complex taxation measures efficiently and effectively. He legislates by proclamation and expects the bureaucracy to write the law, establish departments and draft and print forms and information sheets in wholly unrealistic time constraints. Moreover he expects all accountants and taxpayers to be instantly aware of all ramifications of the law, most of which are mind boggling in their complexity . . . . Unless all concerned are given a breathing space, inside three years, the system will be wholly unintelligible to any one other than those who devote all their time to reading and digesting new legislation and tax rulings and attending seminars. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, even people who do that find it almost impossible to keep up with and comprehend the complexities of the current tax system. He went on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Errors must occur in the compilation of returns which creates a serious situation, particularly in light of the unforgiving imposition of penalties. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important quote. It sums up the feelings and understanding that a lot of us receive from not only tax practitioners but also the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax law is a very difficult area. It is very complex. We ought to be looking at ways to overcome that. The tax simplification document that was produced last week does not even start to look at the issues involved in really making a meaningful attack on the complexities of the tax law. It almost seems that the Government has run out of thoughts as to where it can possibly go with tax simplification. It is a matter of great urgency that all parties need to address. </PARA>
<PARA> While we do not seek to oppose the Bills, we certainly hope that, where problems such as I have just mentioned surface, they will be dealt with expeditiously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990, the Taxation (Interest on Non-resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill. We will be moving one amendment which seeks to strengthen this tax havens legislation. We will be opposing the three amendments which the Opposition moved in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and which I understand it may move again in this chamber as widening the anti-tax avoidance provision in this tax havens legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This tax havens legislation has been developed since the Government's original announcement in its May 1988 economic statement. Draft legislation was issued in December 1989 to elicit further public comment. A further draft was issued in June 1990 which was amended substantially before the current legislation was introduced. While I agree with Senator Short that the Bill is extremely voluminous, far-reaching and complex, the Government has made some attempt at consultation. Many issues remain unresolved. Further substantial legislation will be introduced by way of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) and I expect we will see further amendments next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The current system of taxing foreign source income earned by Australian residents is quite comprehensive. All business and investment income is taxable, with a credit granted for any foreign tax paid. However, one loophole exists: it is possible to interpose a foreign entity-for instance, a company or trust-between the Australian resident and the income earning activity. For example, if Telecom Australia won a contract to install a telephone network in Oman, its profit would be taxable in Australia. Any tax paid in Oman would be allowed as a credit against the Australian tax. However, if Telecom created a subsidiary-for instance, Telecom Oman Limited-which performed the contract and earned the profit, no Australian tax would be payable on that income until it was remitted to Australia as a dividend. Consequently, there is a positive disincentive to remit overseas profits, and a concomitant advantage in sourcing income into low tax jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, such a tax structure-especially when it is reinforced by a low withholding tax rate on income remitted from Australia-tends to promote a large net income deficit. Currently, the net income deficit is the major component of our current account deficit. It represents 70 per cent. The legislation proposes to introduce an accruals system of taxing foreign source income that has been earned in low tax countries by Australian controlled entities. That is, the tax applies whether or not income is remitted to Australia, and so it should. This is achieved by attributing to the Australian resident shareholders their proportionate share of the income earned by the controlled foreign entity. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been painstakingly designed not to interfere with the legitimate business activities of Australian controlled businesses operating overseas. Consequently, only certain income, known as tainted income, is liable to attribution to the Australian shareholders. However, attribution is not automatic. It occurs only when the controlled foreign company fails the active income tax exemption test. Attribution occurs only when the tainted income is 5 per cent or more of total turnover. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, this is a very generous ratio; indeed, too generous a ratio. For example, it means that a company with a turnover of $1 billion will be able to derive $50m profit or interest without risking attribution. Whilst being a small amount of turnover, this may represent a very large proportion of the profit of the business. </PARA>
<PARA> The 5 per cent figure was chosen when the proposed attribution related to all of the income of the controlled foreign company, not just the tainted income which is now the case. Consequently, in the Democrats view there is scope to reduce the ratio. I will be moving an amendment during the Committee stage of the debate to reduce the ratio down to 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A further companion amendment will impose a dollar ceiling amount of $5m over which all tainted income is automatically attributed. Given the recent Committee hearing, I do not think that these amendments will be accepted by the Government. However, the Government has said that it will keep the ratio under review, which does offer some hope for future action in this area. It leaves the question open: what is the rationale for the 5 per cent that the Government wishes to use as against 2 per cent, which would give a substantial increase to revenue which otherwise Australian taxpayers have to find? It seems to us that where there is doubt, the doubt should be resolved in favour of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer the Minister gave in the Committee was that we do not wish to undermine companies currently operating overseas. I do not think that really holds water. If we wish to support the activities of companies which contribute to our export income, then we should do so in a targeted and direct manner rather than in a broad based manner which disadvantages the Australian taxpayer as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> A much tougher regime is proposed by the Government for controlled foreign trusts as against controlled foreign companies, with which I have been dealing. This is reasonable given that, as a rule, companies are necessary for legitimate business purposes, whereas trusts are invariably chosen to avoid tax or other regulations. A transferor trust regime is to be established. The unspoken but obvious intention is to totally discourage the use of offshore discretionary trusts. From an anti-tax avoidance perspective, this seems reasonable. Limited exemptions are granted in respect of some family arrangements. It is accepted that such exceptions are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson will not move the amendments, but he will deal with them in his address to the Senate. The Australian Democrats made it quite clear during the Committee hearings that they would not support these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The regime proposes to attribute the attributable income of a non-resident discretionary trust to the Australian resident who transferred property to the trust. Basically the trust is ignored and the Australian resident is taxed on the income as if it were derived by the resident. This is a severe measure, yet the tax avoidance opportunities of foreign trusts warrant such a response in the Democrats view. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with this harsh treatment, no active income exemption is allowed for controlled foreign trusts. Basically any income which is not taxed in a comparable country will be attributed to the transferor unless it is otherwise taxable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As an additional measure, where a resident beneficiary earns income from a controlled foreign trust which has not been attributed nor taxed on a current basis in Australia, then additional tax in the nature of an interest charge will be payable in certain circumstances. The sole purpose of the Taxation (Interest on Non-Resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990 is to impose this interest charge. Constitutional provisions require a separate Act of Parliament. This measure simply negates any advantage that deferring distribution of income and hence tax liability would otherwise provide. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already dealt briefly with our position regarding the Opposition's amendments. I simply conclude by saying that the Australian Democrats believe there are too many loose ends to this legislation. No doubt we will be amending it for the next year at least, but this is best dealt with by the Government than through attempts on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> We accept one point made in Senator Watson's third amendment, which deals with the possibility of double taxation. We understand that that is a problem. However, it seems to us that rather than remove the liability from the company in anticipation of the possible event that the company may become liable to tax in the foreign country, we should ask the Government to provide an opportunity to allow subsequent credit once it is found that a company has, indeed, been fixed with a foreign tax liability in the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the Senate's attention to a recent article by Colleen Ryan which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 8 December 1990. The article is entitled `Half News Corp Profit earned in the Caribbean Tax Havens'. This is the sort of result that this Bill is intended to overcome. In general terms, I commend the Government for bringing in these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly turn to the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Agreements) Bill 1990. This Bill will insert three new schedules to the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953. The schedules are comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and China, Sri Lanka and Fiji respectively. The agreements follow the general provisions of Australia's existing double taxation agreements and provide taxation certainty which enhances trade, investment and broader relations between Australia and the other parties to the agreements. In general terms, we are supportive of these agreements. I simply ask: is this the time to advance relations between Australia, on the one hand, and China and Fiji in particular, on the other, in view of the international human rights record of those countries? I commend the package of Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity of congratulating you, Senator Calvert, on the capable manner in which you have presided over the affairs of the Senate during this session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said before, and I will say it again today, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill is one of the most complex sets of amendments ever to find their way into taxation law, masking even the capital gains changes which the courts have described as unintelligible at times, confusing, badly drafted and a nightmare of interpretation. We need to get a better mechanism or linkage between the court system and the Parliament in order to overcome the concerns of the courts in their interpretation. We should have a mechanism to implement legislation that picks up judiciary concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation runs counter to all the very high principles of tax simplification that I strongly endorsed during the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration last Friday. For example, many of the attribution tests are too draconian, particularly for innocent shareholders. This is particularly so in circumstances where Australian residents are unaware that foreign companies are controlled by other Australians. People who might be listening to this debate, or readers of this debate, should be aware that the whole purpose of the Bill is to correct certain perceived tax avoidance measures. The Opposition is concerned about the draconian way in which some of these issues are handled. </PARA>
<PARA> The technical aspects of the legislation were reviewed in a detailed way in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I refer people who have an interest in this matter to the Committee debate on 14 December where the technical aspects were discussed. I also remind the Senate that during the Committee hearing the Liberal-National Party coalition moved five significant amendments, which were lost. In accordance with the agreement we made in setting up the hearing by that Committee, the Opposition will not be putting those amendments for a vote today. Readers of this debate should be aware of the issues that were raised and that the amendments were lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to thank all those people who were associated with the hurriedly convened meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on Friday, 14 December. That gave us a valuable opportunity to discuss this legislation, despite the application of the guillotine arrangements applying to Bills within this chamber. I thank the Committee Chairman, Senator Coates, Senator McMullan, and also officers of the Australian Taxation Office for coming along, answering our questions and agreeing to take so many of the others on notice. We look forward to their responses later on. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to state that not all overseas businesses are involved in the tax avoidance industry, which so often seems to be implied in debates on tax avoidance. For example, it has come to my attention that the National Australia Bank has rejected lucrative proposals for certain tax effective forms of lending because the schemes were outside the spirit of the law. So not everybody is associated with tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are anomalies in this legislation, some of which we addressed during the committee stage of the debate last Friday. I think further anomalies will emerge after the enactment of this legislation, when industry has had a full opportunity to evaluate the ramifications of this wide-ranging legislation. There has been over two years of extensive consultation on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is set apart from most other legislation in that there has been wide community input. That is reflected in the fact that this is the third or perhaps fourth draft of this legislation. I note the cooperation of all the parties that have been involved in trying to get this legislation as correct as possible, having regard to the need to minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. Of course, this has not been done without cost. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that it has cost the Treasury at least $33,000 in outside consultants' fees alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Australian corporations operating overseas will be adversely affected. Those that particularly come to mind that I have some concern about are those in the resource area. We call on the Government adequately to address such issues in subsequent legislation in order to-and I continually refer to this-enhance the integrity of tax law. I think we have to acknowledge that this legislation is but the first in a series of Bills which cover foreign companies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that a Bill has already been introduced in the other House, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6), which addresses a number of issues in relation to the foreign income area. Over the past 18 months we have seen this legislation change and expand. It has grown from 119 pages of proposed legislation plus explanatory memoranda, to 221 pages in June and 236 pages before us now. Unfortunately, the regulations have not yet been determined and one can only hazard a guess as to what the extent of the regulations will be when we consider that the explanatory memoranda now exceed 416 pages. I must explain that draft regulations were included in the explanatory memoranda of the earlier draft, but unfortunately they have not been included in the Bill before the Senate. The Liberal-National Party coalition therefore calls on the Government for the early release of those regulations to apply and be backdated to 1 July, which is the commencement date of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> While a degree of complexity in legislation may be essential in the interests of maintaining certainty and equity in the tax regime, I think this Bill has created the reverse situation. This present legislation builds complexity on complexity. The result is that even the simplest amendments give rise to almost unending consequential changes, which is a sure recipe for uncertainty and confusion. I acknowledge that there has been widespread consultation-and that is good and I encourage it for the future-resulting in major improvements compared with the original draft Bill. However, I draw the Senate's attention to an unfortunate comment that appears in the second reading speech-that complexity is the price taxpayers and their advisers must pay for the consultation process. Such an attitude to taxpayers is, I think, unfortunately more reminiscent of despotism than democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Since interpretation is not easy or straightforward, complex legislation of this kind will merely enlarge the coffers of tax lawyers and accountants. While these are honourable professions, the creation of a forced market for their services adds nothing to Australia's real economic output. Further, complex legal, penal legislation has the unfortunate effect of undermining not only respect for the Parliament, but also, more seriously, respect for the law. The law comes to be despised by those who do not understand it because they are presumed to understand the incomprehensible and are subject to its penalties, and by those who do understand it because they see it as an overreaching intrusion into their personal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> In order for legislation to be fully effective, an appropriate public education campaign or program must be conducted by the Australian Taxation Office. Without such an understanding of the provisions of legislation and their practical effect, particularly in a self-assessment environment, the effect of the provisions will be fairly limited. Even with knowledge of the law, how many taxpayers can be sure, for example, that they will never be deemed to be transferors to or beneficiaries of foreign trusts whose existence they remain totally unaware of? I think that is a real problem with the legislation that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I see as being of great concern is the unintended consequences in the area of capital gains. It may now be necessary to obtain variations of offshore assets held on 1 July 1990, as all offshore assets now come within the capital gains tax for controlled foreign companies. Previously, only assets acquired after 19 September 1985 were subject to tax on disposal. To be consistent with the general capital gains tax philosophy of non-retrospectivity, the Bill should apply only to assets acquired after July 1990. In certain quarters, this Bill has been viewed not only as an attack on certain avoidance transactions, but as outright aggression by the Government against large companies. To the extent that that view is prevalent, I think it is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to refer honourable senators to a submission on this Bill by Mr Terrence Dwyer, a former senior adviser in the taxation and income security section of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He made a submission to the Selection of Bills Committee. He stated forcefully that he does not see this Bill as advancing Australia's long term interests. I think that is an important point of view. In fact, it is a point of view that is shared by the Business Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the coalition believes that to further delay this legislation will be counterproductive, given that the decision has been made that Australia requires such complex provisions and those provisions have been largely operating from 1 July 1990. The coalition asks that this legislation be placed on the statute books before Christmas. There is a need to establish some certainty before the law, and this process will help ensure that, rather than further delay the matter. Nevertheless, there are a number of very clear anomalies which mean that certain sections of Australian industry could be adversely affected. I call on the Government to recognise these problems as they occur and to introduce legislation or support amendments promptly as these problems arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us presents specific problems for the banking industry. Previous foreign tax exemption regimes treated overseas branches and subsidiaries of Australian corporations in the same manner. This foreign source legislation distinguishes between branches and subsidiaries. Australian resident banks operating overseas generally operate through a branch network because it enables them to raise their funds more cheaply and overcomes the necessity of Australian banks to establish substantial capital in various overseas centres where the subsidiaries or corporations operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is to give the banks an income exemption. The Government alleges that the banks should not be worse off under the foreign tax credit system. However, not to be worse off, the banks will need to incorporate their branches. Possible disadvantages for the banks will stem from this requirement, because some overseas countries will not allow foreign banks to incorporate for prudential reasons. Secondly, it will result in an unnecessarily arduous administrative burden for the banks. Overall, it appears that the legislation will not mean a lot of additional tax for the banks, but they will be required to change their normal commercial, non-tax avoiding arrangements, and this will make them less competitive and will raise the cost of finance to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the banks have small subsidiary arrangements in centres such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Jersey. Generally they are not there for tax avoidance purposes but for deposit taking and fund raising. The problem seems to be that the Government and the Australian Taxation Office, and certainly some committees of this Parliament, do not really understand what is going on. The concern is that such transactions will become open areas of manipulation. Consultation has occurred with the banks resulting in some concessions-and I thank the Government for that. However, the point is that these concessions are not working and do not appear to work. Hopefully, the Government will be called upon to address these issues in the next amending Bill, which will probably come into the Parliament during the autumn session next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government's preoccupation with the Bill has arisen as a result of the tremendous outflow of funds arising from deregulation. Perhaps this has warped the thinking to some extent, because I think it was wrongly perceived that most of this money or outflow was actually tax avoidance money. In many cases, it was merely a case of companies, having outgrown the scope of the Australian market, seeking investment opportunities overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern is that this Bill is retrospective. I believe that not enough time has been given since 13 September, when this present Bill was introduced, for businesses to comprehend what is now being introduced. In fact, one of our amendments lost at the committee stage last Friday sought to overcome one of the retrospective provisions. The legislation before us proposes that the Bill become law as from 1 July 1990. The second draft, with its extra 100 pages or so, was issued on 27 June. Three days, including a weekend, is certainly not long enough for a business with overseas interests to read, digest and put its house in order. I regard as even more horrific the fact that the September version of the Bill introduced changes on which no warning whatsoever was given, in particular the changes that occurred in relation to the non-resident trust provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan, who is the Government Minister overseeing this Bill, stated in a reported interview in the Taxation in Australia magazine that given the earlier wider debate plenty of notice has been given about the new provisions and that it is not appropriate to announce a commencement date, even if that date precedes parliamentary approval. But I reiterate that three days notice-and we now have further changes, with further changes still to come-is not regarded as plenty of notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The retrospective aspect of the Bill does not stop with the 1 July commencement date. The provisions of the Bill with regard to the trust transfer tax measures apply to transfers made at any time before the Bill becomes law and can even apply theoretically to transactions which occurred before Federation or outside Australia. A tax adviser has indicated to me that the Bill casts its net so wide that it catches transactions which cannot possibly be regarded as resulting in any avoidance of Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I give honourable senators a couple of examples. An Australian-born United Kingdom resident has dual UK-Australian tax residence by virtue of maintaining a pastoral property and residence which he visits annually. This person, who is regarded as a UK resident under the UK-Australian tax treaty because his home is in the UK, created a trust in Jersey in 1936. The income of that trust will now be subject to Australian transferor tax measures. It is irrelevant that the money which comprised the trust was never in Australia and that the trust is dealt with under UK law or that the person may not be regarded as an Australian tax resident because of the tax treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> My second example concerns a business migrant who comes to Australia from Hong Kong, where he set up a family trust in 1949. On the migrant taking up residence in Australia, the Bill could deem the income of that family trust to be part of his taxable income in Australia, even though he has no rights to it, notwithstanding that the trust funds never came to Australia and that the trust was set up before he came to Australia, before Australia had such legislation and even before he, as a migrant, thought that he might ultimately reside here. It has been intimated to me that, for clarity to be obtained in this area, appeals to the High Court of Australia will certainly occur. Unfortunately, how many taxpayers can really afford to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the topic of family trusts, I mention another aspect that was in the June draft. The Bill gave an exemption for transfers to non-resident family trusts whose only beneficiaries were non-resident family members. That exemption was narrow enough but has been removed in the Bill before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is that the Commissioner of Taxation must be satisfied that indigent relatives are not being given too much money. I believe it is morally offensive that, on the one hand, a government gives millions of dollars in foreign aid but, on the other hand, someone wanting to help overseas relatives is limited in so doing by the Commissioner and has to prove that the relatives need help. The Bill allows an amnesty in the area of a non-resident family trust.There is a tax concession in the area of resident trust to encourage people to come forward. In the first instance, the amnesty applies not only to the income but also to the capital component. The second problem is that there could be an application of part IVA of the Act, the general anti-avoidance provisions. The tax amnesty providing a reduced tax rate of 10 per cent is unlikely to bring forth a significant flow of funds. In fact, it could even initiate a Taxation Office investigation going back as far as the original shifting of the funds offshore. </PARA>
<PARA> Another objectionable aspect of the Bill is its evidentiary rule regarding offshore information notices. The coalition sought to remove this provision because it believed that there were other adequate provisions in the Act to cope with section 264a. The Opposition does not believe in giving draconian powers to a government when there are adequate measures elsewhere in the Act, especially in view of the constitutional and other issues that proposed section 264a raises. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the onus of proof is already heavily on the taxpayer in dispute over tax assessment, why should the courts be prevented from examining all the evidence? Parliament has in fact amended the Acts Interpretation Act to enable the courts to look at extrinsic aids to interpretation of legislation. Why should we now seek to prevent the courts from reading all that relevant information? The doctrine of the separation of legislative and judicial powers does appear in this legislation to be going at something of a discount. I mentioned at the committee stage how I felt this undermined respect for the law. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation in many aspects is really an adoption of what operates in the United States. However, in the United States the rights of US taxpayers are protected. Australia has not incorporated the protections given to taxpayers as the US has done. For example, the US Constitution prohibits retrospective legislation, guarantees due process of law and imposes strict requirements on searches and seizures. A taxpayer's Bill of rights has also been adopted recently in response to perceived abuses by the US inland reven- ue system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also raises problems for Australia's foreign relations and trade as well as other areas of international cooperation. In fact, the Bill lists countries as being either acceptable or unacceptable tax havens. Originally, there was a long list of countries which related roughly to tax haven status. After representations by the business community regarding legitimate business activities, we now have tainted and active income. </PARA>
<PARA> The listing of countries as acceptable or unacceptable tax havens raises concerns and problems in my mind with regard to Australia's relations in trade as well as others areas of international cooperation, such as mutual legal assistance, extradition and so on. Australia basically is telling over 150 countries that they are unacceptable tax havens; of the remaining 60 or so, most have unacceptable tax haven features in their law, including several of Australia's tax treaty partners. I think that is an unfortunate approach, which can rightly be inferred from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is proposing that whenever such identified tax havens exist, it will assert the right to tax tainted income of entities in those countries which are owned, controlled or associated directly or indirectly with Australians. Thus Australia will impose tax on the foreign income of foreign entities and collect it by formally imposing the liability on Australians deemed to be in receipt of income from those entities. </PARA>
<PARA> One can expect that foreign countries may well resent such a high-handed approach to taxation income arising within their borders or from entities in their jurisdiction. This idea has not received wide international acceptance, notwithstanding the fact that it was adopted by a few capital exporting countries. Australia is basically therefore placing a black ban on Australian passive investment in most of the rest of the world. Consequently, Australia should not expect those countries to assist when we seek help in such matters as tariff reductions, extradition, access to evidentiary information, et cetera. These countries can be expected to resent this Bill's de facto extraterritorial taxation of income arising within their borders to entities under their jurisdiction. That resentment may translate into non-cooperation on a wide range of issues; for example, it could endanger Australia's attempt to secure modern extradition treaties or to enforce legislation in respect of insider trading where there is a foreign nexus. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may well ask whether Australia's best long term interests are being served by such extraterritorial legislation, which seeks to assert taxing rights over the foreign income of foreign entities. We should also remember that basically this country is a capital importing country. At the same time-to counteract this-we are encouraging Australian companies to expand overseas, but this Bill will impose a large, arduous administrative burden on them. The overall effect will be to discourage overseas investment by Australian companies and foreign entities investing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the unilateral attempt by Australia to override its tax treaties with other countries should be of concern. I noticed today-and I will not have time to comment-that Australia is implementing tax treaties with a number of other countries. The legislation before us will, in part, override some of those tax treaties. I understand that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development recently expressed objection to the unilateral use of domestic legislation to override tax treaties; again that is an unfortunate aspect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia feels that tax treaties are not to its advantage, it is free to give notice of termination to other countries as prescribed in the particular treaties and unilaterally override a different proposition. The Australian Parliament can abrogate its international treaty obligation if it wishes to do so, but one would have thought that such legislation belonged to other, less civilised places. I refer specifically to page 157, subdivision (b), where the double tax arrangements are to be disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add my voice to the fact that this Bill, like so many other tax Bills before us, gives a large amount of discretionary power to the Commissioner of Taxation. That is an issue that should quickly be rectified in the tax simplification process. I hope the Government will take on board the need for legislative backing for this tax simplification process during the autumn session before June 1991. I find the use of discretionary power in this Bill unfortunate. I think it is fundamentally wrong that Parliament should abrogate such power to an unelected and personally unaccountable official, given the nature of the discretions provided in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Other opportunities exist for multiple assessments, which could be raised as a result of the unfettered discretion of the Commissioner, and I believe that is unfortunate. Time precludes a more thorough evaluation of this, but I would like to finish by asking: why, as a capital importing country, is Australia adopting a Fortress Australia mentality? Why is Australia constructing a tax regime which does not encourage Australians to invest overseas? At present there is not enough incentive for Australians with accumulations in lowly taxed foreign countries to remit money to Australia. Why in some instances are Australians being penalised more harshly for investing overseas than in home-based operations? Are there not too many new discretions in this legislation, given the Government's move to remove them from the Act? Why is it necessary to have a predisposition to collect the last cent of every dollar, creating an unnecessary complex Act? Why not a simpler approach; for example, even adopting such things as a high integrity clearing certification system? The Bill has a number of defects, but despite those, and because the business community in this country which operates overseas wishes to get something in place, we do not oppose these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thought in responding to this debate I should start by outlining what the legislation is about, otherwise anybody listening might not be fully cognisant because a lot of the debate has been about peripheral matters. I will then respond to some of these matters without unduly duplicating the extensive discussion that took place last Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer in particular to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill because that is the principal Bill before us and the one which has been the subject of most discussion. It has to be seen in the context of an ongoing program of reform of the tax system. It is a very important piece in the Government's long term program of reform of the tax system. It has a fundamental objective and the detail of it cannot properly be assessed without consideration of that objective. That is, it is a question of ensuring that honest taxpayers in Australia do not have to pay a higher level of tax to deliver the services that Australians require of their government because others who should be paying are improperly avoiding their responsibilities through the use of artificial devices, some of which relate to questions of foreign income and issues that are generally called tax havens. </PARA>
<PARA> When one talks about taxpayers' rights and the need to protect those rights-I do not denigrate that concept-it is important to realise that the fundamental right of taxpayers which this Bill is designed to protect is that of the overwhelmingly majority of the Australian taxpayers not to have to subsidise almost inevitably more wealthy people who are avoiding their proper responsibilities and transferring them to the rest of the honest, ordinary Australian working men and women paying their pay as you earn tax every fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> That is fundamentally what this Bill is about and it has not had much mention. Until one takes that into account, one cannot assess the details of what I acknowledge is a very complex piece of legislation. There are a number of issues that will need ongoing debate and some that will need to be reviewed over the years as this Bill develops, is implemented and administered and as we see its practical outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the claim that in some way this has not been a properly considered matter. Senator Short, in summing up his remarks, quoted a New South Wales accountant. I would love to debate some of the issues to which that accountant referred in another debate because we do not have time now. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall intention of that summation, which obviously did not refer to this bit of the legislation-nor did very much else that Senator Short said; I will come back to that in a moment-gave the impression that it had all been too quick and that no-one had had enough time to adjust. The proposals which we are implementing now were first announced in April 1989. It is true that there have been changes of important detail since that time, but the fundamental principles are unchanged. There has been a number of subsequent press statements, draft Bills and, I would contend, the most comprehensive consultation ever seen in Australia on taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, as has been said, introduces an accrual system of taxing foreign source income that has been derived in low tax countries by Australian controlled entities and has been accumulated offshore. To divert to Senator Watson's conclusion, it is not an attack upon those countries. Those countries are entitled to structure their tax system as they choose. It is saying that Australians who avoid through artificial means the laws of Australia by misusing the laws of those countries will not be given the opportunity artificially thereby to transfer their responsibility to other Australians. It is not a piece of extraterritorial legislation at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The consultative process has led to a number of significant changes; for example, the control rule and active income tests were not features of the first consultative document at all. But those who leap in and condemn the complexity of the legislation have to take into account that some of that complexity arises not simply from the process of consultation. I do not think it is fair to say that we are criticising people and saying, `This is the price you have to pay for consultation'. We do say, quite accurately, that a number of people came forward and sought changes, sought compromises, in the way the legislation operated in their interests and in what they perceived as the broader interests of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the negotiation of those compromises, inevitably the Bill became more complex; in many ways I think better, and that indicates simple is not always best. The total misunderstanding of the concept of simplification that seems to be around is that somehow or other we can magically have a simple tax system. We will not have that. At the end of the simplification process, we will still have a complicated tax system. The simplification process is about taking out the unnecessary complications and complexities and reducing the burdens of compliance cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Those consultative processes are continuing. They are suggesting further improvements and areas of concern, and we are continuing to examine them. As Senator Watson said, some of those concerns are dealt with in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6), which the Senate will be dealing with early next year, and some others were dealt with in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearing, including one raised by Senator Watson and referred to today by Senator Spindler concerning the possibility of a problem with double tax, which is a question with which we will have to deal in the future. I acknowledged that at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to put those broad questions of the underlying principles on the table first before I dealt with the comments of the speakers in the second reading debate. First of all, I should thank all the speakers for the fact that they supported the legislation. I think that is important. It is also important for all Australian taxpayers affected to know, whatever reservations individuals have about details-the Australian Democrats have different reservations from those of the coalition, but reservations nonetheless-that what the Bill is trying to achieve has the unanimous support of this Parliament. That is an important point for people to remember. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not spend so much time responding to what I thought were actually the more substantial contributions from Senator Spindler and Senator Watson, because we have had a substantial opportunity already to have that discussion. If people want to refer to that detail, the Hansard of Friday's Committee hearing is available to them. I will deal with some of those important questions, but not in such length as I did on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> I do want to deal with some of the things Senator Short said in what I thought was a masterful display of ignorance about the tax system as a whole and this Bill in particular. I really think that he needs someone else to write his speeches on tax matters because he got some things wrong and some things were entirely gratuitously offensive. Obviously, he made some points that were accurate, and I broadly put those under the heading of `the need to watch closely the development of this legislation'. I think that is correct. I think we all share that view. </PARA>
<PARA> He then want on to wax eloquent about how this legislation has been mishandled, how there were attempts to circumvent parliamentary scrutiny, et cetera. I have to say that that is entirely untrue and ill-founded. I am not actually sure of what he was talking about, unless it refers to the point he came back to later about the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills about which he is fundamentally wrong. If he is saying that in some way the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did not respond to the concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, he is wrong. He just has insulted the Senate by failing to do the most fundamental homework, such as looking at what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has said. We have had correspondence with members of the Committee. It is true that we have not agreed with everything the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has put to us-and if it expects that it is praying for miracles-but there has been substantial consultation and it has in fact thanked us for the consultative process which we have undertaken with regard to this matter. What Senator Short said was just one of those throw away jibes that people think they can get away with. Sometimes they can, because nobody who knows the truth is listening. His misfortune is that this time we were listening, and he might need to give a bit more consideration to what he says. </PARA>
<PARA> He then went on about how complex and lengthy the whole tax system is and quoted from sources saying that it was getting more voluminous. I have heard those quotes before, because he is reading from the same source as a lot of other people. But at the very same time the Opposition is saying that the tax system is getting more voluminous and that we are getting extra legislation, court determinations and more rulings, we are getting proper, sensible requests from a lot of people for more rulings. It is said that we need to expedite the process and provide more resources so that we can give more rulings. Senator Watson has been raising that point; he is quite right. But we cannot have it both ways; we cannot have more rulings and less output. It does not work like that. The rules of arithmetic still apply. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It never occurred to me that the word `ignoramus' was unparliamentary, but if it is I will withdraw it. The fact of the matter is that this is necessarily complex legislation, because we are dealing with a fundamentally complex issue. We are dealing with a situation where a diverse range of taxpayers have gone about doing two things, both of which need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should remember the objectives of the Bill-that is, to make sure that all income is taxed once and none of it is taxed twice; and to parallel that to ensure that those Australian companies which are seeking to go about legitimate business in unlisted countries can do that on an equal basis with companies based in all other countries in the world, and that they can compete equally with countries of other origin operating under other tax systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we are trying to achieve a difficult balance between competing demands to ensure that we crack down on tax avoidance, to ensure that we do not do so in a way that is unfair to Australians by taxing them twice and to ensure that we do so in a way that does not preclude Australian business from efficiently and competitively carrying out its responsibilities and rights in overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why it is complex. I do not apologise for the complexity. It is legislation that will continue to be reviewed but it will not, as a consequence, become simpler. It may become better but it will not become simpler. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) will certainly not make the system simpler, although I think it will make it better. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to two things that Senator Spindler said. We properly debated the other matters last week. One is not related to this Bill but it is related to his assertion about economic policy overall and about the net income deficit. Anybody who imagines that the Australian net income deficit is driven by the tax system fails to understand that the net income deficit arises inevitably and inexorably from the fact that we have something called debt and, therefore, we pay interest. It is not a tax-driven outcome; it is the inevitable consequence of other economic factors and quite separate. It is not, I regret to say, likely to be affected by this legislation. This legislation has many virtues but that is not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second important point which Senator Spindler made and which I need to respond to now or in the committee stage-I will do it now to save time-is his proposed amendment to deal with the definition of tainted income. It is a bit disappointing that we find ourselves in the position of dealing with this amendment. I thought that we went through that valuable but lengthy and difficult-in terms of organisation of people's schedules-committee stage on Friday so that we would not have to take up the limited time available today in dealing with those amendments. Nevertheless, let me respond to Senator Spindler's point. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee last Friday I said-and I repeat it now-that the 5 per cent limit that has been established does not have some magical quality which says, `Here is the overwhelming objective evidence that says 5 per cent is the perfect rate'. Nobody can say that in advance. I suspect that, even after the evidence is in over several years, nobody will be able to say that there is a perfect level-and whether it is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 per cent everybody will have his or her view. But what one can say is that 2 per cent is too low, that 7 per cent would be too high, and that somewhere in the middle is about right.</PARA>
<PARA> We are balancing the two factors I mentioned before-the need to have the level set sufficiently low that avoidance is properly caught, and also set at a sufficient level that Australian companies trying to carry out bona fide businesses can operate in these areas, particularly in their early years when they may have a larger element of tainted income than would be the case in later years because of the necessary capital requirements in the early stages of conducting a business. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not be accepting the amendment. Two per cent is too low to achieve the second of those objectives and, therefore, we think that 5 per cent is as good a balance as can be struck. I do not want to give it any higher justification than that. We have balanced competing pressures and we have come to what is generally regarded as a fair compromise. I think we should stick to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson raised a lot of detailed points. If I took up my full half-hour I could deal with them all, but that would not allow Senator Spindler sufficient time to deal with his amendment in the committee stage, et cetera. I do not want to take all that time and virtually close the debate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us deal with that subsequently. I am happy to look at what the procedural options are on that. It is hard to know to which of the points that Senator Watson raised I should respond in the time available. It might be better if I deal with some of those that did not come up so much on Friday. For example, there is concern about the innocent shareholder who may be caught without knowing whether the company with which he or she is associated is a controlled foreign company. The mechanism in the Bill that is designed to ensure that minor contributors are not caught is that shareholders either alone or with associates must hold 10 per cent of a company for attribution to occur. It is commonly regarded, and I think appropriately, that it would be very unusual for a person to have a holding of this magnitude without having some level of knowledge of the nature and operations of the company in which he or she was investing. So we have endeavoured to address that. Time may show that the mechanism is not appropriate. On the evidence, I think it is, and we will continue to support it until we get further information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk about capital gains because there is a potential for misunderstanding, although I doubt that Senator Watson misunderstands. The Bill applies to all assets, but only to movements in value after 30 June 1990. I think it strikes the appropriate balance once again. It would be either very complex or very discriminatory to try to move towards some other proposal. The original proposal was to apply capital gains tax only to assets acquired after 19 September 1985 and not have a valuation date. However, in the process of consultation the clear view was that that form of grandfathering was not the preferred mechanism, and the Government was not prepared to look at alternative grandfathering mechanisms. Therefore, the valuation date mechanism seems to be an effective one and deals with the concerns that otherwise might properly have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not regard the Bill as one that has elements of retrospectivity that should cause concern. We debated that mainly in the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Senator Watson made a comment and moved an amendment at the Committee hearing relating to non-resident family trusts. This Bill certainly deals with non-resident family trusts in a different way from the draft Bill. The evidence that became available after the release of the draft Bill was that, firstly, there was a loophole in the June Bill and, secondly, people were assiduously trying to re-arrange their affairs such that they would exploit that loophole. We have closed it. I make absolutely no apologies for acting in that way. We would obviously do the same again in similar circumstances. I have the same view about the issue of the offshore notice amendment, which was another matter debated extensively on Friday and the subject of an Opposition amendment. We stand by the proposed section 264a, the offshore notice amendment. I do not regard it as either retrospective or as seeking to prevent the court from having access to documents. It is not retrospective in so far as it operates from today. It is like any other law enforcement mechanism. The analogy I used on Friday was the search warrant. If we changed the Crimes Act to change the way in which the Australian Federal Police could get access to a search warrant, that search warrant would apply to offences committed before that date; it could not be used retrospectively. A search warrant cannot be used yesterday; it is not retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> The understanding of the mechanism is not apparent from either the amendments or the comments made in support of it. It is also not seeking to prevent the court having access to the documents. Our real objective is that the court should have access to documents. What we do not want is selective access to documents-that is, while the Australian Taxation Office is conducting its investigation these documents are unable to be provided and, when we get to court, having been denied access to them, some of them magically appear and the problems are overcome, with no way to judge whether they are all the documents. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the situation in which, if people choose not to provide the information in the early stages and seek to introduce it in the court and the Commissioner denies the right to introduce it, that is a reviewable decision by the Commissioner and appealable in the courts. That is appropriate and that is what this Bill says. I do not hold the view that it is unconstitutional. I assume that will be tested. At this stage, on the basis of advice taken, I do not take that as a very serious issue, but I understand that others do and get very excited about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to do two things: firstly, to reiterate the significance that the Government places on this Bill as a question of principle and, secondly, to give my thanks to the Senate for its support. Certainly on behalf of the Government, and I suspect on behalf of the Senate as a whole, I thank the officers who have put so much assiduous work into the development of this very important and difficult piece of legislation and who continue to work on it. Their work is reflected in the amendments that are already before the Parliament and the other issues that continue to be raised, including in the course of this debate. They have done Australia a service. I thank them for their work and I thank the Senate for its support of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>I will make only two brief comments since I adverted to the amendments in the second reading debate.

I was not under the impression that I gave up my right to move these amendments when I agreed to a committee hearing. Senator Watson asked for a committee hearing; I merely agreed to participate. I will not detain the Committee for long. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply pick up one comment of Senator Watson's in the second reading debate where he asked the rhetorical question: do we really have to get every last dollar? On behalf of the taxpayer my answer is yes. I therefore support in broad terms the Parliamentary Secretary's statements on the purpose of the legislation. In this instance I believe that the Government has not gone far enough to get every last dollar. It is in that spirit that I have moved these two amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to express my disappointment in the Australian Democrats re-running these amendments. As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that dealt with the Bill on Friday, my understanding-I know that Senator Spindler's understanding is different-was that the Bill would be considered on the basis that the amendments would not be run again in the Committee of the Whole. Senator Watson has done the right thing in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats, as well the Opposition, have insisted that the new system of referral of Bills to committees continue. By acting as they have with this Bill they have only increased my dissatisfaction with the system. I do not object-I could not legitimately object-to the re-running of amendments in the Committee of the Whole if the outcome would be different, acknowledging the difference of numbers in here compared with the numbers on the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been reasonable in the Committee of the Whole, as Senator Watson is doing, merely to allude to the fact that the amendments were dealt with in the Finance and Public Administration Committee meeting on Friday and not seek to move them again here. The circulation of the amendments has made the report of the Committee irrelevant. As I say, if that is going to keep on happening, it increases the dissatisfaction with this system. If the system is going to be given a fair trial, more committee reports ought to be dealt with by the Minister moving that the report of the committee be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1990 and the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I wish to confine my remarks to the second Bill. I will leave it to my colleague Senator Watson to deal with the first. I am sure that he will withstand any pressure that might be directed at him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 sets out a number of relatively minor changes which are not opposed by the Opposition. Indeed, we take the general view that they strengthen the provisions. I suppose it is just as well that any intelligent member of the public does not rely on a Minister's second reading speech in order to attempt to gauge the success of an exercise. This is probably a classic case study in that regard. All that the second reading speech tells us is that the child support scheme has been operating for just over two years and that in that time we have seen a substantial turnaround in the payment of maintenance for children who are living in single parent families. We then get a bland statistic about how collection rates have risen. </PARA>
<PARA> That second reading speech very much disguises what has been a very good concept-one which we have supported from the outset but which has had a number of very significant difficulties attached to its implementation. Perhaps the most glaring of these has been the question of delays. This has been a matter of particular concern to me because even prior to accepting shadow responsibility in this area I had a number of complaints directed to my office from people who were in the extraordinary situation of never having had any problems in regard to the collection of maintenance. They were able to rely on regular payments from, in most instances, the father of the child. However, they had been told by the Child Support Agency that, henceforth, moneys had to be paid through it. </PARA>
<PARA> In one celebrated instance I had a case of a wife who had always received her money on time. She was told that there would be a delay on the part of the Agency in terms of collection. When she told her ex-husband about this, he agreed to continue to make direct payments and in fact gave her a lump sum to tide her over the expected four- to six-week gap. When the Agency discovered that, it roundly abused him and told him that he immediately had to withdraw the payment and direct all further payments through it. </PARA>
<PARA> That, I think, was probably the high-water mark, but we still have very significant difficulties. Despite the fact that, according to a recent paper, some of these delays have been largely overcome, as recently as 29 May 1990 Senator Richardson admitted that processing delays of up to five months were continuing to occur. I have recently had correspondence from people for whom these sorts of difficulties continue. In some instances they did not get a reply after some months; in others they got token replies only. It seems to me still to be an intolerable situation. I do not understand how the Government can receive money from a non-custodial parent, pocket the money, obtain interest on it and then have delays which it explains away by saying that there is only a monthly cycle and that somehow parents are expected to meet the convenience of the Department or the Agency. That is an outrageous situation and I hope that at long last we will see something done about delays. There should not be any reason for any delay at all. Bureaucratic inconvenience is surely the worst possible excuse for such a situation, and I hope we will be given some proper explanations. </PARA>
<PARA> The projected savings from the scheme when it was first announced were in the order of $120m in 1988-89 and $190m in 1989-90. In fact, we have seen savings of $19m and $37m respectively in those periods. The publicly advanced major reasons for the shortfall due to the slower than expected take-up rates include modification to the scheme as originally planned and legislative and administrative delays. It demonstrates an unduly optimistic approach from the outset and a less than adequate recognition of the inevitable teething problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There continue to be a number of difficulties in terms of fairness of the formulas, work disincentives, accessibility of the appeals process and a particularly vexing question, the use of the previous year's taxable income as the basis for assessing a reasonable figure, which does not really take account of what the Agency regards as minor variations. I think the figure is about 20 or 25 per cent before it is taken into account. Quite clearly even a variation of 10 or 15 per cent can make a very significant difference to the non-custodial parent, yet these mechanical formulas simply ignore those difficulties. Quite a degree of publicity has attached to people-particularly the self-employed-who are able to artificially minimise their income for the purposes of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there still remains a lot of work to be done. It is unfortunate that the second reading speech is typical of the attempt to gloss over these difficulties. I look forward to the Government making a full explanation of just what it proposes to do in response to the difficulties to date. I do not regard the Institute of Family Studies interim report-which the Institute goes out of its way to say is not meant to be even an initial valuation-as in any way a satisfactory Government response. The commissioning of that study, which was essentially a longitudinal study, is not any consolation at all to the many hundreds of people, based on my own experience, who seem to be still complaining about inordinate delays. I hope that the Government will act with a much greater degree of expedition than it has shown to date. </PARA>

The latter Bill proposes to alter the thin capitalisation rules-in other words, the rules which prescribe the maximum gearing of certain foreign investment into Australia for tax deductibility purposes; to modify the gold tax in relation to the capital gains tax provisions; to amend the dividend imputation rules to deal with situations arising under the new company tax payment arrangements; to alter the rules for taxation of quarrying operations; to increase certain aspects of the zone rebate; to alter the tax treatment of disposals of contaminated livestock; and to alter the names of organisations currently entitled to tax deductible status where these names have changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the heading of thin capitalisation the Bill seeks to deal with international transactions of financial institutions which are cleared through nostro and vostro accounts. Under the existing thin capitalisation rules, anomalies arise in the treatment of amounts in these accounts. The amendments are severely retrospective in operation but arise because of industry requests. The thin capitalisation provisions provide a maximum amount of interest which qualifies as a tax deduction for an Australian business which is at least 15 per cent controlled by non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Further amendments concern the structure of business group and the change from day to day to weighted average measure of foreign debt. These will result in the loosening of the provisions which disallow excessive interest payments. However, it is unclear whether this will cost any revenue. It is an indictment of the Government that during a recession it is bringing before us legislation which can only have the effect of lessening the tax paid by foreign controlled financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to goldmining. To coincide with the commencement of the taxation of goldmining income, capital gains which accrue after 1 January 1991 will be subject to tax when the assets are subsequently sold. However, the existing legislation which is repealed by this Bill and the wider provision being inserted by this Bill propose to maintain the existing grandfathering of assets acquired before 20 September 1985. Now that the Sex Discrimination Act applies to taxation laws, perhaps we should talk about grandparenting provisions instead of grandfathering provisions. The Government's proposal means that assets acquired after 19 September 1985 will be valued on 31 December 1990. This value will then form the cost base of the asset for tax purposes. All future real increases in value will be taxed, whereas assets held before 20 September 1985 can go on earning capital gains which are exempt from tax. The Australian Democrats do not agree with this provision. It is submitted that it is inequitable and inserts yet another complexity and unnecessary distortion into our tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, when tax was extended to superannuation funds all assets were valued as at 1 July 1988 and are now subject to tax as they appreciate. If it is good enough for the Government to tax the four million members of superannuation funds on shares, real estate and so on which were purchased before 20 September 1985, then surely assets owned by goldmining companies which have never paid any tax should all be treated in an equivalent way. Therefore, I shall be moving an amendment in the committee stage to eliminate grandparenting and to subject all assets to a valuation date of 31 December 1990. Apart from the equity considerations, the identical treatment of assets will eliminate the distortions which tax bias would otherwise introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, a value must be assigned to existing trading stock for the commencement of income tax on 1 January 1991. Trading stock provisions are easily manipulable and hence anti-avoidance provisions are included. We support these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of imputation, last year the Government ended the deferral enjoyed by companies in paying income tax. Whilst we supported the proposal to end the unwarranted tax deferral which companies obtained from the previous quarterly system, we thought the Government's proposals were too tough on small business. Former Senator Haines moved an amendment which would have had the effect of exempting from next July's D-Day all companies which earned less than $200,000. The Opposition would not support that amendment, and small business will bear the brunt of that decision; in fact, it is currently doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has had the unintended consequence of creating some anomalies in the imputation system which, if left unchecked, would allow certain profits to be distributed by companies tax free. The Bill proposes to adjust these anomalies. An additional problem arises for companies which did not take advantage of the loophole, possibly because of anticipation of this amendment. A special provision ensures that these companies are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of quarrying operations, the Government broadly aligned the tax treatment of mining and quarrying operations in last year's Budget. An anomaly with respect to the recoupment of exploration and prospecting expenditure was included in that legislation. The amendment proposed here simply aligns the treatment between the mining and quarrying industries and is supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax system recognises the additional costs of living in extremely isolated areas by granting a zone rebate. This rebate was reviewed and the review recommended aligning the amount of rebate available for residents of the two most isolated of the four zones. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Minister. The last part of the question was: does the Minister believe that this union-that is, the Building Workers Industrial Union-is a more principled and ethical organisation than the Western Australian branch of the Builders Labourers Federation, led by Kevin Reynolds, the federal registration of which may be prevented by his BLF deregistration legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a fairly tawdry effort to try to massage discontent in the building industry. But let me take the questions seriatim. On the question of legal aid, the New South Wales Greiner Government has decided to conduct a royal commission into the building industry in that State. That is a perfect right of that Government-I acknowledge that-and it has proceeded to do that. I might say in passing that thus far the evidence that has been adduced from the proceedings of that Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales has reflected extraordinarily badly on employers rather than on unions. But we are yet to hear all of the evidence. When we have, and when we have the recommendations of the Royal Commission, we can make a judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reference to a $1m slush fund is one that escapes me because I know of no such slush fund. What I do know of is an allegation that a slush fund exists; but I am not one in the field of industrial relations to take allegations as facts and then act on them. I want to be careful, because to be careful means that one might do the right thing and resolve a problem rather than create one, which would happen if one simply accepted allegations at face value. I am aware that the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, which is proceeding to negotiate-and hopefully, bring off-a series of amalgamations, is developing a fund in order that all of the new participating unions can join an amalgamation on an equal financial footing. If that is described as a slush fund, I guess that is the description that the namers of that fund give it. But, in my parlance, it is an amalgamation fund and a fund for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> Do I regard the BWIU as the principal union? In the process of union rationalisations, the existing unions will lose their identities. I do not see union rationalisation as meaning that existing unions accrete to themselves more and more coverage; I see a transformation of existing unions into new entities when they amalgamate with other existing unions to create a third and different organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in terms of the BWIU, I also recognise that the Australian Council of Trade Unions in its strategic amalgamation plans identifies the BWIU as the principal union in the building industry and identifies other unions, including the registered State branches of the Builders Labourers Federation, as significant unions in the building industry. Under their scheme for amalgamation, it is possible that they all may emerge as one union or emerge as a principal and a group of significant unions.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of being more principled and ethical, frankly that is just a try on, and I am not going to be bated by Senator Chapman over that. In terms of the question of the BLF in Western Australia-I have a high regard for the BLF in Western Australia and its leader, Kevin Reynolds, but as a Government we have proceeded on a principled course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This term of the Hawke Labor Government is significant as it is the term of micro-economic reform as we attend to making the economy more efficient by reforming major industry sectors in it. Today I and my colleagues the Honourable Simon Crean, in absentia the Honourable John Dawkins, and my Senate colleague, Senator Nick Bolkus, presided as a ministerial task force at a meeting of all the major players in the building industry, being construction companies, builders, the Building Owners and Managers Association and the organisations representing specialist contractors as well as building unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that meeting, we announced a strategy for the reform of the building industry in Australia to make it more efficient, to lower the level of lost time, to ensure that it comes out of the current oversupply of office accommodation in central business districts as a more lean, more efficient and more productive industry. All of the major players at that conference today endorsed the Government's strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell Senator Devereux who those parties are: the Master Builders-Construction and Housing Association of Australia offered words of endorsement and support and will follow through the reform package with the Government; the Metal Trades Industry Association did the same; the National President of the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors did the same; the National Director of the Building Owners and Managers Association supported the package as well and committed its efforts to the realisation of these goals; and the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Association has supported and endorsed the Government's package, as has the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's package, in brief, enables significant reform on industrial relations, contractual, industry and training fronts and uses, as a way of stimulating change, the promotion of model building sites to trial new practices, to obtain more multi-skilling and to test ways in which we can make this industry more efficient. We now have a mandate from the industry to proceed. It will be a significant reform when it is realised. There is much to be achieved and I am heartened, on behalf of the Government, by the support we have. I believe that we can succeed in making important changes in this industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already given the Senate my view about this allegation of a slush fund. Now that it has been trotted out a second time, Opposition senators may well be shocked but I have to tell them that my view has not changed in the last 30 seconds; it is the same view. The purpose of a fund being developed by the BWIU is to encourage and support union amalgamation. Senator Crane in his question quoted from the West Australian, which I understand in turn was quoting from a transcript provided of a meeting of a national council of the BWIU. It is not surprising that people, in the privacy of their own organisations-privacy, by and large, of meetings of national organisations ought to be respected-express themselves about external parties in colourful language; that is not at all surprising. I would not mind having a bug in the Liberal Party room to hear how those opposite talk about unions and then trotting it out in a transcript and saying, `Isn't this shocking?'.</PARA></TALK.START>

A cross-action has been filed to obtain national registration for the Builders Labourers Federation in Western Australia. A lively legal battle is being fought out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce aware of industry views that the dividend imputation scheme is having an adverse effect on the 150 per cent research and development taxation concession, negating its effectiveness? Will increased demands for fully franked dividends further weaken the incentive value of the concession?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="6000" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue has been about for some time; indeed, since the tax concession and the imputation system were introduced. Some months ago the Industry Research and Development Board, in response to these sorts of allegations, commissioned Ernst &amp;Young to investigate the claims by some industry representatives that dividend imputation may have an adverse effect on the tax concession. The report of Ernst &amp;Young is now available. I am pleased to say that it concluded that the introduction of dividend imputation has not had a significant impact on the effectiveness of the concession. Over 93 per cent of companies registered for the concession reported that its value to the company was unaffected by dividend imputation. Over 90 per cent reported that the value to shareholders was unaffected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report supports the view that theoretically dividend imputation can have an impact on the value of the concession, but only in circumstances where the proportion of profits paid out of dividends is very high. Notwithstanding these theoretical effects of dividend imputation, the report found that research and development spending was rarely linked to profit levels. Fewer than one in 10 respondents set their research and development budgets as a proportion of profit, though one in five respondents fund research and development out of retained profit. The ability to pay cash dividends and the ability to pay fully franked dividends were the least important factors in setting research and development budgets. The most important factor influencing the size of the research and development budget is the availability of the research and development tax concession and the expected after tax return.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that institutional investors and stockbrokers-who have had something to say about this issue-who were interviewed concluded that the vast majority of investors had not perceived the introduction of dividend imputation as having an effect on the value of the concession. Therefore, I do not believe that dividend imputation will have a significant impact on investment in research and development. Imputation has more than offset the 15 per cent earnings tax imposed on superannuation funds, contrary to the expectations of critics.</PARA>

<PARA> I do not know whether this question was provoked by reports in today's newspapers about the further reduction of one per cent in interest rates. There was some speculation in the papers as to whether, following two banks having announced their intention of passing on the reduction straight away, other banks would do the same: because they have incurred big losses as a result of-how shall I put it-imprudent lending to so-called entrepreneurs, those banks might try to recompense themselves for that imprudent lending by not passing on the interest rate cut immediately. On that issue I would say that what is good for those banks which immediately passed on the interest rate cut ought to be good enough for the others. I hope that would be the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that at the end of last month, on 28 November, the Presidents of Brazil and Argentina announced that the two countries had agreed to cooperate more closely on nuclear issues through, among other things, the establishment of a system of mutual inspections and the negotiation of a nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and also to consider bringing the Treaty of Tlatelolco into full effect as far as they are concerned. Brazil has also announced recently that it will not allow peaceful nuclear explosions, so called, to be carried out on Brazilian soil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a very strong supporter over many years of efforts to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime and the IAEA's safeguards system, Australia naturally very warmly welcomes these announcements by the two presidents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. It relates to reports in yesterday's Australian regarding the failure of the Government's waterfront reform program. Firstly, is the Minister aware that the memorandum of agreement in relation to the Cairns port which has been negotiated between the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour (AEWL) and three waterfront unions provides inter alia for in the order of 16 waterfront workers to do a job which users indicate requires only five workers? Is he aware that agreement has not been approved or even discussed with the users of the Cairns port, the stevedoring company or the Cairns Port Authority? Secondly, is the Minister aware that if the agreement is approved by the Water Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) the cost of stevedoring ships in Cairns will almost treble on today's charge-out rates? Thirdly, is the Minister further aware that in that event the two major users of the Cairns port, namely Freeport Indonesia and Incitech, would not economically be able to continue to use the Cairns port? Fourthly, is the Minister aware that one of those two major users has spent, this calender year, in the order of $34m in the Cairns community, generating in excess of 300 jobs which will be lost to the Cairns area if the current proposal is forced upon the Cairns port? Finally, will the Minister ensure that the agreement described earlier in this question is referred to the port users, the port stevedores and the Port Authority for approval before being implemented? It is a long question. I seek a serious answer, and on that basis I have given Senator Collins a copy of this question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume that, with the usual tolerance exhibited by the Opposition, I have 30 seconds to answer. I did, in fact, give an answer substantially to this question a few days ago when it was asked. The last three, four or five parts of Senator Macdonald's question referred to the current utilisation of the port by the existing stevedores and companies. I agree completely with Senator Macdonald's assessment of the contribution to the port made by those users, which makes, I must say with regret, the current attitude of Northern Shipping and Stevedoring Pty Ltd very difficult for me personally to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier in the Senate, the company, for whatever reason-and this is its own business-has taken an attitude towards resolving the situation in Cairns quite different from the attitude expressed not just to me personally but to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority in earlier negotiations. In respect of Cairns, the Commonwealth has indicated that it is anxious, by using the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority package, to remove from the port-as urgently as possible; immediately if an agreement can be reached-that excess labour which qualifies for the WIRA package, that is, some 10 to 13 workers who can be taken out of the port immediately, pending an evaluation of the real labour requirements of the port, not simply the assessment of the users as to that, according to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought-and I personally put this to a principal of the company last week-that consistent with its previous attitude the company would have been minded, in its own interests as well as those of the port of Cairns, to assist the Commonwealth to put cheques into the hands of those who are willing to leave, in terms of redundancy packages, and get them out of the port.</PARA>
<PARA> For whatever reason, the company has chosen not only to reject that-as I have said, I find it incomprehensible that it has taken this position-but also to communicate this rejection in a piece of correspondence that I saw yesterday couched in the most inflammatory and provocative language possible. I understand there has been a further piece of communication today from the company to AEWL-and I am not at liberty to discuss it in detail because it is not correspondence to me-which has proposed an even more extreme solution for the port.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to say, in concluding this answer, that I am anxious to get an agreement for the port of Cairns-and I thought we almost had one-that will allow us, through the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, to get a very large number of redundant workers out of the port immediately pending an evaluation of the real labour requirements of the port and the negotiation of an enterprise agreement for that port.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not blaming NSS. Unfortunately, this is symptomatic of the kind of attitude that Opposition senators take to the whole question of industrial relations and which causes a great deal of these problems. A few days ago Senator Macdonald issued a very mischievous press release headlined, `Minister blames employers in dispute'. I decided to assist the process by simply ignoring the statement, which I did. It is not a question of blaming NSS. It is simply putting the facts on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, which has been criticised trenchantly by Senator Macdonald and others, in fact prepared a resolution to the problems at the port of Cairns based, not surprisingly, on the results of prolonged negotiations with all of the parties. It did not give everyone what they wanted, but it was largely in accordance with positions that were indicated-not just to WIRA but to me personally-would be accepted by the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> Suddenly, a matter of weeks ago the company, for whatever reason, changed the personnel who had brought that position about-they are no longer working for the company-and took a radical shift in attitude. All I am saying, as a matter of fact, is that that sudden shift has complicated what I thought was very close to a resolution. I simply say again that I urge all of the parties to assist us to remove a substantial portion of the idle time from the port of Cairns by allowing WIRA immediately, on an interim basis, to remove from the port people who are willing to go, pending the negotiation of an enterprise agreement for the port.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell gave me notice of this question in big print copy so that I could read it. I would like to comment on a number of allegations in the question. Firstly, it is true that there has been a restructuring-as we call it euphemistically-of the canned ham industry in Australia and some five companies have withdrawn from the market over a period. One company-Castle Bacon Pty Ltd-remains and is located in Victoria. I will come to the allegation of dumping and subsidisation contained in the question in a minute. Senator Boswell also raised the point that there is a high level of subsidisation of these companies in the European Community and significant export subsidies are provided under the common agricultural policy for companies involved in this industry in Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last part of the question on which I will comment was: will I act to prevent the threatened jobs of 200 members of the meat workers union in my State? I take it that Senator Boswell means the people at Castle Bacon. It is not in my hands-it might be in their own hands-to protect the jobs of hundreds of thousands of meat workers in the State of Victoria, but that is the subject of a special inquiry into the meat industry in that State.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of imported canned ham has been examined by the Australian Customs Service and is now being dealt with by the Anti-Dumping Authority. That Authority has to report and make a recommendation to the Minister by 9 January 1991-that is, next month.</PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be some confusion in Senator Boswell's question on the issues of dumping and subsidisation, and I ought to comment on that. Dumping occurs when a product is exported at a price which is below the normal price obtained in the domestic market of the country of export. If these exports cause or threaten injury to the Australian industry producing such a product, the Government will act quickly to stop the injury being caused by dumping. That is consistent with our rights and obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, under GATT certain types of subsidies are frowned on, and if these subsidies harm an Australian industry appropriate countervailing action is taken. So if either dumping or subsidisation are found-and these matters are before the Authority at the moment-the Government can move quickly to ensure that fair trade is restored.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell will be aware of the broader context of this relating to the European Economic Community's farm subsidisation and the current failure-if that is not too strong a word-of the Uruguay Round, largely because of the reluctance or refusal of the European Community to make significant changes to its common agricultural policy. That is the general umbrella under which these things are considered. If there is a subsidy in this case, it can be dealt with once the inquiry is completed.</PARA>

It is disappointing that this would happen at any time, but that it would happen right at the time of the triennial general assembly of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in Perth is particularly disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government does not support mining in national parks and never has. It is contrary to our national platform, and our position in that will be maintained. But obviously the responsibility for national parks exists at a State level. State legislation creates them, and the States are responsible for their management.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Commonwealth legislation does not preclude exploration or mining in national parks, the plans for parks and reserves declared under State legislation are just not something we can affect. Where World Heritage areas are concerned, of course, that changes, and the Commonwealth will live up to its responsibilities, as it has repeatedly shown. Unfortunately, there is no power for us to prevent that mining. If it were to take place, obviously the Government will consider the export permits as they come in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do recall going to a briefing with several other Ministers on this subject some weeks ago at which the Transfield company acquainted us with its plans in regard to this project. Briefly, it is a revolutionary communications system that relies on satellites orbiting at 300 to 500 kilometres rather than geostationary orbits. The plan is to put up 77 such satellites, which will enable people to ring any part of the world via those satellites without necessarily having to go through the current complications. It is a revolutionary scheme. About 60 worldwide companies have applied to be part of the consortium. I understand that an Australian company has been short-listed down to the last 10, and it is only one of two overseas companies, apart from American ones, that have been so listed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has yet to be approached by Transfield for specific discussions on the subject but, quite clearly, Woomera is ideal for this purpose. For some time the Department of Defence has wanted to commercialise a lot of activities out of Woomera, and therefore it would welcome this project. The issue is not without complications and one really has to wait until early in the New Year when the Motorola Corporation gets down to the last three firms left.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian bid is very competitive and Woomera is ideally suited for the project. In fact, it is probably the only spot in the Southern Hemisphere suited for this particular purpose. In conclusion, people may ask why the space port in Queensland is not considered. This project is to send up a different type of satellite. Queensland is not suitable for that type of satellite whereas it is suitable for others. In general, the Government has indicated that it encourages this particular project, without at this stage making any commitments towards it-other than that Woomera is available.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to speak very briefly to the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) report for 1989-90. The exporting situation in Australia is more desperate now than it has ever been. It is more necessary now than it has ever been that we should do whatever is possible to encourage more people into the exporting field. We have to make inroads into this country's debt. The only way to do that is to export more and to export on a better value added basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the recent amendments that have gone through, I still believe it is absolutely essential that we should extend the scheme to cover more people, not fewer, and to include the newer and smaller manufacturers and producers of all types. The fact that the export market development grants were paid to 3,740 people in the last year is satisfactory, but I would like to see that increased by a further 1,000 if we are going to make real inroads into the debt. I notice that the requests for advice have increased from 40,000 in the previous year to 46,000 in the current year. This indicates how much reliance the market places on being able to get good, solid, accurate information. </PARA>
<PARA> The offices of Austrade are working well. I believe that around the world they have done the best they possibly can within the limits placed on them. But we have to keep abreast of what is happening in each of those areas with a view to changing them as it becomes necessary or desirable. The special categories which are listed again this year and are currently operating include education and training services, fresh fruit and vegetables, popular music, aerospace, railway industry, communications equipment, computer software, scientific and medical equipment, agricultural systems, health services, automotive industries, mining systems and processed food. That is all very well, but people who are not in those categories have come to me and said that they cannot get the assistance they would like to have from Austrade because they do not happen to fit into the winner picking list that is currently before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would urge the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to consider the economic circumstances of the country and what we ought to be doing to extend our exports in all sorts of additional ways. The Government has to come to grips with and ensure that more rather than less money is made available. Australia has to compete with countries that adopt a much more red-blooded approach to trading than we do, and our export market is not going to happen unless we make it happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to give fresh consideration to meeting the increasing pressures of the strains on our financial resources and the increasing pressures, on the international market, of dealing with people who are probably better equipped and better motivated than we appear to be to go into the hurly-burly of international trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the annual report of the Australian Trade Commission. The overall export performance of Australia is summarised on page 21 of that report. Despite all the gloom and doom in the community, the talk of recession and, in some quarters, the talking down of the economy, the report makes refreshing reading because it records very real growth in Australia's exports. For example, in the financial year 1988-89 real growth in exports was one per cent. By comparison, last financial year, 1989-90, Australia recorded a real growth in exports of 6.1 per cent-quite a respectable figure in world terms and certainly a large boost to this nation's trading activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further data in the report enables us to look at the composition of exports. I refer specifically to the export of manufactured products with a value-added component. While the overall growth in export volume was 6.1 per cent, the growth in manufactured exports was 16 per cent-more than double the overall average growth. That is certainly a very respectable figure indeed. With regard to the more elaborately transformed manufactured products-those with the highest-value added component-there were high rates of export growth. For example, in that field there was a 15.8 per cent growth in total export volume last year compared with a growth of 6 to 7 per cent in the year before. Despite the talk of recession, the gloom and doom in the Australian community and the talking down of the economy in some quarters, respectable growth is still occurring in our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Two areas that have been targeted by Austrade have shown enormous growth in exports and foreign exchange earnings for this country. I refer firstly to energy systems-that sector of the economy producing and selling power generation equipment. The growth in exports in that field was over 100 per cent-in fact 102.9 per cent-in the last year of record. I also instance the high tech field of telecommunications and telecommunications equipment. While the overall export growth in telecommunications last year was 6.1 per cent, our exports grew by 85 per cent-many, many times the overall rate of growth in exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The elaborately transformed manufactured products are being targeted on the South East Asian countries particularly, where last year there was a massive growth of 78 per cent in the export of those value-added manufactured products to Indonesia and a 40 per cent growth in exports to Malaysia; and Australian firms in this value-added field of manufacturing are starting to break into the European market. For example, according to the Austrade report there was a 36.8 per cent growth in these exports to the United Kingdom-perhaps reversing historic trade flows over two centuries. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 50 of the report documents some major successes for Australian producers in the communications sector. Major contracts have been won as follows: Telecom Australia has won an $86m contract to manage telecommunications in Saudi Arabia. There is vital public sector activity in government ownership. Also, in conjunction with Olex, Telecom has won a $35m contract to supply optical fibre cables in the Pakistan market. Some great success has been recorded by manufacturing enterprises in the Australian community, thereby strongly contributing to export growth. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also surprised at the reference on page 50 to our successes in marketing computer software overseas. Exports of Australian designed computer software have burgeoned in recent years. I was surprised to learn that our exports of this key service now comprise over $300m a year-a figure I would not have imagined. This represents 18 per cent growth over the previous financial year. Australia certainly is at the leading edge in the world in terms of designing software to make computer processes work. We are doing very well indeed in designing and exporting software to the overseas market. Despite the downturn in the economy, in the last 12 months we have seen an 8 per cent growth in exports in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the Australian Trade Commission annual report. Having listened to Senator Maguire, I cannot help but feel that he was giving us a Pollyanna report-that we were having a little bit of a boom time-as distinct from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) during Question Time saying that we were having a little bit of a recession. The fact is that our exports are still way behind our imports. All the attempts by this Government, with the policies it has espoused and stuck by and said were fantastic, have resulted in this country going further into debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report by Austrade simply shows that in those areas where there has been growth it simply has not been enough. The salient point made in various parts of the report is that in many sectors our share of world trade is below that which we had in the 1970s. So there is a very serious problem to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer particularly to the timing of this report's release. It comes very speedily after the report that we had on the thirteenth of this month announcing that the Managing Director of Austrade, Mr Lindsay MacAlister, had in fact resigned. This resignation seems to have coincided with the delivery to the Austrade board of the interim report by McKinsey and Co. dealing with new directions that Austrade is to take. A press report says that the McKinsey review is expected to make some far-reaching recommendations about how Austrade can improve its role in helping Australian companies get into export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> We already have a precedent in the area of trade and trade policy, again directly related to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce-the notorious Pappas Carter Evans and Koop report, a sort of apology for strategic trade theory, which came down in two parts. We had the interim report and then the final report. In light of the fact that our export record is still so poor and the fact that we are still going further into debt, this interim report, which has been delivered to the board of Austrade and has presumably had something to do with the resignation of the Managing Director, ought to be made available to the Parliament. I formally ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to seek to have that interim report tabled in the Parliament so that we can see the sorts of recommendation that McKinsey is making in this far-reaching report. Perhaps we can then have an insight earlier in the piece as to the sorts of actions that need to be taken to improve our export performance rather than wait for the final report, which I understand is not due until the first quarter to first half of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an important issue. The report contains some useful information. Indeed, many officers concerned with Austrade are people with considerable dedication. The bottom line is that we are not doing well enough. Until we turn around our performance from the old `near enough is good enough' syndrome, we will not see our international plight begin to turn around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not detain the Senate long and I shall not repeat the isolated success stories Senator Maguire has quoted from the annual report of the Australian Trade Commission. We must say that, overall, our position is not good enough. Clearly, our overseas balance of payments continues to decline. Unless we want to accept a continuing monetary policy which squeezes Australian families within an inch of their lives, we will have to gear up our export efforts. In this context there are a number of areas where the Australian Democrats would like the Government to take action to address many opportunities which have been missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the debate on the export market development grants scheme has shown, we regret very much that the Government has seen fit to exclude a number of small companies from participating in the scheme. On the figures available, the scheme will cut out some 150 small businesses from export related activities. Similarly, we are disappointed that so far the Government has not seen fit to pick up the suggestion that large-scale projects should be given the benefit of accelerated depreciation to the extent that they are contributing to export income. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we need to realise that simply promoting exports is not the total answer. We must support our scientific community. In this area our expenditure on research and development is lamentably low. The Australian Democrats have recommended, and will continue to press for, an increase of $100m per annum in the budget of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). There is a second stage: once organisations such as CSIRO have provided unique inventions which show value and are accepted as valuable by overseas countries, Australia rather than those overseas countries should pick up the development of those inventions and turn them into marketable products. That represents a gap in our overall effort in science and research and development. The Australian Democrats will be pressing the Government to fill that gap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall talk briefly about a number of points in the annual report of the Australian Trade Commission. I refer par- ticularly to the importance of having economic policies, especially monetary policies, in place that allow our dollar to reflect its true value much more closely. I have noticed some reports in the press in recent times about talking the dollar down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we look at this report and go through the various issues, we find that some areas are quite encouraging while others are not so encouraging. With the collapse of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks recently, in terms of lifting our export performance it is absolutely imperative that, if we are to get our current account under control, we at least be in a competitive position with overseas operators. In recent times we have not been competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to page 46 of the report, referring to Australian fresh fruit and vegetable exports, which are quite disastrous. That industry has been hit very hard relative to the value of our dollar. At this time when we see the growth that exists in Asia, it is very important that we maximise the opportunities that exist in our horticultural industries. Unless we have in place an overall economic management plan that allows us to compete with the other producers of these products around the world, we will find it very difficult to overcome some of that trade imbalance and the lack of competitiveness that has existed for our producers of raw materials. This is particularly reflected in areas such as wheat, wool and meat. In terms of those industries and this report, one also has to emphasise the importance of getting on top of the current problems in the meat industry, where we have lost significant export opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate to note that the factory is moving towards closure at the end of this year. In accordance with section 41d of the Audit Act, the Department of Defence has submitted the 1989-90 financial statements for this factory. I think we should note that, although several lines of production of activity progressively were wound down, a low level of development activity continued in relation to sub- marines. The factory made a profit of $2.689m largely because of an increased appropriation of $8.5m to $18.525m. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to a comment that it was not feasible to perform a stocktake of work in progress as at balance date. As an accountant and a former factory manager I believe that this is complete nonsense and is completely unacceptable. Naturally, inventories are the sum total of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. How can a proper statement of profit and loss be prepared without determining the accuracy of the various components of the work in progress? I think it is worth noting the comments of the Acting Executive Director of the Australian National Audit Office when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Work in progress was not subject to stocktake or other suitable verification procedures. Consequently I have been unable to determine whether the closing balance of this item accurately reflects the true balance. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how the financial statements could really have met the requirements under section 41d, because it is to this extent that the statements are inadequate and, therefore, should not be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the accounts, there are a number of problems which are not really satisfactory. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the accrual basis was applied in preparing the Financial Statements</PARA>

<PARA>The factory does not comply with the general disclosure requirements of Department of Finance on disposal of assets (other than trading stock) in that profits/losses are not reflected in the statements as the proceeds from sales are paid directly into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>

In view of the fact that it is being wound down, I will not take further issue, but I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that as a member of the Public Accounts Committee I find it a most unsatisfactory document. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak to this document because it raises a very important issue. It reports the operation of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 and the regulations under the Act which were enacted in March last year to give effect to both the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and to reduce the emissions of ozone depleting substances, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, in conformity with those conventions, and if possible to go beyond those requirements. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on several occasions has said that this Government has, indeed, through regulations under this Act, gone further. The concern about these substances extends well beyond the question of ozone depletion. This is the issue to which I direct the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these substances, and indeed the substitutes to which we are now looking, have considerable greenhouse potential-particularly HFC-134a as a drop in substitute for CFC-12. HFC-134a has approximately 10 per cent of the greenhouse potential of CFC-12. This means that everything else remaining the same and if current practices continue-namely, the release of these substances into the atmosphere when refrigerators are serviced-it is very easy to imagine at least a tenfold increase in the consumption of these materials around the world, and we would be right back where we are now with respect to the greenhouse effect of these substances. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is a very important one. Dr Manzer is one of the authors of a paper on CFC and ozone issues and is with the Central Research and Development Department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company Experimental Station. I do not have figures for Australia, but regarding the United States of America Dr Manzer states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . $135 billion worth of equipment . . . that depends on CFCs has an expected lifetime of 20 to 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA>So the decisions we make now regarding the substitute substances, particularly in refrigeration, have very long term consequences. Indeed, Dr Manzer concludes his paper by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Policymakers need to provide clear and prompt signals to industry and the consumer. If HCFCs and HFCs are deemed acceptable alternatives, a strong statement to that effect will speed their development and the transition from CFCs. If they are deemed unacceptable, industry may focus its resources elsewhere, which will likely mean continued use of CFCs until other viable technologies are identified. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I wish to stress is that we do have a perfectly viable and adequate alternative. Prior to 1928, when CFCs were developed by the General Motors company, we had a flourishing refrigeration industry worldwide that was substantially based on the use of ammonia. Ammonia is certainly a more toxic gas than either CFCs or hydrofluorocarbons, but in terms of its environmental damage it is not in any way comparable with either CFCs or HFCs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we need to make a decision very rapidly, as a country and as the world, as to whether we are going to substitute the CFCs with these HFCs-particularly 134a which, as I have pointed out, has 10 per cent of the greenhouse potential of CFC-12, the substance it seeks to substitute-and lock ourselves into a massive expenditure on a technology which has a lifetime of 30 or 40 years or whether we make the decision now to go back to that proven technology, namely, the use of ammonia, which has none of those consequences but would impose on those handling the material, as it does with electricians, the requirement to handle it with a degree of safety which is not necessary with CFCs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to speak to the annual report 1989-90 on the operation of the Ozone Protection Act 1989. I want to raise the fact that in October this year the Government adopted the so-called Toronto goal of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases by 20 per cent by the year 2005. However, on 13 December 1990 the Australian stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet, four months before this decision, a report became available that not only showed the Toronto goal to be an arbitrary and counter-productive political dictate but dismantled the scientific assumptions upon which it was shakily built. After two years' work, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, formed jointly by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organisation, concluded its scientific assessment, the most exhaustive yet made. The panel predicted the seas might rise 20cm by 2030-close enough to the Toronto prediction-but a rise of 150cm-</PARA>
<PARA>which is what was said could happen-</PARA>
<PARA>might not arrive until 2250 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is 150 years after the worst case scenario predicted by Toronto. The article continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this November the Second World Climate Conference did not adopt the 20 per cent Toronto goal. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr O'Brien, who has personally been criticised by Senator Coulter, quite improperly I believe, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The worst fears about the worst effects of climate change voiced in 1988 are now known to be postponed by a century or more. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall, this clearly shows Cabinet's decision of October 1990 to reduce emission of greenhouse gases by 20 per cent a year by the year 2006. It is a classic case study of emotional responses to ill-informed activist pressure. That does not mean that we should not be taking action to diminish the impact of ozone depleting gases. What it does mean, though, to follow what Dr O'Brien suggests-I think an editorial in the Australian of 13 December outlined this very clearly-is that Australia should pit its natural resources against the greenhouse effect. The editorial concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Toronto ethos remains obsessed with the misleading measure of per capita output of greenhouse gases, Australia could serve both its own economy and the world environment by using energy efficiently and processing minerals here. Our per capita output of greenhouse gases would rise, but sending fewer bulk transports overseas could bring a greater decline in the world output of gases.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Australia has a world role to play and should be playing it. It should not be succumbing to the ill-informed and now scientifically demonstrated nonsense that tends to come from well meaning but emotionally involved activists, supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA> That the report be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the tenth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under privilege resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 17 December 1990, the President, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, referred a letter from the Hon. Tom Uren relating to remarks made by Senator Robert Ray during Question Time on 12 December 1990 to the Committee of Privileges as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The Committee has considered the submission and recommends that a response agreed to by Mr Uren and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE BY THE HONOURABLE TOM UREN</PARA>
<PARA>AGREED TO BY MR UREN</PARA>
<PARA>AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</PARA>
<PARA>PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7) (B) OF THE SENATE OF</PARA>
<PARA>25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>I ask pursuant to Privilege Resolution 5(1) (b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988 that the Senate allow me to respond to comments made in the Senate by Senator Ray on 12 December 1990 (Hansard, pp 5507-8). Might I draw your attention to the wide publicity in press, radio and television of Senator Ray's comments. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray said, ``It is a long-standing principle that Australians travelling overseas, particularly those who have held high office, do not disparage their own country or necessarily their own Government while they are overseas. ``Let me make it quite clear. I do not disparage our country-to the contrary; my stand in war and peace is for the love of our country and its people. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray chides me about what I should have said to the Iraqis. I was on a mission to seek the release of the Australian hostages-so that they could return to Australia to their loved ones. My record of fighting for democratic and human rights is on the record in the Australian Parliament-the streets and gaols of Queensland and in the records of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I wish to deal with the statement that hurt most and deeply: ``Maybe some of that leadership of the Left will look back to the era when Mr Uren regularly briefed former Prime Minister Fraser on internal divisions within the Labor Party.'' This is not correct. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Fraser incident I wrote the following in a letter to a friend, which I commenced on the night of 29 June 1982:</PARA>
<PARA>Then, out of the blue I received a telephone call from our dear old Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. . . It was Monday night 28 June, Malcolm said, ``Tom you don't have to talk to me.'' . . . I said, ``What is it Malcolm?''. He replied, ``Have you still got the numbers for Bill?''. I replied, ``Yes''. ``Are you still supporting him?'' I said ``Yes, but with certain conditions attached to it, but Malcolm that is as far as I am prepared to discuss it.''. He said ``OK Tom''. </PARA>
<PARA>For the record apart from that telephone call from Malcolm Fraser-the only other time he has phoned me was on two occasions relating to my going as an Australian representative to Lord Louis Mountbatten's funeral in 1979. I understand from press reports that Mr Fraser was contacted in Tokyo and that he has denied the statements made by Senator Ray relating to me. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion-I have served the Australian Labor Party and Labor Movement for over 30 years. I would never be a traitor to the ideals of our party and our movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was discussing the zone rebate, which is one amendment the Bill is seeking to introduce. The tax system certainly recognises the additional costs of living in extremely isolated areas by granting a zone rebate. This rebate was reviewed and the review recommended aligning the amount of rebate available for residents of the two most isolated of the four zones. It also recommended reclassifying the zones into which various island groups and remote towns fall. No-one will be worse off by these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the recommendations and these amendments reflect those recommendations. The measures are supported by the Australian Democrats, but they are only token measures and in no way address any of the fundamental problems faced by our rural population. </PARA>
<PARA> The naive free trade policies which encourage foreign governments to subsidise dumping in Australia are really hurting those in our rural industries, especially our citrus fruit and vegetable growers. The States have recently called for a massive increase in funding to the rural adjustment scheme, yet the Government has not yet responded to this need and we express some regret at that. </PARA>
<PARA> A further minor matter addressed in the Bill concerns the tax treatment of contaminated livestock disposals. A drafting deficiency is remedied by altering the word `destroyed' to `disposed'. This will extend the favourable treatment to situations other than where the beasts are destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of gifts, two organisations which qualify for tax deductible status have changed their names. These amendments merely reflect those changes. One of the name changes apparently occurred on 23 June 1970. The amendment is retrospective by more than 20 years yet, in these circumstances, we do not oppose the measure. As usual, we examine each amendment on its merits. In this case the amendment fixes up a technicality and we have no problem with it. </PARA>
<PARA> One additional matter that I need to advert to is the amendment that the Government will move to remedy the defects in the substantiation provisions of the taxation Act. This matter had its beginnings with a private member's Bill moved by Senator Watson, which the Australian Democrats supported in principle but felt was somewhat deficient in its detailed provisions. I subsequently circulated and provided the Minister with a copy of an amendment which sought to address some of the details that we found to be wanting in Senator Watson's private member's Bill. The Government asked me to defer my amendment until its amendment was available and I bow to the more extensive draftsmanship resources that are available to the Government. I believe that the amendment the Minister has circulated manages to overcome most of the difficulties in that particular area. The Democrats will be pleased to support it and we will monitor its effects during the coming 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Government on its quick response, which I welcome, to my private members' substantiation Bill. The amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) now before the Senate accept the thrust of that Bill, but they go about implementing it in a slightly different way. The Senate might recall that the earlier Bill provided a legislative discretion in examining the substantiation issues under the Income Tax Assessment Act. It was envisaged that such a discretion would have to be backed up by income tax rulings to explain how and in what circumstances the discretion would be administered. That action would be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). I think it was the AAT's lack of ability to review which was of concern to so many in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has chosen to put what amounts to be a discretion together with circumstances in appropriate legislative form. Senator McMullan had indicated in earlier responses that this was his preferred approach and I congratulate him for acting so quickly and for the manner in which he has introduced this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Bill is not quite as simple as we all would have wished. It does tend to run a little bit counter to the principles of simplification which were enunciated so clearly last week. Unfortunately, paragraph 4 tends to favour late lodgers, including even those who incur a late penalty, over taxpayers who have done the right thing and lodged early. That is only a small thing but, given the nature of the amendment, it could perhaps have had an operative date of 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Government's response. Last week's statement on tax simplification was a first step in the right direction of restructuring a taxation Act that would enhance taxpayers' rights. This amendment currently before the Senate is a second and very welcome step. </PARA>
<PARA> Not surprisingly, an opposition is seldom 100 per cent happy with the way a government goes about accepting its proposals. But the thrust is 100 per cent right, the legislation appears to be 100 per cent right, apart from the problem of clause 4, but perhaps not 100 per cent can be given for simplification and presentation. I have raised a number of matters-I intend to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard those documents to which I referred during the committee stage of the debate-and I hope that those issues will be addressed later. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the many people who have supported this change to lessen the previously unrealistic rigours of the substantiation requirements of section 82kt. In particular, I thank Mr Peter Roach, a former senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; the Australian Taxpayers Association, which is always a vigorous defender of fair taxation and taxpayers' rights; Senator McMullan, for what he has done in instituting these changes; and the former President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, Mr Richard Buchanan. I also give a creditable mention to Mr Boucher, to whom I suppose I should offer some form of apology for pushing this issue perhaps excessively vigorously. But, from the point of view of the Parliament, I believe that this issue did have to be pursued in order to resolve what appeared to many people to be an unsatisfactory position. </PARA>
<PARA> An important issue has arisen from a wide evaluation of the substantiation debate, both within and outside the Parliament. Apart from the Government's acknowledgment of rectifying the problem, I would also like to see the Parliament, especially this Senate, establish a line of communication with the appeals system so that the Senate can automatically pick up what members of tax tribunals and judges within the court system perceive to be deficiencies in the laws passed by this Parliament. I hope that both the Government and the Opposition parties in the Senate-and I extend this challenge to the clerks and officers of the Senate-try to establish a mechanism which focuses on the comments that come from the court system to ensure that this Senate can pick up such issues of concern and so enhance the integrity of our tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps a coincidence that, despite all the complaints, including those from State Labor Party personnel, about the impact of the new company tax collection due on 17 December, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) actually amends the collection provisions relating to companies in the Income Tax Assessment Act to clarify that an initial payment of tax, due 28 days after the year of income, is due and payable on the relevant day. Given that the deadline for corporations which have tax commitments under $400,000 seems to be quite intolerable for many, in light of recent events, I ask the Government to look at this 28 day rule which will apply to companies balancing on 30 June and consider whether there could be a modification and perhaps even sliding scale quarterly instalments, which might overcome some of the other problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The major thrust of this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is to give concessions to the banking industry, which is experiencing difficulties arising from the complex thin capitalisation legislation that was introduced in 1987. The changes that have been necessary once again add to my oft repeated argument in this chamber that there is a need to simplify taxation laws. This Government has tended to introduce more and more tax legislation which is so complex that subsequent amendments are required. I know it is difficult, and I think we have to give due acknowledgment to the Government for the problems it is facing in its attempt to wind back on anti-avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1987, the legislation introducing thin capitalisation was regarded by many as the most difficult to understand at that time. Since 1987, there has been an abundance of complex, uncertain and far-reaching tax law, all of which has taken tax law far beyond what a lot of people believe was necessary to achieve the stated or apparent purposes of the Government in tax avoiding measures. There is a desperate need to reduce the uncertainty that prevails within the business community. I acknowledge that this Bill is part of that arrangement to try to simplify the complexity of tax legislation in order to make it much more coherent. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes introduced in this Bill were first announced in March 1989 and many of them were made retrospective to June-July 1987. As it will confer a benefit, the Opposition will not raise an objection in accordance with its longstanding policy. However, the Opposition deplores the fact that once again the intention to legislate was the subject of an announcement by press release, issued as long ago as 30 March 1989. Approximately 19 months have elapsed between the announcement of the intention and the presentation of this Bill to the Parliament. In addition, to my surprise, some provisions of the Bill are in conflict with the information provided in the press release. This is regrettable, although it is not the first time it has occurred. This is apparently after several meetings between the banking industry and the Australian Taxation Office. If we are to be governed by press release, there should at least be consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of discrepancies when compared with the press release. I refer particularly to the amendments proposed in relation to onshore holding companies, that is, the provisions to be implemented by proposed new section 159gzla. Proposed new section 159gzla (i) (c) specifies a number of conditions which must be satisfied at all times during the year of income. In particular, subparagraph (ii) requires that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no amount owing by the resident holding company. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those words because this appears to constitute a significant change from press release No. 24 of 30 March 1989, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will be a precondition to application of the amended provision that the holding company does not itself have-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the difference-</PARA>
<PARA>any interest bearing debt to the foreign parent bank or foreign associates. </PARA>
<PARA>The emphasis is on `interest bearing debt' rather than the amount owing by a resident holding company. I understand that one of the basic principles of thin capitalisation legislation is that it applies only to interest bearing debt. I have been informed that negotiations are under way to try to solve this problem and I hope there will be a solution in the near future. I certainly look forward to it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, bouquets should also be given where they are deserved. I commend the Government for consulting with the industry and being prepared to advance amending legislation to change the structure and the operational difficulties which have arisen from the thin capitalisation legislation. The legislation proposed and now under discussion will affect the banking industry. Broadly, the thin capitalisation changes deny a deduction for interest paid by certain taxpayers on debt-related offshore entities to the extent that the ratio of foreign debt to foreign equity exceeds 3:1; obviously, for financial institutions the ratio is 6:1. These rules were originally introduced to prevent foreign investors having a free rein to use Australian tax to advantage their local operations. I fully concur with the thrust of that ideal. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposed change is to exempt from the thin capitalisation rules certain balances in what are known as nostro and vostro accounts. These are essentially clearing accounts; that is, amounts owed to and by the organisation. These are offshore clearing accounts for international transactions such as foreign exchange settlements and payment or receipt of loan advances. It is normal for the account to be slightly in surplus and it is current practice that interest is not earned on a positive balance. Nostro accounts are usually in surplus for reasons such as uncertainty as to the date on which a draft issued in Australia will be presented at the foreign bank. Human error may cause a deposit in a nostro account to be late so that an overdraft advance by the offshore bank is needed to settle a debt to a third party. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian dollar accounts held by overseas banks with Australian banks are vostro accounts; from the point of view of the foreign bank they are nostro accounts. Under the legislation, foreign debt will exclude any amount owing by an Australian financial institution in respect of an offshore nostro account and the foreign equity calculations will exclude the amounts owing to the Australian financial institution in vostro accounts held in Australia while the accounts in the Australian institution in a nostro account are held offshore. Amounts to be excluded from the foreign equity calculation would otherwise be treated as an equity loan-back. Equity loan-backs reduce the value of foreign equity and increase the risk of a breach in the debt-equity ratio. Somewhat anomalously, credits in vostro accounts, being amounts owed by the Australian financial institution to the offshore institution, are not dealt with in this legislation, and I wonder why. Under current practice, interest is not paid on vostro balances in credit so they would not be included in the foreign debt. That is the subject of a matter which I have asked to be put on notice for the committee stage. Again, I have been informed that negotiations are under way and the Australian Bankers Association is looking forward to a reasonable solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the time constraints, I will omit some of the detail and mention that the March press release did not advise that the exclusion would be limited to foreign equity; rather, I would like to point out that a statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), dated 19 February 1990, on the draft legislation prescribes a 1 July 1987 commencement date. It would appear that this has not been incorporated in the transitional provisions of proposed new section 18 of the draft Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving to another provision, I must say that I do welcome the inclusion of King Island, Flinders Island and other islands in the Furneaux Group in the zone B rebate for income tax purposes. The income tax paying residents of King and Flinders islands will now be allowed an extra rebate of $45 plus another 20 per cent of total dependants allowances. Again, these are standard zone B rebates. It is good to see. I think it is time that the taxation advantages that have already been given to other isolated residents within Australia were extended to this group, because it is remote and the residents do suffer significant cost disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to point out to this chamber the significant cost disadvantages for our Australian citizens who live in the remote areas of Australia. My comments, naturally, are very pertinent to the Furneaux Group which is part of my constituency. A recent study conducted by the municipality of Flinders which examined the extra costs sustained by families on this island has estimated that it costs approximately an extra $1,200 per family just to cover marine board charges, air fares, electricity and other local government costs. It is quite a considerable extra burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The other provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) recognise the change from the exempt status of the goldmining industry from 1 January 1991, which necessitates a number of transitional arrangements such as those applicable to trading stock. Obviously, trading stock will have to be accounted for as at 31 December 1990 for the purpose of determining a taxable income. This can be done at either cost, market or replacement value. There are appropriate anti-avoidance measures to ensure that there is no manipulation of the inventory figures on the commencement date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides an alternative method of calculating residual goldmining expenditure and extends the application of the capital gains tax provisions. Again, it makes a welcome minor technical amendment to subsection 36aaa (4) in circumstances of contamination to allow an election for a year of income to be made when livestock is disposed of rather than destroyed. I commend the Bill and the necessary amendments that the Government has introduced to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to place on record the Australian Democrats support for the main changes contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. We agree that it is appropriate that custodial parents are informed about the progress being made to recover maintenance owing to them, and we note that the Privacy Commissioner has indeed approved of this change. Family Court of Australia councillors should certainly be able to report cases of suspected child abuse to State child welfare authorities. In fact, it is reasonable that they should be alert to the possibility of child abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is reasonable that a period for payment should be other than annual-this would be left up to the parties concerned-so long as the agreements are clearly set out and also, as the Bill allows, the total annual payment is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA> A major measure in the Bill involves the enforcement provisions. Now, the enforcement provisions for the Family Law Act are extended to any court making an order under the child support scheme legislation. In other words, parents can move freely from State to State confident that maintenance orders will be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> We must note however that the scheme was not set up primarily to benefit sole parents, but to transfer financial responsibility for the children of single parents from the taxpayer to the non-custodial parent. The Democrats certainly support this principle, but note that the Government has consistently failed to recognise the need for adequate direct financial assistance for sole parents. The existence of this scheme does not let the Government off the hook regarding its responsibilities to those parents and their children. There is no recognition in any Budget legislation of the poverty traps faced by single parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Janine Haines, when she first entered the Senate, saw the need for a change to maintenance collection and campaigned strongly for change. However, the support payment is tested differently from and more harshly than earnings. Sole supporting parents are allowed only $15 for one child and $5 for each additional child before their pension is reduced. If a sole parent is relying just on the pension and the support payment, he or she will be worse off than when maintenance was treated like any other income. </PARA>
<PARA> In-kind payments are also included. Obviously, those who drafted the legislation were aware of the problems and tried to limit the damage. The support payment does not reduce a pension or benefit by more than 25 per cent of the maximum rate for in-kind or imputed capital maintenance during the first six months after separation where in-kind maintenance is paid by the marital home or alternate housing and where money is paid for the special needs of a child, such as a handicap. I quote from the Institute of Family Studies assessment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when the recipient household is dependent on public support, child maintenance payments are immediately deducted from the supporting parent benefit. Thus, although the scheme doubtless improves the material circumstances of many children whose mothers are not on public support, it may not do so for those who are receiving the SPBN. In the latter case, the new scheme will have altered the public-private balance of responsibility without improving the child's circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Both parents remain responsible for the economic support of their children according to their capacity. For this reason, the level of maintenance paid under the formula relates to the income of the non-custodial parent and will not vary with the actual cost of caring for the child or children for whom it is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly refer to a chart published in Family Matters, the newsletter of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, in October 1987. It clearly sets out the costs of raising children and shows very clearly the differences between raising a two-year-old, a five-year-old, an eight-year-old, an 11-year-old and a teenager, the amount more than doubling between the age of two and the teenage years. </PARA>
<PARA> Normal maintenance is usually not varied with the circumstances of the custodial parent, although it will be reduced when a custodial parent earns more than average weekly earnings. Custodial mothers will continue to pay for at least half the direct costs of their children, probably much more if they have teenagers. At the same time they are likely to earn less and to have less favourable opportunities in the job market than non-custodial fathers. The mothers will bear the burden of the indirect costs of having children. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I stress that this Bill does nothing to alleviate the hardships being experienced by the many sole parents, mostly women, who are living in abject poverty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill because I have spoken so frequently in this chamber about the Child Support Agency since it was established. As Senator Alston said, the second reading speech does not really tell us a great deal about it. We support the amendments, one of which will enable the Child Support Agency to inform custodial parents of the progress of recovery of amounts due to them. I have had frequent complaints to my office and have referred before in this chamber to the inability of supporting parents to get any information concerning the progress of the Agency's efforts to recover maintenance entitlements. It has been very frustrating for those involved and it has contributed significantly to the fact that the Agency has been seen or thought to be not doing everything it possibly could to assist. I understand that the staff have been constrained until now, but I would be critical of the way the explanations and requests for information have been dealt with on occasions. Things could have been explained in a much better fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had women contact me and say that, when they have inquired as to how a recovery is progressing, they have been told, `It is none of your business any more, as the debt was owing to the Commonwealth'. While it is technically true that the debt was owing to the Commonwealth, it is an appalling suggestion to say to a supporting parent that the collection of the maintenance that he or she is owed is none of his or her business. So I welcome this development, which I believe will significantly reduce the frustration of clients of the Agency who simply seek information about what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government is in the process of reviewing the current legislation and making changes, I suggest that another issue needs urgent attention. It affects some of the Agency's clients. There is no doubt that the Agency has collected money and people are now paying maintenance who have not paid it previously and should have been. We supported the legislation when it came into the Parliament and we support the concept. However, I refer to the situation of parents who, prior to getting involved with the Agency, had a totally satisfactory arrangement with their former spouse in operation in relation to the payment of maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> Cases have come to my attention where totally regular payments of the proper amount of maintenance have been made, this in many instances having gone on for years. Once parents register with the Agency, the payments are totally disrupted, causing financial hardship to those involved. They are not entitled to any greater amount of maintenance by virtue of registering with the Agency. No social security savings are involved, yet the parents are put to the inconvenience of having to miss payments for up to eight weeks and frequently longer while the Agency gets the records onto its computer and functioning. Anyone who thinks that eight weeks without the money that is needed for the support of children is not significant does not know much about running a family. </PARA>
<PARA> To use one example, I was contacted by a woman whose husband had been divorced from her for many years. He had paid the maintenance to her bank account directly from his salary over those many years, and never once had there been the slightest problem. The woman had never had a late payment and never suffered a non-payment. She was working herself, was able to budget and knew exactly what her financial situation was. When her young son became ill, she was forced to resign from her employment and go onto the supporting parent's benefit. Because she did that, she was required to register with the Agency, and that is when she got into financial difficulties. As a consequence, she missed two months maintenance. There was no suggestion that her former husband had not continued to pay the money due, precisely as he had done for many years. But in no time the payments were two months in arrears and she was trying to cope with that. Then, of course, she was paid only once a month instead of every fortnight, even though her former husband continued to make his payments as he had always done. </PARA>
<PARA> During the two months that she was without this money she had to borrow. She ran up credit on her credit cards. She had to pay credit charges and other expenses, all of which put her into a difficult financial situation. She proposes to return to work when her son has recovered. Then, hopefully, she will be free to resume the former good relationship she had and have the money paid directly into her account. In the meantime, she has been caused substantial financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the supporting parent's benefit ought to be to assist parents in a situation like this where it is necessary that they give up work for a time to look after a sick child. This woman was required to register with the Agency even though she had proof positive that the father of the child had made payments without any difficulty for a number of years. In cases like that, any subsequent lapse of payment would have to be registered. No-one is denying that. But in a case where the record shows quite clearly that the payments have been made regularly over many years, there should be no need for anyone to have to get involved with the Agency and get into financial difficulties as a consequence of the enormous delays that occur and the length of time it takes to become registered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken before of the outrageous way the Agency behaves in taking enforcement action. It makes the decision that until maintenance is $1,500 in arrears, a case is not worth pursuing. Some honourable senators may not think being $1,500 short on housekeeping money is highly significant but I suggest that it is. Arrears of $500 or even $200 in maintenance are highly significant. Yet somebody makes an arbitrary decision that it does not matter. The scheme cannot be allowed to continue in this fashion, even though in other respects more money is being paid for the support of children. We must see that these anomalies are wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case where it is clear that maintenance has been paid properly over a number of years, it should not be necessary for a woman to get involved with the Agency and suffer trauma and expense as a consequence. It should be possible to allow her to go on to the supporting parent's benefit and let the proper arrangement continue. If that breaks down, I acknowledge that we would need to take the other steps that I have referred to. While something is being done to make the system work more efficiently, other arrangements still need to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Time does not allow me to mention a number of other matters concerning the Agency and the support and maintenance of children. I have raised two points today and I shall leave it at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the limited time in which we have to deal with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1990 and the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, I will not traverse everything that honourable senators have said. Although in many ways the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is an important Bill to many individuals and their tax arrangements, it has not aroused great controversy here today. Therefore, I will be brief in summing up the second reading debate. However, I want to put on the record some comments about the Child Support Agency which was referred to in the context of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I want to deal with Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). I think the description of the legislation has been traversed by Senator Watson and Senator Spindler. In particular, they dealt with thin capitalisation, which is the major element of the amendment. The Bill is designed to modify a scheme which limits interest deductions for Australian companies on borrowings from related foreign sources. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing the outcome of a lengthy consultative process which was foreshadowed in March 1989. It is important that we give the opportunity for that sort of consultation. People may be frustrated that they do not have certainty in terms of outcome during the period. But it is impossible to have a consultative process and an immediate outcome-the two things are contradictory. We could arbitrarily have proceeded to legislate without consultation-it would have been quicker-but we would have had very understandable cries of concern from people that the consultation had not been adequate and that we had moved too quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that people would like the best of both worlds but I regret to say that the realities of government are the realities of life: we cannot have both and we have to choose. We have tried to have the consultative process and deal with the drafting as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important transitional provisions in the legislation for the goldmining industry. An amendment was outlined by Senator Spindler and I will deal with that during the committee stage. It would be a waste of time to do so now. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some changes which relate to quarrying and zone rebates. In the first instance, those changes are substantially technical, and in the second, they are entirely beneficial to people. So, they are not matters of any controversy. The zone rate rebate changes are in response to a review by the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senators Spindler and Watson for their comments about the Government's proposed amendment on substantiation. For the sake of the record, I will speak to that when it is introduced. That being the case, it would be a waste of valuable time to say more about it now. I thank honourable senators for their support for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> I also appreciate the unanimous support for the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill. I think everybody agrees that, whatever their views about the merits of particular sub-parts of the program, the overall program is beneficial and these amendments improve it. I can understand that constituents with concerns about the child support scheme come to my parliamentary colleagues in both Houses. All I can say is that there are 224 members of parliament. I think I get 223 times as many letters as anyone else-I get my own and I get everybody else's as well. So, I understand that a lot of individuals have difficulty. That is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the most volatile issues in Australian society are brought together under one scheme-that is, family law and taxation. This is a combustible combination. Each time there is any concern, that concern is magnified several times by the financial and emotional implications tied up in these matters. This certainly places enormous pressure on the staff of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited nearly all the Child Support Agency offices in Australia and I can assure honourable senators, other members of parliament and taxpayers that these people are very dedicated and are working under extreme pressure. We should be grateful for the work that they do. That does not put the staff, the Agency or the scheme beyond criticism but I want to put on the record my appreciation for what they do. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought I should try to put into context the nature of the benefits which flow from the scheme. I will do so very briefly-it is a subject about which one could talk at great length and that would be entirely inappropriate. First of all, I will try to put into context one thing which Senator Reid said. I will then make some general comments before concluding. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid referred to some arbitrary $1,500 limit in respect of the collection of outstanding maintenance obligations. I know of no such limit. To the best of my knowledge-this was checked again today-there is no such limit. If it occurred in one case, I can only imagine this was generated by the time taken for the process. There is no such arbitrary process and there should not be. Sometimes there are such de facto limits on other debt management activities of the Australian Taxation Office but different arrangements apply to the Child Support Agency because every dollar counts to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> But individual problems arise for taxpayers, citizens and non-custodial and custodial parents, both of whom can in different circumstances face difficulty. We need to acknowledge some of the facts that put the individual problems into context. Some $10m a month is being distributed by the Department of Social Security on behalf of 138,000 children. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an enormous task which puts the individual problems in context but does not make them any easier. It is a 100 per cent problem for the individual who faces it. I acknowledge that and, to the extent that we can help, the Government tries to facilitate assisting in the problems of those people, because sometimes people do have to face very harrowing individual circumstances. It is a small part of a very big successful operation. It is not even the tip of the iceberg; it is a smaller proportion than that. </PARA>
<PARA> We also find that there has been a much higher percentage of maintenance collection than was occurring prior to the scheme. The assessment is that prior to the start of the scheme only 30 per cent of court ordered maintenance payments were being paid, and these frequently at irregular intervals. The indication is that the Child Support Agency collects 71 per cent of liabilities registered with it. That is an enormous turnaround. It is still not perfect-and it will never be 100 per cent, for reasons that people understand. Seventy-one per cent is not a level that we are satisfied with but it is a tremendous leap forward. Average payments of maintenance have also increased substantially. The average amount of maintenance paid per child has gone from $27 to between $39 and $49. There are an enormous number of children in need in Australia whose circumstances have been very substantially enhanced by the child support scheme and by the work of the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantial delays in registration which Senator Alston referred to, and which Senator Richardson acknowledged in May, have been substantially overcome by a major increase in resources for the Agency, and there is no major backlog there now. However, due to the number of cases being dealt with individual cases will still be delayed, and sometimes there is difficulty in getting people to pay their entitlements. We not only inherit responsibilities but also we inherit the very distinct reluctance on the part of some people to meet their obligations. These people often go to extraordinary lengths to avoid their obligations. We will continue to pursue all such cases as assiduously as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> The child support Bill enhances a scheme that is performing a major social justice role in our society. However, there is room for further improvement. I am happy to continue to discuss the scheme with honourable senators from all sides of the Parliament and look at areas of improvement. I just wanted to put in context the tremendous benefits that are flowing, so that the criticisms that have been aired-and many of them involve real and tangible human problems for individuals-are also put in context. I thank honourable senators for their support for both Bills. </PARA>

<PARA> After clause 7, page 2, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``7a. After section 82kza of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Relief from substantiation requirements in special circumstances</PARA>
<PARA> `82kzaa. (1) Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a taxpayer claims to have incurred an expense during a year of income; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) having regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the nature and quality of evidence that the taxpayer has available to substantiate the claim; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) special circumstances affecting the taxpayer, including, but not limited to, the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the extent to which the taxpayer attempted to comply with the substantiation sections;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether the taxpayer's failure to comply with the substantiation sections was inadvertent or deliberate;</PARA>
<PARA> the Commissioner, in the course of reviewing the claim after the making of the assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of income, is satisfied that:</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the expense was incurred by the taxpayer during the year of income; and</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) in considering an objection against the assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of income; or</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) in considering whether to make an amendment of the assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of income in response to a request made by the taxpayer before the commencement of this section;</PARA>
<PARA>the substantiation sections do not apply in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the expense. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) For the purposes of this section, the Commissioner is taken to have made an assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of income if the Commissioner has served notice in respect of the taxpayer to the effect that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of income is nil; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) no tax is payable on the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of income.</PARA>
<PARA> `(3) Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a taxpayer makes an application under subsection 188 (1) or (2); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the period referred to in the subsection concerned ended before the commencement of this section;</PARA>
<PARA>the following provisions have effect:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Commissioner, the Tribunal or the Federal Court of Australia, as the case requires, when making a decision on the application, must disregard subsection (1) of this section;</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) the Tribunal or the Federal Court of Australia, when making a decision under paragraph 190 (a), must disregard subsection (1) of this section. </PARA>
<PARA> `(4) This section applies to an expense incurred before, at or after the commencement of this section.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment answers the concern expressed by some members of the community that the substantiation provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 may, in certain circumstances, be too harsh in their application. Honourable senators will remember in an earlier second reading debate on a private member's Bill dealing with the substantial requirements I indicated that the Government was looking at possible measures to deal with any harshness that might arise in the application of the substantiation provisions. We feel that neither Senator Watson's amendment, nor another amendment put forward by the Australian Democrats, were appropriate answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment I have moved should overcome any concern as to the harshness of the law that might arise in particular circumstances while maintaining the integrity of the substantiation provisions. The amendment proposes relief from the substantiation provisions in respect of an expense item on review of an assessment where the Commissioner of Taxation, having regard to certain matters, is satisfied that the taxpayer has incurred the expense, and also that it would be unreasonable for the provisions to apply to not allow a deduction for the expense. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no relaxation of the substantiation requirements in anything other than exceptional individual circumstances. Taxpayers will be required to demonstrate that a genuine attempt has been made to comply with those requirements. As I have already indicated, the Government is concerned to ensure that the integrity of the substantiation provisions are not threatened.</PARA>
<PARA> The change to the income tax law will only apply in respect of assessments which are reviewed on or after the date the Bill receives royal assent. The rights of taxpayers who have sought an amendment or lodged a valid objection will be maintained. When lodging their returns, taxpayers will still be required to declare that they can substantiate all claims through employment related expenses. I present a supplementary memorandum and commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (NO.4) BILL 1990 COMMITTEE STAGES</PARA>
<PARA>Question 1</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Section 9, Page 3 which has the closest relevance to my question. </PARA>
<PARA>Credits in vostro accounts, i.e. amounts owed by Australian financial institutions to an offshore institution are not dealt with in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Current practice is not to pay interest on vostro balances in credit, so they are not included in foreign debt. However, the practice could change such that interest was payable, such credits would be included in foreign debt and there would be a risk that debt equity ratios could, in such circumstances, be breached. </PARA>
<PARA>Are there negotiations on this matter and has the Parliamentary Secretary any information for the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA>Question 2</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Section 13, Page 6. Amendments to 159GLA (i) specifies a number of conditions which must be satisfied at all times during the year of income. </PARA>
<PARA>Sub-paragraph a (c) (ii). </PARA>
<PARA>There is to be no amount owing by the resident holding company. However, the press release No. 24 of 30th March 1989 referring to the pre-conditions refers to interest bearing debt. `` . . . the holding company does not itself have any interest bearing debt to the foreign parent bank or foreign associations.''</PARA>
<PARA>A basic principle of their capitalisation is that it only applies to interest bearing debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Are there negotiations under way to overcome the problem in the bill which is a departure from the earlier undertakings including the press release. If so, what information can the Senatebe given?</PARA>
<PARA>Question 3</PARA>
<PARA>S159G2A</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the practical effect of the bill which will require a bank to monitor each and every transaction passing through a nostro or vostro account to ensure that it is cleared within the prescribed period. </PARA>
<PARA>1. Given the application of the 10 day rule, is not the legislative requirement so restrictive as to be commercially unrealistic in that substantial resources would be required to monitor the high volume of transactions and that delays are generally occasioned by independent third parties. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Will the Minister give consideration to industry's request for a 30 day period?</PARA>
<PARA>3. Does the offending transaction result in the concession being withdrawn from only that transaction?</PARA>
<PARA>4. Is the whole account tainted and if so for what period?</PARA>
<PARA>Question 4</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Clause 28 clarifying that an initial payment of tax, due 28 days after the end of a year of income is due and payable on the relevant day. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the problems with the economy and the difficulties some companies are facing in paying their tax obligation due on 17/12 how immutable is this 28/7 date for companies balancing on 30th June 1991 or 28 days after the end of the accounting period?</PARA>
<PARA>While there may be some philosophical support for bringing tax payment obligations of unincorporated and corporate taxpayers closer together. Does not the Minister agree that further, the transitional provisions appear in the circumstances to need some further examination, in the New Year. </PARA>
<PARA>Question 5</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the amendment following 82K2A. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendment requires the Commissioner to not apply the substantiation requirements in respect of an expense item where, in the course of reviewing a taxpayer's assessment and a claim to have incurred the expense, the Commissioner is satisfied as to certain matters. </PARA>
<PARA>In the practical operation of reviewing an assessment the taxation auditor will call for the necessary documentary evidence required under the substantiation provisions in respect of the relevant expenses claimed as a deduction.

<PARA> I indicate briefly that the Government will not be agreeing to the Australian Democrats' amendment with regard to the gold mining industry. Tax laws do vary slightly from industry to industry. We do like to have as common a basis as possible but, in particular circumstances, particularly where the tax arrangements for an industry are changing, it is important that laws be crafted to meet the circumstances of each industry. The superannuation industry was eased into the taxation system in a way suitable to its circumstances and in a way that met the special requirements of that industry. The goldmining industry is essentially being treated like other mining, and the transitional arrangements for it are those which are most appropriate. It is consistent with the arguments about level playing fields and vertical equity and, therefore, appropriate on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever we might think about the past tax treatment of the gold mining industry, I do not think there is a case for saying that it ought to bear a larger share of the tax burden than industries in similar circumstances. Therefore, the Government's proposed transitional arrangements are superior to those incorporated in Senator Spindler's amendment. We will not be supporting them, and I hope the Senate will not support them. </PARA>

<PARA> The Bills are intended to spread more evenly the burden of financing the operations of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation between the live stock producers, the meat processors and the exporters of Australian beef. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the slaughter levy is collected at the point of slaughter by the processor. It is the responsibility of the processor to forward all proceeds to the Government and then through to the industry. Although the slaughter levy will remain in place, we are moving away from a situation where a levy is applied at one stage of production. </PARA>
<PARA> The transaction levy will be payable on store, prime or stud sales of cattle. The transaction levy differs from the slaughter levy because the slaughter levy was imposed on all cattle that were processed at meatworks. The transaction levy will be payable on all store and prime cattle that are sold and all stud sales. In the past, none of these cattle has been subject to a levy, except in the case of prime cattle which are moved into the meatworks. </PARA>
<PARA> The background to these Bills dates back to 1987 when the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council recommended the transaction levy for cattle after the 1987 annual general meeting of the industry. These Bills have been the subject of some very lengthy debate throughout the beef and dairy industries for a number of years. In spite of the strong support for a change to the current system, mainly from the processing sector, the Bills coming before the Senate will be tested and reviewed at the end of three years. The levy on cattle sales can be altered at any time during the three years if the system does not work. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be three components to the new levy: a flat rate per head levy on all cattle sales and transfers of cattle from the production to the processing stage, which will be payable by the vendor or the owner at the time of transfer; a beef production levy on a cents per kilogram basis on beef and veal produced, which will be payable by the owner of the carcass; and a charge on live cattle exports on a cents per kilogram basis, payable by the exporter.</PARA>
<PARA> Dairy cattle traded for dairy purposes will be exempt from the transaction levy and export charge. The initial levy rates have been set so that the producer, the processor and export sectors share equally the costs of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation operations. The producer sector has accepted the responsibility for the funding of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign and the national residue survey which is currently collected with the inspection fees from export abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this is a much more equitable way in which to spread the financing of the cattle industry, it is going to cause a few administrative changes to the collection of the levy. In the past the slaughter levy was very easy to administer. There were no leakages and sides of beef could be clearly identified and the levy collected. The new transaction levy will be much more difficult to identify and administer, as it will be necessary to collect at various stages of production. </PARA>
<PARA> There are concerns with these pieces of legislation, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, himself pointed out during debate on 7 November 1990 in the House of Representatives. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme is more expensive. It is more administratively cumbersome. There will be more leakage, less auditing and a lot more trouble with it. Rather than looking again in 12 months time, I can see quite clearly that there will be a need for amendments through these next three years. </PARA>
<PARA>As a representative of a large constituency of cattle stations spanning right throughout the Northern Territory, I should mention just how important this industry is to Australia. Looking at statistics provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics-the exports Australian monthly summary tables for June 1990-beef contributed $2.3m of foreign exchange earnings in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of volume, a total of 672,000 tonnes of beef was exported: 328,000 tonnes, with an export value of $997m, to the United States of America and 181,000 tonnes, with a value of $803m, to Japan-Australia's main importer of beef. These figures indicate the importance of not only the industry but also the valuable exports Australia currently needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the industry has recommended these measures as a fairer way of collecting the levies needed to finance the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, to finance promotion, disease control and research and development. The Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill, the Beef Production Levy Bill, the Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill and the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill, because in essence Senator Tambling has comprehensively summarised the intent of the package and, for the edification of those who were listening, the history of the industry and its value to Australia. So I will not repeat that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very pleased to see that enshrined in this package is an opportunity, over the period of a couple of years from the implementation of the legislation, to review the procedures. This is an opportunity which will be welcomed in many other pieces of legislation that have been introduced recently. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also pleasing to see in this legislation that there has been extensive consultation with the industry and those affected by the procedures in the industry itself. I believe that that consultation has brought to us Bills, as they now stand, which at least have the endorsement of those involved in the industry. It is apparent that there are many details of this legislation which need tidying up. It is apparent because of the extensive amendment to be moved on behalf of the Government. There are also some reasonably extensive amendments to be moved by the Opposition. We also have some amendments which I foreshadow the Australian Democrats will move in the Committee of the Whole. The purport of all those amendments is really to tidy up rather than wholesale challenge the direction of the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also pleasing that, as a result of these Bills, we will see an equitable sharing of the sort of funding that is necessary for programs such as the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign and other funding for research. Without doubt, such programs are absolutely essential for the continued maintenance of an industry as vital as our cattle industry and Australian rural industries as a whole. It is not only the cattle industry which benefits directly from such research but also other livestock industries, especially research into disease eradication and crop, pasture and livestock management. Such research also benefits the entire community, not just the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because the whole community benefits that I say in passing-and not with the intention of moving any amendments in this particular package-that the concept of user pays should not be limited to the first direct user. The concept of user pays sounds simple but is not necessarily simple to apply. It is because the entire community pays that there is often a need to challenge enforcement of payment upon probably the most immediately apparent user, although often it is not the end user who benefits. If I have not made that clear, simply put, the entire community benefits from the research conducted for and on behalf of our meat and livestock industries, and the entire community should have some obligation to contribute as well. But that aside, in this Bill there are provisions for fair and equitable distribution of the costs of research and further programs across the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which the Democrats will be moving in the committee stage are intended to ensure that the levies are collected with due regard to the civil rights and the commercial obligations of those who are engaged in the industry. An amendment which we will be moving, for which we hope to see unanimous support, is that foreshadowed by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills where, in its Alert Digest No. 8 of 1990, the Committee alerted all honourable senators to the fact that this legislation could allow magistrates in certain circumstances to issue search warrants. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a lengthy discussion in the digest on the need to tighten the definition of `justice of the peace' and reasons were given for it. I will not spell out those reasons because I presume that those honourable senators who are interested in this legislation will have read it and comprehended the well argued case presented by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. If that is not the case, I recommend anybody who is interested in this legislation to read it immediately. It has direct consequences for those engaged in the industry and discussed the sorts of measures which must be taken to ensure commercial confidence and, in the other sense of the word, confidence in those who claim to come from the Government to assist them. It is all very well somebody claiming that they are from the Government and that they are there to help, but our amendment ensures that that claim is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> We seek to amend this legislation to ensure that such people actually carry identification and that the identification is available to be viewed by those people whom they are visiting. I hope that the Government and the coalition support that amendment. The Australian Democrats will support the other amendments which have been foreshadowed. Our industries will benefit greatly if this package of Bills is passed with our amendments. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this package of Bills, especially the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill even though there are a multitude of others. This Bill came about as a result of a report of the AMLIPC, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Corporation, at the request of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, about the way slaughter levies for the AMLC are collected. Currently a flat rate exists at the point of slaughter and on export of live stock. At the time, processors of meat or livestock thought that the flat charge levies fell unfairly upon them. They wanted these charges to be spread more evenly across the industry. They were wrong in assuming that the burden fell on the processors. As I have said plenty of times before, processors pass all their costs back to the producers; the buck stops at the producer. So that concept was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report recommended an excise on meat produced by the processing sector and then a flat transaction rate for cattle moving from production stage to the processing stage. It also recommended a form of slaughter levy for sheep, goat and buffalo meat. After further discussion between the industry and the AMLC, the AMLC recommended to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that only cattle be included, thus excluding sheep, goats, et cetera. We have finished up with a recommendation that there be an excise on meat produced by the processing sectors and a flat rate for the transaction to the producers. But the recommendation did not solely include the cattle going from the producers to the processing stage; it included every sale after stock is born. Each time they are sold from one farm to another, a levy is paid. That is a form of sales tax. We should not have this at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this system producers pay 75 per cent of all the levies collected while processors pay the 25 per cent excise. As I have said before, the whole bill finishes up with the producers. This is not good for the production side. As I have already said, there are quite a few sales from the person who breeds the stock right through to when the stock finally gets to the processor. There are various reasons for this: there is lack of feed and there are bush fires, especially this year with farm fires in New South Wales where the stock will have to be on sold a few more times before they get to the processing stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Unforeseen problems arose from those recommendations and this Bill. The main complaints that have come to me have been from the pastoral regions, where properties are sold only on a walk-in walk-out basis-lock stock and barrel; the whole lot. Of course, when one has a cattle station with about 20,000 head, there is an immediate bill of $120,000 that has to be paid by the vendor on the signing of the contract. This is contrary to the spirit of the original recommendation. The inquiry said that there was to be a levy on cattle as they passed from the production stage to the processing stage. In a walk-in walk-out transaction it has to be paid on every head of cattle immediately. It is slightly different in agricultural areas where if a farm is sold then cattle are sold at a clearing sale; they are scattered to the four winds. These people are not affected as much. But in a walk-in walk-out transaction there is a great burden on the vendor. This reflects on the price that someone else is prepared to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> We then have to look at the concept of this slaughter levy being paid by a vendor of a pastoral property. If someone has 20,000 head of cattle the bill totals $120,000. This will not help that vendor one iota as he is moving out of the industry. All levies on production or processing should be ongoing so that the ones paying can get some advantage in research, marketing or whatever. In a walk-in walk-out transaction, the buyer of the property will immediately start to pay on those cattle when he starts trading. If he starts selling in five or six weeks he will have to pay the levy again. As I have said, in agricultural areas matters are slightly different. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the finer points of the problems of implementation. The cost of collection and the cost of compliance have increased dramatically. In fact, they have increased by 250 per cent. The previous system cost $400,000 to operate; it is now estimated to cost $1m. The Cattle Council of Australia simply said, `Yes, it is 250 per cent. It is increasing from $400,000 to $1m. So what? It is only one per cent of the budget'. But these days one per cent makes a lot of difference in someone's turnover. The rate of return for cattle producers in the last three years is as follows: in 1987-88 the return on capital was 1.1 per cent; in 1988-89 it was 5.2 per cent; and in 1989-90 it was minus 0.02 per cent. So one per cent-although it is not right across the board-will make a difference. All these things have to be watched. So much for what the Cattle Council has had to say. As far as I am concerned it is about as irrelevant as the Wool Council of Australia and the Grains Council of Australia are in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This also creates uncertainty in the market. I have already mentioned the high cost of collection and the high cost of policing. I do not know how we will ever police it. Before the system could not be by passed, either at the point when stock went through slaughter or were exported, and the levy had to be paid. Now that the levy will even be paid on private sales between farmers I believe that many will slip through the net. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, in winding up, I reiterate what I have said about all these problems which have to be addressed, especially that relating to the walk-in walk-out transaction in cattle stations. There is no other way to do this. The other point I intend to mention briefly is the exemption allowed for cattle traded for dairy purposes. Dairy cattle are ultimately slaughtered for their carcass value. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, unless the exemptions are extended at least to the walk-in walk-out sales, the cattle industry will get slaughtered and it will be left open to rorting by people dodging the system of collection. That matter should be addressed. In conclusion, let me say that I support the Bill. Because this measure is being implemented on a three-year trial basis, some of us will be back here in three years time to debate this matter again, and I consider that we will then return to the original system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating cognately the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1990, the Beef Production Levy Bill 1990, the Cattle Export Charge Bill 1990, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill 1990, the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990, the Livestock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill 1990. There seems to be very little confidence in the decision that the slaughter levy on cattle should be replaced by a transaction levy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has left the slaughter levy Bill in place, but has reduced the slaughter levy to zero in case the new transaction Bill does not serve the industry as is intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that the industry, the Cattle Council of Australia and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) see some benefit in moving towards a transaction Bill because they believe that the costs will be spread more equitably across the whole industry. On a superficial look at the Bill, I suggest that ultimately the market will decide who pays the levy. Inevitably, the producer will end up footing the Bill irrespective of which way the levy is collected. </PARA>
<PARA> We are here to put this legislation through and, therefore, we give it support. The slaughter levy will be reduced from $13 to $5.83 and that latter amount will be paid by the vendor from purchase to purchase. The beef production levy will be 2.17c per kilogram at the abattoirs and the charge on live cattle will be 1.09c per kilogram. The purpose of the Bill is to involve the whole industry in the collection of the money to finance the AMLC in its promotion, disease eradication programs and overseas sales. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the AMLC has done a good job in the promotion of meat. It has done an excellent job in lifting sales of meat in Australia. This industry is worth $2.5 billion in export sales. It is one of the few industries in rural Australia that are showing some positive performance at the moment. I suppose we could say that the cotton industry and the beef industry are the only ones that are showing some light at the end of the tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few problems for the Australian meat industry. One of the big problems facing the industry next year is the increase in quarantine inspection charges from $82m to $104m. That is an increase of about 60 per cent to recover the total inspection charge. The coalition's policy in that regard is for a 50 per cent recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Although increased inspection services are to be provided by meat inspectors, the average wage for a meat inspector is $35,000 and the Government is to charge $65,000 for placing a meat inspector in an abattoir. That is a very considerable charge which will have to be placed on the industry and recovered by the industry. The industry can live with that as long as the meat inspectors provide services. That is not happening at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a whole range of industrial disputes by meat inspectors closing down abattoirs throughout the country. The Government seems to be inept in doing anything about this. If the industry is paying $104m, it would like some say about how these meat inspectors will be employed. The industry will pay the freight and, rightly, it wants some input as to how these meat inspectors will perform. There is an industrial dispute concerning long service leave entitlements following the transfer of some meat inspectors to the Commonwealth system. Strikes over long service leave entitlements are occurring in various abattoirs throughout the country. I hope that the Minister can come to terms with those people. As I said before this industry provides jobs for many thousands of people and at the moment it is one of the only performing rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by saying that Australia now produces the purest and most disease-free and chemical-free beef in the world. It is very important for Australia that the game is played fairly so that we can take advantage of the quality of our product. We are running into problems-and it is a feature of the world beef market-in that we are now finding subsidisation in many countries. These policies are hurting and are very harmful to the efficient producers in Australia who are not subsidised in any way to compete in the overseas beef market. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community (EC) has distorted the beef trade. It is imposing quantitative import restrictions and import levies. It has intervention purchasing systems which maintain the producer prices at levels well above world prices and the producers have massive export subsidies. The result of those provisions has been that the EC now has become a major exporter of beef compared to 20 years ago when it imported beef. Figures just released yesterday from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics were disastrous for Australian rural industry. They show that we are in danger of losing some of our beef market to Korea and Japan if the EC continues to subsidise some of its overseas production. The Andriessen assurance has largely kept EC products out of Japan and Korea. I just hope that the EC continues to observe that Andriessen assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The only hope that I see on the horizon is that the EC will be facing a subsidy bill next year of $41 billion to continue to provide subsidies for its rural producers. That $41 billion will have to be funded by the consumers in the EC. Those consumers are going to be paying excessively high prices for their staple food products. One would think that political pressure will be felt by the governments of the EC regarding their subsidies for farmers when their constituencies are faced with very high prices for food products when good quality, well-produced food from free market countries such as Australia can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time available to me, I wanted to point out the problems facing our rural producers as a whole. Now that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round is moving into its final days, we are all hoping, I believe, rather than expecting, that it will come up with some conclusions that will allow free trade in the world. I think that Australia has more than played its part. It has reduced tariffs; it has lifted the sugar embargo; it has done so much to lead the way in world trade, yet no other nation has followed Australia's lead. I believe the Government could be accused of giving away many of our bargaining chips in its negotiations with the EC, yet we have not had any assurances that our rural producers will receive fair treatment. If the GATT round fails, maybe we can look at what we have to do when we come back in the new year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill, the Beef Production Levy Bill, the Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill and the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill, I think it is important that I outline the rationale behind the changes that are being made and how the money will actually be spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Previous speakers have outlined what is occurring in terms of the financial take on individual cattle. The $13.07 slaughter levy and a live cattle export levy have been taken away. In their place there will be a transaction levy of $5.83, which will be paid by the grower, and 2.17c per kilo which, in theory, will be paid by the processors. In looking at this matter and the rationale behind it-this has been negotiated between the various cattle industry organisations around Australia over the last 2 1/2 years-we see when we break it up that $63m of the total sum goes directly to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) to cover its running costs, promotions, et cetera, of which $31.5m will be paid by producers, and processors will pay $31.5m from the 2.17c per kilo levy. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been mentioned by other speakers-and Senator Boswell in particular-I think that it is very important in these times that the AMLC, in terms of its international promotion, be well funded so that it can maximise that promotion. I believe that Australian beef is one of the best red meat products in the world. As has been mentioned, Australia also has one of the cleanest industries in terms of chemicals, controls, et cetera. We have a very fortunate marketing opportunity in terms of promoting this around the world. It is worth noting here that the figure works out at $3.15 per transaction, and it is envisaged that there will be some 10 million transactions in total. This could well be a conservative figure in terms of likely developments in the future. Of course, if that happens we will see the potential for the levy to be even less because the fund is not designed to make a profit; it will just recover costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The next arm of this particular transaction levy is the research and development arm of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation, which will raise in excess of $9m, of which the producers will pay $4.6m and processors $4.6m. In looking at the figure of 10 million transactions, that equates to 46c per sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign (BTEC), which I understand should be completed by 1992 or thereabouts, has an annual requirement of $21m, which equates to $2.10 per head. All of this portion of the expenditure will be raised from producers. Of course, this is directly related, as the benefit of having clean herds flows back to the producers. One of the principal reasons why the industry is deciding to change to an overall transaction levy which covers all animals at the point of sale, not just those at the point of slaughter or those being exported overseas, relates to particular aspects of the BTEC program. Senator Panizza and Senator Tambling quite rightly raised this aspect. I believe that this legislation will be back before us in due course, not because it will need major amendments, but because we can envisage some difficulties in terms of the walk-in walk-out sale provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions apply particularly to station sales of cattle, mainly in the north. Currently those in the north are the direct beneficiaries of the BTEC program, because southern Australia has been clean for a number of years. There is no suggestion that the whole industry should not pay for the BTEC program, but I think it is fair to say that in the past a disproportionate share of the cost has been paid by southern cattle producers, as opposed to northern cattle producers. If it works, this legislation will bring a little more equity to the whole equation. </PARA>
<PARA> The next part of the expenditure raised relates to the national revenue survey. This is a random survey in which all primary producers take part to provide feedback on the state of the industry. Once again, as with the BTEC program, all of this money will be provided by beef producers. This annual requirement amounts to $1.4m. This equates to 12c per transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the total amount required for the slaughter levy is in the order of $93m. Of course, if the projections are that there are going to be about 12 to 13 million transactions, as it is proposed just to cover costs and not to make a profit, the $5.83 levy could be lowered in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining to me in this debate, I would also like to refer, as Senator Boswell did, to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) operation. Obviously, that will be subject to a different debate and a different speech. But there are some equity problems in terms of the administration of that Service, particularly with the move to what is called full cost recovery. In my view it has gone past full cost recovery because it is not just the producers who benefit from the AQIS operation. It has flow-on effects, and that is something that we will have to address in future debates.</PARA>
<PARA> While the $93m required is a lot of money, it is really a small ticket item in terms of total costs or the impediments on the industry now. We must overcome the industrial disruption that occurs in the meat industry. It has been very damaging to the industry and has not helped our export performance at all. Equally importantly, we need to address the current killing costs. Analysis consistently shows that in this country it costs up to double the amount that it costs our competitors to slaughter and process a beast. The real challenge facing this country's meat industry is to get our killing costs down so that we can become internationally competitive. This will make it so much easier for us to compete with subsidised beef from Europe and other countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is discussing seven Bills-I repeat: seven Bills-under a guillotine where we simply do not have time to debate them. They are all important Bills because they all relate to the cattle industry, and the cattle industry is one of the few successful industries left in Australia. The Bills involve increasing charges or imposing new charges on the cattle industry. They are well deserving of review by this House of review. But, as we have a government which cannot govern, it is not surprising it cannot run a parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a bankrupt government that has bankrupted the country. In my time as a senator-and I am now in my thirteenth year-I have never seen a government on the treasury bench with so little energy as the present Government. Not only is it bankrupt of energy, it is also totally bankrupt of ideas. We have got into the mess we are in with the guillotine because the Government simply could not run the program. Up to last week the Parliament had sat for about 13 out of 49 weeks this year, and now we are faced with the impossible situation of running through 52 Bills without any time for debate. The Bills were not debated in the other place because they were put through under the guillotine. The purpose of this chamber is to review Bills and get rid of the mistakes in them that this Government generates. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not have been possible to have had this guillotine dropped on us if the Australian Democrats had not changed their position. They gave the Australian public fervent promises the last time they helped to impose a guillotine. I have in my possession a letter from one of their senators to the Parliamentary Liaison Officer written in August 1988 promising they would never do it again, that that would be the last time. But now they have gone along with the Australian Labor Party in jackbooting this legislation through. The consequence is that we simply do not have time to discuss this very important legislation because we are all on about a five-minute speaking block. I could not attempt to move into what are technical Bills-seven of them-in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I declare a personal interest in this subject. I am a beef producer and, sadly, the Australian Commissioner of Taxation takes some money from me every year as a consequence of that. The Bills change what was formerly a slaughter levy to a number of levies covering various parts of the cattle industry. The Bills are: the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill, the Beef Production Levy Bill, the Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill and the Livestock Export Charge Amendment Bill. Earlier speakers from the Liberal and National parties have outlined the general intent of the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the allegations made by all speakers is that the industry wants these Bills. I do not challenge the concept that some people in the industry want the Bills, because, formerly, beef producers who sold into abattoirs paid a slaughter levy but breeders who were selling store cattle to the industry did not. Obviously, not all, but a proportion, of the former category-those selling to abattoirs-would welcome a proposal to spread the load. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that I have known a lot of people in the beef industry for a number of years and not one person that I know has raised with me the matter of supporting this legislation. I take with a grain of salt the universal claims that have been made in this chamber that the industry supports these Bills. I doubt very much, if a mandatory poll were held across the industry, that a majority position of support for the Bills would be found. Be that as it may, the legislation is before us. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen is that there will be a flat rate per head on all cattle sales and transfer of cattle from production to processing stage, payable by the vendor or owner at the time of transfer; there will be a beef production levy on a cents per kilogram basis on beef and veal, payable by the owner of the carcass; and a charge on live cattle exports on a cents per kilogram basis, payable by the exporter. It could be argued that in one sense those taxes are regressive because the more successful the producer is at producing a heavier beast, the more he will have to pay in the levy. It might be argued that he has benefited more from the research programs that have enabled a heavier beast to be developed, but I think, on balance, one would come to the conclusion that in that sense it is a regressive tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that a number of carcass producers are excluded, and they are the sheep, buffalo and goat producers. They may be the smart ones-they decided not to join the scheme, or persuaded the Government not to bring them in. I find it very interesting that some sections of the industry could be granted an exclusion, as well as the dairy cattle section that Senator Panizza referred to. I do not doubt that a case can be made for them, but I think if a case can be made for some it can be made for all. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties I see with these Bills is that they increase the number of levies. Whenever the number of charges is increased, administrative costs are always increased. It does not matter whether it is a statutory authority, a marketing board or a government department, once it gets its sticky fingers on money it gets involved in an empire building process and more and more money goes into administration. When, initially, one charge is split down to two or three, and those subsequent charges are at a lower level, it becomes that much easier for the authority to increase them and build them up. I have no doubt at all that the consequence of these Bills will be far higher costs to the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of other charges on the beef industry, as Senator Panizza and Senator Crane mentioned. It is not only these that we are paying; we are also paying a lot of other charges and they are going up time after time. It is very interesting to look at the graphs of who gets what nowadays out of a beast before it ends up on the table. In the last five years there has been a change and the beef producer-the cattleman-has gone into a minority position. Until about five years ago the producer got most of the price: probably over 45 per cent went to him and the rest went to the processors and the retailers. The ratios have now changed quite significantly. I do not expect that beef producers will ever go back to playing the dominant part in the price of a beast-the retailers and processors will end up getting quite a bit more out of the deal. That has consequences in the long term because the costs of producing keep going up. Pasture improvements, water retention schemes and all the rest of it impact very heavily on beef production and, if the profitability is not in the industry, the industry simply cannot grow and take up the export markets that we need. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the business of costs being loaded onto the cattle industry, I would like to mention the very regressive tax of the Queensland Government-another Labor socialist government-and what it has done in the last 12 months in hiking up the registration fees for farm trucks to quite astronomical levels. If the Commonwealth has its way with its road schemes, under its plan for semi-trailers the costs will go up again in years to come. This is important because truck transport is an essential part of the cattle industry. Very little droving is done these days and rail is not an alternative solution. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minutes left to me I would like to look ahead briefly to the future of the beef trade. I am very concerned that there is a degree of euphoria about the Japanese market which may not be realised in due course. When the Japanese liberalise their markets they are going to put a 70 per cent import duty on beef. That is an extraordinarily high tariff. As a consequence of that, there will be a great incentive on beef exporters to land beef as cheaply as possible into Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the integration that is occurring with producers and abattoirs and the vertical integration in the Australian market, it is as well to be a little cautious about where we are going. I do not have time to develop this theme this afternoon, but I am very concerned that the Government is totally oblivious to the dangers we are facing with Japanese and overseas domination of the beef processing outlets in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the number of abattoirs reduced to about half the number that they were 10 or 15 years ago. Abattoirs have the power of life and death over the industry. They set the price and they actually decide whether they will take producers' cattle. Formerly the abattoirs and the producers had a pretty good relationship in this country. When times were bad in drought conditions, the abattoirs accommodated people who wanted to reduce their stock numbers; and, conversely, producers made cattle available for abattoirs with an export order when they were not as far forward as they would have liked. </PARA>
<PARA> There are signs that that relationship is changing. The abattoirs have the power to set the price for the product and to decide whether they will take the cattle. They are the people who write the export orders and if they are facing a very high tariff penalty, like 70 per cent on their exports, there is very great pressure on them to keep the price to the Australian producer as low as possible. That is a matter I will develop here at a future time, but I would welcome some consciousness on the part of this lethargic Government of the dangers we are facing in the industry at that level. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great problem in this area was referred to by Senator Crane; that is, the archaic work practices in the industry and the difficulties of getting efficiencies into the abattoirs because of the meat workers unions. I do not need to mention here the great number of strikes we have had in Victoria recently. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the Bills, other speakers have commented on the fact that there is a fall-back position whereby the pre-existing slaughter scheme could be reintroduced in three years. I have never seen that in a Bill before. We now have a special provision to come back to the original legislation. This indicates the Government's lack of confidence in this legislation. Nevertheless, the Opposition will not be opposing the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments serve a common purpose of meeting the criticisms of the Bill which were published by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I am disappointed to receive an indication that neither the Government nor the Opposition intend to support these amendments. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee had several concerns about certain aspects of the Bill. Clause 13, for example, allows magistrates to issue search warrants. The `magistrates' so defined include justices of the peace. The Alert Digest published by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee suggested that an amendment to remove the definition which included JPs would be appropriate in order to safeguard the interests of people in rural areas who wanted a tighter definition of the person who would be capable of issuing a search warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, clause 12 allows an authorised person to enter and search premises and to seize material. The Committee suggested a way to strengthen the consent mechanism. The Democrats want to follow the suggestion made by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in that regard, because we believe the civil liberties of people whose premises were about to be searched could be compromised unless some arrangement is made to strengthen the consent mechanism. I cannot see any problem with following the recommendations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it would burden the legislation too much to accept our amendments. Having been given the information in the discussion, we will persist only with amendment No. 3, which is to clause 15. I express our disappointment that no support could be garnered for the other amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will oppose the Democrat amendment to omit the definition of `magistrate' from this legislation. The coalition believes that it is important to point out that the term `magistrate' should include a justice of the peace because so often in rural areas access to a magistrate-let alone a judicial officer, which would be the intent of the Democrats-is not possible. The coalition recognises the importance of that factor to the rural constituency and the effect that such a change may have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrat amendment requiring consent to enter premises is also unnecessary to this piece of legislation. Inspections are hardly ever carried out and when they are the Department of Primary Industries and Energy needs to be fully convinced that someone is cheating the system. The money involved in the collection of the levy is money from producers rather than that of government. Therefore, the less money collected by way of levy, the more everyone in the industry is affected. Furthermore, this would be the first time that a levy was subject to such a clause, thereby proving to be a contradiction in relation to other levies which come under the umbrella of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Specifically the coalition opposes any amendment which stands in the way either of collecting money that rightfully belongs to producers or investigation where cheating is going on. </PARA>

I am not sure that that is something we would have initiated. But we accept that that is an amendment with which the Government can comfortably live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the question about the definition of `magistrate' and the inclusion of justices of the peace, there has been a lot of debate and controversy over a long time about the role of justices of the peace. It is proper and reasonable for members of Parliament, members of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and others to be concerned about ensuring the integrity of things such as search warrants. However, one also has to live with the reality of life in remote areas of Australia. Although I now represent the Australian Capital Territory, where the problem does not arise-although justices of the peace still play an important role in this city, but not for the same reason-having come originally from Western Australia, I am familiar with the circumstances that can arise which make the availability of a magistrate either practically impossible or possible only at a financial burden that would make the whole thing unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to have a compromise. It is proper that we look at these concerns because over the years there has been debate about the role of justices. But this is an area where I think the appropriate balance is being struck and it is necessary that the working arrangement continue. For that reason and because we want to see the continuation of the reasonable and cooperative arrangement which field officers have established in the past in the operation of this very important function, we do not accept the other amendments.

That effect is that in visiting a remote part of Australia for the purposes of inspection, survey and verification of information given, an officer, for the officer's own safety and for the assurance of those people being visited, is better served by having an identity card.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be pressing this issue with any great urgency. It is really a matter of definition.

<PARA>The Secretary may cause an identity card to be issued to an authorised person.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats are now seeking to change the word `may' to `must'. But if we read further down the same section relating to identity cards, we find that clause 15(5) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Where an authorised person proposes to enter premises otherwise than in accordance with the warrant issued under section 13, the authorised person must produce his or her identity card to the occupier of the premises for the occupier's inspection and, if the authorised person fails to do so, the authorised person is not entitled to enter the premises under section 12.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Democrats are inserting `must' as part of the first subclause to ensure that the Secretary to the Department now must issue an identity card to all public servants in such a situation, the public servants could not have carried out the task anyway.

<PARA>Therefore, it is the belief of the Liberal and National parties that we must get this legislation right. In order to get it right, the Opposition will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage to ensure that a clear definition is given of the way the Government will spend this money. The Liberal and National parties believe that the legislation, as drafted, is too loose and leaves too much to the discretion of the Minister. As drafted, there is absolutely no guarantee that this Government will not attempt to establish a half billion dollar war chest to pork barrel marginal seats in the lead-up to an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been guillotined through the House of Representatives in the most cavalier and irresponsible fashion. I think it is worth noting that a piece of legislation described by the Minister as being the most important and significant for land transport in history is now being guillotined through the Senate by the Government with the connivance of the Australian Democrats. I wish to foreshadow that the Opposition will be moving substantive amendments to the Bill in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill changes the name of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988 to the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988. It will amend the Act so that a separate appropriation from Consolidated Revenue can be paid into a trust fund. It will also provide three new categories of assistance from 1 July 1990 from a separate appropriation from Consolidated Revenue. The three new programs of funding are for the three new categories of assistance announced during the last Federal election campaign and in the Budget, and they are as follows: provincial cities and rural highways projects; black spot projects and road safety measures; and urban public transport projects. </PARA>
<PARA> As drafted, the distribution of funds among the States under the three categories would be at the Minister's discretion in accordance with national priorities. There are no fixed State shares. It represents a policy change on the part of the Government towards targeting Commonwealth funding to nationally important projects. While a national approach is worth while, the Bill as it stands opens up a Pandora's box as far as the Government's whim to put funds where it sees fit is concerned, whether or not the States want that particular type of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties believe it should be a matter for individual States rather than for the Federal Minister to decide which nationally significant roads receive attention. This was, I understand, an understanding reached at the recent Special Premiers Conference. This type of funding was to be by way of block grants rather than specific funding, and yet we are back to the old specific funding days. The States, of course, are in a much better position to judge, and there is absolutely no explanation for the present Government changing the rules unless it is leaving the way clear to embark on a giant pork-barrelling exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties will move an amendment to guarantee each of the three new programs-in other words, a share of the additional funds promised by the Government at election time will be incorporated in the Bill, not just mentioned in the second reading speech. As I mentioned earlier, while the recent Premiers Conference looked towards the concept of general purpose funding, this piece of legislation points to the retention of road funding as a specific purpose grant. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election campaign, the Government promised to devote $100m a year for the next three years to the provincial cities and rural highways program, financed from the new 20 per cent sales tax on luxury cars or the $100m, whichever was the greater. Why is there no mention of this in the Bill? Does this indicate that the tax announcement was just an election gimmick or will the Government not make $100m on its sales tax? The Liberal and National parties wish to make sure that the funding is guaranteed whether or not the Federal Government reaches its target of $100m from the sales tax of luxury cars. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also promised $120m over three years to the black spots program, where dangerous spots on the road would be fixed in return for the States or Territories accepting a 10-point safety plan. The Liberal-National parties view is that those black spots should be rectified regardless of whether the States or Territories comply with the Federal plans. Surely it is more important to fix dangerous black spots than worry about a few points not being agreed to by a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said in his second reading speech that total land transport assistance would be increased by 13 per cent in real terms in 1990-91, but funding for roads goes up only 1.9 per cent in real terms. As capital investment in State rail has not been funded by the Commonwealth for a number of years, it is misleading to talk of such an increase, especially given the progressive fall in land transport funding since the Hawke Labor Government came to power. Road funding has fallen by over 27 per cent in real terms in that time and is set to continue to fall over the next 10 years. At the same time, hypothecated fuel excise as a proportion of total fuel tax has fallen from well over 50 per cent to under 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National parties believe that a share of total trust fund moneys should be guaranteed to roads. The way the Bill is drafted at present, the Minister could slash the amount of money that goes into roads entirely at his discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal allocation to the States for rail investment, excluding Australian National, has fallen from $65m in 1982-83 to zero in 1989-90. It is estimated to be only $50m in 1990-91, a fall of over 60 per cent in real terms-hardly what one would call a land transport program. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: who should be paying for improvements in the railways? This is supposed to be a road funding Bill, but the Government has moved an amendment to change it to a land transport Bill. It is clever footwork, but who will pay? The Government has discovered overnight that it is time to start spending more and more money that basically comes from the motorist, and in a very limited respect from rail, on urban transportation and railways. We will move an amendment at the committee stage to restrict the amount of money that will be allocated from the trust fund to the railways so that our deteriorating roads are provided for. We will restrict the Government to undertakings given in the Minister's second reading speech. That is really the basis of our amendments-to restrict the Government to its own undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second amendment also refers to amounts allocated from the trust fund and specifies in percentage terms expenditure on capital railway projects, urban public transport projects and approved organisations. We do not wish to see a disproportionate amount of funding steered towards one area, such as urban transport projects, at the expense of other necessary work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill announces that $50m will go to the National Rail Freight Corporation (NRFC). We support the principle of the NRFC, but its establishment should be looked at in perspective. Improvements to interstate rail freight are appallingly overdue and any improvements are not before time. The fact is that interstate rail freight accounts for only 15 per cent of the total freight carried by rail and losses on interstate rail freight are currently running in the order of about $300m per annum. Railways in Australia are now losing close to $3 billion annually. This move is a step in the right direction, but a palliative. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is very much in favour of reform of the rail network. We see it as one of the key priorities in Australia's micro-economic rehabilitation. Not only should there be substantial safety and environmental benefits from reducing the amount of projected traffic-especially heavy vehicles-on our major corridors, but there is magnificent scope to increase efficiency. When transportation costs are reduced, it follows that there will be significant gains for our agriculture and manufacturing export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As with waterfront reform, there is no room for featherbedding of unions or prevarication where tough decisions must be made. We shall move amendments to clause 12 of the Bill which relate to the power of the Federal Minister. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that the decisions about these funds are best made by the States, which are much closer to understanding their own needs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the matter of road tolls. Section 32 (1)(m) requires the States to seek the Minister's written permission before a toll can be applied to any road that has been wholly or partially funded out of the trust fund. We believe that this allows too much discretion to the Minister and we consider that the States should be able to apply a toll on a road in proportion to use of State funds. We shall be moving an amendment at the committee stage accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed, the Opposition will be moving amendments to the Bill in committee. When these amendments were moved in the House of Representatives the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) made the extraordinary comment that while there was nothing inherently wrong with those proposed amendments, the Government opposed them because they were not necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill 1990, which amends the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988. It is more than a Bill to fund road development; it is more a land transport Bill because it covers railways as well. The Government is obviously now moving towards catering for land transport. The Government fully admits that it is attempting to help railways and says that it wants to put railways on an equal footing with road transport. I do not quite know what it means by that. If rail transport is not on an equal footing with road transport at present, then I believe it is the fault of this Government and previous governments, which have let it fall down over the years. I believe that taxing road transport is quite an unusual way to fix up the problems besetting rail transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) said in his second reading speech that he wanted a land transport sector in which both road and rail undertake the task to which each is suited. I totally agree with that concept. He went on to say that we need a rail system that is more efficient and competitive. I have no disagreement with that proposition whatsoever, but there is no way in the world that trucks would be able to compete with rail on the long haul between capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, road transport is able to compete with rail transport. Trucks can compete because of the inefficiency of the rail system. I believe that the Government has a long way to go in tackling that problem, but I do not believe that it is going the right way. It will kill off road transport by charging it out of competition under the ruse of removing distortions in State revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention a few facts about road transport. Firstly, it is predominantly a local industry. Road transport's biggest employer is the domestic freight market; it is close to home. It carries 78 per cent of the total domestic freight of 1.5 billion tonnes. The average length of haul is 70 kilometres. How can the Minister tell me that it is a more efficient method to move that amount of freight by rail?</PARA>
<PARA> Generally, the loading of freight starts at the producer's door. Not all factory yards have a rail link. Basically, freight would be loaded onto road transport, hauled to a rail yard and then shifted to rail transport. At the end of that process the situation would be reversed. That cannot be done as it just does not work. Road transport carries 78 per cent of total domestic freight on an average of 70 kilometres, which is one-third of the task in tonnes per kilometre rather than volume or tonnage. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, interstate freight amounts to only 4 per cent of the total freight. So how much can we move to rail? The estimate of inter-capital road freight, as distinct from interstate rail freight, in Australia is only 10 million tonnes per annum. Inter-capital freight is only 0.66 per cent of the total domestic freight of 1.5 billion tonnes. So there is very little potential for the overlapping of the two systems. Those calling for wholesale conversion from road to rail do not know the facts. Their idea is that, as the Government and others have been preaching, freight should be taken off the road and onto rail and that that will solve the problems of road accidents and so on. That is a simplistic solution which does not heed the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that around Australia at present 10,000 trucks are on the road interstate every day. If no changes occur to general expansion, by the year 2000 there will be 20,000 trucks per day on the roads. The best estimate of the additional volume of traffic carried by rail is the equivalent of approximately 3,000 trucks per day, which is an 80 per cent increase on the present figure. On those figures, we will still be 20 per cent short on the projected tonnages that have to be moved by the year 2000. So there will be a bigger demand on roads even if rail transport carries what it is intended to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot blindly say that all will be well if we get freight off the roads and onto rail; any society needs both systems. Certain commodities are better suited to certain modes of transport: for example, bulk freight should be carried by rail and general freight on road, rail and, no doubt, air. In remote and sparsely populated areas, road is the only choice that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me is the way that the Government has let the rail system go down the tube. The rail system has been starved of funding and has outdated work practices. Of course, we still have the three different gauges that we had 70 years ago or thereabouts, different safe working systems and different awards, which all add up to a maze of inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has there been a lack of funding for rail but also a massive reduction in real terms in road funding. To illustrate that, I refer to a chart of the Federal allocations to the States for rail investment for the years 1969-70 to 1989-90. In Fraser's last Budget of 1982-83, $65m was allocated to rail. In the first year of the Hawke Government, 1983-84, the allocation was cut to $11m, and in 1984-85 to $7m. By 1988-89, the Federal Budget made no allocation to rail. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, has seen a copy of the chart. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The chart shows the lack of commitment of this Government to rail. I come now to roads, where we have the same story. I will later seek leave to incorporate a chart which shows dollar expenditure on roads in real terms and the excise at the end of each particular year. It shows that in the last year of the Fraser Government $1.058 billion was allocated to roads while the fuel excise was 6.96c per litre. The maximum of $1.282 billion was reached in 1984-85, but excise at that time was 9.64c per litre as a result of the Hawke Government introducing the system of indexing the levy. By the end of 1989-90, spending had fallen to $0.951 billion, but the fuel levy by then had reached 16.21c per litre by indexation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This puts paid to the argument of Mr O'Keefe in the House of Representatives. I would like to quote the Hansard record of the House of Representatives, but time goes by-and the Opposition Whip is looking at me. Mr O'Keefe stated that in the last year of the Fraser Government spending on roads was $690m. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and be kind to him: he must have got his figures wrong when he claimed that the Hawke Government had doubled spending in the first year. It did not double spending. Spending increased by 29 per cent but the fuel levy increased by 42 per cent at that stage. Road funding by this Government in 1988-89 is 7 per cent less in real terms than under the Fraser Government in 1982-83, even though the fuel levy is 132 per cent more than in 1982-83.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr O'Keefe sought to know why 2,000 trucks per night use the Hume Highway when a standard gauge railway line is running alongside it. I believe I have already given that answer. We must ensure that rail is run by private enterprise and get away from the work practices that this Government perpetuates in eternity in this and other places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Returning to the section of the Bill on roads, the Bill sets up three new transport funding programs-the provincial cities and rural highways program, the road safety black spots program and public transport projects. These programs are, of course, in addition to the existing programs for national highways, national arterial roads and State arterial roads. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me is that under this Bill funding for State arterials will cease, yet the category is to be left in place. I am sure that the position is left open for any Minister during an election to use that as a lollipop jar. I believe that the black spots program, which is worth $120m, was an off-the-cuff decision made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) leading up to the Federal election campaign. That program was announced as a result of the big vehicle accidents on the eastern seaboard. Honourable senators will remember that the program was opposed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at the time, and we know what has happened to it since. Of course, that brought in the `jealousy tax' that I have mentioned before on vehicles worth over $43,000 retail. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill allows ministerial discretion on top of ministerial discretion on top of ministerial discretion. The Bill simply allows the Minister to do virtually what he likes when he likes, especially at election time. I believe this Bill will play havoc with the transport industry and that those ministerial discretions ought to be eliminated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin by saying through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to Senator Panizza, that the opportunity for ministerial discretion is not confined simply to Federal Ministers, and examples of pork-barrelling are also not confined to activities of Federal Ministers. As the name suggests, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill 1990 is primarily a roads Bill. However, this Bill also makes provision for urban public transport and for rail development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats feel that the areas of public transport and rail require significantly greater support from the Federal Government and believe that these areas should, in the not too distant future, be the subject of separate legislation. Since 1950 the total length of Australian roads has remained relatively constant at about 800,000 kilometres. Over that same period, however, the number of vehicles on our roads has steadily risen from fewer than 800,000 to over nine million, at the time of the last Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of motor vehicle usage in September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there has been a marked increase in the number of articulated trucks on our roads over the last two decades with their freight task growing fourfold between 1971 and 1988. Trucks have also been allowed to increase their gross vehicle masses and therefore increase axle loads. This has led to sharp increases in the wear and tear of Australia's roads, many of which were never designed to carry an all-up weight of 42.5 tonnes-a limit introduced in the eastern States at the bidding of the Federal Government in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1980s there has also been a marked increase in long distance coach travel. The build-up of heavy vehicles over recent years operating on our inadequate road system contributed to the two tragedies that occurred late last year on the Pacific Highway claiming no fewer than 55 lives. At the same time as increasing calls on the Federal Government to make more of the funds collected from fuel taxes available to road works, there are pressures to contract fuel levies. We have seen calls for the Federal Government to reduce its fuel tax in the wake of increased oil prices following the present Middle East crisis. As world oil prices go up and our own domestic supplies of oil go down, it will become increasingly harder for the Federal Government to maintain its taxation of oil relative to its cost price. </PARA>
<PARA> This will make it more important to look to other forms of revenue for road maintenance and construction. In the future, this may include some form of congestion pricing for cars in the central areas of our major cities. Alternative funding mechanisms should most certainly include mass distance charges for heavy trucks and buses. But to blame all of our road problems on trucks, however, would be to miss the point. We must also be looking at demand management for car use in cities and this will require significantly improved urban public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> A further reason for improved public transport and rail networks is the need to both conserve liquid fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Work by Dr Peter Newman and others at Murdoch University shows that our major cities are wasteful by world standards in the fuel usage per capita. Added to this problem are reports that despite some improvements in recent years, the fuel usage of the average Australian car of about 9 litres per 100 kilometres is higher than the average American car which uses only 8 litres. We have too many cars moving drivers simply to and from work in congested cities where the cars are being left to sit in car parks all day. This is clearly when people should be using public transport which is far more energy efficient at peak loadings than cars carrying one person only, but in order to do that we have to have efficient public transport systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The old policies enshrined both in the Australian centennial roads development legislation and the amendment Bill before us today place an overemphasis on roads, provide inadequate funding for urban public transport and rail and need to be reassessed. Despite the overwhelming importance of the need for improved public transport and the Government's claim to recognise this need, the Bill we are debating has limited provisions with only $55m for 1990-91 and a mere $200m over three years for the urban public transport program. These amounts compare poorly with previous allocations made in the 1970s, and Senator Panizza used a similar comparison. I have a table detailing these allocations under the Urban Public Transport Agreement 1973-78 and the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

While the Government boasts of its commitment to public transport we can see from this table that the allocation of the $55m for the coming year is, in real terms, only one-half and, in some cases, only one-third of the allocations to public transport made between 1974 and 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The value of the large grants given in the 1970s was clearly demonstrated by its inducement to the Queensland Government to electrify Brisbane's suburban railways. When the first line was electrified in 1979, patronage of the Brisbane rail system had fallen to a low 29 million passengers. By the time of completion of electrification in 1988, patronage had risen to 45 million people a year and it is now approaching 50 million. This shows that people will use modern reliable public transport if it is available. </PARA>
<PARA> This figure of $230m, which the Democrats proposed in their alternative Budget, is insignificant when compared with the total Australian investment in motor vehicles estimated by the Inter-State Commission (ISC) of some $14 billion. Because of the level of imports in the motor vehicle industry, much of this enormous expenditure is a charge against our balance of payments. Added to this expenditure on motor vehicles is a further $5 billion a year on roadworks, $6 billion for road crash trauma, $2 billion for road congestion and an ISC estimate of $1.3 billion for noise and air pollution. Where such enormous costs are involved, more economically and environmentally efficient alternatives do need to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the provisions in the current Bill for main line rail upgrading, like the Government's past record in the area of rail, are totally inadequate. There is a need for a commitment from all parties for ongoing Federal support to bring our rail system up to modern standards which is capable of efficiently supporting both export oriented industry and interstate freight and passenger movements. As a former Prime Minister, Mr Gough Whitlam, recently said in connection with Federal initiatives, the 1980s were a lost decade for rail. </PARA>
<PARA> When discussing rail matters, too often we find emphasis on deficits, poor management and work practices. Senator Parer, like the shadow land transport Minister in the lower House, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), referred to a $3 billion rail deficit. Our understanding is that the deficit over all rail for 1987-88 was just $16m, according to the Industries Assistance Commission in its report last year on Government non-tax charges. While there is scope for smaller deficits, it needs to be noted that productivity has improved. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent report the Rail Industry Council noted that the work force had fallen from 114,000 in 1979 to 79,000 in 1990. But, during this same period of time, the rail freight task increased over 30 per cent. We need to take combined action to remove some of the real problems that limit rail efficiency. These problems include: five different rail systems operating interstate passenger trains as well as freight trains; three different gauges; a multiplicity of unions and awards; main line interstate tracks in New South Wales with steep grades, sharp curves and tight clearances; and last, but certainly not least, a heavily subsidised interstate road freight industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To run freight trains with modern intermodal capability of double stacked containers, one needs a good track with gentle grades, easy curves and good clearances. The only interstate links in Australia meeting these requirements are Adelaide to Perth, and Adelaide to Alice Springs. Coupled with good management on the part of Australian National and Westrail, rail has a high modal share on these corridors. It is essential that the other corridors linking Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are upgraded to what is now called fast freight train (FFT) standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent example of upgrading in Australia to FFT standard was that by Queensland Railways between Brisbane and Rockhampton. The result is that freight trains formerly of only 750 tonnes and taking 15 hours or more to travel between these cities are now of 1,250 tonnes and take just 12 hours. These savings make rail freight more competitive and the benefits to rail passengers are also obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this rail track alignment upgrading was about $90m. Most of this cost was in the four major deviations, one of which was at Eumundi north of Nambour near the Sunshine Coast. Here a section with steep grades and sharp curves was replaced by 10 kilometres of track with a gentle gradient and easy curves for a cost of about $20.5m. That is roughly $2m per kilometre through difficult country. Compare this with $151m for a 32-kilometre deviation of the Hume Highway over the Cullerin ranges between Goulburn and Yass at an average of $4.7m per kilometre. </PARA>
<PARA> The new train services between Brisbane and Rockhampton have attracted more passengers. Operating costs are held down with modern equipment and driver-only operation. Even though new day services were introduced, passengers still have the option of overnight trains with sleeping cars. We now see the Federal Government and Australian National, despite this evidence from the Queensland situation, trying to withdraw trains linking Adelaide to Whyalla, Broken Hill and Mount Gambier. Rather than doing this, Australian National should be getting direction and financial support from both the Commonwealth and South Australian governments to buy new trains and to run them efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the formation of the National Rail Freight Corporation by 1 July 1991, with the support of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premiers, is most welcome, as I have already said, infrastructure investment is also needed. This was identified by the national freight initiative (NFI) as costing at a very minimum $178m, being $80m for freight terminals in our five mainland State capitals, plus $98m for very basic track work. NFI also gave cost estimates for Adelaide to Melbourne gauge standardisation at $250m and for bringing Sydney-Melbourne to modern FFT standards at an extra $210m. The Democrats regard these two major works as absolutely essential and note the total NFI capital works package as costing $630m. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost effectiveness of this total package is clear when one considers that it would, with efficient operations, eliminate a $300m a year deficit on interstate rail freight operations. In doing that it would also lead to reduced road wear and tear, reduced road trauma, savings in liquid fuel and less pollution. The savings in total transport costs that can result from having more freight on rail have been noted by many authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to Senator Panizza that I am using my share of the two hours; it is being divided only between myself and Senator Spindler. These costs were examined for the Melbourne-Sydney corridor in the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies working paper of Dr Phillip Laird, published in May 1990 by the Australian National University. Dr Laird's paper stated that no fewer than 37 lives were lost in road crashes involving articulated trucks on the Hume Highway in 1988-89 for the movement between Sydney and Melbourne of about five million tonnes of road freight. The paper noted that rail freight is now at a level of about two million tonnes a year and it states that, if rail were upgraded and won the right to carry five million tonnes a year, still leaving two million tonnes for road transport, there would be a saving in total transport costs of about $100m a year. That is a $100m saving between Sydney and Melbourne alone. Further, there would be savings in liquid fuel of about 70 million litres a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst these are initial estimates only, they clearly show potential gains far too important to ignore. The Democrats see a need for the Government to indicate and legislate for ongoing main line upgrading. Such upgrading should not be restricted to interstate main lines, but should also allow for export main lines such as the completion of the Maldon-Port Kembla railway. </PARA>
<PARA> Other rail-related matters in need of Government commitment include a need for an evaluation of rail infrastructure and the establishment of a land transport research centre, as noted in the September 1990 communique of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. Finally, the Federal Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics needs to increase its research output on rail and rail-related matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with Senator Panizza that it is wrong to take things off roads and put them on to rail. I agree that there is a place for both. But I also make the point that this Government-and we have had eight years of previous Labor governments-has not shown a genuine commitment to improving the fate of rail in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleagues have said, the Liberal and National parties generally support the thrust of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill 1990, in particular the part to increase Commonwealth Government funding of road transport programs throughout the nation. For some time there has been an enormous realisation throughout the community of the rip-offs that the Government gets from excise levies on fuel. There has been a wish that some of this be ploughed back into the roads that so badly need it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years the fuel excise has increased from around 6.155c per litre when this Government came into power to about 24.9c per litre now. In that time, with the tax rip-off rising by almost 18c, the amount that the Commonwealth has used to fund road construction has only risen from about 4.5c per litre in Fraser's day to about 5.8c per litre now. </PARA>
<PARA> A major campaign was launched prior to the last election by the Local Government Association of Queensland and its counterparts in other States, and also by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland and its counterparts in other States, calling upon all political parties to increase funding by something in the order of 2c per litre to bring it up to about 7.8c per litre. The Liberal and National parties promised in their election campaigns to increase funding by 2c, but it was not matched by the Government. The Government was, however, moved by this pressure from these organisations and from the Liberal Party to make some commitment. Halfway through the campaign the Australian Labor Party (ALP) changed its policy, because of public pressure, and promised $500m over the next three years. The Liberal Party's policy would have given $1 billion over the next three years for road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be pointed out that it is probably fair that those people who use the roads the most-that is, the ones who buy all the petrol-should pay an extra amount for the roads they use, but so little of the fuel excess going back into roads simply means that those of us who live in areas far removed from the capital cities where we must have road transport are paying more tax to the general revenue. We buy so much more petrol and we pay so much more tax. That is not too bad if that tax goes back into road funding, but unfortunately it does not; it goes into the general coffers. This means that the people of rural and regional Australia are ripped off again-and this Government, I suggest, does that with relish. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill incorporate three new road funding programs, but a fourth major measure of the Bill is to abolish the allocation of funds to the State arterial roads category. That can mean horrific cuts in funding for many State arterial roads throughout this nation. I am particularly concerned that in Queensland a large number of kilometres of very major roads that fell into the State arterial category used to be funded by the Federal Government. Following the adoption of this Bill, that will no longer be the case because I understand that all those roads which used to be funded by the State arterial roads program will now have to be funded from general State revenue without any increase to the States in the form of general grants for State arterial roads. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned that in north Queensland, where I come from, many of the major roads will no longer be funded under the State arterial roads program. I will mention just a few of them. They are: the Gregory development road from Charters Towers to The Lynd; many roads in the Thuringowa area: the Herveys Range road which runs from Townsville to the west; and the Bowen to Collinsville road, which is a very major road and has received a lot of Commonwealth funding under the State arterial roads program. All of those projects now will not be getting this sort of funding and will have to be funded from State funds. But the States, unfortunately, will not be getting any increased road funding in this general category to fund those programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The three new categories are the provincial cities and rural highways program, which will apply to roads that are not national highways, but which do offer potentially large returns in terms of transport efficiency. I am aware that the road between Richmond and Hughenden on the Flinders Highway is being put up for that program, and I certainly hope it does receive the nod for funding under that program. There are a lot of other roads in north Queensland that well deserve funding from that provincial cities and rural highways program, but I understand that they are not going to get the nod. They include the very important Kararamanga road which bypasses Cairns and, as I have mentioned, the road from Charters Towers to The Lynd; the Bowen-Collinsville road; and the Herveys Range road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are very important roads and they in fact mean a lot to the wealth of this country because they bring cattle and other products to the ports. They should be funded but they will not be because, of course, the Minister has the discretion and one wonders how he is going to use that discretion. Following the election promises of the Australian Labor Party, a new program is being introduced to fund the black spots-the roads with bad safety records. The third program, which I will not even touch on, is the one relating to capital expenditure for urban public transport. But the $505m being provided over the three years is in addition to existing payments to that fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have very grave reservations about certain aspects of this Bill. The first is about the discretion of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). Senator Parer and Senator Panizza have mentioned that discretion. We are left with the Federal Minister to use his discretion on where these funds are to be spent. But I think that is the same Minister who, just before the last election, decided to have the maritime surveillance centre put into his electorate so that he might retain his seat. That was done purely for political pork-barrelling. Is this the same Minister who is now going to exercise his discretion on where funds are to be spent throughout Australia? It seems to me that he is just going to use it to prop up the oncers who got into the other House in the last election. It is probably fortunate that there is a oncer in Kennedy, because maybe we will get some funding out in that seat to try to prop him up. Of course, he will only be there for three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course he does. By the same token, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), who has been around for a little while, will not be there after the next election. But one of the good things, I suppose, is that this Minister will try to put some funds into Leichhardt, into Herbert, which the current honourable member (Mr Lindsay) will lose, into Kennedy and even into Capricornia, that is, if the ALP still has a member there, because I think he is fiddling around with the factions and will probably end up with Australian Democrats by the time the next election comes around. But at least we might get some funding there. However, it is rather horrific to think that this Minister is going to have the discretion to do all of these sorts of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wanted to say a lot of things on this Bill, but the Government's guillotining is just atrocious. I can understand why it does not want full discussion on these Bills. It does not want the people of Australia to know how it has stuffed things up in the past and how it will, we believe, not do it properly in the future. I did just briefly wish to recommend the amendments that Senator Parer will be moving on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> I also just wanted to briefly touch on another aspect of the Bill which requires the Minister's permission for toll roads to be built throughout Australia. Talking of toll roads reminds me of the Sunshine Coast toll road in Queensland. The Labor Party, before the last Queensland election, promised to abolish the toll that the previous Government had imposed on that road. It promised it and promised it. It won the election, and what did it do? It continued it immediately. It just shows that, when the ALP starts talking about road funding, it cannot be believed at all. I understand that Senator Spindler is going to move an amendment so that $250m will be spent on some Victorian road. I suggest that money should not be spent in Victoria, but should be put into the Queensland tollway. An amount of $100m is all that is needed, and the Labor Government up there could take it all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I must inform Senator Kernot that he has cribbed about $80m. Senator Kernot, as a good Queenslander, will not support that ridiculous amendment from Senator Spindler. I do know that the ALP will do anything to try to prop up that Government in Victoria because, boy, does it need propping up. What did the ALP get in Victoria-24 per cent! The Government will have to spend all of the road funds in Victoria just to try to buy the Victorian voters off. But it will not work, of course. The Victorian voters have the Government's measure, and it will go out. Why Senator Spindler and the fourth wing of the Labor Party here want to try to help the Government buy off the Victorian voters is beyond me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, in the very restricted time that I have because of the Government's guillotining, can I just say how terrible it is that, in this new federalism that was spoken about at the Special Premiers Conference, the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is now trying to give himself the power to direct where all the funds are spent. That will mean setting up yet another Commonwealth Government bureaucracy. The infrastructure is already there. All of the States have it. They have their engineers; they have their programs; they have their officers; and they have their planning organisations. Now we are going to set up yet another one, increase the bureaucracy here and increase the number of people in Canberra earning these huge moneys down here in this ivory tower. That does not need to be done because it is already in place in the States, and it is a matter of some regret that that has happened. The idea of the Bill giving more money to road funding is good, but the way it is being done is typical of this Government's administration of all of the things that it tries to administer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald's speech will be a hard act to follow and I offer him my congratulations. As has been said by previous speakers, this Bill comes here into the Senate under the guillotine. But it also was pushed through under the guillotine in the House of Representatives. I think that the Minister for Land Transport, Mr Brown, should have been prepared to discuss this Bill. Indeed, he should have been prepared to stand up in the lower House and defend the Federal Government's performance or lack of performance in relation to road and rail funding. But this was not the case and perhaps, when we look at the Government's disgraceful record, it is easy to understand why it is not so keen to be subjected to the sort of scrutiny that it would have been subjected to in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen the Labor Government use the petrol bowsers of this country as a milking cow for its election promises. Obviously, Labor has not given the same priority to road funding which the coalition has. As has been said by previous speakers-I think Senator Parer mentioned this, but it bears repeating-since Labor has come to power road funding has fallen by over 27 per cent in real terms. This is a fact which the Government cannot hide. At the same time, hypothecated fuel excise as a proportion of total fuel taxes has fallen from well over 50 per cent to under 25 per cent and petrol excise has risen to nearly 25c per litre. This situation has had a crippling effect upon petrol prices and upon goods and services which must be transported by rail. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, the General Manager of the Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania, Mr Dennis Nation, was prompted to call upon the Government to reduce the amount of excise on fuel as a counter to balance the Government's recent windfall gains. Mr Nation argued that in 1986-87 when world oil prices were at a low level this Government had a Budget shortfall in revenue from petrol excise. It therefore decided to increase the level of excise to bring its Budget into line. Unfortunately, however, the situation has not been reversed and the Government has thereby benefited from unreasonably high fuel tax rates whilst the world parity price for oil is artificially high. This effect doubles when the consumer price index (CPI) formula is applied to the excise component on petrol, thereby ensuring that the Federal Government simply cannot lose. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also remember that there is a resource tax on crude oil which is paid for by the oil producer and every time the price of crude oil increases by $1 per barrel this Federal Government benefits to the tune of an extra $60m to $100m. When the Budget was prepared in August the expectation was that the price of a barrel of oil would be about $23, but since then it has been as high as $40. So the windfall to the Government would be about $1 billion to $1.7 billion during a full 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, petrol excise was a mere 10c a litre and, as I mentioned earlier, it is now approaching 27c a litre. These costs have all been passed on to the motorist. In my own capital city of Hobart the maximum wholesale price of petrol rose by almost 20c a litre over the three month period to October. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an inescapable fact that higher petrol prices add to inflation and that their contribution to a rising CPI forces workers to demand wage increases which exacerbate that spiral. The coalition has always believed that more of the fuel taxes paid by motorists should be returned to road users in the form of better roads and during the 1990 election campaign the coalition pledged to increase road funding by $1,000m. This was to be funded by directly increasing the amount of fuel excise hypothecated to roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Other people in our community are very concerned about this matter. I took the trouble to look at the annual address by the President of the Australian Automobile Association, Professor Peter Scott-a very distinguished Tasmanian. He talked about the price of fuel and the windfall gains it has provided for this Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the Government has since displayed a disappointing reluctance to take further action to ease the burden, steadfastly refusing to surrender the substantial windfall tax gains it stands to make from higher oil prices. </PARA>
<PARA>I happened to notice in that document an advertisement that was placed by the Australian Automobile Association during the last election campaign. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>LABOR POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Over the next three years they promise to spend an extra $420 million. </PARA>
<PARA>COALITION POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Over the next three years they promise to spend an extra $1,035 million. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of politics have got the message as to just how important roads are. When people were surveyed during the last election campaign the results showed that roads rated higher than health and environment issues. But as far as this Government is concerned the roads issue sits down at the bottom of the barrel. It has taken a series of catastrophic bus accidents to prompt this Government to take the issue of road funding seriously. Over the years it has been prepared to stand idly by and watch our road networks slowly deteriorate. For the first time motoring organisations are able to ensure that roads are placed high in the priorities of the political agendas of all major parties, as I have just demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> As previous speakers have said, we do not have a lot of time to talk about these issues, but the coalition quite willingly supports a number of areas in this Bill. In particular, we are pleased to see some increases in the funding of our transport system. However, we do have some genuine concerns about the manner in which this Bill, in its present form, allows the Minister considerable discretion. That has been pointed out by previous speakers in no uncertain terms. We believe there should be a better definition of the way in which money is allocated. As an example of this, funding for State arterials will cease at the end of the year, as Senator Macdonald said, but the category is to remain, which will enable the Minister to transfer funds on a discretionary basis from other categories to State arterials where individual States are judged to have needs in this area. There is no doubt that this situation politicises the whole area, and that is a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's record on road funding is disgraceful. In summary, I repeat what I mentioned earlier: the coalition does not disagree with the broad thrust of this Bill, but we have placed before the Senate a number of very clear amendments which will reduce the power of the Minister to determine road funding purely at his own discretion and which will also ensure that any State which wishes to apply a toll on a road where there is some Federal funding should be able to do so on the basis that a proportion of that toll is returned to the Federal Government. These amendments and the other measures which will be advanced by my colleague Senator Parer will go some way towards negating the Federal Government's neglect of our land transport system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill 1990. I believe there is no doubt that road funding is becoming increasingly critical to Australia as the consequences of the Government's continual cutbacks become more and more apparent. These consequences do not show up in the short term. They occur progressively as a result of lower maintenance standards and an inability to increase the capacity of the road system to meet growing demand. Ultimately, they produce higher vehicle operating costs, less efficient industries and more road deaths and injuries, I regret to say. It is the roads which support the industries that generate the nation's wealth. Australia is a nation on wheels with a road network that is vital to all Australians. Indeed, it is the vital basis of our economy. Road funding should reflect this and it deserves our support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill is being introduced under circumstances where funding has seriously declined. Never before has any government been so short-sighted as to continually reduce expenditure levels on road funding over a number of years. I am pleased to see that the Government has come to recognise its lack of foresight and is trying to correct this disastrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to read in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that transport reform in Australia would mean an increase of approximately 3 per cent in the gross domestic product. I am sure that this is very important for the greater efficiency of the economy, and anything that will improve our productivity will of course be welcomed by all Australians. I am sure that this sudden change of heart is also because the public has been demanding that something be done. It is demanding it because of the high cost of freight, the damage that is caused to vehicles, the loss of life upon the roads, and the deplorable state of our roads. Unprecedented publicity campaigns have shown the seriousness of the situation at a grassroots level. I want to quote from a number of articles about the state of the roads in rural Queensland. The first article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Lack of road funding is an insult to every travelling motorist. It is an insult to our intelligence to get so little back from our fuel tax for our roads.</PARA>
<PARA>The second article states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfair that people in the most productive areas of Australia have to put up with deteriorating roads while money for roads is lavished on Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>The third article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian motorists have been duped for paying high fuel taxes with only a small percentage being returned to road funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Cuts have had a major impact, particularly in country areas. A State-wide survey by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland found that country roads are so rough that motorists are often forced to drive on the shoulders rather than on the potholed bitumen. It found that many roads become impassable when it rains and that they are deteriorating more rapidly than city and shire councils can repair them. Declining road standards have resulted in a high cost of wear and tear on transport vehicles which is then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This is highly ridiculous when one realises that much of Australia's export and financial income is created outside the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> As fewer road works are commenced, fewer jobs become available in road construction and maintenance. This has had a particularly detrimental effect on employment opportunities in many provincial and rural centres. I have been reading about this quite recently in our local paper in South Burnett about the number of people in the councils in South Burnett who have had to be put off because of the lack of road funding. A safe, reliable road network is of fundamental importance to our nation's economy. Poor roads serve only to isolate communities, increase fuel consumption, damage vehicles and increase the cost of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is really serious about making industry more efficient, improving road safety and easing traffic congestion, it has no option but to increase funding. That is why it is interesting to hear for the first time the Minister acknowledging the impact of road funding on our productivity. Yet it is a fact that there have been reductions in real expenditure on road funding by Canberra in every year this Government has been in office. In real terms, the amount of money going into roads has fallen by something like 27 per cent since 1984. It is not a very pretty record. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Australian centennial roads development program and the Australian land transport program by the Government was a smokescreen as road funding was reduced again and again at Federal level. That is why I say that we have reached the period when, for the development of Australia, we have to look to better ways to approach our general transport system throughout the countryside. While there is no doubt some very useful things are provided for in this Bill-I support especially an increase in funding for our transport system and, in particular, our roads-the fact is that this Bill, as it is written, gives the Minister an enormous amount of discretion in the way that he spends this money. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about whether this is the most efficient way to tackle the reform of our transport system. The Commonwealth Minister-whoever he might be-upon the advice of his department will select certain jobs to be done, certain black spots or certain national arterial roads, as we used to term them; the Minister himself will actually select the jobs. This concerns me greatly because I believe that State departments of main roads, or whatever they call themselves, are pretty efficient organisations. I worked for a main roads department for 13 or more years before I married, and I know quite a deal about it. They have their finger on the pulse as to where the bad roads are; they have a regular assessment of the needs of their particular States, whether they be for transport to port works or to industries in major towns, rural areas or the capital of the State. My concern about the legislation is whether the States will have their say. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to this, the Minister for transport in the Northern Territory said that Commonwealth discretionary powers in relation to road funding should be lessened rather than strengthened. I think this is a very important approach. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>It should be the Federal Minister's preserve to approve such program details as those for the black spot program. It is not appropriate that a Federal minister should place himself in the position of approving small projects to the value of around $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA>This is but one example of what is inhibiting Australia's progress in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I say to this Government that it is well past the time when it should indulge in some forward planning in the transport industry. The band-aid approach to problems as they arise is not good enough. It is not possible to speak in this debate, where the guillotine has been applied, to all the proposals mentioned in the Bill by the Government. I support the Opposition's amendments, which will help to improve the Bill as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time allotted for me to speak on the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill, I will not be able to go through all the matters that I would like to mention, and much of this has been covered by previous speakers. Therefore, I will concentrate on two issues that are of great concern to me. The first matter is the introduction, in terms of our transport system, of cross-subsidisation. I find it incredible that by implementing cross-subsidisation, this Government will keep the featherbedding which has existed in our transport industries for many years. Nobody argues about the necessity to improve our transport systems; nobody argues about the need for more funding into our rail or road systems, but the Government has adopted a position which defies all economic logic by basing its policy primarily on cross-subsidisation. For many years the rail systems in this country have paid fuel excise which has gone into general revenue or into road building. We now have a ludicrous situation where we are doing just the opposite; it is going to do nothing to address the fundamental problems which exist there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In talking about the road system, the first thing one has to do is to look at the allocation in terms of the moneys that have been raised from the fuel levy. It has been outlined by other speakers that with the Hawke Government the amount going back into roads has dropped from 50 per cent to approximately 25 per cent. That in itself really tells the story of the problem that we have so far as the funding for roads is concerned. That is a particular area that should be addressed as far as funding is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take that a little further and examine the whole issue of road funding charges, we have to acknowledge that the transport industries, road and rail, are really the communication of industry in Australia and they are one of the most important things in terms of getting costs down to make us competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> To begin with, we have an enormous cross-subsidisation into general revenue from road users which militates against efficiency. Now we are going to see that being exacerbated by a cross-subsidy to the rail system. The answer in terms of the rail system is not to cross-subsidise it but to take some of the burdens it has off its back, as I mentioned, by first removing the fuel excise that rail pays. We have to look very carefully at the lack of funding that has occurred there to allow the rail system to be a modern rail system in comparison with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got to look at the industrial encumbrances which exist in the rail system and have held it back. I am sure Senator McKiernan will agree with me that the changes that have been made in the rail system in Western Australia have created a much more efficient rail system than we had a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now seeing the benefit of those changes to the Western Australian rail system where, for example, road and rail grain freight charges have dropped significantly over the last seven to 10 years. Those benefits have also been brought about by the introduction of competition between road and rail transport on the fringes and competitive charges. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate concerns what has been described as the war chest or the slush fund or whatever else we may call it. The Opposition is to move amendments to this legislation. I challenge the honourable senators opposite and the Australian Democrats to support these amendments, which are all about disciplining government spending and imposing some rules in that regard. In Victoria and Western Australia, for example, such discipline has not applied. Some very shameful and corrupt expenditure decisions have been made in those States. </PARA>
<PARA> I am absolutely amazed that the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill seeks to give one Minister discretion over the spending of $500m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak on the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill 1990. It was about two years ago that I rose to speak on the same topic and, again, the legislation was rushed through under a guillotine. It is important to address this issue as a senator because as we travel around our own States we see the appalling state of the infrastructure of our transport system, especially in Victoria, and we see the damage that is causing. We are constantly being told by farmers and small manufacturers in rural and regional areas the problems they have and the costs that they are incurring as a result of transporting their goods and services on poor roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the three new programs which are included in this Bill and which were announced in the last Budget have merit, as we have come to expect with this Government's legislation they have problems-problems which I want to outline. Funding for these new projects will not necessarily be tied to fixed State shares. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) will determine eligible projects. The Minister has sole discretion to decide which State gets the funding and for what purpose. What a handy little pot of money that will be when we come to the next election. It amounts to some $505m of road funds available to the Minister to be used at his discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The provincial cities and rural cities highways program was originally intended to be funded from the sales tax on luxury cars or $100m, whichever was greater. However, we see no mention of this in the Bill. This was obviously another election gimmick, or the Government will not make $100m on its sales tax. Funds from the provincial cities and rural cities highways program may also be used for priority improvements to maintain rail systems. There is no mention in the Bill of how much money can be allocated from the trust to the railways. Again, it is left to ministerial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no objection to a greater amount of funding being allocated to this area but we believe that this should be a matter for a separate piece of legislation. If we look at micro-economic reform in the area of transport we find that the Government could have gone a lot further. Only two weeks ago the Bureau of Industry Economics released a detailed account of the cost benefits accruing from micro-reform for the six years from 1989 to 1995. The Bureau said in the report that it expected rail transport to produce the biggest gains, amid overall reforms in transport. But here we have the Government committing some small amount of money to a partial reform of the rail system, instead of introducing a separate piece of legislation that could have made some significant changes to that system. The Government has again squandered the opportunity of gaining some of the$6 billion boost to gross domestic product as outlined by the Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement of the road safety black spots program should be supported. But why has the Government taken so long to act? Better roads are safer roads. The Government's own Office of Road Safety has consistently outlined ways in which improvements to the road system can contribute to a reduction in road crashes. It is a pity that the Government has neglected its responsibilities in this area for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> The urban public transport program will increase the scope and level of assistance for urban public transport. For so long the residents of Australia's expanding outer metropolitan areas have been neglected. It did not come as a surprise to me that the Minister said that these areas have been neglected. I visit many shires throughout Victoria and I will give an example of a couple. </PARA>
<PARA> When I visited the Shire of Sherbrooke in the picturesque Dandenongs on the outskirts of Melbourne, I was told that the municipality had a severe lack of public transport. Census data for 1986 showed that 77 per cent of the Sherbrooke work force relied on car travel to the workplace. Many of the shire's main roads are being placed under great pressure due to the lack of alternative transport. An added problem is that a significant proportion of the main road system in the shire was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s when traffic loads and volumes were much lower than their present level. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of these roads require strengthening to cater for their increased loadings. The level of concern about the standard of some of the roads has meant that these roads have been ripped up and returned to gravel, which makes them much safer than the pothole ridden roads. But this is not going to create viable and sustainable infrastructure in those developing areas. This situation is not confined to the Shire of Sherbrooke. </PARA>
<PARA> In the City of Werribee, which I have visited a number of times-and I am mentioning both these areas because they are the two fastest expanding local government areas in our State-an extensive transport plan has been undertaken to indicate the possible future direction when planning for the development of one of the municipality's major infrastructures, that of transport. The chief engineer and some of the councillors spent half the day driving me around some of the treacherous roads in that locality. One of the most notable things in the plan that they put forward and talked to me about on that visit was the size of the gap between the funds available to the shire and the funds required to undertake the projects identified. There is an enormous gap between the traditional sources of funding available to local government and the funds required to keep pace with the needs of a rapidly developing outer metropolitan municipality. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is necessary to set the record straight as to the coalition's record on road funding. The Fraser Government introduced the Australian bicentennial road development program in 1982. The full effects of this program were not felt in 1982-83, since the program operated for only a little over 10 months of that year. Road funding was boosted by around $440m per year as a result of this initiative, and this represented about a 50 per cent increase in road funding. I repeat that this increase was brought about by a coalition government. All the empty rhetoric that we hear from the Government benches about the boost that the Hawke Government gave to road funding in 1984 is utter nonsense. It was the effect of the initiative of the bicentennial road funding program. </PARA>
<PARA> In comparison, let us look at the Hawke Government's record. The introduction of the Australian land transport program was designed to index the hypothecated amount of excise to the consumer price index. However, the legislation was twice amended to reduce the hypothecated amount of the excise. The effect was to maintain the level of road funding in money terms only. Since then there has been a massive reduction in real levels of road funding. One only has to go to those shires to see the effect of that reduction in real levels of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government money going to roads has fallen by some 27 per cent. At the same time, we find the Government collecting massive amounts of revenue from petrol excise. In fact, Victorians are repaying in petrol excise for a promise, a commitment, that the then Premier made about the viability of Pyramid Building Society. On top of this exercise that the Federal Government is putting on, we are paying for an error made by Mr Cain. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are pretty used to the taxing exploits of the world's greatest recession inventor. Fuel excise as a proportion of total fuel taxes has fallen from well over 50 per cent to under 25 per cent and petrol excise has risen from about 6c per litre to nearly 25c per litre. In this Bill, the Government has failed to continue its commitment to index Australian centennial roads development (ACRD) funds to inflation. As fuel excise is automatically indexed, ACRD funds should be too. There should be a guaranteed level of funding in real terms for the next three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can look at roads. There is no vision. There is no understanding that if we had a proper road funding program-if we have capital investment rather than recurring non-capital funding-we would be at least investing our dollars for some reward. But we are not. The Budget figures show that capital funding as a percentage is declining every year under this Government. But in terms of recurrent non-capital expenditure and outlays, it is increasing. In other words, we are spending more consumer dollars and investing less in capital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For a modest example one only has to look at Western Australia back in the 1960s. We had a State Government that had the vision to open up the Kimberleys of Western Australia with those magnificent beef roads. It started a whole new industry. There were roads that went into the iron ore towns. Those roads created towns, societies and industries. This Government is so myopic, so blinkered, so lacking in vision, that it does not understand the great virtues of government expenditure in capital outlays. The Government squanders taxpayers' money in line with the whim and the wish of minority groups that dictate its political direction, which changes ever so quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> That contrasts very sharply with the Liberal Party's commitment prior to the last election. Senator Collins will say what I say privately to some of our people- `If it was such a good promise, why didn't you win?'. Let me say this: it is one of those outstanding commitments that was perhaps buried in the rhetoric of the campaign. We made a commitment not to spend but to invest a billion dollars on Australian roads over a three-year period. That was to revitalise land transportation and to create efficiencies in the economy. </PARA>

<PARA> This legislation provides a great deal of not only discretion for the Federal Minister but also a measure of blackmail wherein funding is provided under certain circumstances, as if to say that the States and the local governments do not have the intellectual capacity, the competence or the intrinsic natural understanding of what is wanted of them by their own constituents; as if they do not understand what is best for the people in their State or in their shire. That perhaps is the best example of why this Government is really so rudderless and lacking in leadership, understanding and sensitivity as to what the Australian people want and expect of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second I have left, I conclude by noting that the Australian Labor Party has reduced road funding by over 30 per cent in real terms since it came to office. Yet, as I think Senator Patterson said, the revenue from excise has risen dramatically. It has gone into the Government's coffers to be distributed under general revenue in a totally non-accountable way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In rising to speak to the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill 1990, I wish to confine my remarks to the amendment which I have circulated about one particular aspect of the Bill. The Bill seeks to switch $250m from the construction of a freeway, which funds I understand have been earmarked, to the construction of a railway through the Koonung and Mullum Mullum valleys instead. In doing so, I need to advert briefly to what Senator Macdonald has said. As usual, he was rather strong on abuse and weak on facts. He tried to imply that the amendment was designed to take money away from Queensland. In fact, it does nothing of the sort. It simply seeks to switch funds from one purpose to another, funds which have been earmarked for the State of Victoria for a given area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am speaking tonight for three organisations: the Public Transport Users Association, the Koonung Mullum Forestway Association and the Conservation Council of Victoria. They are merely the spearheads for about half a million people across the south-eastern corridor of metropolitan and suburban Melbourne, half a million people who are concerned to retain within their neighbourhood the last bit of original wilderness instead of having it buried under hundreds of tonnes of concrete. It has been demonstrated in numerous reports that there are at least 150 varieties of birds and over 100 varieties of shrubs and trees in that area. That is what people are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the fact that we are contrasting public transport with road transport, with all its attendant congestion, ill effects on health, the greenhouse effect, et cetera. I know that people on the Opposition side do not care about those matters. In answer to some earlier comments, I wish to say that when Don Chipp admonished us to keep the bastards honest, he meant the bastards on both sides of the chamber. Judging by recent performances, it will take a lot more for us to keep those on the opposition side honest than those on the other side. We shall be impartial on that, and we shall do our best for both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> In foreshadowing that I would move my amendment, I was pleased to get support from Mr Spyker, the Transport Minister in Victoria who thought it was a good move to put it on the table for the Federal Government to consider. I was also pleased to hear from the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) that he was prepared to consider that issue. I know that the amendment will be rejected but, if nothing else, it has put the issue on the table for further consideration. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) for provincial cities and rural projects-not more than 60% and not less than 55%;</PARA>

<PARA>I have canvassed the reasons for this amendment in the second reading debate. I know that we are constrained by time. Very briefly, this amendment fixes each State's share of funding along the lines suggested in Minister Beazley's second reading speech. It gives effect to commitments made by the Federal Government prior to and during the last election to introduce three new land transport funding programs, but it goes further by spelling out a formula for distribution of that funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will ensure that the additional amounts paid into the funds are applied to the program for which they were intended. Whilst permitting a degree of flexibility, it removes the Federal Mini- ster's absolute power to move funds between various land transport programs. If the Government is honest, it will agree to this amendment. It is totally in accordance with the spirit of the legislation and is moved by the Opposition because we believe that the Government is very likely in the lead-up to an election to target the funding in an inequitable fashion to help its mates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Temporary Chairman, the claim is nonsense. That has been demonstrated by the record of this Government over the last two years. I might add that there is no point in repeating the same argument in respect of most of the other amendments that will be moved because they are all directed to the same end. These points were made at length during the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the concept of this type of funding is not new. It was successfully employed with the national arterial roads category when the legislation was first introduced. The arguments are not new either. The Hansard will reveal that the Opposition raised the same pork-barrelling charges against the legislation to which the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill is an adjunct when it was first introduced two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is-and the State Ministers and Premiers know it-that that has not been the reality of the way in which this program has been administered. What is being directed by these proposals is a far more efficient and rational national system of transportation. There is a growing acceptance-thank goodness-by State leaders across the board, Labor and non-Labor, that this is the way to go. There are very tight guidelines attached to administering these programs. The programs are-again, thank goodness-being developed on a three-year basis by agreement and negotiation with the States. That is a very rational way of doing it, rather than handing out fixed shares allocated by legislation from year to year. It is precisely the way good government should be going. For that reason we oppose this amendment and indicate at this stage of the debate that we will be opposing the other Opposition amendments on the same grounds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on the adjournment tonight. I rise on the most fundamental of principles, and that is to defend a friend who has been maligned unfairly. I refer to recent events in the Parliament of New South Wales in Macquarie Street and specifically to allegations made by the New South Wales National Party to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These allegations concern Mr Barry Toomey, QC, who is an outstanding lawyer and is recognised as such at the Sydney Bar and, indeed, nationally. He is a great contributor to the legal profession. He is an individual of integrity and honour. For his pains, he also happens to be my senior counsel. He has successfully represented me on a number of occasions and I believe he will again in some matters pending. Mr Toomey also happens to be my friend, which causes me to rise tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a series of realities that apparently have caused some concerns within the New South Wales National Party. These concerns have boiled over into some outrageous allegations that Mr Toomey, in his capacity as counsel assisting the ICAC on the North Coast land deals, was unprincipled and biased. I have been critical of the ICAC and its methods on civil liberties grounds and where I believe those concerns are justified I will continue to express them, but no criticism ought to have been levelled at Mr Toomey. In my view, and I think in the view of all those who have observed, Mr Toomey, during the inquiry, behaved with absolute propriety. He certainly acted consistently with the principles laid down by the New South Wales Bar Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales National Party really has a problem with the outcome of the inquiry. It did emerge stained from it and the inquiry report was politically negative. There were some severe electoral consequences. There is no excuse for this outrageous personal attack made by the Chairman of the New South Wales National Party, Mr Doug Moppett, under the privilege of the New South Wales Parliament. This attack was made without checking any of the facts, made without courtesy and made without regard to accuracy. Certainly as a consequence, it was made without having regard to reputation. Mr Toomey has replied to this attack in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald and I seek leave to incorporate that letter into Hansard tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>12th December, 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Editor,</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney Morning Herald</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> In the SMH of 12.12.90 you reported that the chairman of the NSW National Party, Mr Doug Moppett, had claimed ``there was a view that the counsel assisting the ICAC during the [North Coast] hearings, Mr Barry Toomey, Q.C., was biased because he was a member of the Society of Labor Lawyers.''</PARA>
<PARA> In his written submission on behalf of the National Party to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ICAC, Mr Moppett used the words ``there have even been suggestions that Mr Toomey is or was at one time a member of the Society of Labor Lawyers . . . .''</PARA>
<PARA> In the manner of his kind he did not, of course, name those who had pointed the dagger at my professional integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that I am not and never have been a member of the Society of Labor Lawyers; nor have I ever been a member of any political party. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I have been a vocal and public critic of the existence of such a body as the Society of Labor Lawyers because I believe it is impossible to reconcile the stringent ethical rules which govern practice at the Bar with the partiality and subjective standards necessarily involved in public support of a political party. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed Mr Moppett's behaviour provides an object lesson in the way that truth is subverted for political ends. Because the National Party suffered, in his perception, at the hands of ICAC he is anxious to advance reasons why ICAC should be discredited. In a democratic society he is free to do so-the pity is that he chooses to use, under Parliamentary privilege, the methods of those who despise democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack on me which you reported was not the only one directed at me by Mr Moppett. However the other attack was based not only on misstatement of fact but on obvious ignorance of the rules of the NSW Bar Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most piquant feature of Mr Moppett's behaviour is that the attack was made without any attempt to check the facts with me. It would have been inconvenient, of course, for Mr Moppett to have been made aware that he was promulgating lies-that is, until after he had done so. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>Barry Toomey</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that letter Mr Toomey rebutted claims point by point. The most absurd allegation levelled at Mr Toomey was that he was a member of the Society for Labor Lawyers. Not only was Mr Toomey not a member of the Society; he has in fact been a critic of that body. In his view, politics ought not to intrude upon professional responsibilities. He has acted consistent with the strictures of the Bar Association. Mr Toomey is certainly entitled to his politics but he has kept them quite separate from his professionalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the inquiry, I think it is fair to say that he was professional and fair. He stood down from the inquiry where there could be a suggestion of a conflict of interest, but he did his job and that was perhaps uncomfortable for some. He demonstrated beyond doubt during the course of the inquiry that there had been questionable conduct by certain Ministers in the New South Wales Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The absurdity of the claims is best illustrated by simple anecdote. My lawyers, McClellands, in Sydney were approached by the Secretary of the New South Wales National Party, Ms Jenny Gardiner, for a copy of the judgment in which I was exonerated on the Harris-Daishowa matter. I was represented in that matter successfully by Mr Toomey. As a courtesy and an act of decency we gave that judgment to Ms Gardiner. The response has been, frankly, indecent. Increasingly, every elector in New South Wales has come to realise that. I agree with His Honour Mr Justice Adrian Roden's comments, which are eloquent and appropriate, on some of the remarks made by the Nationals over the past week or so. If there is any respect due an organisation, perhaps an apology would be called for. It is not appropriate in this circumstance. No respect may be afforded the organisation concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that Barry Toomey is a fine Australian and his detractors should be judged for the malice and hypocrisy with which they have acted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue I raise tonight is of considerable importance to public life in Western Australia and to our good name abroad. I refer to the continuation in office of Mr Brian Burke as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See and the propriety of his original appointment. It is also a concern that members of the Hawke Labor Government have shown far greater determination to safeguard the reputation of their Party than that of Australian public affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset, I make it clear that I am not making allegations of criminal behaviour. I agree that guilt in these matters should, if necessary, be determined in the courts. That is not the core of the problem. The issue at stake is one of propriety. The media have reported clear factual evidence, not mere allegations as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) keeps stating in his refusal to answer questions, that Brian Burke, as Premier of Western Australia, was a key player in a campaign of dirty tricks against political opponents and in the deception, which is slowly unravelling, of WA Inc-that adventure of which he is the clear, undisputed political patron. </PARA>
<PARA> I am stating firmly that the weight of evidence is such that a responsible government would review the suitability of such a person holding a diplomatic post. It is also fair to ask why such action has not been taken, given the knowledge of Ministers about the dirty tricks campaign and the duty of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to seek assurances from an ambassadorial appointee about his reputation and actions in public life. It has become a practice of the Hawke Labor Government not to follow the convention of standing people aside when a cloud hangs over their heads or for Ministers to resign when motions of censure have been carried by the Parliament. Accountability is not a word readily understood by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a matter of the coalition criticising a diplomat because he is a former senior Labor figure. Former members of Federal Parliament have held and are holding diplomatic posts. While we might on some occasions have queried whether they were the best person for the job, we do not criticise them for doing a job as an Australian representative. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about a person-namely, Brian Burke-who has actually been identified by name in diaries seized by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). This is not innuendo; this is fact. Mr Burke did not simply take an overseas appointment prior to retiring. Aged 40 when he stood down as Premier, it was reported as recently as 2 November this year that`Labor sources' in Western Australia had reaffirmed that he still plans to make a bid for Federal politics. The Prime Minister may be non-committal today about the prospect, but the 1988 appointment of Mr Burke to Dublin can be seen as an advancement of this exact goal. After all, it was the Prime Minister-Mr Robert James Lee Hawke-who insisted that his friend Brian be given the job in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 November Senator Tate, in ans- wer to my earlier questions, stated that he had been briefed no fewer than six times by the Australian Federal Police about the contents of the blue file marked `Govt', which was seized on 6 December 1988 from private investigator Robert Smith, who was subsequently tried and convicted of phone-tapping-not once, but twice. If those six briefings occurred `during 1988', the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) would have received concentrated information about the content of this material over a maximum period of the 25 days remaining in 1988-or was it in the six days before the Australian Federal Police charged Mr Smith? What could have been so devastating that the Minister had to be briefed six times in such a short period? It is also relevant to ask, given that Senator Tate as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs was given this information, what was known by the then Federal Attorney-General, Mr Bowen. Was he informed of the contents of the file? It would be surprising if he had not been informed. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely Senator Evans as Foreign Minister should have been informed of evidence that implicated an ambassador in past surveillance of political opponents. From his reactions in the Senate over recent weeks, he certainly gives the impression that he knows far more than he is prepared to say and he has not sought to deny that he knows much more. It does not mean very much for the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs to state that there was no reference to an actual breach of Federal legislation. I repeat: a person need not have been guilty of criminal conduct to have so debased his office of Premier as to be unfit to represent Australia overseas. It does not say very much for the concern of this Government for honest and open government generally that, when the Minister knew that the file had been passed on to the Commissioner of Police in Western Australia, he presumably never followed up the matter to find out why no action was taken. He would say that action had been taken with regard to breaches of Federal legislation, and that is true. However, are we to believe that absolutely no mention was made to him during his six briefings over a matter of days that the file contained politically explosive mat- erial detrimental to the State Labor Government?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate has refused to answer my question about why all the documents seized by the Australian Federal Police in the raid on Mr Smith were not on the property seizure record. Probably what is worse is that Senator Tate also refused to obtain an answer. Why? Are we therefore to presume that it is now to become standard procedure for the AFP or is the Minister willing to give the Senate an answer in an effort to uphold the good name and reputation of the AFP? Successive Premiers and an array of Labor politicians have, until recently when the pressure became too great, refused pointblank to hold a royal commission into these and other allegations surrounding Mr Burke and WA Inc. Never mind the damage to the political and corporate reputation of Western Australia: just cover up Labor dirty tricks and linen at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence which has arisen since the conviction of Robert Smith is damning. During 1987, the last year of Brian Burke's premiership, diaries show that Mr Burke, his brother Terry-a former Cabinet Secretary-and Brian Burke's driver and personal assistant, Vince Shervington, were actively involved in a campaign of surveillance of political opponents. The same Premier who on 15 March 1987 wrongly accused the State Leader of the Opposition of keeping him under surveillance was later that same month, according to the Smith diaries-I repeat: this is not innuendo; it is fact-to order an investigation of the business dealings of Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly Ross Lightfoot. Such was the punishment to be meted out to those daring to unmask WA Inc. </PARA>
<PARA> It says something for the integrity of those so investigated that Mr Burke was unable to do more than make generalised and unfounded allegations in Parliament about `bottom of the harbour' scams. This is the guy who will sue anyone if there is a buck in it. Indeed, all efforts to smear Mr Lightfoot came unstuck when it was revealed in the Smith diary on 9 April 1987 that `NO JOY' had been found in respect of the investigations of Ross Lightfoot. It is equally apparent that the operation was a determined exercise to attempt to destroy the reputations of Mr Lightfoot and the former Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Ian Laurence. Smith was even asked to check on all known associates of the two gentlemen in question in a vain attempt to besmirch their names. The sleazy, clandestine nature of the `BB' investigations is made obvious by the fact that this work was paid for independently of the $133,600 that Smith formally received under his supposed security contract with the Department of the Premier and Cabinet from March 1987 to December 1988. The coincidence of dates for both operations should not go unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australians would like to know-and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should make it his business to find out-exactly who paid Robert Smith for his dirty tricks spying at $45 per hour for sometimes as long as 15 hours a day. One may well ask how Smith had the time to do the tasks for which he was officially being paid. The money trail on 26 May 1987 points to Darcy Farrell, who just happened to be Mr Burke's media consultant. Another coincidence? Not likely. </PARA>
<PARA> The diaries reveal that on 22 May Smith met with an employee of the accounting firm which was the official auditor of the Western Australian Liberal Party and paid a person $400 for confidential information. Who paid for that? Surely it was not Smith personally. The diary entry for 27 May indicates that this stolen information was passed to Vince Shervington, Mr Burke's driver and personal assistant. One can only assume that it was not just paper to light his barbecue and, as he worked for Mr Burke, the connection could be deemed to be obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Political opponents were not the only object of surveillance. Police officers involved in the inquiry into Len Brush, who happened to be superannuation board chairman, husband of Mr Burke's private secretary and longstanding ally of Mr Burke, were subject to investigation by Smith. One detective, Colin Pace, was among several policemen whose promotions were held up in July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the real reason why Richard Nixon was driven from office was not that some underlings committed a burglary but that Watergate revealed an ugly, cheap vindictiveness against political opponents that weakens democracy. It is reasonable to suggest that, when such evidence points at a serving ambassador, his continuation should be seriously questioned and should have been investigated by this Labor Government long before today. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as Ministers cannot disregard the catalogue of dirty tricks, of which I have only given a brief outline, neither can they dismiss as mere allegations the role of Mr Burke in concealing the affairs of Rothwells from scrutiny in the closing months of his premiership. The existing evidence from the McCusker inquiry points to at least five questions that should be asked of Mr Burke to determine his fitness to serve Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> With the appointment of senior public servants and long time mates, Tony Lloyd and Kevin Edwards, to the board of Rothwells, was Mr Burke indeed a de facto director of that same shady concern for his last three months as Premier? We do not know and the question remains unanswered. Was the memorandum of13 November 1987 by the Director of Rothwells, David Hurley, stating that a $150m National Australia Bank guarantee was almost exhausted and that therefore Rothwells was again insolvent, conveyed to Mr Burke? We do not know, but the question needs to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Did Mr Burke, as stated, take to Cabinet the share deal of 16 November 1987, whereby the purchase of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd shares by the State Government Insurance Corporation injected another $50m into Rothwells? We do not know, but the question needs to be ans- wered. Why did Mr Burke supply a character reference to the new Chairman of Rothwells, a close associate of Laurie Connell named Bill Burgess? Was it part of an exercise to allay any suspicions of the National Companies and Security Commission as to the $500m worth of non-performing loans in Rothwells? We do not know, but the questions need to be answered. Also in mid-December 1987, Mr Burke induced David Hurley not to resign as the one director of Rothwells with banking credibility with the offer of an eventual senior position in a government instrumentality to `protect his career path'. These questions are not vague scuttlebutt. They have been posed in black and white in the McCusker inquiry report. They lead us back to many of the central questions that I am posing in the Senate tonight.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other questions of possible impropriety by Mr Burke is his involvement in or awareness of the payment of a bribe to Stirling City councillors to allow a beach front development to proceed. It is almost inconceivable to believe, even if one wished to, that, as it was Mr Burke's brother, Terry, who taped a conversation with another person about the bribe, Mr Brian Burke was not subsequently informed. </PARA>
<PARA> One current Labor member of the House of Representatives has said that he was aware of the bribe and had at the time considered that it was his public duty to pass on the information. However, he decided to remain quiet. Who was this member of parliament? Was it the local member who nearly lost his preselection in the same year? Why did he not exercise his public duty? Was pressure put on him by Mr Burke and Mr Burke's brother to stay silent or else?</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from all the close advisers, friends or relatives associated with Mr Burke whom I have already mentioned, it has also been revealed that another former Burke adviser and lifelong friend, the late Mr Jack Walsh, was involved in the bribery affair. Is one expected to think that he too did not advise his lifelong friend, Mr Burke, of what was going on?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Burke was obviously very sensitive to what people knew long before he was dispatched to Ireland. While he has a reputation of slapping a writ on anything that moves, he was keen to suppress a petition circulated by a Western Australian citizen in 1988 which simply sought to have any allegations against Mr Burke cleared prior to his going to Ireland. Mr Burke issued the gentleman with a defamation writ and, in typical style, bullied him out of continuing to obtain signatures. Now, over two years later, the whole jigsaw is being pieced together. </PARA>
<PARA> The stonewalling by this Government, and Minister Tate and in particular, is a disgrace of enormous proportions. Mr Burke was sent to Ireland by this Government for the benefit of the Labor Party and, for the same reason, Ministers of this Government are stonewalling as to why he should not give an account as to the propriety of his behaviour as an elected official prior to his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> Many questions that have been raised in the Senate over many weeks as of tonight remain unanswered. Unless the evidence that I have tried to summarise here can be refuted, such a person as Mr Burke is not fit to represent Australia in Ireland or anywhere else for that matter. How long can this Government and its Ministers go on defending a situation that clearly in the national interest should be settled once and for all one way or the other?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the adjournment this evening because of a number of comparisons that Senator Cook has made between the economic results of the Thatcher Government and the Hawke Government. I prefix my remarks by concurring with the observations made by many eminent observers that Mrs Thatcher was probably the greatest peacetime Prime Minister of England this century. She gave her country and indeed the Western world strong and purposeful leadership. There are far more lessons to emulate than examples to avoid in the Thatcher years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook has argued that the Hawke model is far superior to the model developed by Margaret Thatcher and has suggested that there are striking similarities between what the Opposition is proposing and the policies of the Thatcher Government. In support of his observations, he quoted a number of statistics in answer to a dorothy dixer from Senator Childs last Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray reminded us in this chamber recently that we should be very cautious about the use of statistics. He said, `There are lies, damn lies and statistics'. He did not actually quite say that; in fact, he got the quotation wrong, but that is what he meant to say. Perhaps his staff could ensure that the weekly Hansard is corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparative statistics between countries are affected by a vast range of local and international factors which suggest that caution is the best policy in discussing comparative statistics between countries. Senator Cook in his answers in comparing the Thatcher years and the Hawke years shows no such caution. He sustained his case by arguing that growth in the Australian economy under Mr Hawke was faster than that in the United Kingdom (UK) under Thatcher in relation to gross domestic product, employment and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly using these statistics alone without qualification or context Senator Cook appears to have a point, but when we put the statistics into the context of the world economy the picture becomes somewhat different. Two years after the advent of the Thatcher Government there was a world recession from 1981 to 1982. This had the effect of depressing growth rates, and certainly that of the British economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way of measuring the relative performances of the two economies is to look at how key aggregates performed from the advent of the Hawke Government-that is, from 1983 onwards. This at least ensures that we are measuring key statistics over the same international economic environment. When we look at this period we find that the growth rates of the Australian and UK economies are, in fact, very similar. If anything, the UK economy grew faster from 1983 at 3.2 per cent per annum compared with 3 per cent per annum in Australia. Inflation in the UK over this period averaged 4.8 per cent compared with Australia's 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Ray might say to Senator Cook, reflecting on the selective statistics that Senator Cook gave to the Senate, there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Given the Labor Party's oft-stated concern for the conditions of working men and women-an appropriate concern which is shared by all parties, I trust-it was surprising that Senator Childs did not ask Senator Cook in the dorothy dixer last Thursday what happened to wages and salaries under the Thatcher Government. Even granting this oversight, why did Senator Cook not use statistics on incomes to demonstrate the alleged superiority of Labor's much vaunted accord? After all, as Senator Cook tells the Opposition, the Opposition has-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . created in their industrial relations meanderings a bastard child of industrial relations, ill-conceived, unformed, impractical, without precedent and, more importantly, dangerous if the Thatcher model is something close to what they seek. </PARA>
<PARA>We shall see. I will try to fill in this oversight by Senator Cook. What happened to the incomes of British workers under Margaret Thatcher? Were incomes ground down, as Senator Cook seems to imply? Real wages under Margaret Thatcher actually increased very substantially over the 10 years of her stewardship. In fact, they rose by an impressive 2.6 per cent per annum in real terms. We might ask how real wages have progressed under the Hawke Government, which in recent times has had Senator Cook as its Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA> In an adjournment speech last week, I outlined in some detail the disgraceful record of the accord in protecting the incomes of Australian workers. Senator Cook, hardly surprisingly, has chosen not to debate these figures, despite Senator Ray's riposte that evening that a devastating reply would be forthcoming from Senator Cook. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A devastating silence, as Senator O'Chee has said. Real wages under the accord-which was developed by the Hawke Government-have actually declined, not risen, as has happened under the Thatcher model, which has been so savagely attacked by Senator Cook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Thatcher record becomes even better if we compare growth in real wages from 1983-the time when the Hawke Government assumed office. In this case, Mrs Thatcher delivered average growth in wages of 3.1 per cent annually. The question we should ask ourselves is this: did Senator Cook omit these figures through oversight, or did he deliberately hide these statistics because he knew the comparisons would damn his accord? I leave it to honourable senators to judge. We might ask who has the best record in delivering real increases in living standards to working men and women. If these statistics provide the guide, the answer must be Mrs Thatcher, not Mr Hawke. So Senator Cook's accord fails on the critical test of living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that Mrs Thatcher did not have to adopt the very high interest rate policies which have marked the Hawke era and so damaged the effective disposable incomes of workers. While the Hawke Government was making it difficult for young people to buy homes through record mortgage rates, Mrs Thatcher's Government was encouraging working men and women to own homes through selling local authority housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook has spent some time lecturing the Senate on how Mrs Thatcher allegedly created havoc in British industrial relations. We again ask: what do the comparative statistics show? In 1989, the last year for which comparative statistics are available, which government was more successful in delivering industrial peace-the Hawke Government or the Thatcher Government? Those of us who have been in this chamber in the last three weeks would have assumed as a result of Senator Cook's efforts that the Hawke Government was more successful. What do the statistics show? It was fortunate that Senator Cook did not compare strike rate statistics in the latest year. In 1989, under Senator Cook's accord, Australia lost 190 working days per thousand employees. Mrs Thatcher's Government recorded a loss of 180 working days per thousand employees-a better record than that of Senator Cook and his accord. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that industrial disputes in the United Kingdom over the period of the Thatcher Government, measured in terms of working days lost, are higher than in Australia under the Hawke Government. Certainly, there was the enormously difficult period of the miners strike which enabled Mrs Thatcher to transform industrial relations in the UK and break union privileges. It is important to make the point that in five of the last seven years the Thatcher Government has had a lower strike rate than that which was achieved by Senator Cook's precious accord. As we know, the Thatcher Government achieved this excellent record in comparison with Australia by not doing what Senator Cook and his colleagues have done, in agreeing to every demand of Bill Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions bosses and giving trade unions a privileged position in Australian society. In contrast to Senator Cook, Mrs Thatcher believes that trade unions should not have a privileged position in our society. Her success in restoring the union movement to its proper role is certainly one of her great achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, if Mrs Thatcher beats Senator Cook-and it is hardly a competitive race, let us face it-in the vital area of delivering real increases in living standards to workers, and generally having a better industrial relations record in five of the last seven years, how did Mrs Thatcher and her Government rate in the area of unemployment statistics? The latest figures show that unemployment in the United Kingdom is about 6 per cent. In Australia, the figure is 8.2 per cent and rising. Over the term of the Thatcher Government, unemployment was somewhat higher than over the term of the Hawke Government, but how high the overall average of the Hawke Government will go is not known. We know that Hawke, Keating, Cook and company have engineered--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But it will go higher, as Senator O'Chee says. Senator Cook omitted one other vital statistic from his comparative treatment of the Thatcher and Hawke years. That statistic is productivity. With the Prime Minister's boasting about his unparalleled record in micro reform, why did Senator Cook not tell us how productivity had grown in the Australian economy in contrast with the Thatcher years? After all, if we are considering the capacity of an economy to deliver rising living standards, productivity is arguably a vital statistic, is it not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason Senator Cook did not talk about productivity is that the Thatcher Government, according to the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) statistics, was able to achieve a productivity growth in the British economy of around 1.8 per cent per annum during the 1980s. What did Senator Cook do? What magnificent effect on Australian industry did all that restructuring and micro-reform carried out by the Hawke Government have on productivity? What was the bottom line? The answer, according to the OECD, was an annual growth of 0.5 per cent, one of the worst among OECD countries. No wonder Senator Cook did not enlighten Senator Childs about the productivity comparisons between the Hawke and Thatcher governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend that there are no serious problems in the British economy. Of course there are. Inflation is far too high and there are balance of payments problems-although, it has to be said, they are not as serious as Australia's balance of payments crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins is listening because he is getting very sensitive about it. He is certainly listening; there is no question about that. Senator Cook's simplistic view does not make any contribution to understanding complex phenomena and is not a credit to the Minister. It is clear that the Thatcher experience in the UK has in some areas had an influence on the Hawke Government-and a beneficial influence. Let it not be denied. Senator Collins can tell us whether the Hawke Government would have been prepared to adopt privatisation policies, in total contradiction of its own platform and election promises, had it not been for the manifest success of most privatisations in the UK and a strong support for privatisations from the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook and Senator Collins should at least give some credit to Margaret Thatcher for influencing the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to adopt privatisation as a policy. I do not recall that privatisation occurred in any ALP election manifesto; I do recall that it was Mrs Thatcher who showed the benefits of privatisation. Senator Collins may like to answer why the Hawke Government adopted the rhetoric of smaller government and deregulation. I say `rhetoric' because in many areas the Hawke Government has simply failed to deliver. Certainly it borrowed the smaller government and deregulation policy approach from the Liberal Party. The success of the Thatcher Government also had an influence on the rhetoric of Hawke Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> In another area of experience, the Thatcher years had an unfavourable influence on the Hawke Government. In both countries-Australia and the UK-the money supply expanded at far too great a rate during the 1980s. A consequence of this policy has been massive inflation of asset prices, debt and ultimately deflation. That was an unfavourable influence of the Thatcher Government on the Hawke Government. The Economist, the well-known British weekly, in a not uncritical editorial said of Mrs Thatcher:</PARA>
<PARA>Where five generations of political leaders had watched Britain's economic decline, she was ready to say no, enough-and do something about it. These were massive achievements and they will give her a stature that time will not erode.</PARA>
<PARA>Will any newspaper write similar lines about Senator Collins, Mr Hawke or Mr Keating? Certainly the Treasurer, Mr Keating, has let us know in no uncertain terms what he thinks of the Prime Minister's stature. We go back to his now notorious off the record briefing of the press. It is clear that the Hawke Government has failed to pick up some of the positive aspects of the Thatcher years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention just one final aspect. No-one would argue that Mrs Thatcher did not have a clear set of philosophical beliefs which were endorsed by her Party. No-one would argue that she did not provide strong consistent leadership or deny that she attempted to put her philosophy into practical policies. There were no U-turns with Mrs Thatcher. There were no special conferences to revise party philosophy and platform. No-one ever called Mrs Thatcher a jellyback, from what I can recall, let alone one of her own Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic for my adjournment speech this evening is the crisis in the Gulf. Now we have a breathing space before the 15 January deadline and a chance to initiate a negotiation process to avoid war, it seems useful to consider what possibilities exist for an agreement that would be acceptable to all parties concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I would first like to refute the allegation by Senator Richardson on 4 December that I represent the views of only a few people in Australia. According to the latest Saulwick poll in the Sydney Morning Herald-and taking into account the correction that appeared tucked away on page 2 the day after the original headline, which claimed that 80 per cent of Australians support sending warships to the Gulf to remove the Iraqis by force-the reality is that 56 per cent of Australians are in favour of force being used in the Gulf and Australia being involved in that force, divided between 68 per cent of men and 43 per cent of women. In fact, the Australian Democrats and I, from the Greens WA, represent the 41 per cent of the population that is definitely opposed to the Australian involvement in the Gulf, and that number will probably grow. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is far from only a few; it is a significant and growing number of the Australian population. Curiously, far more Americans are opposed to the use of military force in the Gulf, indicating that Australians still tend to be gung ho before a military adventure and then rapidly swing away once the body bags start coming home from some foreign field where Australia has been fighting another nation's war yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> However we may interpret United Nations resolution 678, it is erroneous to assume that there is ample legal justification in the United Nations (UN) charter for unilateral military action by the United States. White House officials, apparently supported by the Australian Government, take the position that article 51 of the United Nations charter, which affirms the right of individual and collective self-defence, allows the United States to liberate Kuwait by armed force. But this argument ignores the specific language of the article. It permits:</PARA>
<PARA>Individual or collective self-defence until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA>Once the Security Council has adopted collective security measures under chapter 7 of the charter, as it has done by imposing air and sea embargoes against Iraq, member nations are constrained by the charter from acting unilaterally or multilaterally to launch an attack. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the exact one I am talking about. The key to a well-governed world is not the endowment of the United Nations with the coercive capacity of a planetary police force but the power of the credible threat of collective action to create conditions for seeking peaceful and diplomatic solutions to international disputes. Such action is embodied in the purposes and principles of the UN charter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the slaughter of more than 60 million people in two world wars, the United Nations was established to put an end to fighting, not to authorise a Third World War. International armed force has proved to be effective when used in a peacekeeping capacity; that is, to disengage warring factions in cases of civil war or to contain further aggression when hostilities across international borders are involved. The use of armed force to restore the status quo ante is, as the Korean conflict demonstrated, a far more perilous means of achieving the high purposes to which the UN is dedicated. Of course, the notion of liberating Kuwait is highly unlikely-it would be more like a total demolition job, finishing off the destruction that the Iraqis began. </PARA>
<PARA> The paradox of world peace is that, in a world lacking the consensual foundations for international peace and security, there can be no negotiations with aggressor nations without the credible threat of collective force, but the risks of global conflict are so great that collective force should not be used without first exhausting all the channels of diplomacy. The challenge facing the UN today is to combine the techniques of diplomacy, peacekeeping and collective security by constructive devotion to those features of international organisation that make reliance upon consent, rather than carnage, at once so necessary and so precarious. The kind of public peacekeeping resolution proposed here would preserve the unprecedented international solidarity and threat of force against Iraq's aggression while providing time for economic sanctions and serious diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement. I believe that there are points for negotiation which could lead to a settlement without rewarding Iraq for its aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> Two major Iraqi grievances concern the uninhabited islands of Bubiyan and Warbah, which restrict Iraq's access to the open sea, and the disputed Al-Rumeilah oilfield that straddles the border drawn by the British 70 years ago, before anyone knew about the oil deposit, as a straight line between Kuwait and Iraq. It is also worth recalling that when Iraq was created out of the remains of the Ottoman Empire it was deliberately given virtually no access to the sea in order to ensure that it did not become too powerful. </PARA>
<PARA> After the First World War there was a dispute between Sweden and Finland over the Aland Islands, which lay close to Finland but the inhabitants of which spoke Swedish. Finland had once been part of Sweden but in 1809 it became part of tsarist Russia. This is a useful example of the kind of proposition I am putting forward. In 1918 the Bolsheviks announced that Finland could become independent. In 1917, 96 per cent of the inhabitants of the Aland Islands had signed a petition in favour of a reunion of Aland with Sweden, but Finland said that the islands were nearer Finland than Sweden and should remain part of Finland. </PARA>
<PARA> The islands had historically been of strategic importance in the Baltic Sea and, after the Russians started building a fort there in 1820s, the British and French bombarded and destroyed it during the Crimean War in 1854. Fortunately, the question was referred to the newly formed League of Nations in Geneva, and the League Council delivered its decision in June 1921. Sovereignty over Aland was rewarded to Finland as a result of this League of Nations consultation. However, the Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . peace, future cordial relations between Finland and Sweden and the prosperity and happiness of the islands themselves can only be consolidated through measures envisaging (a) new guarantees for the population of the islands and (b) the neutralisation and non-fortification of the archipelago. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision of the Council was supplemented by a treaty between Finland and Sweden, the so-called Aland Agreement, which was contracted three days later. In it both countries made an agreement on how to effect the guarantees envisaged by the Council of the League of Nations. This kind of approach, applied to the disputed islands at the head of the Gulf, which are in fact uninhabited, could act as a model for a solution which, while not rewarding Iraq, would-with regional Arab guarantees-remove its fear of interdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Contested oilfields have also been the subject of past disputes and can be resolved through patient negotiation, or countries can go to war over them, which invariably resolves nothing in the long run. Australia's negotiations with Indonesia over the oilfields in the Timor Sea are a good example of successful diplomacy, although unfortunately we were negotiating with the wrong partner-Indonesia, rather than an independent East Timor-in the settlement of that oil dispute. It is, of course, ironic that Australia should now be supporting the small state of Kuwait after it was occupied by its large neighbour while Indonesia's occupation of East Timor in 1975 can apparently be overlooked-a very hypocritical and increasingly embarrassing situation for the Government to contemplate and to deal with. It is this selective indignation that so infuriates the Arabs when they look at the voting record of the Western democracies of Israel and Palestine as well as other examples nearer home, such as East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> Some commentators have also suggested a regional conference to consider some of the other conflicts in the Middle East. Critics of this idea have argued that this would be far too ambitious an undertaking. However, there is an historical parallel in the nineteenth century. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars all the interested nations met at Vienna in 1814 and 1815 to deal with a vast array of political, economic, geographical and military disputes. Out of that Congress of Vienna emerged a new structure for peace and stability in Europe that lasted for a century until it was shattered by World War I. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those arrangements ignored pressing social and political injustices, but the conference provided a practical forum dealing with a host of immediate problems. Many of the problems in the Middle East today arise from the arrangements made for the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after 1918. A similar conference to the Congress of Vienna could be held in New York and perhaps conducted in three stages. Stage 1 could focus on an end to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, taking into consideration arrangements over Iraqi access to the sea and a settlement over the disputed Al-Rumeilah oilfield. Stage 2 could focus on the long-festering Palestinian issue and the relationship of Israel to the Arab nations. If these issues can be negotiated, a UN peacekeeping force could safeguard the settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> With adequate security guarantees, Israel might be willing to relinquish the occupied territories, including the Golan Heights. The alternative for Israel would be to live under a constant state of siege for the unforeseeable future, and I am sure that that is not a situation that is acceptable either to Israel or to her neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Syria would be asked to yield its claim on Lebanon and fully accept the right of Israel to live within secure borders as an independent state. Stage 3 of such a conference might focus on Lebanon and the desperate need for a stable and effective Lebanese government guaranteed by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgency of addressing the various Middle East issues in a comprehensive conference is underscored by the huge new arms explosion threatening the region. The Pentagon, in response to the Iraqi threat, has proposed a transfer of planes, tanks and artillery to Saudi Arabia over the next few years that may cost more than $US20 billion. President Bush has recommended cancelling Egypt's $US7 1/2 billion debt to the United States for earlier arms and other aid. These moves have frightened the Israelis, who are now asking for debt cancellation and military aid as a counter to the arms build-up and the continuing danger from Baghdad. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the United States is fostering a costly, much expanded Arab-Israeli arms competition, supposedly aimed at Iraq but actually fed by the protracted Arab-Israeli conflict. This problem cries out for solution within the context of an overall peace and security arrangement. Whilst Saddam Hussein is being presented by the popular press as an monster or latter-day Hitler, we must remember that those countries which condemn him now are the same countries which armed him between 1980 and 1988 to fight Iran, the then bogeyman of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> As Hans-Heino Kopietz, Middle East analyst with the control risks group in London, observed:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a Frankenstein monster that the West created. We closed our eyes because some businesses wanted to make money and because Saddam was a useful tool against Iran.</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone, it seems, took a slice of the Iraqi arms pie. The Soviet Union, France, China and Chile sold the Baghdad regime much of its off-the-shelf weaponry. West Germany, France, Britain, the United States, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland and Brazil all sold the components, machines and tools, much of it material with civilian as well as military application, that are the building blocks of the modern Iraqi war machine. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, by 1985 Iraq was the world's leading importer of arms with a military budget of $1 billion a month. The United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimated that during 1981 to 1985 Iraq imported $US24 billion worth of military equipment. This exceeded the $15 billion worth bought by Saudi Arabia, traditionally the world's biggest arms spender. It was also nearly four times the $6.4 billion spent over the same period by Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> The respected French paper Le Monde has estimated French arms sales to Iraq during the Gulf War at $5.6 billion plus an additional $4.7 billion on civilian and commercial contracts. It is worth noting that the French company Aerospatiale, which supplied Exocet missiles to Iraq, was a leading participant in the AIDEX 89 arms bazaar held in Canberra in November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of all these sales, military and intelligence analysts say that Iraq can make some of its own chemical weapons, has a fledgling nuclear weapons program that could produce a bomb in five years or less and is working on a long-range missile that would enable it to deliver such a bomb to Tel Aviv, Tehran or Riyadh. For the record, that comment comes from the Washington Post. I think it is worth taking seriously if we are to avoid an even greater conflict in the Middle East in the years ahead, whatever the outcome of the current crisis in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> The Washington Post also ran another article by Haines Johnson on 16 September 1990 in which he said that the Gulf crisis is not only about oil but also about arms. He warned that any genuine new world order will be jeopardised if the United States wants to go on being the world arms merchant. I would add that the same applies to Australia, given the Government's expressed desire to double military exports over the next few years. In this light, it is worthy of note not only that Australia was prepared to lift its arms export embargo to Iraq after the Gulf war but also that much of our current efforts to export military hardware are now being directed towards another unstable part of the world, South East Asia, currently the market's second in importance to the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Defence Industries' latest advertisement at the Asian Defence Services exhibition and conference in Bangkok this month was for a mortar that was apparently dirtier than ever before, promising `a 25 per cent increase in lethality'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are proposals to try to limit global arms transfers. Some of them were discussed at the third United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in New York, so I will not canvass them further here. However, the point has to be reiterated that if we are to avoid the errors that we have made in the Middle East over the last 30 years through pouring arms into such a volatile region, government policies have to change. </PARA>
<PARA> What this crisis a largely about is control of oil resources in the Middle East. Once the OPEC countries got their act together, warning bells rang for the United States oil companies. It was no accident that the United States rapid deployment force was engineered in the mid-1970s after OPEC countries first wielded their economic power. The rapid deployment force, which was designed specifically for quick United States intervention where its interests were threatened anywhere in the world, had a specific and stated focus to be ready for engagement in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The farm product forecast appearing in Statement 2 of Budget Paper No 1 was based on Treasury analysis of commodity production forecasts by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), as well as information received from other statutory agencies (such as marketing authorities) and from rural industry groups. Disaggregation of the Budget forecasts is not made public. The disaggregated ABARE forecasts were published in the June 1990 issue of the `Agriculture and Resources Quarterly'. More recent ABARE forecasts appeared in the September 1990 issue of the same publication.</PARA>

<PARA> In 1986-87, 156 000 used tyres were imported into Australia. According to the Australian Tyre Manufacturers Association imports of used tyres have increased to 700 000 in 1989-90, and are exported mainly from the USA and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> Imported used tyres are either utilised for retreading or sold at the retail level as second-hand tyres. They are therefore essentially a commercial import. However, used tyres have a naturally shorter life and therefore will be ready for disposal more quickly than new tyres. To the extent that the import adds to Australia's waste disposal problem, this is a matter of environmental concern.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Federal Government is responsible for the standards of tyres for new vehicles which are set out in the various Australian Design Rules. In addition to specifying an Australian Standard, these Rules also allow, in the case of commercial vehicle tyres, a number of alternative standards, specifically the Economic Commission for Europe, Japan and the United States. These alternative standards were included on the advice of industry, after an appropriate comment process, on the grounds that they provided equivalent safety requirements to Australian Standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The standards for tyres fitted to vehicles in service are the responsibility of State and Territory authorities. These requirements, I am advised, are generally based on the Design Rules. The Minister for Land Transport has advised his State and Territory colleagues of the concerns regarding the safety of imported used tyres.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government is concerned about road safety and devotes considerable effort to ensure that vehicles have a high level of safety. The Federal Office of Road Safety has arrangements for investigating safety defects in the context of the various recall codes in support of the Trade Practices Act. The industry has been asked to bring forward factual evidence that the used tyres being imported and offered to the market present a safety hazard.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been advised that the majority of the tyres concerned are imported from Japan, Europe and America. The standards for tyres in those countries are generally equivalent to Australian requirements. Interestingly, a large number of commercial vehicle casings are imported by major companies in Australia to meet a shortfall of casings for remoulding purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Customs Service has advised that import controls which specify an end use are very difficult to administer, impede commerce and are readily circumvented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I understand that it has recently become increasingly difficult for the UNHCR to provide protection and assistance to Burmese students in Thailand, particularly since the hijacking of a Thai Airways aircraft by Burmese students in November. On 16 November, a Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Thai Ministry of the Interior publicly warned international agencies, including the UNHCR, to stop providing assistance to Burmese students or face arrest and possible deportation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An official of the UNHCR has confirmed that there have been some arrests of Burmese students by the Thai authorities but that all have subsequently been released. The sole exception is the person charged with the hijacking of a Thai Airways aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Thai Government's warning to UNHCR and other aid agencies resulted from the inquiry into the hijacking of the Thai Airways flight to Rangoon by two Burmese students. Ministry of Interior officials in Thailand have claimed that one of the hijackers was receiving maintenance funding from UNHCR. In addition, it has been pointed out that Thailand is not bound by any international agreement concerning Burmese asylum seekers and that the UNHCR has no formal mandate to assist Burmese in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No officials of the UNHCR have been expelled from Thailand, nor am I aware of any officials from other aid agencies being expelled.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australian Embassy in Bangkok has registered Australia's concerns to the Thai authorities over the treatment of Burmese refugees. It has expressed the hope that Burmese displaced persons in Thailand, including students, will continue to be treated in accordance with accepted standards applying to the treatment of asylum seekers and should not be subject to refoulement. The Embassy has also emphasised Australia's expectation that Burmese asylum seekers should be given normal UNHCR protection and assistance and that relief agencies and international organisations should have access to the holding centres in order to provide humanitarian assistance and, where applicable, to fulfil their protection function.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed that, in November 1989, BHP Petroleum entered into a production sharing agreement with Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise to undertake work in an area in Burma known as Block H. The onshore bid round in Burma was highly competitive; more than forty international oil companies participated. Each of the nine successful bidders entered into a production sharing contract. As is ordinary commercial practice worldwide in such agreements, the production sharing contracts each required exploration work and payment of a signature bonus. In the case of Block H, the signature bonus paid to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise was the minimum bid amount of US $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA> The signature bonus was paid by BHP in consideration of the right to work in the area and the purchase of geologic, geophysical and well data over Block H. Throughout the world, the amount of the signature bonus will vary widely based upon prospectivity, competitive interest and the data purchased. The amount paid in the present case is well within the usual parameters.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Embassy in Rangoon facilitated contacts between BHP representatives and Burmese ministers and officials and briefed BHP representatives on political and economic developments in Burma. The Embassy was not involved in the substance of negotiations between BHP Petroleum and the Burmese government nor in the eventual agreement. However, the Australian Ambassador did attend the ceremonies associated with the signing of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Embassy's assistance to BHP Petroleum was no more and no less than that which it provides to representatives from other Australian companies who have visited Burma to examine or negotiate commercial opportunities. These activities are consistent with the Government's directives that embassies should give full support to Australian commercial activities overseas.</PARA>
