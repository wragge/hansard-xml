<TITLE>Local Road Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Australians living in rural and non-urban areas rely to a great degree on the local road network for all facets of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA> Funding for roads is an essential part of the Commonwealth's responsibilities for the maintenance of the transport infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA> Road funding under the Hawke Government has decreased significantly in real terms and local government is particularly disadvantaged by this decline.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Immediately address the serious problem of a rapidly deteriorating road network which is confronting local government by allocating more resources to local road funding.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray</PARA>

<TITLE>Animal Patents</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate. The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would *reduce biodiversity, `compromise animal welfare, *concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and *allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more:</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>
<PARA> We pray that all members of the Australian Senate will act on this petition.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should: reconsider the applications and implications of this legislation in the light of justice, equity and freedom of choice for parents and have the unfair sections (Section 8 (2), 8 (15) and (11), repealed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That, for the avoidance of doubt for the time being about certain important orders of the Senate that ought to be of continuing effect, the Senate declares that the resolutions and orders of the Senate collected in the volume entitled Standing and other Orders of the Senate (expect for those referred to in paragraph (3) of this resolution) have and continue to have effect until a further resolution of the Senate following consideration of the report from the Procedure Committee arising from paragraph (2) of this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the resolutions printed on pp 119-131 of Standing and other Orders of the Senate, be referred to the Procedure Committee for consideration of their status, whether in each case there remains a need for such a resolution and, if so, whether its terms need to be revised.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That, unless otherwise ordered, the orders Reference of Bills to Committees (pp 137-143) have effect until the last sitting day in December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) That any future order will have continuing effect only if the following provision is included in it:</PARA>
<PARA>`this order has effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders and is of continuing effect'.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) That this order has effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders and is of continuing effect.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume-I take it that what Senator Coates is moving relates to the procedures of the Senate. I wonder whether he would care to seek leave to make a brief statement and tell us what this is about.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, as the Senate will be aware, there has been some discussion about the status of at least part of the collection of other orders of the Senate which were distributed recently, and the view is taken by at least some of us that some of those orders were inappropriate to be labelled either as continuing or as orders. As some senators will remember, I gave notice last Monday that the question should be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure for report back so that there could be some agreement about this matter. Because leave was not granted for that to be taken as formal and because I was not given leave to postpone the notice in order for there to be more discussion, I then withdrew it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick then gave notice that there in fact be a confirmation of all those orders. I would have preferred certain specified orders to have been confirmed, those that we do need to recognise as having continuing effect, whilst others which were debatable were referred to the Procedure Committee. However, as a compromise on my part, and after discussion with Senator Puplick and Senator Macklin, I have proposed this notice of motion, which gives confirmation for the time being of all the orders of the Senate so that those which are important to be continued can have effect but those about which there is doubt can be considered by the Procedure Committee, which can report back, and so that there can be a further resolution of the Senate, presumably in the Budget sittings, to deal with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is included to implement the intention of all sides of the Senate when the reference of Bills to committees order was adopted last December, that is, that it be a trial for a period of sittings and not for a whole Parliament. The fourth and fifth parts are included to implement a proposal from the Australian Democrats which picked up a suggestion of mine that in future any order that is intended to be continuing include that explicitly in its terms. </PARA>

I am making it pretty clear that there are procedures to be followed in this chamber and independent senators, or, indeed, any senator, can really foul up the whole sittings of the Senate if they put their minds to it. They might be inclined to put their minds to it in the event of their not being consulted on these very important issues. These are issues which relate to Standing Orders and the rights of individual members of the Senate to represent their constituents in the best possible manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If deals are to be done behind the scenes on these very important issues, and all others are not properly consulted, certainly this chamber is in for a very torrid time during this coming week.

That was one of the purposes of actually talking to the Manager of Opposition Business and Senator Macklin. The people I have spoken to are those who have shown an interest in this matter by themselves proposing either amendments to a previous notice or to give notice of the matter themselves. There has been no arrangement that this would be supported. I have not even consulted with all of my own colleagues.

<PARA> (d) calls on the Federal Government to make it quite clear that it does not accept that these elections are free and fair, and furthermore, while these human rights abuses continue, should actively discourage Australian companies like BHP from entering into production-sharing contracts which are designed to help prop up the tottering Burmese economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Committee long. I just wish to respond to one of the points made last night by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in which he, I think properly, sought to draw a distinction between people who were appointed to various statutory authorities who were not permanent members of the Public Service and members of the Public Service as such and the relative constraints which might apply to both of them in relation to their participation in party political debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two things that arise. First, let me make it quite clear that at no stage, either in the speech I made last night or in the course of the hearings of the Estimates Committee, did I seek to imply that Mr Max Bourke, who is a public servant and who is the General Manager of the Australia Council, bore any personal or direct responsibility for the activities of the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> What I was concerned about was not that he had been involved but two other things: first, the fact that, as a statutory authority, its expenditure of money in the production of the press release which was at issue was money out of the public purse and that the printing and distribution of that, to the extent that there was any cost involved, was a cost out of the public purse, out of public revenues, and was therefore in fact an expenditure of taxpayers' money on what was a partisan political exercise; and, secondly, that the Council purports to speak, as it were, as an authority, in exactly the same way that Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines, Overseas Telecommunications Commission Australia, Aussat Pty Ltd or any similar organisation might if it believed that one set of policies, either Government policies or Opposition policies, were contrary to what it perceived as its corporate interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I put this parallel to the Minister. The Government was fairly vigorous about the comments made by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) in terms of the debate about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). It said, `Look, the Government has a policy to abolish this organisation and to replace it with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and it is not proper'-and we accepted that it was not proper-`for the ADC as such to become involved in that debate'. The Government has the right to determine what the structures, particularly advisory structures which report to it, should be and, if there is dispute about that, then the dispute should properly take place in the Parliament and in the public domain between the political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> It was on that basis, I think, that the Estimates Committee C came to the conclusion to which it did. I repeat that conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is of the view that statements of party political opinion should not be canvassed in news releases of government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the essential point of the Committee's recommendation. It is one which, I believe, organisations-whether they happen to be the Australia Council or any other statutory or advisory authority, no matter how they are composed-because of their very nature and relationship with government, should have drawn to their attention and should seek to abide by. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by asking the Minister whether he is now in a position to provide information about costs and distribution which I was assured last night would be made available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;News releases from the Australia Council are distributed to the following groups: Medianet, general media, ethnic media and general arts. There were 67 addresses to non-media organisations and individuals in the general arts category. We hope to have a list of those before the end of the morning. We have asked for that list to be sent and I shall make that available to Senator Puplick as soon as it arrives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost of distribution of a single news release is approximately $226. The break-up of that figure is: $99 to medianet for distribution and $127 for postage. The news release under discussion was formulated at the Australia Council's meeting in Adelaide. It was put out in Sydney on 2 March 1990 through Medianet and media personnel in addition to the distribution in Adelaide. </PARA>

I do, however, make the point that my recollection is that that slightly contradicts the evidence given at the Estimates Committee C hearing namely, that the distribution was only in Adelaide. At that hearing, I had asked what the distribution was. Mr Bourke is reported on page C92 of Hansard as saying that it had been released in Adelaide. He continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>But the facilities for press distribution from Adelaide, at least for us, were not as good as they normally are. We did not have access to our Medianet communications system down there as we do in Sydney. </PARA>

Just so it is clear to Senator Richardson, the correspondence that the drugs in sport committee took in camera was that relating to the Niewand and Vinnicombe inquiry, and the rest of the correspondence was the Commission's response to the Minister's concerns about the Commission's response to the interim report.

Before we conclude this debate, the thrust of this correspondence, without disclosing its contents, is simply Senator Richardson writing to the Commission expressing concern about its response to the inquiry and the Commission writing back telling him that it was satisfied with what it had done.

Quite clearly, if the material that Senator Crichton-Browne has asked for in the Estimates Committee, which is listed as the first item under the heading `Australian Sports Commission', will be provided or has been provided to the Estimates Committee, then the question of whether they were provided in camera does not arise because there was no request from the Estimates Committee that material be provided on that basis, other than some implication about the solicitor's report.</PARA></TALK.START>

There had been two requests and the head of the Minister's Department was helpful in providing it. We have got all the correspondence now, and only half was requested by the Estimates Committee. The correspondence I was referring to is between the Minister and Mr Harris. The Minister's letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I acknowledge that funding limitations have, in the past, restricted the Commission in its capacity to operate a fully effective drug testing program. However, the additional funding appropriated to the ASC in this year's budget for the establishment or an independent Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) should enable those deficiencies to be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The physical relocation of the drug testing agency, separating it from the Commission, was a desirable and timely move. I was also pleased to hear that the ASC has established a committee to oversee the work of the ASDA. I would appreciate it if its reports to that committee were automatically copied to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Several issues remain to be resolved with respect to the powers and conduct of the ASDA in the longer term. The co-operation of the States and Territories is being sought on the implementation of a truly national program and the matter has been listed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Sport and Recreation Minister's Council. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department is currently liaising with the Attorney General's Department regarding constitutional matters, criminality and privacy concerns. The issues are complex, and while they cannot be resolved quickly, I am hopeful that the appropriate legislative backing will be in place early next year. I have asked that officers of the ASDA be kept informed of developments. </PARA>
<PARA> The community has an expectation that strong action will be taken to eradicate drugs in sport in this country. It is of the utmost importance that the integrity and efficiency of the new drug testing agency be beyond question. </PARA>
<PARA> The interim report of the Senate Committee has made a number of allegations concerning drug use by Australian Institute of Sport athletes and the involvement of staff. The Inquiry has elicited sufficient scientific and anecdotal evidence to arouse suspicion. Unless there is a thorough investigation of those cases where serious doubts have been raised both the Institute and the individuals will remain suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Your report of the interviews conducted by yourself and the Deputy Chairman does not make clear that a thorough investigation of the allegations elicited during the Inquiry has been carried out. I believe it is necessary for the Institute to clear its reputation and the reputation of its employees. Accordingly, I ask that the Commission review its position with the object of thoroughly investigating the allegations that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, I will be called upon to respond to the final report when it is tabled in Parliament. Because of the intense publicity and community interest in the findings of the Black Committee, its conclusions and recommendations will be closely scrutinised. I may well be called upon to defend the actions of the Committee in response to the interim report and would appreciate your assistance in ensuring that I am able to do so convincingly. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an eminently reasonable letter. Before I turn to the response of Mr Harris I will ask one or two questions peripheral to my immediate concern but certainly not peripheral to the whole matter. Could the Minister tell me what is the status of the legislation which is to be prepared and put in place for the purpose of ensuring the integrity of the ASDA, and when we can expect that to be introduced into the Parliament?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the Estimates Committee hearings the Minister will recall that I raised the matter of a social and community research report which was commissioned by the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). I came by that document after about 29 phone calls to the Institute. I just put on the record that almost nobody had heard of it, notwithstanding that it cost $8,500. I will not press the words, but I asked Mr Crosswhite why the report had been commissioned. In due course, the Minister might like to reflect upon his answer because, in my view, it was not truthful to the extent that was necessary. The reason the report was commissioned, according to the Department, was that it was a social and community research survey to respond to the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts inquiry into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport. That was the main reason. It went on to say that it was to respond to corporate sponsors, and develop public communication strategies for the Australian Institute of Sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any sensible reading of that would tell one that the decision to commission that report was made because of concern amongst senior executives of the Australian Institute of Sport that they were suffering some damage as a result of public perception of their conduct, the conduct of some coaches and further, the conduct of some athletes. It would have been much more sensible if Mr Crosswhite had simply said that at the outset rather than having given me waffle about corporate sponsors and so on. The only reason why corporate sponsors may have come into it is that they might have been concerned about continuing to give funding as a result of the drugs in sport inquiry. I do not chide beyond saying that, but it makes life easier for us if we get straight answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The research showed a number of matters which, I think, reflect Senator Richardson's instinct for public perception. Eighty-eight per cent of those surveyed said that the AIS should publicly condemn the idea of athletes using drugs in sport-right up front. In an explanation, the researchers say that the results suggest that the AIS should take a strong and high profile position on the issue. The most significant direction for AIS action would be to publicly condemn the idea of athletes using drugs in sport. It goes on to say that the community does expect the AIS to take a strong position on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Some might say that we are outraged by the use of drugs in sport, but we are horrified. We think their application is reprehensible and we deal in a direct and particular way when the occasion calls for it. I think honourable senators will agree that the two reports that have so far been put down have been fair, objective and bipartisan. The response from the Australian Sports Commission hardly reflects what it discovered after spending $8,500 of taxpayers' money, which was required of it by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Minister's correspondence to the Commission highlights that very point. He makes the points that the public has strong expectations, that he will be required to defend the Commission in due course, that he will have to respond to the reports and that there is sufficient evidence of a scientific and anecdotal nature to arouse suspicion-and that was a generous way of putting it, crafting it so as to say no more. The golden thread of the correspondence is that the Commission is expected to act in a constructive and proper way when confronted with evidence in respect of the conduct of officials and athletes of the Australian Institute of Sport. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied with Mr Harris's response to his letter. In a rather gratuitous tone, speaking for himself and Mr Coates, Mr Harris states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are both at a loss to understand your statement. </PARA>
<PARA>He then quotes the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> Your report of the interviews conducted by yourself and the Deputy Chairman does not make clear that a thorough investigation of the allegations elicited during the Inquiry has been carried out. </PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister explain why he might be at a loss to understand simple language used in the correspondence?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne has raised a number of issues. I would like to cover them before answering the last question. First off, I refer to his reference to Mr Crosswhite. I thought that under difficult circumstances at the Estimates Committee he performed admirably and was prepared to be honest even to the point of casting doubt upon his own judgment in terms of a promotion that he had recommended for someone at the Australian Institute of Sport. I thought he performed very well and was prepared to be very open and honest with the Committee. On that basis Mr Crosswhite has my full confidence and support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of the research to which Senator Crichton-Browne has referred, 88 per cent of people said that they thought drugs in sport were a bad idea and that the Institute ought to come out publicly and condemn their use. Of course both the Institute and the Australian Sports Commission have done that many times. I do not think it is the case that it always gets front page coverage, but they have continually decried the use of drugs in sport and called for harsh penalties for those who transgress. When it came to the investigation of some allegations, my concern was that the correspondence I had received from Mr Harris was not conclusive as to whether or not a thorough investigation had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that those of us who know Ted Harris know that he responds, very often, in strong tones, and he did so again. It is a good appointment; I am not opposing it. I am making the point that Mr Harris, when he feels that someone is questioning him, very often reacts angrily. I received from Mr Harris the kind of correspondence he is accustomed to writing, so I was not greatly offended by it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think at the time the Department drafted me another letter to send back, which I do not think I sent. My recollection is that I spoke to Mr Harris on the telephone about this incident. I received, over the phone, his assurances that the interviews that had been conducted by himself and Mr Coates had been thorough, that they had well and truly canvassed the issues and that the conclusions they had come to were based on a proper investigation. The simple point was that I had not been satisfied, on the basis of the correspondence I had received, that the investigation had been thorough enough. That was why I wrote the letter that Senator Crichton-Browne has read out. I do not think that the response I received from Mr Harris helped me at all in coming to the conclusion that a proper investigation had been conducted, but after a telephone conversation with him, I was satisfied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it clear, first of all, that I was less than satisfied with the answer Mr Crosswhite gave. I will read it out, if it needs to be read out, to convince Senator Richardson about that. In my view, one of the problems at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is that the Acting Executive Director is kept in the dark and behind closed doors on almost every subject of substance, if I am any judge. Let me embellish on what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is implying. Mr Harris is very autocratic and domineering, and is determined to get his way-I will say it and the Minister will not-in spite of the facts. As long as that happens, Mr Crosswhite is going to find life pretty difficult when it comes to the Estimates Committee. If life goes on the way it is at the Institute and if by then somebody has been found to work with him, at the next Estimates Committee his life is not going to be much better.</PARA></TALK.START>

The difficulties in finding suitable senior officers at the Institute and the Commission have absolutely nothing to do with Senator Crichton-Browne's allegation of finding somebody who will work with him. That is nonsense. They have everything to do with the very poor salary package we have been offering when the reality is that top sports administrators around the country are getting double what we are offering. We are finding it very difficult to attract people of real quality on the money and packages available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the Minister is not aware of it-if he is not I will enlighten him, as he is the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in this place-but urine substitution is a well known racket and a notorious form of cheating which is specifically outlawed by the International Olympic Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of Miss Flemming's present circumstances, as I said yesterday when I was speaking to the tabling of the report, I find it painfully regrettable that it is still on the agenda. I do not make judgments about what she did; that is not my task. I have no doubt that she has considerable remorse. Under the circumstances, that can be understood. My view is that if the Commission had acted in a proper, responsible and sensitive way at the time I would not be standing here now asking the Minister questions and he would not be standing there answering them. </PARA>
<PARA> But to the extent that the Commission has compromised everybody, it leaves me no choice. The Commission said, by way of explanation for its judgment of the penalty and in explaining its inquiry, that Miss Flemming volunteered to appear before the Committee. The response of Mr Harris to our recommendations and finding was:</PARA>
<PARA> She provided evidence in camera, but it was published. She considers that the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proved innocent, rather than the reverse. She has been greatly disturbed by her appearance before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Miss Flemming wrote to the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts and volunteered to appear before it. In fact, so enthusiastic was the Commission that Mr Bowman rang on her behalf. I will not use the language he used about other athletes when he encouraged us to hear her evidence, because I think that is inappropriate. But she was coming over not to confess to urine substitution; she was coming over to pay out on previous witnesses who had made allegations in respect of drug taking at the Institute. That is why she was coming. In fact, her written submission was in essence:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to request a chance to voice my opinion as an Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games and Australian Institute of Sport athlete regarding the inquiry into drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>She said that she was surprised to hear that it had been suggested that as many as 25 to 30 per cent of Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) athletes had used banned drugs. She said she knew nothing about it herself. She referred to the fact that she was looking forward to hearing from us and would be most willing to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA> When Miss Flemming came before us, in essence to give evidence on behalf of the Australian Institute of Sport, she said in the opening comments:</PARA>
<PARA> I am basically here to support the Institute of Sport on some of the allegations that have been made against it. I have been at the Institute for four years'. </PARA>
<PARA>That was her reason for being before us. She did not seek to present her evidence in camera. She did not volunteer the information that she had been involved in urine substitution. In fact, she was asked by the Chairman whether she knew anything about urine substitution. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you have any knowledge of either that practice or of the provision of clean urine samples by athletes for others?</PARA>
<PARA>Miss Flemming answered:</PARA>
<PARA> I have heard of that sort of thing going on and I have also heard of people who have been tested and had positive results, not in Australia, but internationally. That has not become public knowledge and therefore they have never got the sort of ban placed on them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman, after a number of questions, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Have you ever been asked to provide a clean urine sample for anybody?</PARA>
<PARA>That was the first Miss Flemming knew of the material we had before us. She then said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to talk about that evidence in camera. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, the inquiry did not learn from Miss Flemming, as a result of her evidence, either public or in camera, that she had been involved in urine substitution. That information was made known to the Committee by a number of sources, all of whom had been told by Miss Flemming in the belief by her that she was speaking to them in confidence. She then sought to have her evidence in camera for a number of reasons, not the least being, to use her expression, that it would damage her with her sponsors. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators know the rules as well as I do: one takes evidence in camera and then makes a judgment about it afterwards. Miss Flemming did not come before the Committee with the attitude of mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. She came to pay out on some other athletes and learned as a result of other evidence what we were aware of. So, to reflect upon the findings of Mr Harris, she volunteered to appear before the Committee. That is true. She provided evidence in camera but it was published. We now know about the circumstances of that. Mr Harris said:</PARA>
<PARA>She considers that the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proved innocent rather than the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that a remarkable statement by Mr Harris. We had already received evidence; we asked her the question, and then she said yes. I am not aware that under any circumstance Miss Flemming has denied it-and it is to her credit-although Mr Rice is now challenging that, as honourable senators know, and that was the matter raised at the Estimates Committee hearing. Up until that point it had never been suggested, to my knowledge, that there was any doubt about Miss Flemming's guilt. But it is used presumably as the basis of the determination by Mr Harris. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of that, I ask Senator Richardson whether he would not be vaguely concerned about the grounds that Mr Harris used to impose the penalty he did on Miss Flemming, which was to write and say that she had done something wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have now a copy of all the correspondence with which we have been dealing, and I make that available to the Committee so that everyone will know where we are up to. The actual response to Jane Flemming by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) was conveyed on 12 October 1989 in a letter to Miss Flemming by Mr Harris. I will just read a bit of that letter, a copy of which Senator Crichton-Browne has, because it sets out what the Commission's response to this was. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> You will recall that the Deputy Chairman, Mr John Coates, and I met with you on 5 July to discuss this matter and that at that time we admonished you for your role in the incident. While we acknowledged the circumstances surrounding your participation, we made it clear that the Commission will not take the incident lightly or condone your role. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission of the Australian Sports Commission met on 13 July and considered the Senate Committee's Interim Report and a report arising from our meeting on 5 July. I now write to inform you that the Commission confirms Mr Coates and my disapproval of your participation in the urine substitution incident and views the matter with concern. Had it not been that you were young at the time, on your first major trip as a member of the Australian Commonwealth Games Team and following the instructions of your Assistant Manager, we would have terminated your scholarship. If there is ever any repetition or other breach of our doping policy you can expect instant dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA> You and all other athletes must understand that since the Belfast incident the AIS/ASC doping policy now-</PARA>
<PARA>not an unimportant word in this context-</PARA>
<PARA>clearly states that any activity to subvert a drug testing process constitutes a breach of the policy and is punishable by dismissal and a life ban from competition. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty heavy letter to be writing to an athlete; it is not one that the Commission, via Mr Harris, would ever undertake to do lightly. I think it, very correctly, underlines their concern about the incident. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think it is also making the point that we have seen in the four intervening years since 1986 a marked change in community attitudes to the use of drugs in sport. Recognising that community change, the ASC and the Australian Institute of Sport have very much tightened their own policies and penalties in relation to drug testing in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> So the case, as I view it, is that Mr Harris and Mr Coates investigated the incident and reported to the Commission. Miss Flemming was informed of just how much concern the Commission had and was told that any breach would result in a life ban and dismissal from the Institute. That is about as far as the Commission could take this matter in the circumstances that prevailed at the time. So I am satisfied with the Commission's response; it is quite clear that Senator Crichton-Browne is not. There is a difference of opinion between the honourable senator and the Commission as to the way in which the Flemming incident should have been handled. </PARA>

Senator Crichton-Browne cannot disguise the fact that during the last hour he has raised a number of things that came up in the report that was presented yesterday. As far as I am concerned, we have to try, as a government, to deal with the reports of the Committee. We have to try to come up with a proper, lengthy and considered response to lengthy reports which are raising matters of very great community concern. I will not be in a position today to respond to a whole series of incidents and issues that have been covered in those reports. I do not regard that as either proper or my responsibility.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jane Flemming was referred to in detail on pages and pages of the first report, regrettably. The report yesterday said that we were dissatisfied with the Commission's response to the interim report. There is, essentially, nothing new in that report except that Mr Rice now alleges that Jane Flemming lied under oath to the Committee. I am just not in a position to make a judgment about that and I do not propose to. But everything else flows directly from the interim report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not expect the Minister to be able to respond in general terms to the report presented yesterday. I am referring to the Commission's response to the interim report. Before we disagree about the penalty, let us see whether we can agree that the foundation upon which that penalty was built has substance and merit and has the Minister's support. </PARA>
<PARA> Those grounds are, at the risk of repeating myself, that she volunteered to appear before the Committee-which she did-but she volunteered because she was coming across, as she said herself in both her written and oral evidence, to defend the AIS and Peter Bowman had rung us to make sure that she got a guernsey. </PARA>
<PARA> Ms Flemming did not provide her evidence in camera. She asked for it to be taken in camera when she learnt not that her evidence was damaging, but that questions in respect of a matter which she did not know was within our knowledge were to be raised. Part of the foundation of her response was that she considered the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proved innocent, rather than the reverse. The Committee did not treat her as either innocent or guilty. We simply said, `Have you been involved in urine substitution?' When the extent of our knowledge of that matter finally dawned upon her, she confessed. When she was asked in a general sense on the public record whether she had any knowledge of either that practice-that is, that revolting practice of injecting urine into somebody else's bladder-or of the provision of clean urine samples by athletes for others, which is what she did, she said that she had heard of that sort of thing going on, but had also heard of people who had been tested and had a positive result, not in Australia but internationally. She said that had not become public knowledge and therefore they never got any sort of ban placed on them. Presumably she was suggesting that if they had been caught, they should have had a ban placed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> That was Jane Flemming's response to a general question. The most generous interpretation I can put on it is that because the particular question in respect of herself was not asked, she did not respond. But a truthful answer to that question would have been, `Senator Black and Mr Chairman, I have heard of it, and in fact I have participated in it. I can give you first hand evidence of how it works.' But she did not. It was only when she was asked later on-and this is about 10 or 15 questions later on-`Have you ever been asked to provide a clean urine sample for anybody?', suddenly her response was, `I would like to talk about that evidence in camera'. On she went. </PARA>
<PARA> So I ask the Minister how he can give some support to the Commission who, as an explanation for the penalty, said that she volunteered to appear before the Committee, she provided evidence in camera-but it was published-she considers that the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proved innocent rather than the reverse, and that she has been greatly disturbed by her appearance before the Committee?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to read it out, but I will read it out if the Committee wants me to. What disturbed her was, as she said, that it might damage her reputation and cause her difficulties with her sponsors. That is what distressed her, not the objectionable questioning by Senator Crichton-Browne in his inimitable fashion. Yet they are the reasons given by Mr Harris for writing a letter to Jane Flemming telling her that she had done wrong. We all know what the International Olympic Committee says about that sort of thing. The IOC list of doping classes and methods states that the IOC Medical Commission bans the use of substances and methods which alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping controls. Examples of banned methods include urine substitution. That is the IOC's view. Are the premises upon which is based the determination of the Commission to respond in the way it has reasonable and accurate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first point out that, if people interested in the report produced yesterday were to turn to pages 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or indeed 28, they might get a rough idea that the Flemming incident was covered in the report tabled yesterday along with every single matter that Senator Crichton-Browne has covered today, so he should not raise furphies and say that it is referred to only in the first report, and that he is not referring to anything in the report tabled yesterday. I am afraid that no-one in Australia will pick the distinction and, having flicked through those pages, neither do I. I do not withdraw those remarks. What I said was a fact-an absolutely undeniable fact, even for Senator Crichton-Browne at his most difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will get back to the Flemming incident and the way in which the Australian Sports Commission handled it. In November 1987, the Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport introduced a policy which would result in a life ban for transgression against that policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Australian Sports Commission; they both did-in November 1987. We are dealing with an incident that took place in 1986. It is certainly true that since 1986 the International Olympic Committee, individual sports like athletics, the Sports Commission and the Institute of Sport have all tightened up. They have introduced very strict policies on drugs in sport, and rightly so. Those policies did not exist in 1986. I am absolutely certain that, if evidence was now produced of an incident like this, the offender would be out for life. There is no question about that. But it did not happen now; it happened a long time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in responding to the report that was brought down yesterday-I repeat, yesterday-will have to respond to the matters now raised by Senator Crichton-Browne, and no doubt it will. But the Government will not be giving any more responses to those incidents than what I have given today, and I do not intend to keep responding. I have made my position clear. Obviously, I await consideration of the report tabled yesterday, which covers these incidents and to which the Government must respond.

<PARA> I bring Senator Richardson back to the Commission's explanation for drawing the conclusion and the recommendation-which I have not yet read out, but I will if the Minister wants-in respect of Miss Flemming. I am sure the Minister must understand what I have said four times already-that she volunteered to appear before the Committee; she provided evidence in camera but it was published; she considered the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proven innocent, rather than the reverse and she has been greatly disturbed by her appearance before the Committee.

The response of the Commission in respect to Miss Flemming is as read out by me in paragraph (b).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am satisfied with the extent of the investigation carried out by the Australian Sports Commission. As the Minister responsible at the time, it was my duty to find out how far the Commission had gone in investigating the allegations about drugs in sport and their use by Commission and Institute of Sport athletes. As a result of the inquiries I made I was and am satisfied at the extent of the investigations. In respect of the actions that have been taken since, I have already said that I regard the letter sent to Jane Flemming and its contents as sufficient punishment. I do not really believe that the Commission could or should take it further than it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the more general question, I am not aware of the Government as yet tabling a response to the interim report-the interim report was also a lengthy one-and the Government will be responding to the interim report and to this one, one would imagine, in one go, not in two. Today I do not wish to pre-empt the Government's response to those reports. That is a matter to be more properly dealt with by Mrs Kelly making a submission to Government. I am absolutely certain that Jane Flemming has paid a sufficient penalty for whatever transgressions she may have committed in the past. I do not believe that the continued canvassing of this issue is in the interests of Australian sport. Accordingly, I do not propose to canvass it any further. </PARA>

<PARA> I ask Senator Richardson a simple question: Given his knowledge and that of his advisers, does he believe the explanation given by the Commission in making these recommendations-that Miss Flemming volunteered to appear before the Committee, which is totally and absolutely misleading; that she provided evidence in camera, which again is totally and absolutely misleading because it was not her evidence but the evidence of others that led us to understand the truth of the matter, and that she considered the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proven innocent rather than the reverse-was reasonable? Are those reasonable grounds for drawing any conclusions and recommendations, whatever the findings or penalty might be? Are they reasonable grounds upon which to write a report and send it to the Minister to tell him why Miss Flemming got the penalty that she did?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne should not read too much into all this. The Commission investigated this incident. There is no question that in that investigation it found Jane Flemming guilty of participating in a urine substitution incident, as it called it. The Commission saw fit to comment on her appearance before the drugs in sport committee. I do not agree with all the views expressed collectively, or individually, by members of the Commission on the proceedings that took place before the drugs in sport committee: I do not believe that I need to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the commissioners, and the Commission itself, are entitled to a view about the way the Committee conducted itself. I believe that all Australians are entitled to a view about the way the Committee conducted its proceedings; but I do not have to share it. I will not take part in an exercise where I tell the Commission, individual commissioners or athletes that they are not allowed to think ill of a Senate committee-of course they are. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not got to the stage yet where people are going to be arrested for saying that they did not like the way a Senate committee proceeded. It is pretty obvious that Jane Flemming was not all that keen on the Senate committee. She expressed that view to the Commission. I have already made it clear that individual commissioners and the Commission have received criticism of the way the Committee conducted itself-as have administrators in quite a number of sports that were touched upon by the Committee's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Commission accepted that Jane Flemming did the wrong thing. It wrote to her and said that it now had a policy for bringing about a life ban for people who did such a thing and that if she did it again she would be out for life. One wonders what more the Commission can do about a four-year-old incident. That is what the drugs in sport inquiry ought to be looking at and that is what the Committee of the Whole ought to look at. I have said that I am satisfied with this result, and I am. </PARA>

I understand that Senator Richardson does not have to agree with the Commission, the Commission does not have to agree with the Committee, the Committee does not have to agree with the Commission and the Committee does not have to agree with the Minister, but that is all a bit irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask Senator Richardson, as the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in this place, and as the Minister responsible for that portfolio at the time, whether he is satisfied that the excuse given-or the explanation, if I want to be generous-by the Commission for imposing the penalty, whatever it was, was that Jane Flemming volunteered to appear before the Committee and provided evidence in camera but it was published, that she considered the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proven innocent rather than the reverse, and that she has been greatly disturbed by her appearance before the Committee. The simple question I ask the Minister is whether, in his mind, those are fair and reasonable grounds for drawing any conclusion as to guilt, innocence or penalty?</PARA>

That is a great shock to me. He says what is obvious to him, and then refers to blind Freddy, although I will not attempt to raise the spectre of the visually impaired. All I can say is that the reason for the penalty is not a statement that Jane Flemming appeared voluntarily before the Committee-which she did-or anything else. The reason for the penalty is that the Commission found that Jane Flemming had participated in a urine substitution incident, found that this occurred prior to its adoption of a doping policy in November 1987, and informed her that now that that policy was alive and well, she would not be in so far as sport is concerned, if she transgressed again. It will not matter how many times I am asked the question, that will be my response.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: is the Minister himself satisfied that any of the explanations given are a foundation for drawing any conclusions? Is it relevant whether she appeared before the Committee voluntarily? Does the Minister accept what she has told the Committee, and that is that she came along to defend the Commission and bag other athletes? Does the Minister accept that she did not ask for her evidence to be taken in camera until such time as it began to reflect adversely on her? Does the Minister accept that she was never treated by anybody as guilty, contrary to natural justice? Does the Minister accept that Jane Flemming being disturbed by the Committee in some way is a suitable response to the penalty? The Minister knows what I am saying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actual words appear under the heading `Response to criticisms', not under the heading `The reasons why we made the penalty were these'. That fact seems to have been left out of all the questions Senator Crichton-Browne has been asking. The reason why I am hanging in there, as Senator Crichton-Browne put it, is that, as a response to criticisms, I believe that the Commission is entitled to make the response. That does not mean I agree with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Do I think that a committee chaired by Senator Black, with Senator Crichton-Browne as the Deputy Chairman, would treat people as guilty until proven innocent? The answer to that is no. I do not accept that the Committee would have behaved in that fashion-not for a second. Do I accept that Jane Flemming was greatly disturbed by her appearance before the Committee? Too right I do. </PARA>
<PARA> Do I accept that she volunteered to appear before the Committee? Yes, I do. She certainly did volunteer to appear before the Committee, so I do not think that Senator Crichton-Browne can suggest that she did not. Do I accept that she provided evidence in camera, but it was published? Well, that is probably going a bit far, so I am not certain I want to accept that sentence either. But I do not have to accept any of these sentences. My acceptance or rejection of any one of them does not mean a thing. These are there as responses to criticisms. They are not there as justifications for penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Crichton-Browne wants to talk about justifications for penalties and about the attitude the Commission took to the Jane Flemming incident, he should refer to the letter of 12 October. I read most of that letter into the transcript. It makes it very clear that the Commission took a very strong exception to what Jane Flemming did and wrote to her in very strong terms indeed. The Commission does not write many letters to people saying, `You have got to understand that since the Belfast incident the doping policy now clearly states that any activity to subvert a drug testing process constitutes a breach of the policy and is punishable by dismissal and a life ban.' Such letters are not written every day. That is a very serious letter. It is obviously a matter of grave concern to the Commission. It is not a question of going through the responses to criticisms saying, `Do I accept this and do I accept that?'. I do not accept that the drugs in sport committee behaved improperly; obviously I do not accept that. But there are people in the community who believe it. I do not intend to act as a thought policeman who goes around saying to people. `You are not allowed to think ill of the Committee'. I cannot and will not do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to be understood that I received correspondence from the Australian Sports Commission about the actions it had taken. I wrote back because, on the face of it, the letter did not satisfy me that a thorough investigation had taken place, and so I subsequently spoke to Mr Harris about it. The suggestion that I was satisfied with the correspondence that I had received is obviously not the case, or I would not have bothered writing the letter in the first place. But that does not change the discussion that we are having now at all. Senator Crichton-Browne is continually distorting what response to criticisms means. It does not mean justification for penalty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question that the Sports Commission is entitled to put in a view. Senator Crichton-Browne says, `Why put it in?'. He is only concentrating on the part of it that he does not like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Response to criticisms:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) She acknowledges she should not have participated in the urine substitution. Maurie Plant was the Team Manager; she had known and respected him; he had helped her in the sport . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not regard that as an irrelevance. I do not regard it as one line, either. It is clearly not that; it is significant. As a result of that the recommendations state:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Ensure that Australian Athletics further investigates Maurie Plant's actions in the urine substitution. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Write to Jane Flemming informing her that Board of the AIS strongly disapproves . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Inform all athletes and coaches . . . of the ASC/AIS drug policy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that the athlete will get a life ban if he or she does it again. The recommendations go far enough. The Commission has responded to criticisms. I do not accept all that is in its response, but I do not believe-and I did not believe at the time-that those responses to criticisms amount to some total justification for the penalty that is given. As an example, nowhere in the response to criticisms is it stated that at the time the incident occurred in 1986 the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission did not have a drug policy as they do now. That is not even stated in response to criticisms, and yet there is no question that that is an important part of the justification for the penalty that was given. It is a very important, crucial part, which is not even in the response to criticisms. Senator Crichton-Browne should not keep harping on this response to criticisms as if it were the justification that it clearly is not.</PARA>

<PARA>The tragedy is that Harris wrote back, gave the Minister a mouthful of cheek, and left him where is is now. The Minister was smart enough and wise enough to know what was going to happen. Harris responded to the Minister, stating:</PARA>

Jane Flemming explains that she is 21, white, female; first trip overseas; didn't like the Committee; disturbed by her appearance before it, went across to give somebody else a serve and copped one herself by accident on the way past; and the following recommendations flow from it'. No wonder the Minister wrote back to the Commission. I thought that Senator Richardson might have taken the opportunity now to restate what he restated in that letter; that is, it is totally unsatisfactory. Mr Harris wrote the Minister a pompous letter simply saying that he was steeped in either ignorance or stupidity and that he did not understand what he was on about.

Some of them were quite serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that in response to criticisms made in the interim report there was a considerable tightening up of procedures at the Institute in a range of areas. I know that the Institute and the Commission have taken a very hard line on the use of drugs and as a result of the deliberations of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts they now have systems in place which make the use of drugs in Australian sport very much more difficult.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, this part is. Mr Peter Bowman was criticised on two grounds. This is not the main question, Mr Chairman, but if I can explain it, it will be seen that it goes to the heart of the next question. Firstly, he did not follow procedures in respect of the distribution of drugs and associated medical supplies, namely, that his decision had to be approved by a doctor. That is simple and logical and clear to understand. He was criticised because he did not follow that practice, and that practice made it possible for the Wardles and the Joneses of this world to use taxpayers' money to buy anabolic steroids to inject into young athletes at the Institute.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>She had been overseas as a member of the Australian Athletics Team, prior to the Commonwealth Games, not as a member of the AIS team. </PARA>

I cannot speak for the extent of what he might have heard at the time, but if all he had heard was a rumour then I am not certain that I want to place people like Mr Bowman-or other athletes, not just those in administration or coaching-in a position where they have to report every rumour.

I also ask the Minister why, if it was simply a rumour, Mr Bowman would then go on to say, by way of excuse, that Miss Flemming had been overseas as a member of the Australian athletics team and not as a member of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS).</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the reason Mr Bowman would have raised that question is that he would have had some direct responsibility for Jane Flemming had she been overseas as a member of an AIS team. Perhaps he felt that if he had had responsibility over the team and he heard a rumour, he would have to make some more inquiries. But in so far as that was not the case, obviously he felt that he did not need to go further. I do not know whether Jane Flemming told her boyfriend, or her coach, or whatever--</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know how many dogs were barking at the time, but while someone like Mr Bowman does not have a direct responsibility and all he has come across is rumour, then I am not of the view that he is bound to report it. It may well be the case that others more closely associated with running the team should have reported it. If they had heard it from a number of team members, the coaching staff or other athletes, perhaps they should have taken it further. But I do not think that in Mr Bowman's case there is sufficient evidence to punish him on the basis that he heard a rumour about a member of a team over which he had not direct responsibility at the time and did not report it.</PARA></TALK.START>

When Senator Crichton-Browne says that the Association had a reserve position, I do not think that it actually had a vote on this matter and said, `If weightlifting tries to let Walker in, we will say no'. I do not think that was the case either. Rather, I think it was the case that his name was withdrawn before that kind of discussion had to take place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a response to Senator Crichton-Browne's question. The survey of drug use in Australian sport carried out during 1979 to 1982 on behalf of the Australian Sports Medicine Federation was aimed at determining the nature and extent of drug use by Australian sports men and women. Individual sports people in a wide range of sports that were popular in Australia recorded the drugs they had used in connection with their own sporting activity.

<PARA>This report is the fifth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 26 February 1990 the President, in accordance with Resolution 5, considered a letter from Mr A. E. Harris, AC, Chairman of Australian Airlines Ltd, relating to remarks made by Senator MacGibbon during the adjournment debate on 19 December 1989 and referred the letter to the Committee of Privileges of the previous Parliament as a submission under Resolution 5. That Committee decided to consider the submission. The full circumstances leading to the report of the present Committee are set out at paragraphs one to three of the report. As the previous Committee has done in relation to all other matters on which it has reported to the Senate, this committee recommends that the response included in the report, which has been agreed to by Mr Harris and the Committee, be incorporated in Hansard.

<PARA> In the adjournment debate in the Senate on December 19, 1989 (Hansard, page 4847), Senator MacGibbon sought to bring to the attention of the Senate what he regarded as a serious attack on the rights of Senators to perform their duties and to discharge their responsibilities. In doing so, Senator MacGibbon referred to a letter which he had received from me in my capacity as Chairman of Australian Airlines Limited and which he described as `threatening'. I deny any such intention and seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard that letter. The letter read as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>My Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA>My attention has been drawn to remarks made by you in the Senate on October 5 1989. Would you be kind enough to explain to me what you mean by `but we object violently when that change (the need for change within the Civil Aviation Authority) is brought about as a result of political pressure by the Prime Minister looking after his mates, Mr Harris and Sir Peter Abeles and the airlines that they represent.'</PARA>
<PARA>The following are the facts, Senator, in respect of Australian Airlines:</PARA>
<PARA>1. There has been no pressure whatever placed on the Civil Aviation authority by Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>2. All of the negotiations with the Pilots' Federation were carried out by the management of Australian Airlines under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer, Mr James Strong. </PARA>
<PARA>3. All members of the Board were aware of the negotiations and unanimously endorsed the actions of Mr Strong and his management team. </PARA>
<PARA>4. At no time during this dispute has the Prime Minister or any member of the Government given a single direction to myself, any board member or any member of the management of the Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The Chief Executive Officer of Australian Airlines, Mr James Strong retired from the Airline on September 24 as had been announced by him some months ago. The Board has retained Mr Strong as a consultant until the dispute with the pilots is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> As you appear to have some particular concern as to my role in the dispute, let me spell it out for you. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Airline I have, on behalf of the Board been actively involved with our management in seeking, in the initial stages of the dispute, that the negotiations with the AFAP which were most comprehensive, should reach a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> When the AFAP `walked out' of those negotiations and subsequently induced their members to abandon their employment with the Airline, we have endeavoured to employ qualified competent pilots to bring the Airline back to normal operations. </PARA>
<PARA> We will continue in the pursuit of this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to your explanation which I have sought in the opening paragraph of this letter, copy of which I am sending to members of my Board. </PARA>

I refer to the new reference given to the National Crime Authority shortly before the Federal election, unique in that it was given direct from the Commonwealth Attorney General and not by the intergovernmental committee and unique in that the Government confirmed the target of the investigation. Is it not the case that in January the Government sought an additional $800,000, including $600,000 for counsel fees which it intended to expend in pursuit of this investigation by 30 June?

I would distinguish very clearly the rate of expenditure in relation to court appearances and counsel-which, I think, was the main thrust of the slowdown in likely expenditure-from the question of investigation which, I imagine, is being conducted by the National Crime Authority with all due diligence.</PARA>

In Sir James Balderstone's speech to the annual meeting of the AMP Society, he referred to the `urgent need to put to an abrupt end the unacceptable, immoral and, in some cases, illegal practices' of some company directors, while Sir Eric is reported to have said, in a speech to the Australian Institute of Management in Melbourne, that `the ethics and practices of some managers and directors had resulted in significant damage to public trust and domestic and international opinion'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was very remarkable, or at least worth commenting on, that the chief of the AMP Society, Sir James Balderstone, took advantage of his address to policyholders to speak of what he saw as a need to establish a national corporate regulatory body to tackle the speedy prosecution of errant directors. In support of that call, he commented on the way in which dishonest directors had not acted in the best interests of their shareholders, but, further, in so doing had acted in a way which undermined confidence of investors both domestically and overseas in business opportunities in the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the status in which Sir James Balderstone is quite rightly held adds great weight to the understanding that is growing in the community that one of the key reasons for and purposes and goals in establishing a national corporate regulatory body is, indeed, to enhance the reputation of Australian business in the eyes of investors, particularly those from overseas as we continue to require their investment confidence in order to build up business, commercial and trading live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the support now given by major elements within the business community to the setting up of the Australian Securities Commission is to be welcomed, and I believe it is also to be linked to the clear statements by the proposed Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Tony Hartnell, that he intends to take very speedy action in order to enforce the duties of directors and that he will take action against directors who breach their duties. I believe that the type of legal proceedings that might be appropriate could vary between the civil and criminal jurisdictions. But the point is that the courts in Australia will be involved, according to Mr Hartnell, in his attempt to ensure that company directors undertake their fiduciary duties in a way which is required by the law and which enhances the reputation of Australian business both domestically and abroad. I understand that the Senate and House of Representatives committees involved in these areas are looking at the duties of directors and reviewing those duties in a number of different contexts. I believe that those parliamentary reviews will assist this Parliament in ensuring that the law, which we make and seek to have enforced, will indeed ensure that company directors act in the best interests of shareholders and in a way which will enhance the reputation of Australian business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health been drawn to a notice under the heading `Urgent Drug Recall'? Is he also aware that Ayerst Laboratories Pty Ltd is recalling two batches of premarin 0.625 milligram 28s because of a labelling error resulting in prednisone 5 milligram tablets being found in two bottles labelled premarin? Can the Minister inform the Senate what medical problems could develop if the wrong tablets were taken? How successful was the recall by Ayerst Laboratories, and what quantity of tablets have been affected by this mix-up? Has any detailed report of this labelling error been sought from Ayerst Laboratories?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has informed me that he and his Department are aware of the problem with premarin. The Department of Community Services and Health instituted the recall. This involved the immediate issue of a press release to all media outlets, including the ethnic media. At the same time a recording was provided on a 008 number to enable pharmacists to obtain details as soon as they were approached. This facility is made known to pharmacists through the pharmaceutical benefits schedule and is also listed in telephone directories. This action was followed as soon as possible by notices in the press placed by the company concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jones asked about the medical problems which could develop. They depend, in large part, on the reason the premarin was prescribed. Possible indications for the drug include: post-menopausal oestrogen replacement; hypogenitalism and various forms of cancer. For the most common indication, post-menopause, the intended dose of premarin would be low, so the unintended prednisone dose would be low. The main effect would be onset of uterine bleeding, simulating menstruation, due to cessation of premarin when the patient transferred inadvertently to the wrong tablet.</PARA>
<PARA> It is conceivable that a dangerous situation could arise if prolonged high dose premarin had been intended. This could result in a patient taking high doses of prednisone for several weeks. This could aggravate a serious underlying disease, such as diabetes, and could carry the danger of collapse when the prednisone was suddenly stopped. I am advised that the likelihood of such a situation arising is low.</PARA>
<PARA> One full bottle from each batch was found. We are waiting for details of the recall as it proceeds. No further faulty bottles have been returned to date. A detailed report of the labelling error has been requested from Ayerst Laboratories. This matter will also be investigated by the Commonwealth goods manufacturing practice inspectorate. While in this a reputable company has behaved properly and responsibly, it is a timely reminder of the need for comprehensive regulations in this area to prevent less responsible operators injuring consumers. Members of the Senate would do well to recall this example when reconsidering the Therapeutic Goods Regulations in the Budget sitting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter, of course, about which I am not an expert. Senator Bell was kind enough to give me notice of this question. The answer which has been provided to me is that tenders for the printing of the forms for the 1991 census of population and housing were called in December 1989 and the successful tenderer was determined in March of this year. The total number of household and personal forms to be printed for the 1991 census is 11,800,000. With regard to the last part of the question-which I think Senator Bell regards as the most important part of the question-it is not possible to have the census forms printed on recycled paper because the use of optical mark recognition technology for reading information from the completed census form requires precision printing on very high quality paper that cannot be obtained from recycled sources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted a number of recent statements, including one by the shadow Minister for Trade Negotiations, that the post-1992 European Community poses a considerable threat to Australian trade. I think the Australian Government's view generally on the proposed completion of the single European market in 1992 is well-known. We welcome the opportunities for Australian industry which the single market will present in terms of greater economies of scale, wider choice of bases for investment, simpler and cheaper operating rules, and a bigger pool of skilled labour. We are encouraging Australian business firms to take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by the single market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, we have had a number of concerns based on our experience with the common agricultural policy (CAP) and coal subsidies that the single market could create a `fortress Europe'. After all, in relation to the CAP and coal, as I have said on a number of public occasions, it is not just a matter of `fortress Europe', it is a matter of the drawbridge being up, bolted and, effectively, the key thrown away. I think it is fair to say that our fears have now largely been allayed in relation to those particular areas of concern-particularly, things like local content regulations, anti-dumping and the application of the principles of reciprocity, which have been key areas of concern over the last couple of years as the 1992 process has evolved. We are, of course, watching the development of the single market very closely and we are assessing its effects sector by sector, issue by issue. We remain concerned generally to break down the fortress area that does still exist with the CAP and coal.

The attention of the Treasurer has been drawn to the issues raised in Senator Zakharov's question. The design of Australian bank notes is an issue primarily for the Reserve Bank, which consults various experts about the design. The Treasurer does not have a power of veto over the design of notes but is, of course, consulted by the bank about new currency designs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the letter in front of me but, as I heard the particular paragraph, it seemed that Mr Staples was not speaking directly but rather indicating that certain persons referred to the groups in the terms that Senator Patterson outlined. I understand-anybody who knows Mr Staples would agree-that nobody has tried harder to provide a very widespread range of services to assist those who might otherwise be without shelter or proper care, particularly among the frail aged. For example, only last Saturday, in Kingston, south of Hobart, I opened an elderly persons' hostel on behalf of the Christian communities in Kingston. They expressed their delight at the support that the Federal Government-through Mr Staples-was giving to aged people in the provision of a wide range of nursing home, community care and hostel-type accommodation in order to make Australia a much more civilised society, as indicated by the way in which we care for our frail and aged citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the Government consider using its powers to control access to Australian ports as a means of ensuring that foreign ships accept piloting when passing through the reef?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year I attended a meeting of a Ministerial Council between Queensland and the Commonwealth at which the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority made a presentation on `Reefplan'. Obviously, any plan that protects a couple of thousand miles of reefs is always going to be difficult to administer. But with `Reefplan' the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has made a pretty valiant attempt to control damage, should it occur. There have been only a couple of very minor spills on the Great Barrier Reef, despite a great amount of increased shipping traffic. Thus far, it has not been necessary for `Reefplan' to be put into action to solve any great emergency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Dunn should also bear in mind that the reaction of oil in the very warm waters of the Great Barrier Reef presents less of a problem than does oil in Arctic or Antarctic waters, where we have seen some disasters in recent times. Nonetheless, obviously if we were to get a major spill we would be presented with a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority has paid particular attention to spills north of Cairns. The recent spill that took place there was monitored very carefully and the Authority was satisfied that no lasting damage occurred. I think I saw a report on that while I was still the Minister and I was certainly satisfied when I read it. Overall I am satisfied that Reefplan is about as far as the Great Barrier Reef Authority could possibly go.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past couple of years we have been looking at the question of pilotage of ships through the Barrier Reef and discussions are continuing with the Queensland Government on what might occur. I will have to check for Senator Dunn on where it is at the moment, but my recollection is that no decision has yet been made to make pilotage compulsory. I think that has probably been done on two bases-one being cost and the other the fact that thus far we have managed to avoid any major disaster and therefore there is some evidence that the system works.</PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the potential for an oil spill and the damage it could cause is so great that I have the matter still under review. I do not believe that at this stage we have ever ruled out getting compulsory pilotage if we can get agreement from Queensland. Discussions with the Queensland Government will continue and I shall attempt between now and Monday to find out exactly where they are up to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is certainly that the US is committed to the permanent five process, that there are a substantial number of United States inputs into that process in respect of which we have been in consultation with the US. The commitment is still unequivocally there to a comprehensive settlement essentially employing the kind of strategy that Australia mapped out in our contribution to this process, beginning last November. I think any reference to a review of US policy by President Bush should not be taken as signalling any kind of sea change at all in that process. It is essentially a matter of riding with what is a fast developing situation and adjusting policy response accordingly as things move along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a lot happening at the moment and it is a little difficult for me to be more precise than that. Certainly there are some encouraging signs that the ice floes are breaking up a little at all three levels. Things are happening at the level of the P5 or Permanent Five-that is, the major powers whose continuing patronage of internal parties has been such a crucial factor in keeping the conflict going. Things are happening at a regional level, with Thailand, Japan, ourselves and others all being very active in trying to craft ways through the present impasses. The Cambodian parties themselves are showing a willingness to talk to each other and to try to craft effective solutions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there has been some criticism of the child support scheme in recent times, particularly because of some delays that have been occurring from the date of application through to the date when maintenance can actually flow. Certainly we have experienced some difficulties. It will be appreciated, of course, that the scheme is actually administered not by my Department but by the Australian Taxation Office. In the course of the next week or two I think we will be in a position to announce that some very significant extra resources are about to be put into the Child Support Agency so that we might eliminate some of those delays. Nonetheless, despite the fact that there have been some delays, it should be noted that 17,500 payments were made in the month of March, which suggests that, even with the difficulties I have just outlined, the scheme has had some extraordinary success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment there is a difference, understandably, between those who are receiving payments under stage 1 of this scheme as opposed to those who are under stage 2. There is a difference between the average amounts that have been received under stage 2, which is about $69 a week, and the average for stage 1, which is about $56 a week, and that affects those who came into the first part of the scheme. Nonetheless, that difference appears to be narrowing. There is a general indication that the value of court orders is continuing to rise, which is something which we should all be grateful for.</PARA>
<PARA> About 81 per cent of non-custodial parents whose liabilities are collected by the Agency now meet their maintenance obligations in part or in full. This suggests, of course, that there are still some cases of recalcitrant people who do not live up to their obligations and we are certainly continuing our efforts to pursue them to make sure that they contribute properly.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of looking at the profile of those who are in receipt of these payments through the Agency, it should be noted that there is a total of 245,000 sole parent pensioners in Australia at the moment. Six per cent of them receive payments through the Child Support Agency, a further 30 per cent receive their maintenance privately and another 12 per cent are waiting for processing and collection by the CSA-making a total of 48 per cent of sole parent pensioners. It is certainly an encouraging result, given the length of time that this scheme has been in operation.</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Giles is concerned why the number is not higher, it should be noted that 30 per cent of the pre-scheme pensioners do not have to take action under that child support scheme; about 13 per cent are new applicants with exemptions-obviously, widows come into that category, but so do those for whom pursuit of an order would require them to risk violence and, sadly, there are too many of those cases; and the remainder, which is some 8 to 10 per cent, is made up of those who are yet to obtain court orders-some of whom have had applications rejected by the Agency because information has not been sufficient or has not been supplied.</PARA>
<PARA> So I think if one reviews the work of the scheme to date, and certainly it has been a major advance for those who have not received maintenance in the past, one will see that it has improved collection and that it has even had the effect of gradually forcing up court orders so that children can receive more adequate payments and we can ensure that their lot is made just that little bit easier.</PARA>

<PARA> I can recall some disagreements with Senator Coulter at the time that we brought the legislation in. He wanted legislation that was even tougher. The Australian Government took the view, I think rightly-and I might say it was supported by the Opposition-that we were about setting levels that were achievable. That is why we set about the process of talking to industry. We had very lengthy talks with industry about this. The fact that we have persuaded our industry to go further than in any country in the world and by 1995, to all intents and purposes, we will have eliminated the offending substances and their use in Australia-except for very small applications, particularly medical ones-suggests to me that if industry can wear it here, it can wear it around the world. We are using the fact that we have made those agreements with industry to convince other governments to take the protocol further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the second part of the question essentially is yes. The Ford Capri, which is basically a car built for export, has to meet the safety requirements of the country to which it is exported. That is principally the United States; there is no doubt about that. Regarding the first part of the question, I have been asked whether, not being able to answer the primary question, I would now look into the issue. I think I can look into it but I will not see anything because no-one will tell me the answers.

Since the Minister made those predictions and with the benefit of both the Westpac-Confederation of Australian Industry survey of business trends for the December quarter and the September quarter figures which show a real decline in business investment, I ask: What other factors led the Minister to make such a prediction?

We can get a feel for the investment climate and I would acknowledge that there has been a downturn in the investment climate. In order to quantify that, we would have to look at figures which are not produced for some time. I cannot quantify that at this stage. In terms of any projections I might have made last year, I think the investment climate was very strong throughout 1989.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 May, Senator Durack issued a press statement based on statements reported to have been made by Air Chief Marshal Hakimullah, chief of Pakistan's air staff. Senator Durack's statement to the effect that the Pakistanis would shortly be sending a plane to pick up the first instalment of engine spare parts and plant facilities for the Mirage is, I am advised, quite inaccurate in several respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As yet, no arrangements have been made between Australia and Pakistan for transportation of any part of the Mirage sales package to Pakistan. There are no new engines included in the package and the plant facilities could not readily be transported by air. A period of three months was allowed for in the contract for Australia and Pakistan to agree to a shipping plan and this has not yet occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> The volume of the items involved in the Mirage package is extensive, dictating that the majority of them be moved by sea. A contract will not be effectively completed within the next few months.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the Israeli Government position is that there is no right of return within the green line, as the pre-1967 boundary is now called, for Palestinians who left Israel as a result of its creation in 1948</PARA>
<PARA>the Israeli Government cites security grounds as the reason</PARA>
<PARA>it has also stated that `the only long term solution of the Arab refugee question is the resettlement in the midst of their kin in the Arab countries'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Israeli Government does not recognise the right to family reunification</PARA>
<PARA>although it has allowed some family reunions on a case-by-case basis</PARA>
<PARA>after the 1967 war it allowed 39,000 people who had fled to Jordan to return</PARA>
<PARA>a larger number were permitted to return to the occupied territories.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no comprehensive mechanism for compensation for property left by Palestinians within the green line.</PARA>
<PARA> The Israeli Government has declared its willingness to provide compensation for immovable property, predominantly real estate, left within the green line, but on the following conditions</PARA>
<PARA>agreement on compensation would be contingent on peace and/or cessation of the Arab economic blockade</PARA>
<PARA>payment would be in relation to Israel's financial capacity</PARA>
<PARA>refugees accepting compensation would renounce all claims to a right of return, as well as further financial claims against Israel, and</PARA>
<PARA>agreement being reached on reciprocal compensation for Jewish property left in Arab countries.</PARA>
<PARA> All property left within the green line has reverted to the holdings of the state of Israel, under the authority of the custodian of absentee property and provided for by the absentees property law of 1950. Absentee Palestinian owners have no right to sale or use of the property thus administered.</PARA>
<PARA>A right to return and a right to compensation for loss of property for Palestinian refugees is referred to in paragraph 11 of UN General Assembly resolution 194 of 11 December 1948 in the following terms</PARA>
<PARA>`The refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and . . . compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for the loss of or damage to property which, under the principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible'.</PARA>
<PARA> Although General Assembly resolutions are not of themselves binding instruments in international law they can be reflective of law and help crystallise customary international law. Australia voted in favour of resolution 194 in 1948. All the Arab states voted against.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia accepts as a matter of international law that `everyone has the right to leave any country including his own and return to his country' (article 13 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</PARA>
<PARA>We also accept that `no one shall be subject to arbitrary interference with his . . . home' and that `everyone has the right to protection of the law against such interference or attacks' (article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).</PARA>
<PARA> It is open to any person inside or outside a country to seek redress through the municipal legal system of that country for compensation for property lost and the return of ownership of the property. If municipal remedies are exhausted, in certain circumstances another state may espouse the claim of the individual against the country in which the property was located as a matter of international law (state responsibility). A key condition is that the person seeking redress have the citizenship of the state espousing the claim at the time the claim arises.</PARA>
<PARA> From all of the above a number of points stand out</PARA>
<PARA>In the 43 years since the partition of Palestine, attitudes on both the Arab and Israeli sides have hardened</PARA>
<PARA>it is most unlikely under now conceivable circumstances that Israel would ever allow a wholesale right of return to within the green line for Palestinians displaced from their homes during the 1948 fighting</PARA>
<PARA>the conditions Israel places on civil actions by Palestinians seeking compensation are stringent and would seem to depend finally on an Arab/Israeli peace settlement</PARA>
<PARA>because of the citizenship condition set out above, it would be very difficult for Palestinians displaced by the fighting to have access to international law procedures in order to make claims for restoration of property or payment of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>In these circumstances Australia's position on the right of return of Palestinians to what is now Israel and on compensation for property lost as a result of the fighting in 1948 is that we regard these as matters for ultimate resolution in the context of a peace settlement, which may involve the creation of an independent Palestinian state.</PARA>
<PARA>We continue to urge all parties to the Arab/Israeli dispute to work towards such a settlement.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> It is not true that funding for the University of Tasmania has been cut in 1990. Funding for the 1989-1991 triennium was announced in November 1988 and included provision for increased funding for growth for each year of the triennium. No cuts have been made to the previously announced funding for the University.</PARA>
<PARA> Higher education funding is provided in the form of a block operating grant for a specified level of student load within the context of an agreed educational profile covering teaching and research activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Institutions have the flexibility to determine the most efficient allocation of resources within their profile according to their own priorities. The Commonwealth does not set quotas for individual faculties or courses or determine the distribution of resources and student load between faculties and schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the importance of the arts and humanities, as well as the sciences, in the provision of higher education. It is not the Government's intention that institutions should lessen their commitment to the arts, social sciences and humanities, either in teaching or research. Asian Studies have, in fact, been identified as a national priority area for growth.</PARA>
<PARA> Institutions are also encouraged to implement and maintain programs and initiatives which are designed to improve opportunities for women in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 higher education in Tasmania will receive operating grant funding of $79.1m for a student load of 7745 places, compared with $76.7m in 1988. This includes funding for 150 additional places in 1990 over the 1989 level.</PARA>
<PARA> The University did not in fact meet its student load target in 1989 and, based on early estimates of 1990 load, is unlikely to fill the 7745 places for which it is funded in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been little evidence of unmet demand in Tasmania (except in selected areas such as medicine) and year 12 retention in Tasmania is very low. In 1989, Year 12 enrolments grew by only 118 students while the Commonwealth has provided 150 additional places for new students in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The University of Tasmania is in fact very well-funded compared with other higher education institutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before consideration of the report of Estimates Committee C was adjourned this morning the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was in the midst of reading the answer to a question on which information was required. Mr Chairman, I seek your indulgence and ask you to be a little generous with the Standing Orders as I wish to refer to a matter which has appeared in today's Herald. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Collingwood was identified today as the AFL club named in private evidence before the Senate inquiry into drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> A member of the committee confirmed-anonymously-that Collingwood was identified when committee members spoke with Ross Oakley, now AFL chairman, and players' representative Simon Madden late last year. </PARA>
<PARA>My interest in the Australian Football League is limited to this question of whether or not it has appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that it can adequately test for performance enhancing drugs. I do not remember the name of the team or club that was mentioned. I would find it absolutely reprehensible if a member of the Committee has, in fact, provided to that newspaper information which was taken in camera and then, having done that, remained anonymous. That really does reflect upon the integrity of every other senator on that Committee. I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the article.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister was in the process of answering question 1 (c) 1, which asks whether boxing could be described as being in a high risk category in relation to drug use, and states that a survey of drug use in Australian sport is to be provided. I think the Minister was in the process of working his way through that document. To my memory there was not for the duration of the inquiry one sporting body or association which was anything other than thoroughly cooperative. A number acknowledged the shortcomings of their own testing procedures, the integrity of those testing procedures, and the fact that some of them did not have them in place and did not have adequate and suitable penalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I must say that I was gravely disappointed with the response by Arthur Tunstall, OBE, JP, Secretary-General of the Amateur Boxing Union of Australia, who, if my memory serves me correctly, was the Secretary of the Commonwealth Games Association. He was written to and asked to provide a submission to the Committee. He wrote back in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I am in receipt of your letter of 3 June 1988, addressed to my President . . . who has asked me to reply on behalf of the above Union. </PARA>
<PARA> In so doing, I would advise that the above Union has never had any of its members involved in drug usage of any kind, and therefore, does not wish to offer a submission for your Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite obvious that any sport which has weight categories has to be in a high-risk group in respect of the use of diuretics. As boxing has various weight categories, it would have to be a sport which would be likely to attract participants who use diuretics. Of course, boxing is also a sport that requires durability, muscle mass and bulk. To that extent, I would have thought that also anabolic steroids would have enhanced the performance of the participants. But, rather than Mr Tunstall's making a submission to the Committee, to give us some understanding as to what his union does in respect of the matter and to assure us that it has proper mechanisms and testing procedures in place, he wrote this letter. The other performance-enhancing drug that I would have thought boxers might be likely to use would be a stimulant. But, again, there was no suggestion by Mr Tunstall that that might have been a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that Mr Tunstall is also the Secretary of the Commonwealth Games Association, I would have thought that he would have been better placed to have demonstrated publicly before the Committee the concern which I have to assume he has in respect of the use of drugs in sport. For Senator Richardson's information, I was just responding to a question which he had not fully answered. I think he was part of the way into the survey on drug use in respect of boxing. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . we did ask for some elaboration of the criteria, and also for further evidence that the Commission will be seeking in the future in terms of sources of extra funding outside of grants. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to the wall about it. I just wondered whether there was any intention to resolve further some of the concerns expressed at the Senate Estimates Committee about why the sports selected were limited to the seven targeted sports. I think the concerns being expressed were very much directed towards the Olympic-type sports, for which the clear intention is to concentrate funding so that Australia will have a better chance of doing well and getting medals at Olympics and other international meets of that kind, such as the Commonwealth Games and so on, rather than spreading the money around in other sports where Australia has a very high reputation, and I used squash as an example. The point was made in the Australian Sports Commission's strategic plan that the Commission is of the view that there should not be significant levels of funding for professional sports. I understand why cricket, for example, should not get additional funding. Clearly, it can raise money from the events, such as test matches, it holds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, at the elite level. I presume that this funding is to be concentrated on the seven targeted sports at the elite level, in order to win more medals or to prepare people to be capable of being trained to win more medals. In regard to Senator Richardson's August 1989 statement that the extra money should be concentrated on sports elitism-and I am not objecting to that-what was the criteria that excluded some of the other sports in which Australia performs extraordinary well, and which are not professional, at elite level? The Chairman commented that we did ask for some elaboration of the criteria. If that cannot be answered now, could it be provided at some future time?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall that at the Estimates Committee hearing I gave a number of explanations on this matter. I do not seek to go over all of them now. The basic point I made was that in my statement of August 1989 about increased funding I said that we would never have received the extraordinary increase in sports funding that I had persuaded the Government to give, had it not been for the Olympic Games and the revulsion felt by many Australians at the fact that Duncan Armstrong won a gold medal while on the dole, and so forth. That being the case, I had attempted to integrate the efforts of the Olympic Games people with those of the Australian Sports Commission. I did that by nominating some people from the Australian Olympic Federation to the board of the Sports Commission. The Sports Commission has subsequently taken a decision to foster those seven sports, on the basis that these were sports in which we were likely to be successful at the Olympics. It has never been suggested that that is the sole reason that we give them money. I explained at the time that it is the example of champion elite athletes that inspires many ordinary Australians-young ones in particular-who see their stars in action, to increase their participation level. That is the basic aim underlying our sports funding. I thought that this complied with that aim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not under the impression at the time that we were required to provide Senator Michael Baume with extra information on this; it may have been a lack of understanding on my part on this point. Given that the honourable senator has requested it, I will seek from the Sports Commission an explanation of the exact criteria used. I will provide that to him as soon as I can. </PARA>

One of the residual concerns I have-and I would be grateful if this could be addressed in the reply-is that if the extra funding is to be limited to seven sports, does that mean the remaining sports will simply have their funding maintained, in money terms, or is it definitely to be maintained for all the other sports-excluding the seven-in real terms?</PARA></TALK.START>

I will ask the Australian Sports Commission for its criteria. It must be put on the record that the great majority of sports received increases in real terms as a result of the announcement in August 1989.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There may be some confusion here. Certainly we did answer a question on this from Senator Michael Baume although, in my view, it does not answer the question he has just asked. But he did ask about expenses being broken up between sports programs and the provision of sports facilities when they are not broken up that way in the annual report. The reality is, of course, that the Australian Sports Commission has not administered the sports facilities program and so has not been responsible for it, and it would not be reasonable in that sense to have done that. Nonetheless, I am quite happy for a break-up of what was spent on the sports facilities program to be done sport by sport. We can certainly prepare that and give it to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer we have got here does go through the expenditure between 1988-89 that Senator Michael Baume asked for and gives the reason for it. It then goes on to explain why that break-up did not occur this time and talks about why there is increased expenditure for sports facilities now, running mainly to wage increases, increased energy costs, water rates, et cetera. So there is an answer here, but obviously I do not regard it as finalising the line of questioning Senator Michael Baume undertook, and we will provide him with more information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Harris said that as late as last year the Government was refusing to provide financial resources sought by the Institute. This document is new so he was talking about last year. In the report Mr Harris says that there was no substantive evidence to suggest that the drug testing program was a complete failure because of `(1) above'. The `(1) above' is that the staff did not fulfil their obligations and responsibilities properly in terms of testing and that accordingly the testing became a bit of a farce. I turn to the interim report which refers to that matter. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is obvious that due to the slackness with which the procedures for collecting urine samples were followed, samples could have been tampered with or destroyed by Sister Beasley. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not suggested that they were tampered with or destroyed by Sister Beasley; simply that that possibility was available because of the failure of the Institute. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, because of the lack of proper documentation, in many cases there is no evidence that the urine sample was actually provided by the athletes being tested. Even if samples were found positive it is highly unlikely that any action could have been taken when area supervisors or chaperones were not recorded or had not signed the required forms. As discussed later, Dr Fricker himself was party to these lax procedures quite apart from his overall responsibility for the drug testing program. The comments made above by Dr Fricker about Ms Howland and Mrs Martin's appalling lack of understanding of dope testing are much more appropriately applied to himself, as his statement that the International Olympic Committee procedures were used is just not true. </PARA>
<PARA>I say with respect that the Committee went to the trouble to include in the report photostat copies of specimen identification forms which show that by any measure had there been one single test that deemed positive and an appeal had been lodged by an athlete the appeal would have been bound to succeed. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 99 Specimen Identification Forms on the AIS file provided to the Committee, only 10 contain the signature of both a chaperone and an area supervisor in accord with accepted procedures. Two of these 10 were supervised by the replacement nurse. Another two of these 10 tests involved a longer delay between selection for testing and the time of giving a urine sample than the allowed 48 hours. Overall, less than 10 per cent of all tests in 1986 and 1987 met the accepted standards and the Committee believes, as a result, that the integrity during this period of the entire AIS testing program is questionable. </PARA>
<PARA>What I am saying and what the Committee is saying in summary is that there was no testing done at the Institute which in any way could have been responsible for any athlete who tested positive having been penalised in any way. Yet Mr Harris says that there was no substantial evidence to suggest that the drug testing program was a complete failure. We produced copies. I ask the Minister whether he endorses the view of Mr Harris that there are no problems with the testing to the extent that it was a complete failure. If he does agree with Mr Harris how does he justify suggesting that it was not a complete failure, given that presumably the measure of whether it is a failure or not is, firstly, whether the test is done properly and, secondly, whether it is possible to enforce a penalty?</PARA>

So I do not think that we can say that the whole lot was out, but some may well have been. I think that is a matter of regret.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Richardson has ventured that far forward because, quite frankly, that is not the view that was expressed by the Commission. I refer to an inquest report signed by Mr K. M. Waller, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This inquest concerns the death of a young man, MAURICE FERRANTI, who died aged 23 on 21 October, 1989. Mr Ferranti became suddenly and unexpectedly ill at the home of his girl friend. He was taken to Sutherland Hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then mentions the name of his girlfriend; I will not mention it as it adds nothing to the matter. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and the deceased had acted responsibly in taking with them to the hospital substances recently ingested by the deceased, and as it transpired it was those very substances which caused his death. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ferranti was a man who had taken up the sport of body-building, and as the evidence shows, had become quite fanatical about it. Sports like body-building and weight-lifting have become notorious in recent times for the fact that their practitioners frequently take steroids to build muscle and enhance performance in that way. As I have said, who cares who is the best drug-affected athlete? But the desire for success is such that people risk the criticism, and the dangers, associated with drug-taking in order to be thought the best. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ferranti was one of these. He has clearly been using steroids for a long period of time. The drug builds muscle, but has certain damaging side effects. There are long-term side effects like cancer and liver damage which should put people off taking the substances, but unfortunately Mr Ferranti did not get that far. Steroids increase fluid in the body, and the athletes then ingest diuretics in order to eliminate the fluid, and increase muscle definition. Some diuretics, like Lasix, eliminate both fluid and salts including potassium from the body. The practise is to then take potassium to replace that chemical. However, Mr Ferranti used aldactone as a diuretic, which is ``potassium-sparing'' that is, it retains the potassium. </PARA>
<PARA>Again the report mentions the deceased's girlfriend by name, and continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at the request of the deceased, purchased potassium tablets for him as he no doubt believed that he had lost that substance through use of his diuretic. Having ingested a large number of the potassium tablets, he suffered in effect potassium poisoning, which led to his physical distress and, finally, cardiac arrest. </PARA>
<PARA>The irony was, that Mr Ferranti died on the day of his competition, and if tested, as he should have been had he won, he would have been disqualified because his body contained the steroids which are illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> The case is a stark reminder to people that there are great dangers involved in taking drugs to improve performance. They are rightly banned by all sporting organisations. Their long term effects are very serious, as is demonstrated in this case by the fact that already Mr Ferranti was suffering atrophy of the testes, another nasty side effect. He was probably infertile, Dr Duflou said. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence has not clearly established just who provided the steroids-</PARA>
<PARA>and that really does not add to it-</PARA>
<PARA>However, it was the potassium tablets, able to be purchased without prescription, which were the final agent of death. However, there was no necessity to take these unless the steroids and diuretics had also been taken . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Both steroids and diuretics are only available upon doctor's prescription, and it is an offence to deal in them without. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this inquest was to warn possible users of the great danger of both short term disaster, and long term illness, which may arise from the use of steroids, diuretics and indeed any substance for the purpose of enhancing sporting performance. Every drug carries with it the possibility of unpleasant and health menacing side effects. No drug should be taken except under medical supervision. The result of misuse in this case has been the loss of a young and promising life, no doubt a very sad blow to his family and friends. </PARA>
<PARA> The court expresses its sympathy to the family. </PARA>
<PARA>I read that out because I was disturbed to read the substance of a speech given on 21 May 1990 by Mrs Ros Kelly, the present Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. She was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm very wary of the issue of drugs in sport because I think we have really gone a bit overboard. </PARA>
<PARA>I went to the trouble to ring the journalist who reported that article; he read his notes to me verbatim and I took them down. Mrs Kelly was not misquoted. In fact, she went on to say some other things which I will not repeat because I think they add to the embarrassment of others and I will save them for another time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that no graver or more irresponsible statement could be made than to have a Minister-not only a Minister but the Minister responsible for sport-address the Australian Olympic Federation and say that she thought we had gone overboard with drugs, given the painful process that the community, sport, institutions, the Government and the Parliament have gone through to extract enough funds to ensure that we have proper testing and that it has a level of integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> All the surveys that have been done thus far show an abysmal lack of knowledge, understanding and, not least, awareness of the direct and indirect effects of performance enhancing drugs upon the people who use them. At a time when the Government is proudly boasting of the amount of money it is spending on education, when our Committee and other authorities are desperately seeking ways to inform young people of the risks and the threats involved in the use of drugs, we have a sports Minister who says she thinks we have gone a bit overboard. </PARA>
<PARA> She makes much of the fact that there are to be 2,000 tests this year. I have to assume that that is bad advice because there have not been 2,000 tests. One thousand tests are scheduled this year and 2,000 next year. Mrs Kelly went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . so far we have tested 20 positives, but all are subject to appeals. </PARA>
<PARA>It really needs to be seen in that light. In other words, while we have got 20 positives, hold your breath; they are all subject to appeals. I could not believe that, so I rang the Minister's office and asked for it to be put in writing. The correspondence, which I do not happen to have with me, says that the Australian Sports Commission has advised the Minister that each of those 20 tests is under appeal. When I sought the names of the 20 who had tested positive-not because I much cared who they were but simply to identify and define who had appealed-I was advised the names were not available because they were subject to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I can think of nothing more irresponsible than for the Minister to suggest to the community and the Australian Olympic Federation that we have gone too far in our pursuit of rooting out the corruption of drugs in sport. In respect of the report that was tabled yesterday, Mrs Kelly says:</PARA>
<PARA>Let's not focus on the individual because too many people will be hurt and the sport will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson might like to explain that, as Mrs Kelly is his colleague, not mine. But I would have thought that sport does suffer because of the conduct of the few and if they are not exposed and rooted out, sport, in the long term, will continue to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mrs Kelly was being interviewed by the journalist she also said that she hoped we would put all of this behind us and get on with the future. The truth of the matter is that those who ignore history are bound to make the mistakes of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Life has been made a little bit more difficult for us than it need be in terms of seeking to understand how the Australian Institute of Sport could be so incompetent in respect of its drug testing and how it could be so negligent in not knowing that the weighlifters were taking drugs, that the coaches were buying and supplying them and that young athletes were bringing them into the country. That information has been made publicly available through our inquiry for the purposes of ensuring that it does not happen again. Yet we have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm very wary of the issues of drugs in sport because I think we have really gone a bit overboard . . . But let's not get totally neurotic. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson might like to explain what the Minister means when she says:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt there is a problem in the international sporting arena, particularly in some sports more than others about drug use. But let's not get totally neurotic. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like Senator Richardson to explain the level of care, interest and diligence that his Government intends to apply in future to this issue of educating the public about the effects of the use of drugs in sport. He might like to tell me whether, by concerning myself about Ferranti, a 23-year-old young man who died because of drugs, I am neurotic and have gone overboard. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is a welter of evidence about Mrs Kelly's commitment. As I understand it, in the speech to which Senator Crichton-Browne referred and about which he suggested the article was written, Mrs Kelly was suggesting that we were concentrating too much on the past. She felt that we ought to be concentrating on the future and on what to do about the problem. I am not able to comment any further on Mrs Kelly's speech. I have asked for a transcript of it if one is available and, if it is, I will certainly be happy to provide further comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no doubt whatsoever that Mrs Kelly is committed to the Government's policies on eradicating drugs from sport. I would hope that no-one in the chamber and no-one listening outside would think that the Ferranti incident had anything whatsoever to do with the Australian Institute of Sport or the Australian Sports Commission. As I understand it, that person, Mr Ferranti, was not at either and so did not come within any purview of Mrs Kelly or any of her agencies. So any suggestion that in some way we are responsible or lax because of that I reject entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case, as the report points out, that particularly in powerlifting there is a great deal of abuse when it comes to drugs. That abuse is centred in a whole range of gymnasiums around the country. We hope that the States and their police forces react accordingly, find the offenders and punish them heavily. We will certainly support their doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the Commonwealth's reaction is concerned, I am told that Mrs Kelly was wrongly advised when she suggested that the 20 people to whom Senator Crichton-Browne referred as having tested positive had appeals in. I am advised, I hope this time correctly, that there are no appeals from those 20 people. I am told that 14 of them have already been dealt with; that is, punishment has already been decreed. I am informed furthermore that a percentage of those were involved with low dose medicines and no further action was deemed necessary. There is a disagreement here amongst advisers, but I will stick to what I have just said until I am properly corrected. As far as I am concerned, Mrs Kelly may have been badly advised on that. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Crichton-Browne is aware, I have advocated that when we hopefully next session put through the Bill which sets up the Australian Sports Drug Agency, the names of offenders-that is, after appropriate appeal processes have been gone through-are named in Parliament. One of the great sanctions that we will ever have in fighting drugs in sport will be the shame and humiliation that accrues to people once they are publicly exposed in the Parliament of our country as having cheated in a way that can bring degradation not just to them but to those children who at some stage in the future might try to emulate them. </PARA>

There is no doubt there is a problem in the international sporting arena, particularly in some sports more than others about drug use. But let's not get totally neurotic'. </PARA>
<PARA>Can Senator Richardson tell me what that has done for the educative process amongst sportsmen and women in Australia.

This Government absolutely rejected his views then and does now.

I have never put that proposition to anybody publicly or privately. I have done more to raise the issue of drugs in sport than almost anybody else in this Parliament. I have not sought to get a few grubby votes out of it by rubbing shoulders with the successful sports men and women of this country. But if Senator Richardson would like to produce some documentation of the type he has alluded to, I would be very interested to read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past I have raised philosophic questions that the Australian Olympic Federation was unable to answer. I asked the fundamental question: why are we going where we are? Now that I have read the strategy plan for the Australian Sports Commission, I am none the wiser.

I find it absolutely outrageous that Senator Richardson can in any way imply that I have done anything other than raise the awareness of drugs in sport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Just for the record, I note that the Commission, in its interview with Mr Wardle, concluded that the conclusion of guilt by association with Lyn Jones failed, that Mr Wardle rejected any involvement in administering steroids, that he had no knowledge of Lyn Jones administering steroids, and that there was no evidence to support terminating Mr Wardle's contract of employment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In respect of Mr Wardle, what Mr Wardle told me was almost identical with that of Mr Jones, although Mr Wardle was more restrained. I think it was more likely that the information he gave me was rehearsed with Mr Jones. The findings in respect to Mr Jones left some serious reservations about the level of his credibility with the lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not expect Senator Richardson to respond. He has now told me that it is not a report; it is something quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the strategic plan and ask Senator Richardson, as I did at the Estimates: why was the peak sport body, the Confederation of Australian Sport, not consulted prior to the strategic plan? Would Senator Richardson explain not that he and the Commission have indirect and informal communications and relationships with these bodies, but the compelling logic which would allow for this document to be prepared without any consultation? I remind him of the open forum of 60 of the biggest sports associations of the country which moved a number of general resolutions, one being:</PARA>
<PARA> Sports indicated a desire to be consulted in the strategy planning processes of the Commission. ASC Commissioners should be available at these forums to discuss issues with sports. </PARA>
<PARA>Could Senator Richardson explain why the Confederation was not directly involved in the preparation and the drafting of the strategic plan? At the end of the day, it is not the words that count; more is achieved by consultation, cooperation and consideration of each other's points of view. These plans are best developed and matured as a result of the deliberations of all those involved. At the end of the day it is not the final document that counts; it is how the process is undertaken that is important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought we went through this matter fairly comprehensively at the Estimates Committee hearing last week. At that time I said that officers of the Commission, and the Institute for that matter, are constantly in contact with representatives of all of the sports which are members of the Confederation of Australian Sport Inc. and which receive funding from the Commission. Obviously some sports associated with the Confederation do not receive Sports Commission funding so I cannot say every single sport. Also, when one talks about a conference of 60 of the biggest sports-some of the sports among the 60 are not exactly big-that does not mean some are not entitled to funding or consultation. It is my understanding that because Commission officers are constantly in contact with all of those sports, they felt that was sufficient. They did not need to speak to a peak or representative body if they had spoken to all those underneath.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, it is my view that there ought to be some closer cooperation between the Commission and the Confederation. That is why I am pleased to see that the Commission had agreed to continue funding to the Confederation to enable the Confederation to better represent the views of its constituent sports. That is an act of faith by the Commission in its belief that there is a legitimate role for the Confederation. I do not believe that we would have had a substantially different document had consultation with the peak body occurred, given the amount of consultation that had already occurred with representatives of the sports on an individual basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an excuse, not an explanation. I want to raise a number of other matters but they will have to wait for another time because of the hour. They relate very much to what one might be tempted to describe as the capricious and arbitrary funding of the various sporting organisations by the Commission. Notwithstanding the strategic plan and the general explanation the Minister has given in terms of the seven big numbers for Olympic sports, it still does not add up. I raised this matter the other night and I was told that equestrian events get funding and shooters get some funding. There is no compelling and logical explanation which would satisfy an ordinary person that more funding ought to go, on the one hand, to basketball, where we will win only one medal at best. In my view, unless God is much more willing in the future, we will not win the men's basketball events. Whereas on the other hand team sports such as shooting and equestrian events have an excellent chance of winning not only one medal but a number of medals because a number of medals are available. The logic is not there. If I offer that question on notice, will the Minister explain the answer to me at a later date?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, to the extent that Senator Richardson suggested that Mrs Kelly implied that we perhaps have looked too much in the past and not enough at the future in this question of drug use, can the Minister explain what tangible circumstances and events caused the Government to focus on providing adequate funding for drug testing at the Australian Institute of Sport and for making it conditional upon giving any grants to sporting bodies that they have appropriate mechanisms in place for drug testing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Basketball is the fastest growing spectator sport and one of the fastest growing participant sports in the country. As one of the fastest growing participant sports, it certainly fulfils all the criteria that I would have in mind for a sport that ought to be supported by the Australian Sports Commission, particularly in the lead-up to the Olympic Games where both our men's and women's teams did so well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not regard this support, and I never have, as simply a chase for medals. I thought I had made that clear at the Committee and in the Senate a number of times. I regard it as a dual matter. We seek to maximise our performance in Olympic Games and international competitions and we use our success in those arenas to increase participation rates, particularly among our young people and especially young women. One would have thought that basketball provided a phenomenal opportunity to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne spoke of equestrian events and the shooters. At the last Olympics there was considerable concern that we had taken far too many shooters and their chances of winning medals were minuscule. The way the results turned out, there is some evidence to suggest that that might have been correct. The equestrian teams were funded. They went to Seoul, but they did not come within cooee of a medal either. That is not to say that they should not be funded in the future; they will be. All the Commission has said is that there will be a concentration on the seven sports which it has nominated. I support that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also made the point that in trying to rationalise Olympic funding when it was obvious that Australia had competed in more sports than countries such as East Germany, which devote a phenomenal percentage of their gross domestic product to sport, it could have been said that we were fragmenting the effort too much. In fact, many people in Australian sport suggested at that time that in future we should attempt to take athletes in a fewer number of sports to the Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA> No decision along those lines has been taken by the Olympic Federation or the Sports Commission. All they have done is suggest that we ought to concentrate particularly on the seven sports, but-and this should be remembered-maintain the funding for other Olympic sports and increase the funding for a whole range of other sports that will never see the light of day at the Olympics. We can continue to work away at those participation rates, and that would be in line with the strategy that I outlined last August. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally reject the suggestion of some capricious allocation of funds to sports. The Sports Commission takes its responsibility in that respect very seriously and devotes a great deal of time to the process of identifying the sports that are worthy and sorting out what is an appropriate amount of money to give to each one of them. I have no objections to that. I do not remember the other part of Senator Crichton-Browne's question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As someone who went to the Olympics and as the high point of the Olympics saw Ben Johnson's win and what happened afterwards, and as someone who has been aware for quite some time of allegations of drug testing in Australia, I was certainly of the view that Australian parents would not permit their children to participate in sport in this country in the manner and number which I thought was appropriate unless the Government was seen to be taking the strongest stance possible-not just in terms of words but in terms of giving the money and resources to deliver on the promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it seems to me that the Government had to dramatically increase the funding for drug testing in sport and change the procedures by which the tests were made so they would be seen to be completely independent and unable to be questioned. That is why I made sure the money was there. That money would have been there without the general increase in sport funding because I had approached the Government separately about it to make sure that it understood that a request was on the way for a very significant increase in funding for that. There was no resistance in any part of the Government, even from the Department of Finance-and that says something-to making sure that we had adequate funds for drug testing in Australia. </PARA>

I just happen to have two names here which might jog the memories of the Minister's advisers. One of the people nominated was Mr Chris Mercer, who was formerly of Wesfarmers south-west brokerage, which was the original tenderer. I think the other person's name was Mr John Gleeson. I notice the Minister's adviser shaking his head, but I am sure that that is correct. In fact, John Gleeson, for the knowledge of the Committee, is a manager in Hobart for Beaufort Shipping Agency Co., which is the agent for Icebird. Having already established that Beaufort is the agent for Icebird and Anderson Hughes is the broker, I ask the question: given the fact that, on the one hand, we have Anderson Hughes letting the tender for the ship and, on the other hand, Beaufort acting as agent for the ship-in other words, we have the manager of Beaufort on the one hand acting as an adviser and on the other hand receiving the tender-and that the answer I received was that there was a corporate veil, surely to goodness there must be a conflict of interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the answer. As honourable senators can imagine, I was concerned when I was made aware of these matters. I will move on to the cost of tendering the Icebird compared to the Akademik Federov. I asked the following question about the difference in tendering the prices of Icebird and Akademik Federov:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At what cost was the tender put forward by Icebird for the season?</PARA>
<PARA>If honourable senators consult Hansard they will see that Mr Blunn replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Put forward or accepted?</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked, `What was accepted?' Mr Blunn answered:</PARA>
<PARA>It was just that there was a difference between the price they put forward and the price we eventually--</PARA>
<PARA>I interrupted and asked:</PARA>
<PARA> I want to know what the price was for the Icebird. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Moncur confirmed that it was $3.1m to $3.4m. I ask the Minister: What was the original tender price put forward for Icebird? Also, what was the original price put forward for Akademik Federov? If there was a difference in the price it would appear to me-I would like the Minister to answer this-that Icebird's tender was negotiated down. If that is the case, was the tender for the Akademik Federov renegotiated down; if so, what was its price?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just give some information on this matter generally. After taking account of fuel, overtime and the requirement for a fuel barge on Akademik Federov, the estimated costs of the two vessels were: Icebird, $3.6m to $3.8m for a 120- to a 133-day period, and the Akademik Federov, $3.05m. Despite the potential saving of approximately $500,000 to $800,000 in using the Akademik Federov, the unanimous recommendation of the tender evaluation group, which included two Antarctic Division officers, the Department of Administrative Services representative and a marine surveyor from the Department of Transport and Communications, was to use the Icebird.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were some good reasons for making that decision and they included: that the Icebird would be fully under Antarctic Division control, whereas the Akademik Federov offer was based on a shared operation with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) Antarctic program; the Icebird price was in Australian dollars, and the Akademik Federov price was in United States dollars and was subject to a currency variation which is, as honourable senators would agree, hazardous in this day and age; and the Icebird was available for four voyages, while the Akademik Federov offered only three. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other concerns about the Akademik Federov, including the development of schedules to meet both the Australian and the USSR programs, and its availability to operate in Mawson Harbour as its length exceeded the tender specification, the additional travel time for the Australian expeditioners, and cultural and social problems associated with joint use of the vessel over long voyages. </PARA>
<PARA> The apparent advantages of the Akademik Federov in marine science capability, long-range helicopter availability, and greater icebreaking capabilities were not regarded as significant pluses as marine science would be undertaken on the Aurora Australis. The helicopters are of limited use and the Icebird's icebreaking capability is sufficient for the period of the season for which the vessel is required. So there is a whole range of reasons why the Icebird was preferred. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the negotiations, I will have to check with the Department on this matter, but, as far as I am aware, Icebird was negotiated down. I do not believe that the Akademik Federov was negotiated down, either because that did not arise or because those involved were not prepared to negotiate down. I do not know, I will have to have that matter checked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is rather unfortunate that those involved with the Akademik Federov were not given the opportunity to renegotiate. I note the answer by the Minister that the long-range helicopters from Akademik Federov were not of much use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Minister to the five-year transport plan that I received a couple of days ago with the compliments of the Director. I was promised it last year, and I think it was an oversight that I did not receive it. It seems to me, having read it briefly, that one of the major parts of this particular report, and the whole concept of using air transport as a subsidiary to sea transport, is based around the use of long-range helicopters and Twin Otters. The recommendation in the transport plan was that any intracontinental transport system be based on the use of three long- range helicopters, with the option of using two helicopters and one Twin Otter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee hearing the other day I referred to the fact that the Minister travelled to Russia with Mr Blunn and had negotiations with the Russians on their cooperation in Antarctica. I also referred to the fact that Premier Ryzhkov visited here this year and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was so impressed that we managed to put out a stamp depicting the cooperation between Russia and Australia in Antarctica. Given the fact that the Akademik Federov is probably one of the most up-to-date icebreaking vessels in the world and, particularly given the fact that the Russians were going to throw in the use of long range helicopters for virtually nothing, we could have at least tested it out, as was envisaged in this transport plan, at far less cost. It was admitted to me in the Estimates Committee hearing that the difference in price between Akademik Federov and Icebird was $800,000. At the end of the day, the only reason I could gather for our not accepting Akademik Federov rather than Icebird was the fact that Australia had full control over Icebird whereas the Akademik Federov involved a joint venture. Even allowing for that, I would have thought the opportunity to mix with the Russian scientists, to observe their methods, and all the other things that go with it, for one season, would have been of tremendous advantage to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The ice runway plan has fallen through. I will not use the word `failure' in relation to it because I do not think that the Director would accept that word, but it seems to me that it was a futile effort to establish an ice runway. I thought it would have been an ideal opportunity to use long-range helicopters to see how the whole operation could have been used in the future. I do not expect the Minister to comment on that because he has already given me the answer-unless he has anything to add. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. When we were looking at the ice runway plan in the first place, the proposal was to use Hercules aircraft from Australia and then, base-to-base, onshore-never going offshore-use long-range helicopters. In any event, that plan fell by the wayside. It was decided that it would be much more efficient to use fixed wing Twin Otters. So we were not going to use long-range helicopters, anyway. That was further compounded by the fact that this offer involved a ship-to-shore operation-not base-to-base-which was not going to be of any use to us. The marine research capability did not matter because we have the Aurora Australis coming on-stream. We have just spent an enormous amount of money making sure we have the right ship for Australia's purposes, built in Australia and crewed by Australians. We would be crazy not to use it to its fullest. That would have been a waste of money on Australia's part. There is already considerable cooperation between Australia and scientists from the Soviet Union in the Antarctic, and that will continue. It is in no way affected by this decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, the Antarctic Division, when it is looking at the use of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, has to look at its most efficient use. There are more voyages, and they are under Australian control. That seems to me to be a tremendous improvement, particularly when we have to query the capacity of the Akademik Federov to operate in Mawson harbour. Of course, additional travel time for all Australian expeditioners would result because the vessel would have been calling in at other places, quite apart from the ones that were required by us. There are a whole range of reasons for the decision. I doubt very much that the Antarctic Division or, indeed, the evaluation group, would have had any other choice but to opt for the Icebird. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested to hear that the use of helicopters is a waste of time. I was aware that early in the season and late in the season the use of helicopters, particularly ship to shore, is most essential. Obviously, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is not going to answer any more questions on that particular subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two other matters I wish to raise. The first concerns answers I was given about the charter of the Icebird. I asked how much was going to be paid under the charter contract for 1989-90, and was given the figure of $8m. I do not argue with that. The price for Icebird this year is less than half. I was given a couple of answers which both Senator Collins, who was in the chair, and I accepted as being right-that the reason it was less than half was a result of the difference between deutschmarks and dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the five-year Icebird contract, the starting figure in 1985-86 was 45,500 deutschmarks and, if one allows for the increase in inflation, the figure is brought up to about 58,900 deutschmarks per day in 1989-90. If deutschmarks continue to be used, the figure this year for the Icebird is 32,000 deutschmarks per day-about half the cost it would have been. Whether one uses dollars or deutschmarks, the fact is that the Icebird charter that was negotiated by the director this year is half the price it should have been. I ask the question I asked before: Why is the price in 1990-91 half what it was in 1989-90? Are corners being cut that will prejudice safety, or were we being ripped off before?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is going to check that, because the figures I have got, as I said, whether one uses deutschmarks or dollars and allowing for inflation, indicate that it is half. It is good to know that it has been negotiated to a half. All I want to know is why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter-and it is a matter of clarification-is that I asked questions about a report which I was told came from a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot-not an engineer-who was part of that particular ice runway project. Is it a fact that that particular pilot was a squadron leader who was in charge of the RAAF contingent?</PARA>

In fact, when I read the report that was given to me, I found out that he was Squadron Leader Nattrass, who was in charge of the Royal Australian Air Force contingent. In this particular report he raised all the matters that I asked about safety-and it was quite a damaging report. I have been told that there is another report coming, but I do not think we can just discount this report. It has an accompanying letter from his commanding officer, Group Captain Harris, and I just think that more weight should have been given to answering those questions about all the risks involved with weather and runway strength-all the questions I raised last year when Senator Richardson said that this was something new and you-beaut but which has turned out to be an utter flop.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proof roller went through the runway. That is why it was decided to call it off. He may have left but this still does not get away from the comments he made. I sum up by saying that he said that from an Air Force point of view `the support of the ice snow runway concept is a proposition of diminishing returns'. I think that sums up the opinion of the Air Force about this ice runway. I note that the director has been quoted as saying that it has totally discounted any idea of a gravel runway. It is a pity that this whole exercise, which cost over $1.1m of taxpayers' money-the Minister told me it would cost $387,000-has really been done for nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>

Anything that is done in the Antarctic obviously costs an awful lot of money. Getting people and equipment there is an incredibly expensive business. That does not mean, with the lives of so many Australians down there, and not always in the best of conditions, that we are prepared to simply rest on our laurels. We will try to seek better ways of getting people to and from the Antarctic as often as we can within reason.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak for a few minutes this afternoon on the report of the Standing Committee of Privileges presented by Senator Giles earlier today which details a response by Mr A. Harris, the Chairman of Australian Airlines Ltd and the Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission. This is a further stage in what is now becoming a rather tedious exercise on the part of Mr Harris. It is a quite proper use of the parliamentary procedures, particularly the procedures of the Senate, that Mr Harris should seek to put a point of view before the Senate in this way, but implied in the provision for a response such as this to be made is the clear implication that, if the facility is to be used, there has to be some justification for the Senate's time, particularly the time of the Privileges Committee, being taken up in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the response provided by Mr Harris today he does nothing at all to justify the use of the Senate's time, least of all to counter the charges made against him by me earlier. I wonder about Mr Harris's judgment when he embarks on this view. I view his response with some gravity, particularly because it does not address the points that I raised initially. The report of Mr Harris certainly merits far more time than the five or ten minutes I will take this afternoon to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the heart of the matter is the right of freedom of speech of members in this Parliament. I hold this right of freedom of speech very dearly. I will support anyone, on any side of the chamber, to not see their rights impaired in any way at all. It is a right that derives from the Parliamentary Act 1987. This, in turn, derives its power from section 49 of the Australian Constitution. It goes back through the House of Commons and the British Parliament, right back to the original Bill of Rights. It is a very cherished position that members of parliament hold. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of the longest serving senators in this Parliament I have been involved in all the controversies that have come before us in the last 12 years. I have taken my part in those debates. I have never had anyone write to me the way Mr Harris wrote to me during the pilots dispute. I have never had a letter like that, let alone three letters. Again, it is Mr Harris's right to do so, but I very much question the intention behind writing those letters because the charge that I made against Mr Harris was that he set out quite clearly to intimidate and to bully me and to force me into silence. Of course, he failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The origins of this exercise this afternoon lie in the pilots dispute last year. Mr Harris's involvement came about because he is the Chairman of Australian Airlines. I served on the two Senate committees which dealt with the pilots dispute-the original Estimates Committee, which went into the procedures that were followed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in granting air operator certificates and licence validations for overseas aircrew and the general conduct of that Authority through the pilots dispute, and the Select Committee into Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I also spoke on the matter in the chamber whenever it was opportune to do so during, for example, matters of public importance. So I had a central part in it. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that I received three letters: two written to me, the third one to the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges, and all were widely distributed. The intention of all three letters was clearly to intimidate me and force me into silence. It is a matter of history that it had no effect whatsoever nor will it have any effect. I made no response to those letters for two reasons. The first was that I viewed them as beneath contempt and, secondly, they were clearly provocative. After the third one I was forced to respond, which I did on 19 December 1989. In a very measured and moderate way I answered the charges raised by Mr Harris in those letters. That should have ended the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now deal with the purpose of the twenty-third report of the Privileges Committee. As I said at the outset, Mr Harris has every entitlement to put his view-and I do not question that at all, nor do I question the actions of the Privileges Committee. I believe the report of the Privileges Committee is a very proper and correct report and no blame at all attaches to its members for the situation that they were put in. The first point in Mr Harris's response is to claim that:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon sought to bring to the attention of the Senate what he regarded as a serious attack on the rights of Senators to perform their duties and to discharge their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harris tries to assert that it was not a very serious dispute. Mr Harris quotes from his first letter. He does not quote from the second letter, nor from the third. It is a very selective use. I believe that one could argue the case from the first letter that it was possible to come to the conclusion that Mr Harris was not out to intimidate me although I took it to be so at the time, and still do. I was proved correct in my judgment of that by the subsequent letters that arrived. He was very selective in not quoting from the second letter. The second letter ends with the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless you advise that you were incorrectly reported in the press or you are able to substantiate any of the allegations you have made, which are requested by return facsimile, the Board seeks an immediate retraction of your comments in the next session of the public inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>That reflects the whole tone of the letter. For the record, let me say that I view all three letters very seriously as an attempt to influence me and to suppress my comments within this Parliament on matters that are properly within my preserve in the public community. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point raised in Mr Harris's response is the fact that Australian Airlines exerted no pressure on the Civil Aviation Authority. I do not really want to argue the case as I did before but I do want to say that it was clearly shown before the Committee at the time that one of the major airlines influenced the CAA very clearly-and I believe improperly-with respect to the granting of licences to some French aircrew. That was proved beyond dispute. It also became transparently obvious that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who made no secret of his direct involvement, was talking with his very old friend Sir Peter Abeles and his other very old friend Mr A. E. Harris continually throughout the dispute. In short, all three major players knew what was happening at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> The next important point in Mr Harris's comment relates to an abridged reference to the second letter which is not quoted. In that letter Mr Harris is clearly fencing with words when he said that he had no part in the preparation and dispatch of that letter, that it came from the Board of Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that literally as being true, but I also accept that it means absolutely nothing. Mr Harris is Chairman of the Board. Mr Harris knew exactly what the resolution of the Board was and almost certainly proposed that I be written to in this intimidatory way by the Board. If he did not propose it, he had one of his friends on the Board propose it. Clearly, he took part in the debate and did not oppose it. Had he opposed it, it would not have gone out. His disclaimer that he took no part in the preparation or dispatch of it is misleading and, in my judgment, quite dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another point of dishonesty in Mr Harris's second letter. He attacked me in that second letter for making derogatory comments about his director of operations-a Mr David Wiltshire. I said nothing about Mr Wiltshire, as the Hansard record showed. In Mr Harris's third letter, he tacitly conceded that that was so because he then attacked my colleague Senator Brownhill for making the statements. However, he did not have the courtesy or good manners to apologise. That was his second act of dishonesty in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harris dealt with the matter of Senator Puplick that I referred to in my speech on the adjournment that night in December. That is very revealing of Mr Harris's view on life because he made no apology and there was no sign of remorse in his statement to the Privileges Committee about what he said about Senator Puplick. Mr Harris said:</PARA>
<PARA>I categorically deny that I have at any time, or on that occasion, behaved other than as befits the holder of a public office seeking to properly address issues which might have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue that Senator Puplick raised was the fact that he was attacked by Mr Harris because he dared to question one of the representatives of the Australian Sports Commission before an Estimates committee. Mr Harris's response to that was to write to Senator Puplick and Mr Valder, who was then the Federal President of the Liberal Party, very bluntly and crudely pointing out that if this intolerable behaviour of a Liberal Party representative-namely, Senator Puplick-was perpetuated there would not be any funds raised for the Liberal Party around Australia. But there is not a word of apology for that sort of action which I outlined in my speech of that night. It is dismissed in this misleading way in the paragraph on page 5 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harris is concerned that I commented on the fact that he enjoys certain positions which coincide with the tenure of Mr Hawke as Prime Minister. All I did was pass an observation on that. I did not comment on the correctness or incorrectness of it. Quite clearly, it is a matter of obvious distress to Mr Harris. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harris's letter to the Privileges Committee, I believe, has been a waste of time because none of his points stand up under analysis. Briefly, Mr Harris's history is that he has attacked Senator Puplick for exercising the proper duties of a senator in this Parliament, he has attacked me, and I am aware that he has issued a writ against another member of this Parliament because he dared to say that he was a friend of Mr Hawke. Hours and hours of the Senate's time have been taken up today by Senator Crichton-Browne talking about Mr Harris's stewardship as Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission. Quite clearly, Senator Crichton-Browne was telling the Senate that Mr Harris treated this Parliament with utter contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> When the drugs in sport committee sought answers to questions about how members of the Commission conducted themselves with respect to the provision of drugs and other matters, Mr Harris did not give them the courtesy of a measured response. Obviously, he took the view that Senator Black, as Chairman, Senator Crichton-Browne as Deputy Chairman, and other members of the Committee were ants to be crushed under his feet. The important thing was that he knew Mr Hawke and he was not going to answer to the Parliament for anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the slightest interest in how Mr Harris behaves and how he conducts his personal life, his social life, or his business life. My only concern is when it intrudes upon my own affairs and particularly in the discharge of my public duties. I will not be stood over, I will not be intimidated and I will not be bullied by any thugs in this country in the discharge of my public duties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for keeping the Senate, and I will be as brief as I can. Under the guise of questioning the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) about procedures for cleansing the electoral rolls in the remote areas of Western Australia, Senator Crichton-Browne patronised and denigrated his constituents and mine, implying that ballots had not been correctly conducted, specifically during mobile polling in the Kimberley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He professed to be amazed at the high vote for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the low percentage of informal votes, making insulting assumptions about the political knowledge and perspicacity of the Aboriginal voters of the region who, incidentally, get their exposure to election propaganda in exactly the same way as most Australians do-via television. Those Aboriginal voters would have seen, as did many other Australians, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, committing himself to cutting funding for Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne studiously ignored other obvious reasons for the high ALP vote and the low rate of informal voting. The electors in the Kimberley have every reason to take an intelligent interest in politics. They have a conscientious member in Graeme Campbell who has their interests at heart and who works tirelessly for his constituency. The same applies to the State Labor members, Ernie Bridge, Tom Stephens and Tom Helm. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, under Labor, both State and Federal, the Aborigines in this area, as in the rest of Australia, have seen dramatic changes in their standard of living over the last few years, encouragement of the out-station movement, greatly improved housing, health and education and, more than anything else, respect for their cultures and traditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the people in this area particularly recall clearly the Court of Disputed Returns in 1977 and the disgraceful incidents which led to that inquiry, including intimidation of voters and at least one attempt to intoxicate voters. The result of that Court of Disputed Returns was a damning indictment of the Western Australian Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, at which time Senator Crichton-Browne was a very influential officer. The saga of Noonkanbah, that black blot on Western Australian Liberal history, occurred only 10 years ago-the blink of an eye compared with the centuries of Aboriginal history and tradition. Why would any Kimberley Aboriginal vote Liberal? This is tacitly acknowledged, I might say, by the fact that the Western Australian Liberal hierarchy apparently thought it pointless to send scrutineers to many of the Kimberley booths. I know of at least nine where there was no Liberal presence at all. </PARA>
<PARA> My observations of the 1990 election led me to believe that voter education had been thorough and effective, and I congratulate the Australian Electoral Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs officers who were responsible for this. Those who were unable to vote because of infirmity or illiteracy knew very well that they were entitled to seek assistance, and that assistance was given by a range of people-not only scrutineers-and more often was given by officers of the Electoral Commission, community managers or leaders or other members of the communities, as is absolutely legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA> Aborigines demonstrated their capacity to actually conduct the ballot, under supervision of course, on this occasion. My experience once again led me to admire the way in which they were able to deal very effectively with the mechanics of conducting polling procedures. Despite what has been alleged, multiple voting would be most unlikely in areas of this sort because of the close knowledge of the officers of the Electoral Commission of the people who were assisting them, and the great affinity between particular groups in the area. It just would be known if one individual was appearing several times on the rolls, as has been alleged by Senator Crichton-Browne. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia for decades there were attempts to stop people voting, to stop them getting onto the electoral rolls. This has completely changed. We are doing everything we can now to make certain that everybody has the opportunity to vote as, in fact, people are required to do by laws. </PARA>
<PARA> In completing my contribution this afternoon, I would like to recount what happened in Wiluna and Meekatharra in 1983. I witnessed pastoralists standing at the door of the Wiluna polling booth threatening Aboriginals that if they voted they would never again be employed in the area. At the Meekatharra polling booth, I heard the Liberal scrutineer say very loudly, `These people should not be allowed to vote. They don't even speak Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
