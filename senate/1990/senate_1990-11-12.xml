<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the statement by the official spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, dated 19 October 1990, which states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government of India expresses its dismay and unhappiness with the decision of the Government of Australia to ship 50 Mirage-III aircraft shortly to Pakistan . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to assurances given by Foreign Minister of Australia during his talks with External Affairs Minister in New Delhi in August 1990, the Australian Government has unfortunately chosen to ignore the realities of the situation in the region and gone ahead with the deal . . . We had least expected that a friendly Australia would take action which has the effect of further disturbing stability of the region.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Is this the statement of the Indian foreign ministry which the Minister says was fundamentally wrong? Are those in India who have indicated that bilateral ministerial talks have now been cancelled also fundamentally wrong?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the statement I was referring to. The suggestion that Australia had acted contrary to assurances given was fundamentally and absolutely wrong and justified the terms of my reaction to it. It was the subject of a press release I put out at the time-I do not have a copy of that with me. I do have with me, however, a copy of something which I meant to table the other day in light of Senator Teague's question about what I had said in Pakistan on the subject. I have a bit of paper which has the relevant extracts of my public press conferences, both in New Delhi on Thursday, 2 August and in Islamabad on Sunday, 5 August, which goes to the question of the delivery dates and what I actually said, which is the assurance that allegedly was given and has now been broken. I gave no such assurance. What I said on the public record makes that perfectly clear. I was hardly likely to say on the public record something different from what I was saying privately, for very obvious reasons. I seek leave to incorporate those two extracts in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Extract of press conference at Shastri Bhavan, New Delhi on Thursday 2 August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> Question from Ashok Sharma (PTI): What is the time framework with Pakistan for the actual delivery of the aircraft?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans: The contract spoke in terms of delivery within six months of the date of agreement, i.e. by mid-October, subject to mutually agreed shipping arrangements being worked out. In practice there has been some slippage in the working out of those shipping arrangements and my present understanding is that the actual delivery of the crated up aircraft will be somewhat further delayed. The fact that there has been that delay is, I think, proof in itself of the fact that these are not regarded as exactly super top priority military acquisitions by Pakistan. What we are talking about here is appearances rather than substance, but appearances in diplomacy and politics can be very important, as we all know.</PARA>
<PARA> Extract of press conference with Pakistani press, Islamabad, Sunday 5 August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> Question from Reuters Journalist: Are there still any difficulties with this Mirage deal, or is it finally settled and when will the delivery take place?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans: . . . In terms of the actual delivery schedule, it was the terms of the contract that those deliveries occur within six months of the final agreement being entered into in April this year. That delivery schedule, I think, has slipped a bit, through no fault of anyone and no deliberate decision by anyone. It may be that deliveries will not occur now until the early part of next year, but that remains to be seen and the general principles that will govern this matter are as I have just described.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the question of the alleged cancellation of a ministerial meeting, there has been no cancellation of a meeting because no such meeting was ever scheduled. In the context of an anticipated meeting of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers in New Delhi early in December, there was some initial exploratory discussion of the possibility of bringing forward a joint ministerial meeting at that time. But there were difficulties about dates that had simply not been bedded down in any way. There was continuing uncertainty as to the dates of the Foreign Ministers meeting on southern Africa. In fact, in the last 48 hours, that meeting has now been deferred. It will not take place until early next year. The press report this morning on that subject was as big a beat up as most of the reports on this whole issue have been throughout.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I refer to an investigation into the airline crash in Britain last year when a Boeing 737-400 crashed across a motorway. The main recommendations coming from that investigation included a recommendation that the floors of aircraft be strengthened and that passenger seats be faced backwards, rather than forwards, for safety. Given that one Australian domestic airline has just purchased some of this type of aircraft, can the Minister indicate whether these recommendations will be looked at by aviation authorities in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Maguire's question is yes, they will. I should point out to Senator Maguire that, for the purposes of pilot endorsement, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has identified this aircraft type as being distinctly different from the earlier models of 737-200s and 300s that operate in Australia. The report of the British authorities into this disaster in Great Britain has only just been completed. The CAA is not yet in possession of the report of that incident, but it will be getting it and it will pay due regard to the recommendations of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Government made a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal to increase the salaries of senior members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by 6 per cent from 1 January? If so, what is the basis of the Government's decision? Will it lead to a national wage claim of 6 per cent by all salary and wage earners, as threatened by Mr Kelty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, or more accurately I, as representative of the Government, early last week referred a matter to the Remuneration Tribunal for determination. I did so routinely, before it became known what the September quarter consumer price index (CPI) figure would be. There was a return of 0.7 per cent for the September quarter CPI figure, the September quarter being the critical quarter as far as the accord is concerned. The first wage increase under accord mark 6 applies as the percentage that comes out of the September quarter figure. I referred the matter to the Tribunal before the September quarter figure was known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That September quarter figure is quite a significant result for the Government. As a consequence of that result for the Government, we have an unrivalled opportunity to break the cycle of inflation and to put Australia in a better competitive position with our trading partners. The only way in which we can do that is by operating with and through the accord. I am now looking closely at the effect that September quarter return will have on the accord and wages policy generally. Because I am, I will include in that examination the matter we have referred to the Remuneration Tribunal concerning the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I asked specifically whether the submission had recommended an increase of 6 per cent as from 1 January for senior members of the Tribunal. Is the Minister saying that it did but he will now review it? If he is not saying that, what is he saying?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I made it fairly clear. I said that last week I referred the matter. Senator Durack in his question referred to 6 per cent; the proposition we referred to the Remuneration Tribunal was for 6 per cent. In the normal course of events, one would expect the Remuneration Tribunal to receive our notification and then, in the appropriate way and the appropriate form, deal with it. What I am saying in answer to Senator Durack's question is that yes, we referred it, but that was before the September quarter CPI figure came out. The September quarter CPI was 0.7 per cent. Most of the pundits predicted 1.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a consequence of that return, we now have an unrivalled opportunity in this country. We would be foolish in the extreme if, not using the strength of the accord and the relationship created by it, we did not look at overall wages policy and overall opportunities created to break out of the cycle of inflation. As a consequence, we will do that. We will include in that examination, as we would include all wages and salaries in that examination, the question of the reference that Senator Durack asked me about.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Firstly, following the success of Anne Fairbairn in gaining the release of two Australian hostages, and in light of the Iraqi Ambassador's undertaking that all Australian hostages would be released if Australian ships were withdrawn from the Gulf, is the Government continuing with its negative attitudes toward hostage relief initiatives, such as that proposed by Tom Uren and Janine Haines, so as to conform with the United States Government's hard line in order to support its non-negotiating position? Secondly, does the Australian Government support the views expressed in the United States and in Britain that Iraq has to be militarily demolished even if it leaves Kuwait and that this would be tantamount to killing the monster that 30 countries from the West, the Soviet Bloc and the Third World all helped to create by unashamedly selling weapons to Iraq during the last decade? Thirdly, can the Government clarify its intentions if war breaks out in the Gulf? What would be the chain of command in the event of an armed conflict given the current de facto command position of the United States military?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3863" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first part of the question concerning hostages, the position taken by the Government-which has been explained by me on innumerable occasions and I do not propose to repeat all of that again now-is not one that has been determined by the United States or anyone else. It has been a position determined by the Australian Government on the basis of our best judgment and it is no different from the position adopted by just about every other country involved in this exercise. I remind Senator Vallentine and the Senate that the Economic Community Foreign Ministers, meeting in Rome on 16 November, unanimously reaffirmed their opposition to any form of official sanction for unilateral negotiations with Iraq for the release of hostages. It did not agree on the formal proscription of such visits, nor has Australia; but, as with us, there is simply no official encouragement being given to such visits for all of the obvious reasons that we have spelt out. The Japanese Government, again, has emphasised that former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone's visit was private and Japan has restated its view that Iraq has to release all hostages unconditionally. The New Zealand Government's position on such visits is also totally consistent with ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must emphasise that while there has been some success by private emissaries in these various `pilgrimages to the Baghdad bazaar'-as my Belgium foreign ministerial colleague put it-in securing the release of a number of hostages, in fact now some 500 of them, it has to be remembered that there are still around 4,000 west Europeans, Americans, Japanese, Australians and other nationals left and they are either detained at strategic installations-and there are still some 400 people in that category-or are otherwise unable to leave Iraq and Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> The main focus of our activity, acting in consort, conjunction, solidarity and coherence with the international community, has to be on putting pressure on Iraq to comply with its international legal obligation to release unconditionally and immediately, not just a handful of people from time to time to its own timetable and for its own propaganda advantage, but all foreign citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second part of the question about the objective of military demolition of Iraq being necessary to be accomplished, the situation is that the position of the United States and Britain, Australia for that matter and, to my knowledge everyone else participating in the Gulf exercise, is to ensure the success of the United Nations resolution-the United Nations Security Council's stated objectives. That does not require Iraq to be militarily demolished. The objective primarily is to ensure the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait and the release of all foreign nationals who wish to leave. Our policy and that of these other countries in every case is toward achieving those objectives by peaceful means if that is humanly possible. If it cannot be achieved by peaceful means, we do have to contemplate the military option. It needs to be appreciated that the objectives have been deliberately cast in that form so as to not make necessary the military demolition of Iraq for the successful accomplishment of the Gulf task. The basic objectives that are spelt out in the Security Council resolution are objectives that are capable of being secured without full scale or any other military action.</PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, crucial that in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis there be a reshaping, somehow, of the military balance of the region; and that there be some containment exercise or other security precautions put in place involving, preferably, large scale arms control agreements. But all of those things can be accomplished without the dramatic or comprehensive military down-sizing that some people seem to misunderstand to be part of the basic objectives of the international community. We believe that the core objectives, including the objective of a saner and safer security environment generally in the Middle East in the future, can be achieved by the effective and sustained application of economic sanctions by the international community.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last question concerning Australia's position if a wider conflict occurs in the Gulf, I can only say again that the Government will need to make decisions on that matter in the circumstances applicable at the time. I do not propose to speculate now on what are merely hypothetical questions. The only point I further offer by way of correction is that there is not a current de facto command situation, so far as the United States military is concerned, in relation to the Australian ships. The truth of the matter is that Australian ships are operating under their own command. There are coordination arrangements, but Australian personnel and Australian ships are not subject to orders from any other country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his answer and I ask him to clarify whether the Australian Government is attempting to ensure that there would be United Nations command in the event of the outbreak of hostilities. That position has not been clarified. I would also like him to spell out whether the Australian Government is prepared to withdraw support from the United States' provocative war preparation position, which does not give any credence any longer to a negotiated settlement in light of the disaffection with that position expressed recently by France, for example. I do not think the Minister can claim that there is total accord in the international community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, the Australian Government does not dissociate itself from the military preparations in which the United States and other countries participating in the Gulf are presently engaged, for the very obvious reason that it is very important indeed that Saddam Hussein understand that unless he does withdraw from the Gulf, unless he does respond to all the pressure that is put on him at the moment-which we hope will be successful in its own right through economic sanctions-there is inexorably and inevitably awaiting him at the end of the trail a military conflict, and a military conflict that he cannot win and must not win.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is entirely appropriate that the international community, led in this instance by the United States, be engaging in the kind of preparation to ensure that message is communicated loud and clear. If Senator Vallentine, with her sense of hearing, cannot understand that message, I am unhappy for her, but I can assure her that it is a message that cannot now but have been heard by the Iraqi leadership and that, in the interests of peace and security in the Gulf, is what should be the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that the Government will not dissociate itself from military preparations, my question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Can the Minister confirm that under section 10 of the National Service Act 1951 all that is required to reactivate conscription in this country is the publishing by the Minister-that is, the Minister for Defence-of a notice in the Gazette? Will the Minister explain why the Prime Minister failed to rule out the introduction of conscription in the event of war in the Middle East? Will the Minister explain the level of support that the Government is prepared to give President Bush if hostilities break out in the Middle East-in the light of the assurance we have just had from the Foreign Minister that the Government is prepared to participate in military preparations-and would this necessarily include conscripting young Australians?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been given a great example of someone sitting in a chair over there listening to my colleague, Senator Evans, and totally distorting and misleading this place about what Senator Evans said. Let me go to the first point raised by Senator McLean, and that is on the more technical nature. I have to say that his proposition is completely without substance. The national service scheme was abolished by administrative measures immediately after the election of the Whitlam Government in December 1972. An example of that was by the indefinite deferral of all obligations to register and by offering discharge to national servicemen in the Army. The National Service Act was not repealed at the time because some national servicemen continued to serve in the Army and it was necessary to keep the Act in force. However, the National Service Termination Bill 1973 was passed. This made it clear that no-one is liable to register or render service under the National Service Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear beyond all doubt that the National Service Act could not be revived by any Executive or administrative action. Furthermore, all the provisions of the Defence Act which referred to national servicemen and included them in the composition of the Army were repealed by the last Defence Force Re-organisation Act 1975, after the last national serviceman left the Army. It is perfectly plain that the National Service Act is completely defunct. There is no way it could be revived, except by a substantial legislative exercise-that is, if anyone wanted to revive it.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator McLean's question asked why the Prime Minister has not ruled it out. I simply ask the question: Why should the Prime Minister waste his time chasing down every idiotic press release that the Australian Democrats put out? I could easily come into this place and be provocative and call the Democrats lackeys of Saddam Hussein if only to get a bit of publicity, et cetera, but I do not do so. I try to play politics at least in a rational way. But the Democrats' exercises over the last two days have been real cheap shots, especially the statement by their Leader yesterday. They have sat down and thought, `How can we jack up this issue and get some publicity? Let's reintroduce the conscription issue'.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question: Will we reintroduce subscription?, the answer is no. Senator McLean also asked us to speculate on what this Government's reaction would be to a set of future and hypothetical situations. I will not give an answer to that other than assure him that we look at every scenario in advance and plan accordingly. But it is not proper, and no-one would expect us to do so, to publicly announce what we would do today if hostilities broke out in the Middle East in the future.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of particular relevance to the State of Tasmania that Senator Walters represents. It is very important for people going to sea in small boats, particularly when they are responsible for the lives of others, as was the case here-two young children-to make sure that they go to sea equipped with a satellite compatible EPIRB; that is, an emergency position indicating radio beacon. The only way they can be certain of that is to make sure they have purchased one of these beacons since June this year. Prior to June, the EPIRBs that were produced were for terrestrial systems. Some were produced for satellite systems and, regrettably, some people are still under the impression that all of them are satellite compatible. They are not. The consequences could be tragic for people that are still under that impression. The only way that people can be certain they have EPIRBs that are compatible with the new satellite system that has been in use since late last year is to have purchased these EPIRBs at a cost of just over $200 since June this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the two cases that occurred on the same day last week, both gave very dramatic point to how successful this system is in saving lives. Both incidents occurred on Thursday last week. In the first a satellite signal was transmitted to the ground station at Alice Springs and then transmitted to the Sea Safety Centre in Canberra from a yacht which was stranded near Osprey Reef in the Coral Sea.</PARA>
<PARA>  A Coastwatch aircraft, that is a coastal surveillance aircraft, was dispatched immediately by the Sea Safety Centre and discovered a man and two young children stranded on that sinking yacht. They were winched off the yacht by helicopter and landed at Cairns, and their lives were thereby saved. In a second incident on the same day a Cathay Pacific airliner over the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia reported hearing distress signals from an EPIRB. These signals were confirmed by a second aircraft and almost immediately afterwards the exact position of the yacht was pinpointed by the satellite system and transmitted to Canberra. Again, a coastal surveillance aircraft was immediately dispatched and successfully located the yacht. On this occasion two vessels were diverted and took the yacht in tow. As a result six lives were saved which otherwise may well have been-in the case of one of the yachts they certainly would have been-lost. I take this opportunity again to stress that all people going to sea in boats should make the very modest investment of a little over $200 and make sure they have an EPIRB which was purchased after June this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to the answer to a question without notice given by the Minister last Wednesday which referred to a possible Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry into the level of executive salary increases that he said were in the range of 16.5 per cent. Will such an inquiry include in its terms of reference those senior staff in his and other ministerial offices who have received salary increases of up to 35 per cent, plus additional fringe benefits? If not, why not? Is the level of salary increase there more than double the level of increase in the private sector to which the Minister referred?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this chamber there have been some cheap shots and we have just seen another of them. In respect of the Prices Surveillance Authority, I propose to have a discussion with the responsible Minister, Mr Simon Crean, about whether the PSA can in fact require there to be shown in applications before the Prices Surveillance Authority what the level of executive remuneration is, and have that clearly reported so a comparison can be made between the wage restraint being conducted by ordinary Australian wage and salary earners within the guidelines of the Industrial Relations Commission wage fixing principles and what, on the evidence, appears to be rapacious rip-offs by some senior executives in some companies. Where those rip-offs are the case and a particular company or industry is applying for price increases-that is, applying to pass on the rip-offs to consumers in the form of higher prices-those rip-offs should be reduced out of any price increases. That is what I am proposing to do and I look forward to having those discussions with Simon Crean shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cheap shot comes in the second part of the question about ministerial staff. The adjustments to ministerial staff are in the province of Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Administrative Services. The adjustments were determined according to the appropriate wage fixing principles after a substantial period in which the salaries of that class of officer had not been reviewed. If the increases are larger than would normally be the case, it is to do with the fact that there has been a significant delay in review for this class of officer and no provision over that time for the adjustments that appropriately ought to have been made.</PARA>
<PARA> The last point I make about this is that since it has been within the guidelines, the level of remuneration that has been referred to-and I have seen some reports in the press-has been fixed so there is an upper and a lower level of the range. Where the performance of ministerial staff members is properly assessed, they are then placed within the range so there is a recognition of their performance and an incentive for continued and improved performance. There is also a recognition of the hours they work and the type of obligations and responsibilities they bear and the right remuneration is paid for those types of penalties as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. It concerns the number of complaints I have received regarding insurance and the insurance industry. What steps is the Government taking, if any, to address what are very legitimate complaints of consumers about the insurance industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3867" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives receive representations from policyholders and those who have made application for insurance, but particularly claimants under various insurance contracts, which reveal first of all a difficulty in the comprehension of the terms of the various arrangements they are asked to enter into, and then, of course, when making a claim, a difficulty in pursuing that claim where the insurance company resists the ordinary expectation of the holder of the policy to a payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, there have been various moves within the insurance industry over the last year to try to come to grips with these complaints and to provide a system whereby complaints could be handled in an expeditious, fair and impartial manner. To that end, both the Life Insurance Federation of Australia (LIFA) and the Insurance Council of Australia, dealing respectively with life assurance and general insurance, have been devising a scheme to provide for the resolution of such complaints. That particular scheme, I hope, will be in place if not by the end of this year then early next year.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the operation of the Industry Ombudsman has already been a very successful operation. The banks have constituted Mr McDonald as the Banking Industry Ombudsman to oversee the complaint resolution process operating throughout the banking system in Australia. There is no need to slavishly adopt that particular model, but it is important that the life insurance and the general insurance industries do provide a complaint resolution process. I hope that with further consultation with consumer groups, which is being undertaken at this very moment by LIFA and by the Insurance Council of Australia, a system of complaint resolution can be established that will have the confidence of policyholders and the insurance companies-and both sides need to have confidence in the process.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand also that in relation to certain superannuation, which is another cause of some confusion and concern in the Australian community as superannuation becomes more widely available throughout the community, particularly, as we know, with the very successful extension of superannuation entitlements to workers under their awards, the Treasurer has indicated that he will be promulgating regulations which will disclose more about the promotional and administrative fees which are involved in the provision of superannuation. I believe that that will be very satisfactory from the point of view of those out in the community, to which Senator Crowley refers.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition in that matter I have asked the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, headed by Justice Paul Stein, to look at the question of superannuation and consumers because this will be a matter of growing concern over the coming decade as more and more Australians have the benefit and entitlement to this particular provision. In answer to Senator Crowley, I would say that there is a considerable amount of activity in relation to resolving disputes and complaints between insurance companies and consumers and I believe that we are well on the way to having a fair, impartial and expeditious system of resolution of these disputes being constituted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. Was the Minister or his then Department of Immigration responsible for initiating the proposal for his Department to spend additional funds on the grant in aid scheme, the migrant access project scheme and supplementation for the pilot access and equity projects amounting to $2.75m immediately before the last Federal election, which was described in the Minister's submission, I understand, as an election ploy; or did the proposals originate in the Office of Multicultural Affairs within the Prime Minister's Department? Why were the pilot access and equity projects one-off grants? Did they originate from detailed submissions with stated objectives and criteria for review?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3868" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in an awkward position not because of the question but because of the portfolio responsibility that it covers. It is not normal in this chamber that one answers questions on one's previous portfolio. I must say that that is very frustrating at times. It is a very frustrating process that one disciplines oneself not to comment outside the Cabinet room on other portfolio areas. We do not have the same restraints placed on us within Cabinet where, with a lot of ex-Ministers, it is a long meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear to Senator Michael Baume that any submission I brought forward was absolutely my own submission. Any of the arguments I put in Cabinet in favour of that submission were well based. There was a requirement in terms of the pilot equity and access projects (PEAP) scheme where we were following a policy of gradually easing out established grants in aid. When grant in aid was first instituted, it was meant to be a temporary three-year thing under the previous Government. What it became was an institutionalised, always renewable grant. What that tended to do was bottle up grants in established communities. As the Government moved its policy away from established communities to where the grant in aid scheme was regarded as essential, that is, to the newer communities, certain gaps were created that were undesirable in some of the more established communities, especially some of those that had ageing communities because they then had different needs apart from the new settlers. That was the origin of the PEAP scheme. It was not meant to be a scheme that lasted for several years. It did not start during that Cabinet submission, incidentally, but many, many months before. It was announced and Senator Baume would have first come across it when I answered questions here and in Estimates Committee about dealings with the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other two matters that were in that submission and got funding, one was the migrant access project (MAP) scheme. The intention of that particular scheme was: are grants in aid the most appropriate way or can we move to project funding? I think that there is a strong argument for project funding because at least it gets round the problem that every grant has to be automatically renewed politically. I do not mean in a partisan way; I mean that once a grant is given, it is very hard to take it away. Therefore, the MAP scheme was an experimental scheme to go to project funding rather than personnel funding.</PARA>
<PARA> On the final matter of an increase in grants in aid-I enthusiastically supported that for the 20 months in which I was Minister for Immigration, again to try to break that bottleneck and to try to get some grants in aid to the very newly arrived ethnic communities, and there are many of them. It was my belief that by the established communities bottling up those grants in aid we were failing to get money to very desperately needed areas. I had no hesitation in supporting that Cabinet submission. It was my initiative and it is one of which I am quite proud.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A thorough search of the Immigration Department records will show that the aim of both the PEAP scheme and the MAP scheme and my intention throughout the 20 months that I was Immigration Minister was to increase grants in this particular area. All sorts of input comes in, but I stress that the initiative was mine and not theirs. They do, of course, feed in. I also have to caution the honourable senator on the veracity of Finance coordinating comments over the years. Often I have not found them to be as well based as they should be. That seems to be the case irrespective of who the Finance Minister is because nothing has changed in the last few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to stress that it is the Finance Department's job to play the devil's advocate, to put the blow torch to every submission that comes before Cabinet and to use every tactic possible to test rather than to assert. I think that part of its process was to put those remarks in to test that particular process. Sure, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has always consulted on those particular matters to get a view because it also deals in a hands on way. It is also necessary to make sure that grants are not being duplicated, et cetera. The Office of Multicultural Affairs tends to be research oriented and its grants are research oriented and one must coordinate between the two so that there is not an overlap. Yes, I understand what the Department of Finance said. I do not believe that it was properly based.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The management of Australia's landscape has obviously been a problem for longer than just the last few years because in 200 years we have managed to remove an extraordinary percentage of our tree cover and in attempting to replace it over the next few years Australians will need to be careful about the way they go about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has recognised just how severe these problems are and has put in place a number of initiatives. They include: the Landcare program, which included the Landcare year 1990 and the Decade of Landcare for the year 2000 and an expansion of the national soil conservation program, the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation, and the Murray-Darling Basin natural resources management strategy and revegetation program, which include the national afforestation program, the save the bush program and, importantly, the billion trees program.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it is not the case that we can attempt to ban the planting of exotic trees. Obviously the planting of pines will have some effect over time on pressure on our native forests and, far from discouraging it, we should be encouraging it. By the same token, it is often a matter of where they are placed. I am not sure that we have always been terribly careful about their position.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is still the case that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is experimenting even with some exotic species. As an example, on the New England tablelands, it is still experimenting with species which will give protection, especially as windbreaks, during those harsh New England winters. I do not rule out the fact that there may be localised uses for some of these exotic species. Nonetheless, I think through some uninformed land management practices there are some landholders in Australia who are planting exotic trees where it is not appropriate. Greening Australia will be working with many groups in the community, including the Australian Institute of Horticulture and the Society for Growing Australian Plants, to try to raise awareness. I think all any of us can do is make sure that we caution landholders that where they are planting trees, if it is possible to plant a native, they ought to go for it.</PARA>

Given that Ecuadorian authorities have said that another dangerous disease, black sigatoka, did not exist in that country when the Quarantine and Inspection Service found that it did, what credence can be given to Ecuadorian claims to have implemented strict quarantine measures on moko?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I am in a position to answer all of the details about moko, if that be the proper name of the disease. However, I am aware that the Australian banana industry has approached the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) expressing its concern at the likely disease risk if Ecuadorian bananas are permitted entry to Australia. In late 1989 AQIS received a proposal from Fruit Distributors Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand, to permit importation of fresh banana fruit from Ecuador. This company has been importing Ecuadorian bananas into New Zealand for a number of years and wishes to extend its operation to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

That may be a Queensland disease for which there ought to be quarantine protection from the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, let me go back and say that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service operates independent of government in these matters, and it is appropriate that it should do so because there should be no political interference at all in the technical assessment of whether or not there is a quarantine risk from the importation of whatever item or substance into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee is inviting me to express an opinion on an opinion-moreover, on an opinion which is currently the subject of a discussion paper released by the independent Quarantine and Inspection Service so that scientific analysis can be made and the opinion of grower organisations can be taken. I think in all of those circumstances, it is entirely appropriate and, moreover, responsible for me, as a representative Minister to say that any concerns about that disease, which I expect to be real concerns-particularly in view of the way in which the honourable senator may be adding to the speculation about it-should be properly taken up within the ambit of the opportunity provided by the Quarantine and Inspection Service.

After deliberations by a ministerial committee, the Government decided last month to put forward a set of processes to be implemented in consultation with the States regarding resource security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measures involve the development of bilateral agreements with States and assessment of suitable regions for long term resource security. Those assessments would cover environmental, heritage, cultural, social and economic considerations. The measures recognised that proposals for resource security will emanate from the States, as they have the primary responsibility for determining land use and management. The Commonwealth would assess and respond to these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> Further discussions are to be held between Ministers and with States and other interested parties regarding the exact means of ensuring an adequate level of resource security and a clear set of resource, conservation and development regimes. The processes and means being proposed by the Government do not involve amendment to the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Such amendment is not considered a real or desirable option.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that, following discussions in Brisbane, it was agreed that the proposed intergovernmental agreement on the environment would aim to embrace the development of these improved processes for assessment for forest resources. These would provide for both the conservation of Australia's forest heritage and long term resource security. These processes could include complementary Commonwealth and State legislation where requested by States and, importantly, agreed upon by the Commonwealth.

One of the most important things to come out of the exhibition was that the Government's purchasing policy based on the principle of value for money was explained to industry. In that context a very basic principle of government looking for sophisticated equipment and looking for industry to meet those sorts of quality needs was also explained. Industry understood quite well that the State and Federal governments' $30 billion purchasing power can be used quite effectively to assist domestic industry to compete for work domestically and also to put it in a great position to compete internationally.</PARA>
<PARA> This is very far from the allegation that Senator Parer makes that what we are moving towards is a centralised Soviet bloc system of purchasing. We have decentralised. Purchasing has been devolved into two individual government departments. The sooner the Opposition understands that that is the direction of purchasing policy and also that industry out in the broad Australian community is responding to it, then the sooner it will get back into the mainstream of Australian politics.</PARA>

<PARA>SALES OF RURAL PRODUCE</PARA>
<PARA> On 6 November, Senator Bell asked me a question relating to details of initiatives undertaken to facilitate export sales of rural commodities. Examples of the Government's actions include:</PARA>
<PARA>GATT</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as Australia has sought stronger disciplines for trade in agricultural products in the Uruguay Round, the existing GATT rules have been used to further sales of Australian rural produce.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the successful GATT challenge against the Republic of Korea's import regime for beef, brought by Australia, New Zealand and the United States, and subsequent bilateral access negotiations with Korea, the Korean beef market has been expanded.</PARA>
<PARA> The beef access arrangements with Korea follow on from the successful conclusion in 1988 of the Japan beef access arrangements. These arrangements followed negotiations to which Japan had agreed after Australia and other countries had initiated a challenge within the GATT. By these arrangements Japan agreed to successively larger import quotas for beef.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has mounted a successful challenge against US sugar import quotas. We are disappointed that the changes that the US has made to its import regime in response have only been cosmetic ones. However, we will continue to press strongly for a more market-oriented sugar program. This will, if appropriate, include further action within the GATT.</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERIAL VISITS AND REPRESENTATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>US</PARA>
<PARA>Over the past 12 months, Australia has made intensive efforts to press for a more market oriented 1990 US Farm Bill</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett and Mr Kerin have made representations during their visits to Washington and most recently Senator Evans raised Australian concerns at the October US/Australia Ministerial talks.</PARA>
<PARA>Middle East</PARA>
<PARA> During August this year, Dr Blewett led a delegation of 37 Australian business representatives and government officials to the three-day Australia Iran Joint Commission, which he chaired with the Iranian Minister for Agriculture which resulted in</PARA>
<PARA>initialling of a new Trade Agreement between Australia and Iran, providing a framework for the conduct of future bilateral trade</PARA>
<PARA>signing of a Veterinary Sanitary Agreement which will facilitate the further development, stability and predictability of trade in sheepmeat from Australia to Iran.</PARA>
<PARA>negotiation by business of contracts which will boost annual export by some $100m a year, including sales of wheat and mutton.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin's visit to the Middle East earlier this year included discussions on formal agreements with Oman and the United Arab Emirates on veterinary requirements for sheep.</PARA>
<PARA>EC</PARA>
<PARA> Our agricultural trade access concerns with the EC have been raised on number of occasions by Ministers during the year, including by Mr Duffy and Dr Blewett during their various visits to Brussels and EC capitals, and by Senator Evans and Mr Kerin at the EC/Australia Ministerial Consultations in Brussels in June. Representations on the Andriessen Assurance have been made by the Prime Minister personally to the President of the EC Commission, Delors.</PARA>
<PARA> During 1990 we have pressed the EC for</PARA>

<PARA>Wool</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin will be leading a Government/Industry Wool Mission to West Europe (Milan/Paris), Moscow, Korea, Japan (Osaka/Tokyo) and Beijing from 17 November to 2 December. The objective of the Mission is to make an overall assessment of the wool market, future prospects and timing of recovery</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin will be accompanied by senior industry representatives</PARA>
<PARA>he will also be discussing the question of credit with the Soviet Union to maintain our important commodity trade with that country.</PARA>
<PARA>COMMODITY TRADE AGREEMENT</PARA>
<PARA>The Government signed an agreement with the Soviet Union in February this year to provide a more stable basis for exports to the USSR. The indicative quantities listed for the terms of the Agreement include:</PARA>
<PARA>Wheat: 2 million tonnes over three years;</PARA>
<PARA>Butter: 37,500 tonnes over three years;</PARA>
<PARA>Greasy Wool: 260,000 tonnes over three years;</PARA>

<PARA>as well as mutton, barley and protein crops.</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RURAL INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA>Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program (IAMP)</PARA>
<PARA> The Program is providing $20m over five years as assistance to producers, processors, manufacturers and marketers in Australia's agricultural, forestry and fishing industries. Priority areas for funding include improvements in handling, storage, transport, packaging, distribution and marketing techniques for Australia's fisheries, meat, dairy, horticultural and forestry industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Export Marketing Skills Program (EMSP)</PARA>
<PARA> The Program is upgrading the export marketing skills of agriculture and allied industries by establishing centres of excellence in export marketing, in co-operation with industry, and by supporting action orientated training. In 1989-90, $2m was provided to 7 training projects and 2 centres of excellence in export marketing skills. Training was provided in export marketing for dairy, horticulture, viticulture, food processing, fisheries and timber industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC)</PARA>
<PARA> EFIC facilities are aimed at encouraging Australia's exports, international project work and investment through insurance, guarantees and indemnities and loans. Commodities constitute the largest proportion of exports insured by EFIC. In 1989/90, traditional exports including meat, dairy products, wheat, hides and skins and wool accounted for around 70% of exports credit-insured.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Just last week Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me a question relating to the move to 100 per cent cost recovery for services provided by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). I am now able to give a full answer to that question. The full recovery of user attributable services is consistent with the user pays principle and it encourages more efficient use of resources. The Opposition in its Economic Action Plan supports the concept of user pays. Since the 1988 Policy for Growth statement, the 1989 Industries Assistance Commission report on the food processing and beverages industries recommended full cost recovery for inspection services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A comprehensive review of all AQIS charges and charging systems is being undertaken in consultation with industry over the next 12 months to ensure that charges are equitable and the most administratively efficient. In association with the introduction of higher charges, the Government is funding a number of measures to facilitate changes in industry practices which will minimise the cost of inspection and quarantine services. These will include relief for small-scale domestic meat processors and encouraging new participants into the export sector. Revised charges reflecting the 100 per cent cost recovery will be announced on 15 November 1990 for introduction on 1 January 1991.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasury annual report is always an interesting and important document as the Treasury, of course, acts as the principal economic adviser to the Treasurer and hence to the Government. The 1989-90 annual report tabled today is a comprehensive report and has much very useful and important information in it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in 1988-89 the Treasury in various ways increased both its functions and its responsibilities. In particular, it has stepped up its role in the area of consideration of micro-economic reform in the last 12 months. It has traditionally, of course, been the adviser on macro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, it has also stepped up its consideration of environmental issues. I welcome that development very much because I believe that the Treasury has an important input to make to the debate on environmental issues, to help get a balance between the straight environmental issues and the economic issues when we look at the whole question of environmental policy generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Tabling of Documents</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasury has also played an important role in the last financial year 1989-90 in the area of retirement incomes and superannuation policy. In that financial year we saw a major change in the superannuation policy and programs of the Commonwealth Public Service. Last year a public debt management policy became increasingly important. On the other hand-and I regret this-the Treasury ceased responsibility for the preparation of the monthly Treasury Round-up. That was a very important statistical document commenting each month on the state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I have been able to ascertain from the Parliamentary Library, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has not begun production of a publication which has a coverage anything like the Round-up but which was, at the time of the cessation of the Round-up, said to be imminent. I for one relied on the Treasury Round-up as a major source of useful statistical information and I hope that the Bureau of Statistics will get on to the job of supplementing that quickly. If not, I hope its decision to discontinue the Round-up will be reveiwed. </PARA>
<PARA> Try as it might, even with the Treasury's expanded role, it has had little success with micro-economic reform. The Treasurer has continually been rolled by other Ministers. Mr Beazley, for example, has abjectly defeated the Treasurer on the whole question of communications reform. We have welcomed the reform moves generally in the micro area but Treasury's preferred line seems to be becoming increasingly isolated as senior Ministers-Senator Button in this chamber, Mr Dawkins and others-call for selective industry assistance and a reassessment of the Treasury's approach to economic policy. I believe that that is a very worrying trend. That is one of the most significant trends that has happened within Government circles in recent weeks and the selective breaking of the Government line by senior Ministers in their public statements in this area augurs very seriously, I believe, not only for the Government but also for the Treasurer himself. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of addresses by Treasury officers on macro-economic issues. I welcome that. I think that is a very useful role. The macro-economic policy role and its whole process has obviously gone off the rails. There is increasing tension between Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia over the direction and reliance on monetary policy by the Government. I have spoken at length on this in recent times. I will not do it again other than to raise the main issue, namely, a major fiscal policy blow-out. We are more on track now than ever with the reckless and profligate increase in Government spending that was announced by the Government in the Budget. The forecasts for the year ahead on which the Budget was based are now out of line with reality. The unemployment figures, the inflation figures-despite last week's figure-and other forecasts have really blown the relevance of the Budget out of the water. That is a matter that will be of continuing importance in debates in the weeks ahead. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is an example of a report of excellence. There are few reports tabled in this place which provide more useful information than the one before us today. I urge all senators to avail themselves of this report because the Industry Commission has outlined in a most comprehensive way the failure of this Government's economic policies and, more particularly, the failure of Senator Button's industry policy to bring about sustainable benefits for consumers, taxpayers, manufacturers or exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Government's reluctance to use the `R' word-indeed in this morning's press some people are talking about the use of the `D' word; of course, those two words are recession and depression respectively-the Industry Commission outlines the poor state of the economy. At page 3 of the report there is a worthy quote. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The economy has been burdened with persistent inflation, a build up of foreign debt and, despite strong employment growth, continuing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>Further it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the constraints that the Australian economy currently faces leave us particularly vulnerable to a turnaround in world commodity prices. If the terms of trade decline . . . our ability to maintain living standards will come under strong pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>This report amounts to a rap over the knuckles for the Treasurer who is told by the Commission:</PARA>
<PARA>We should not judge our performance against the standard of the past. We must consider what other countries are achieving. </PARA>
<PARA>That then becomes a very interesting yardstick. The Commission shows that agriculture is the only Australian sector performing better than other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and that electricity, gas and water utilities combined have productivity levels half that of other OECD countries. The Commission identifies precisely which areas are in need of micro-economic reform and precisely the extent of likely benefits to Australians. Micro reform could bring Australia an additional $22 billion in gross domestic product, 53,000 additional jobs, a reduction in the price level of 7 per cent and make Australian households better off to the tune of $2,300 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission reiterates precisely what I have been advocating in this chamber, which is that Senator Button's policies have failed to invigorate Australian industry, and the report states how Australia's credibility has been undermined by provision of such assistance as the Kodak bounty. The sort of bedtime reading that this report could make for the Minister concerned could be of assistance to Australia generally. The Commission demolishes the argument that strategic trade theorists use, and at page 64 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . industry-specific assistance far from being a prerequisite for success is likely to be harmful, especially if it is extensive and maintained over long periods. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is an excellent compendium for the case for free trade. I would recommend it as good reading for all those who are touched from time to time with the need for governments to become interventionist. Generally, I must say that I am impressed with the report but I am very disappointed at the way in which this Government has hounded Dr Allan Moran from the Commission for daring to put a point of view which differed from his Government's. I can only say that I hope Tony Cole does not meet with the same fate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Bishop that this is an excellent report. It contains a number of things which I wish to highlight. Obviously, one cannot deal with the whole report in five minutes but I think chapter 4 and appendix 1 of the report are two areas in particular which need to be concentrated on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Chapter 4 which is headed `Selective assistance is not the answer' gives a comprehensive position as to why it is not the answer. It makes particular reference to a recent report sponsored by the Australia Manufacturing Council (AMC) in 1990, which argues that selective assistance is in fact the answer. A number of things need highlighting in terms of that. My first point is in respect of page 15. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The report-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the AMC report-</PARA>
<PARA>fails to recognise the significance of the costs these measures would impose on other industries, activities and taxpayers. There is also the danger that, despite the lessons of the past, a signal would be given to industry. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That would be the wrong signal. The report refers to a number of different aspects, particularly the aspect of competition. I quote from page 16 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>One example is provided by the recommendation of accelerated depression for taxation purposes for export oriented, value-added resource processing projects with a minimum investment of $20 million. This seeks to compensate investors on a selected basis for higher inflation and the higher real cost of investment capital they are claimed to face relative to our competitors. The proposal would disadvantage a wide range of industries which would be ineligible for favoured tax treatment. These include all non-exporting industries-</PARA>
<PARA>et cetera. Then it goes on to say that the particular load would fall back on our efficient low value-added industries which is the case that exists now. I would certainly recommend that the policy setters particularly note that, because there is a large enough load currently on the people who provide our wealth at this particular time. One aspect on page 17 of the report that needs drawing out relates to inequitable involvement in industry or what I term misguided assistance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is substantial agreement that industrial targeting in Australia has detracted from our economic performance. Australia's experience with industrial targeting has been uniformly poor. Several of the risky, high technology ventures supported by entrepreneurial state Governments have proved to be costly failures-</PARA>
<PARA>and sadly, my State Government in Western Australia is one of those state governments. It states further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . other well known examples are the textile, clothing, footwear and motor vehicle industries. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to now turn to page 29 of the report and deal with table A1.1. It is worth noting that there has been much discussion in recent times about the necessity to have an efficient transport industry in this country. This table is headed, `Cost reductions possible from Australian railways adopting international standard work practices'. The percentage gain on the costs in Australia in 1988-89 are: in labour, 35.4 per cent; in capital, 11 per cent; and in materials, 34.1 per cent, a total of 30.6 per cent. In a nation such as Australia, which is so dependent on having an efficient transport system running from coast to coast, whether it be from west to east or north to south, that is worth bearing in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to read from page 30 under the heading, `The economy-wide impact of micro-economic reform':</PARA>
<PARA>The projected long term impact of micro-economic reforms analysed in the IAC's 1988-89 annual report and those evaluated this year are shown in table A1.2. The results suggest longer term annual gains in real GDP of 6.5 per cent, equivalent to just over $22 billion 1988-89 dollars. Of this about $14 billion accrues in terms of higher consumption expenditure. This is the equivalent to about $2,300 a household. The reforms are estimated to generate an extra 53,000 jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to say a few words about the Industry Commission annual report of 1989-90. This is the first annual report of the Industry Commission, because it was only in 1989-90 that the Commission was formed by absorbing the functions previously performed by the Industries Assistance Commission, the Inter-State Commission, and the Commonwealth's Business Regulation Review Unit. What the Government has done has been to put those three bodies into one very powerful and very important Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amalgamation of those bodies was something about which the coalition expressed some serious concern at the time. I think this first report suggests that the Commission is working well and in the right direction with its approach to the matters facing industry and the economy generally. But the Coalition, given its earlier reservations about absorbing organisations such as the Business Regulation Review Unit into the larger Industries Assistance Commission, will carefully monitor the situation because the Business Regulation Review Unit in particular has a very important role to play in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators Bishop and Crane have said several of the things that I would have wanted to say in the brief time available to me today. I draw the Senate's attention, however, particularly to chapter 4, entitled `Selective Assistance is not the Answer'. That is a very appropriate title, and it is an important chapter in the Industry Commission's report. It reflects many views that the coalition has shared for a long time now. I am concerned that the views expressed in that chapter are seen to be increasingly at odds with the statements made in recent days by some of the Government's most senior Ministers. I refer particularly to Senator Button and to Mr Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only in the last few days that Mr Dawkins said that we need to take a step `beyond adherence to the market and a level playing field' and that we need to be `supporting those of our best performers who have prospects of doing better'. If the word `support' means selective subsidies-and I am sure that, in essence, that is what Mr Dawkins was getting at-then he is going down a very dangerous path. Indeed, if he believes and this Government starts to believe that they can pick winners and that, by selective approaches to different industries, the Government can further the performance of this economy, then they are ignoring the history of the past 50 years, not only in Australia but elsewhere. It has been proved beyond any doubt that such a selective approach to industry development is ineffective and counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button seems to be heading down the same path, and he is the very important Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. He was reported in the Australian Financial Review in recent days as having `signalled to his Cabinet colleagues that he would be proposing selective measures aimed at boosting the export and import replacement capacity of Australian manufacturing industry'. Of course, we all want to see the export and import replacement capacity of Australian manufacturing industry boosted. Indeed, it is of critical importance for the Australian economy and for living standards that it be boosted. But if the essence of the Minister's comments is that he is going to try to pick winners or be selective in his approach rather than encourage the environment which will enable all industries and individuals to prosper on an equal basis, then he is talking very dangerous nonsense. Our concern is reinforced by the fact that Ministers such as Mr Kerin, Mr Beazley and Mr Howe are also talking increasingly of selectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Sunday program yesterday the Industry Commission Chairman, Tony Cole, rightly rejected the claims that such selective assistance be used. I believe that the Government would do very well to take Mr Cole's advice. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an audit report into what has clearly been a mess. The Government really has little to smile about on the question of the building of an Antarctic supply vessel and the contracts that surround it. Many questions have been asked in Senate Estimates committees for some time over this matter. Basically, the report by the Auditor-General underlines the fact that there has been a mess, and it does say that at least there has been an attempt to fix up the mess. The findings of the report state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . throughout the negotiations the Department and the Australian Government Solicitor sought to preserve the Commonwealth's position. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that the position that the Commonwealth, and particularly the Department, got itself into was a ludicrous one. The Auditor-General's report clearly outlines that ludicrous situation. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA>The audit disclosed that the negotiations-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for the building of the ship, Aurora Australis-</PARA>
<PARA>over the time charter for the vessel were affected by:</PARA>
<PARA>* the loss of negotiating power on the part of the Department following the public announcement of P&amp; Polar as the successful tenderer and the issue of the letter of intent</PARA>
<PARA>* the lack of a firm time charter on which the short-listed companies could base their bids</PARA>
<PARA>* financial assumptions included in the P&amp; Polar offer-</PARA>
<PARA>I mention that the assumptions did not prove to be correct-</PARA>
<PARA>* specification changes arising during the course of negotiations, and</PARA>
<PARA>* imprecise specifications for the scientific instrument system at the time of the tender. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into the mass of detail about the letter of intent, but I will mention the audit report's conclusions. The Auditor-General notes:</PARA>
<PARA> The P&amp; Polar bid-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the successful bid for Aurora Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>originally approved by the Government involved a first year higher cost of $10.1 million. As a result of negotiations over the vessel design and the charter details the Government agreed to an increase to $10.8 million per annum. In addition, payments totalling $895 425 were made to cover the additional costs associated with the scientific instrument system. There is also a potential payment of $400 000 per annum in lay-up costs following the first year's operations. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition-this is not mentioned by the Auditor-General-the ice pilot that will be required will also cost a large amount of money on top of--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Calvert" NAMEID="5F4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another $28,000 per year. So there have been considerable increases to the cost since this P and O Polar bid was originally approved. The AuditorGeneral continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the ANAO's view these increases were due to changes in specifications and the deletion of adverse financial conditions during the negotiation process. The ANAO considers that this negotiation process was made difficult because of assumptions included in the original P&amp; Polar proposal which were not fully taken into account at the time of the Government's original consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that the Department blundered. That is a very polite way for the Auditor-General to express it, but it means simply a costly departmental blunder. The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The need to issue the letter of intent and to issue letters of comfort on other matters arose from those assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA>These have proved to be not too soundly based. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO considers that throughout the negotiations the Department and the Australian Government Solicitor sought to preserve the Commonwealth's position. </PARA>
<PARA>The big question is whether or not the Commonwealth should ever have been put in a position where it had basically very little room to manoeuvre and very little power to negotiate, because it was locked into a deal which is now turning out to be a far more expensive deal. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is suggested that, in future cases of a similar nature, the Commonwealth's position would be strengthened if:</PARA>
<PARA>* proposals are based on a firm, approved time charter document</PARA>
<PARA>* the specifications are settled prior to any final decision and Government announcement, and</PARA>
<PARA>* the implications of any assumptions included in a proposal are explored and clarified before the Government's final consideration, decision and announcement. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, those three points are exactly the opposite of the way the Government conducted itself in this matter. The Auditor-General is being remarkably polite in the manner in which he has couched this criticism. But it is overwhelming and damning criticism of monumental incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one could wonder why a department would conduct itself in this crazy way. Some people are prepared to offer suggestions. I do not know to what extent there are friendly relations between some of the people involved. I do not know whether or not there really are conflicts of interest but that matter was certainly raised at a Senate Estimates committee meeting. The potential for conflict of interest was certainly there. Perhaps Senator Calvert, who is in the chamber and who knows far more about this than I do, may wish to pursue that matter of the potential for conflict of interest. It is a matter of some concern, for example, that P and O did appear to have one of its subsidiaries, as I understand it, acting in this matter in a different form. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The approach taken by the Department was in part a result of the desire to have the vessel built and available for service as early as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well. We have seen some very curious arrangements made when the desperation to get something ready quickly prompts governments into accepting deals which cost the taxpayer a fortune. I guess, as we look around this chamber, we can think of perhaps some elements of the building of this Parliament House that fall into that category. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's view is that while additional costs were incurred, the Division has access to an improved vessel to that originally envisaged and that it has successfully negotiated to limit the impact of the financial conditions originally sought by P&amp; Polar. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well but I do not know whether the Senate is aware of the fact that this super deluxe high quality ship which is costing us so much more has broken down basically on its voyage around the Antarctic continent. As Senator Calvert pointed out last week, it is now limping its way around the Antarctica, powered by its smaller No. 2 engine. Last Wednesday Senator Calvert asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) a question on this matter. I might say that the Minister promised to give the reply to Senator Calvert last Thursday. Today it still has not arrived. No doubt Senator Calvert will be pursuing that. </PARA>
<PARA> But the fact is that he asked for details as to the nature and cause of the mechanical problems which have delayed the Aurora Australis and the reasons why the vessel was not carrying a spare coupling between the main engine and the gear box, a procedure which is considered standard practice on such a vessel. During the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee C I asked specific questions about why the Aurora Australis had not been fitted with a skeg and ice knives to protect the propeller and rudder from ice. I was told that the Department had taken the considered view, as I recall it, that those things were not necessary because it had been assured on that, I understand, by P and O Polar. Last Wednesday Senator Calvert asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is it not a fact that this problem-</PARA>
<PARA>which brought about the engine breakdown-</PARA>
<PARA>would have been averted if the Aurora Australis  had been fitted with a skeg and ice knives to protect the propeller and rudder, a design feature which was recommended by some of P and O Polar's specialist technical advisers and apparently rejected by P and O and the Antarctic Division?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Calvert then asked whether the Minister could give an assurance that the Aurora Australis would be modified to have these features with a view to protecting the safety of Australian expeditioners and the viability of our ongoing Antarctic research programs. To fix this will mean more cost and more expense. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned as to whether or not the Auditor-General was aware of what had happened-I presume he was not aware of what happened to the Aurora Australis in this break down because he signed his report on 2 November 1990 and Senator Calvert's question was asked on 7 November. It seems that the outcome in terms of the quality of the ship, let alone its cost, is unsatisfactory. I hope that we might get more direct and apposite answers to the questions we have been pursuing in Senate Estimates Committee hearings about the consistent capacity of the Antarctic Division to make major blunders. This is the latest one. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the Auditor-General feels that there ought to be an inquiry. I also regret that so many of the basic rules seem to have been avoided in the decision to accept the P and O Polar proposal. I hope that the Government will take notice of the Auditor-General's suggestions-those three points I read out earlier-which are the right way to go about things to save the Australian taxpayer money and to make certain that expeditioners are not put at risk by having to go to Antarctica in an unsatisfactory ship which at present is limping around that continent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall add further to the comments raised by Senator Michael Baume. Unfortunately, I have not seen the Auditor-General's comments yet but I take note of what Senator Baume has said. I shall enlarge on one or two of the matters he raised. I refer to one of the most important parts of the contract. I have consistently asked the Minister and departmental officers to provide me with the final extent of the Commonwealth's liability on the ship but they have declined. It is interesting to note that the contract eventually was signed in October 1988 after the vessel had been under construction for about 10 months. It was completed 11 months later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know why P and O was given this particular job. It was because Carrington's were to build the ship at Newcastle and it just happened to be the time of a State election. That was the reason for the undue haste in the Minister putting out a press release saying that P and O Polar were to get the job before any contracts had been signed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At present values, the accepted bid was $10.1m for the first season or $124m for 10 seasons but, as the Auditor-General points out in the report, as a result of the late signing of the charter, Australia is being asked to pay over $12m for the first full season or more than $150m for 10 seasons. Honourable senators will see that the delay in signing that charter has cost Australia about $25m. The Auditor-General is quite right in raising these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we have all the add-on costs. The Commonwealth has to meet all the non-Antarctic season lay-up costs for the first time ever amounting to about half a million dollars a year. The lay-up port was not specified. The Commonwealth was required to pay an additional $460,000 for the provision of scientific equipment. The Commonwealth has to pay the charter rate for an 80-day Antarctic season whether it uses it or not. In answer to questions I asked at Estimates Committee hearings about the ice pilot, referred to by Senator Baume, there was a lot of doubt as to whether one would ever be needed. But the first time the ship goes to Antarctica, lo and behold an ice pilot is being used at a cost to the Commonwealth of about $28,000. I hope that does not have to happen again but there is a possibility it will. </PARA>
<PARA> During the negotiations, whilst it was set down in the tender documents that the captain of that particular ship had to have satisfied the specification of having four years Antarctic ice strategy experience, we now find on this first trip that the captain of that ship has nowhere near the experience required and that is why the ice pilot was required. </PARA>
<PARA> Another query that did not come up in the Auditor-General's report, which was a matter of great concern to me, was that during the construction of the ship no proper monitoring was done by technically qualified people. One of the officers used to take photos but there should have been much closer monitoring of the specific tender requirements in the construction of this ship. At the end of the day, once we are using the ship, there is always a possibility that things can go wrong. In fact, they have gone wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I am looking forward with interest to see whether Senator Richardson, representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories tomorrow will tell me the reason for this incident. Any other ship that headed to Antarctica always carried a spare coupling that operates between the main engines. In this case it did not happen. I do not know whether that is because so much was spent on the ship that the company could not afford one. The upshot is that a ship is operating in the Antarctic with a smaller motor. Were that ship to get into difficulties, the members of the crew and members of our expedition could be placed at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason that I and my colleagues have been raising so many questions about the haste with which this vessel was constructed, the anomalies in the tendering system and all the other shortcomings that have been pointed out and noted in a series of lengthy questions during the Estimates Committee hearings. Harking back to the cost of the ship-whilst I agree with Senator Richardson that the building of the ship in Australia by Australian workers was very advantageous, it is interesting to note that the bid by Reiber to build the ship was half the original bid of $124m. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume raised the question of conflict of interest between some of the companies. I have been given an assurance by the heads of the Department that there is no conflict of interest. When the new charter for the appointment of a second vessel was granted, Anderson Hughes Australia, which is a subsidiary of P and O, won the tender. It just so happens that the providoring authority in Hobart for Antarctic ships is Beaufort Shipping Agency Co., which is also a subsidiary of P and O. We therefore have the trifecta of the ship being built and owned by P and O, the people tendering of the second ship being a subsidiary of P and O and the people providoring the ship being a subsidiary of P and O. The Department of Administrative Services has assured us in answer to questions at Estimates hearings that there is no conflict of interest between those companies, but the matter should never have arisen. However, there is now that suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward with interest to scrutinising the criticism of the tendering process regarding the Aurora Australis by the Auditor-General. My colleagues and I will be pursuing these matters during the committee stage of the appropriations debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was concluding my contribution to this debate on Thursday evening when the debate was adjourned. At that time, I was discussing the start-up of the Australian Securities Commission and some of the matters I had raised in Estimates committees about that. I was using it as an example of how the Government goes about trying to solve problems and how sometimes it is ineffective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the Government's objective is to try to move the corporations regulatory environment to a system which works a lot better. In doing that, it followed through the advice of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its report of 1987, which raised concerns about how the cooperative scheme, which is in effect at the moment, was running. The new corporations legislation, which was passed through this Parliament in 1989, was to set up a national scheme, which, as honourable senators know, fell apart a little bit when earlier this year the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth did not have the power over incorporations of companies. Since then, on 29 June in Alice Springs, after some protracted negotiations, the States, in a heads of agreement document, agreed to refer their power over incorporations to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now five months since that time and the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 was introduced into the House of Representatives last Thursday. Unfortunately, after this gestation period of about three years, this Senate and this Parliament will have only a very short time in which to debate these amendments and the new national scheme. This is of some concern to me. The High Court case ensured that the Government rethink its approach to corporations legislation. It has certainly done that, with the cooperation of all the States. That is laudable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems in setting up this new legislative framework is that all the State parliaments need to introduce applications of law legislation. With only a few sitting days remaining in most of the State parliaments and with this quite complex legislation-indeed, the legislation before the Federal Parliament is about the size of a telephone book-I wonder whether it is an appropriate way to go about changing the entire corporate affairs legislation in Australia if it can be debated in only such a short time by both the State parliaments and the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the head of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Hartnell, are hell bent on setting up the Australian Securities Commission by 1 January. In my remarks before the adjournment on Thursday I drew the Senate's attention to the fact that in my home State of Western Australia and, I presume, in many other States none of the Corporate Affairs Commission staff have at this stage been offered jobs with the Australian Securities Commission. Indeed, a problem flowing from that is that none of the staff have been trained in using the complicated new computer system which will be used to make the Australian Securities Commission work. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are looking at having some continuity and having an effective corporate regulatory structure, we need staff that have had some experience in following the corporate players in their own States. It is a matter of alarm to me that the Australian Securities Commission does not seem to have made any progress since the meeting in Alice Springs at the end of June to deal with the staffing problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem is that in Western Australia and, I believe, in many of the other States the Australian Securities Commission has decided on its head office locations. It has proceeded to lease premises but, at this time, no work has started on fitting out the offices. Certainly, that is the situation in Perth. There is about one acre of office space in the middle of Perth with no partitions, no furniture and no computers and we have only about 30 working days until Christmas, when the building industry closes down-and the building industry does not come back to work until the middle of January. I cannot see it in any way possible that these offices will be set up before 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter is business compliance. I referred to it briefly prior to the adjournment on Thursday. One of the small matters is the necessity to issue each company in Australia with an eight-digit corporate identification number, or the `company's number', as it is referred to in the legislation. This is a necessity because, now that we are amalgamating the corporate affairs offices of all the States, obviously a number of companies will have similar or identical names. It has become necessary to give each company a number. It is probably a good idea and it is probably very sensible administration. The only trouble is that very few companies know about this idea and know that they are supposed to place this number on their documents. I referred to that on Thursday. To achieve a successful transition to this new national scheme, it is important that there be proper administration so that it is ready to operate properly on 1 January-as the Attorney-General would have us believe. We need a smooth transition to this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need the business community to be able to comply with it and to understand and support it. At this stage, most of the business community is in the dark about it. It is no wonder. Prior to 29 June in Alice Springs, and for the five months since then, the parliamentary draftsmen, solicitors-general from all the States and the Attorney-General's Department have been trying to come up with a package of legislation to put the scheme into effect, both in this Commonwealth Parliament and in all the States. I imagine that they have been far too busy to tell the poor old business people how they will make this work. I reiterate: it is important to have the administration right and for the business community to understand how the system will work. At this stage, we have neither of these prerequisites. As I have said on a number of occasions, there are only a few working days to Christmas. Personally, I cannot see how these two prerequisites will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I have called on the Attorney-General and the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission to delay the start-up date until we are all satisfied that we will have a smooth transition to the new national scheme and that the original objective-back in 1987 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs suggested that the old scheme be done away with-to have a more uniform and effective corporate regulatory environment is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> As most honourable senators know, I have objections to the centralisation of this but I now believe that it is inevitable, unless the upper houses in some of the States knock back the legislation, so it is important that it be made to work. I see this headlong rush to set up the Australian Securities Commission by 1 January as something that will set the new scheme off to a very bad start and not actually achieve the objectives. So in terms of the Appropriation debate we will be quadrupling the money that the Federal Government spends on corporate regulation in Australia. But I suggest to the Senate, to the Attorney-General and to the people of Australia that the expenditure of this money will be wasted if we rush headlong into setting up the Australian Securities Commission before everybody is ready, and that is what seems to be taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been brought to my attention today that the Government plans to introduce into the House of Representatives some 35 Bills to be debated during this week. The corporations legislation package is among those Bills. There are many important pieces of legislation amongst those packages and it strikes me, as a new senator in this place, that, if Parliament is supposed to scrutinise this legislation and government appropriations and, indeed, play some positive role in making sure that good quality legislation and administration come out of this place, introducing 35 Bills and hoping to have them dealt with in one week is certainly not a very good way of going about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my impression that the Senate should be having a very long look at even this corporate legislation amendment package-if not sending it to a committee to look at-to see that the draftsmen and the solicitors-general and the Attorney-General's Department have got it right. I cannot see how in five quick months of work they will have it right. I wish them luck. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that the Senate and the Parliament need to look after the interests of the community. If we are to deal with these matters, if we are to look at the Appropriations, these matters need proper scrutiny. We should not be rushed into having an Australian Securities Commission set up by 1 January. We should be allowed to handle this and all of the other matters in good time and with the required amount of scrutiny, because I am sure that is what we are really here to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to the order of the Senate I will call on the proposed expenditure in the departmental groups and order considered by the Estimates committees. Before doing so, I inform honourable senators that many of the reservations attached to the Estimates Committee reports are not strictly in accordance with the procedures of the Senate in that they do not specifically recommend that specific matters be further examined by the Senate. Paragraph 4(2) on page 141 of the Senate publication Standing Orders and Other Orders of the Senate explicitly outlines how reservations to Estimates Committee reports are to be worded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this occasion I intend to accept reservations where the intention is clear, but I remind honourable senators that if they wish to list specific matters for further examination in the Committee of the Whole they should follow the relevant procedures. I expect that these procedures will be adhered to in the future and I would ask Committee secretaries to give guidance where necessary to ensure that reservations are correctly worded. I also mention that some of the reservations are so wide in scope that they could be taken to open up for debate much of what was traversed in Estimates committee hearings. To do that defeats the purpose of the new procedures of reducing the time of debate in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Without in any way wishing to curtail senators' speaking rights, I do suggest that in future they closely identify the matters they wish to have further examined. I request honourable senators who wish to speak to matters mentioned in the report of an Estimates committee or in reservations to a committee report to identify the specific area of the report or reservation which they intend to debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chairman, I so move because I think there are a couple of important issues which you have raised that will require further attention in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter that I raise is how explicit a senator is required to be in relation to a reservation that will allow further debate in the committee stage in the chamber. I appreciate the spirit of your ruling today which I think facilitates our way through our continuing learning curve under these new procedures, and I am sure that that spirit will be reciprocated on this side of the chamber. But when you mention, as you did in the statement that you just read to us, the need to be explicit, I have to say that I have some problems with that when I look at the obligation under which we are operating which seems to me to have been drawn in extremely general terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the purpose of these new provisions-so there can be focus of the debate-and I think that is obviously recognised or we would not have carried these changes of procedures. I think as it is drawn at the moment there will be ongoing difficulties, Mr Chairman, on the next occasion when you attempt to more strictly order that we comply with the provisions as you are interpreting them. It seems to me that, on the face of the order, you will interpret it much more strictly than has been drawn. I am not disputing your interpretation at this time, but it might be that it is more appropriate that, rather than get into an argument in here, the matter be further considered by the Procedures Committee or by some other means before we come back into an appropriations debate in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter is that I was simply going to state what I think my colleague Senator Tambling stated-that, although I think it is not your purpose, there will be some interpretations drawn from the times relating to particular committees that, perhaps, they have been tardy in their operation and that may simply not be so. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee that I was particularly concerned with had matters before it which, I believe, were adequately dealt with in a much smaller time frame than some of the other committees, but there are different issues that take different periods of time and I would not want any interpretation to be placed upon this which reflects on the operations of a particular committee or the operations of a particular senator within that committee. Mr Chairman, I heard your reply to Senator Tambling. I know that is not your intention in this regard, and I hope it is not so read by any other senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make some comments in relation to Senator Hill's remarks and I will take the second matter first. I would hope that not only do senators not take the time involved by committees and draw any conclusions from that and I hope also that the press and the public would not do so either. The idea is that the table is there to provide some information for senators and, perhaps in future, the grouping of departments so that the work load for the Estimates committees is more constant than it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the first matter raised by Senator Hill, it seemed to me that this is the first time we have considered the total Budget Estimates under the new system. I think it will be a learning experience for all of us. It had been my intention at the end of the Estimates that if certain matters had arisen which we should take back to the Procedures Committee we might, in fact, do that because there might be some of those. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a problem, Mr Chairman, with your view that many reservations were not strictly in accordance with Standing Orders. That seems to me to be a issue which will have to be canvassed at some stage in this chamber. I must say, I am glad that you said that on this occasion-if I understand you aright-those reservations would be allowed to stand and that debate could proceed on them. I should stress to you that advice was given to senators by officers of the Department of the Senate that the reservations that were to be put in by senators were strictly in accordance with Standing Orders. It does not seem to me to be a good procedure for a view to be held or, if you like, to be dumped on us in this chamber different from the view that has been conveyed to all senators putting in reservations which is a contrary view to yours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there are better ways of establishing what the right rule is. Mr Chairman, I draw your attention to page 141 of the Standing Orders. It says that debate relating to Estimates committees in the Committee of the Whole `shall be confined to matters in respect of which reports of Estimates committees, or reservations attached to reports, have made recommendations that the matters be further examined by the Senate'. There is nothing in that which would, in my view, support your contention that reservations of a broad nature are not strictly in accordance with Standing Orders, particularly when you refer to page 25 of the Standing Orders and subsection (14) of section 26 dealing with Estimates which says:</PARA>
<PARA> The report of a Committee may propose the further consideration of any items. A reservation by a member of a Committee may be added to a report. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate takes the view that what is clearly written in the Standing Orders is not acceptable, the Senate surely has the capacity to change it. But it does seem strange to me that advice on the meaning of Standing Orders given to honourable senators by officers in the Senate should be suddenly reversed in your statement about these reservations not being in strict accordance with Standing Orders. I would be grateful for your guidance to see where in the Standing Orders your comments are sustainable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I referred to page 141, I was referring to the particular phrase, `debate . . . shall be confined to matters in respect of which reports of Estimates committees, or reservations attached to reports, have made recommendations that the matters be further examined by the Senate'. All I was speaking about was the technical wording being used. In one case, for instance, the reservation was worded in this fashion, `I wish to reserve debate on such and such', and it did not say that this matter was to be further examined by the Senate. There is one in the report of Estimates Committee B at the moment which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following receipt of the Minutes of Proceeding, the Hansard reports of evidence taken and copies of additional information provided by departments, I wish to advise that there are several matters raised in the course of the hearings in relation to which I continue to have reservations. These relate to program elements . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And it continues. It did not specifically say in that letter that certain matters were to be further examined by the Senate. In areas such as that, where it is only a matter of wording, perhaps we can get the wording right. When I said that they were not strictly in accordance with the rules of the Senate, I just meant that perhaps in some cases we did not use the correct words. I think that is an easy matter to get over. On this occasion, where the intention is clear, we will have the matter for debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a problem in terms of the statement you have made in picking up the gist of the relevant standing order. I am one of those people who put in a number of reservations. I did that on the basis-and I took advice from the officer concerned; I was on Estimates Committee F which considered the estimates for the Department of Industrial Relations-that at the time we had to have them in there had not been one question on notice answered previous to the hearing and there had not been one question answered during the hearing. Similarly, with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, there had not been one question answered that had been given on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I do not see how you can be specific in terms of placing a reservation before this chamber if in fact there has not been an answer to the question. I took advice on that particular matter and it means one of two things. If we are to stick specifically to the wording which exists here, which you have quoted in terms of expressing a reservation, the department concerned and the Minister responsible are just going to have to improve their performance, or lift their game, in terms of getting those questions back. Obviously, in terms of some of the answers that have come back, the matter is satisfactory and will not be pursued. But I think we are in an impossible situation if they have not fulfilled their part of the bargain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the issue that Senator Crane addressed. For the last month or so, by leave of the Senate, I have been absent overseas. Prior to my departure, I participated in the deliberations of a number of Estimates committees and placed a considerable number of questions on notice to facilitate the work of those committees. Whether it was due to my absence, the departments' tardiness or the motives of other people, many of the answers did not come back. In fact, many of those from the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) have just dribbled in only in the past few days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, whilst I was away at the point at which the reports were finalised and reservations were expressed, I was not in a personal position to express any of the appropriate reservations on a number of those questions. In fact, even if I had been here I would still have been unable to give other than a general reservation because the answers to those questions, as I said, have been dribbling in from Senator Collins's office only in the past few days. I find it a matter of major concern that my consideration of the appropriate Estimates committees has in effect been thwarted by that particular matter.</PARA>

It is quite satisfactory for any honourable senator to say, `I have reservations in relation to questions which are unanswered as at such and such a date' and ask that they be further examined by the Senate. One does not have to list the questions or the areas. One just has to list certain questions, or a certain group of questions, which one wishes to have reserved. I see no real problem with that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In starting the debate on Estimates Committee B, I presume we are dealing with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade first. I do not intend to debate at length. Officers of the Department provided the Committee with the information sought to a level satisfactory to the Committee in most instances, but the Committee will note that a series of reservations have been entered by senators who wish particular matters to be pursued further in the Committee of the Whole. I have put in a number of reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first matter I wanted to raise arose not from the officers' answers but from some rather, if I may say with respect, evasive-certainly incomplete-answers from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in relation to Australia's relationship with Taiwan and in almost all instances, I suggest, calls for further clarification. To save time I will run through this series of concerns and the Minister might be willing to respond to at least some of them a little more fully than he did during the Estimates hearing. I raised the difficulty of dealing with Taiwan without official contacts on matters that only an official within Taiwan could change. I was particularly interested in the question of wheat quotas and fresh fruit quotas because I was trying to explore how the Australian Government can progress Australia's interests in these matters if it is to have no contact with Taiwanese officials at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to both wheat and fresh fruits, the Department has provided the answers the Minister was unable to provide in the Estimates. In the case of wheat the point is made that imports of Australian wheat have not been permitted by Taiwanese authorities since 1970-78. The information we are now given in this additional answer is that the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) has been making presentations at successive meetings of the Australia-Taiwan Trade Association and no doubt there has been other non-governmental negotiation. However, ultimately, it comes down to the attitude of the Government in Taiwan and in relation to that, Senator Evans-presumably it is Senator Evans-through this answer says that the Australian Government has given strong support to these efforts. The question, of course, is whether that is sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the price for Australian wheat has dropped this year, in part because of a good crop elsewhere in the world, and Australian wheat growers are looking for every opportunity to export their product, which is internationally accepted as being a high quality product. Yet it seems that because of the way in which this Government does business in Taiwan there is no direct role it is prepared to assume to try to negotiate a market-a market from which Australia has been excluded since 1970-78. I therefore ask the Minister: What does he mean when he says the Government has given strong support to those efforts? Is there no way in which the Government can, through direct contact, and therefore hopefully more effective contact, seek to open up that market to Australian producers?</PARA>
<PARA> A similar position exists in relation to fresh fruit. We see now from the answer to this question, which has come in since the Estimates Committee, a small allocation to Australia of some fresh fruits. Fifty-seven tonnes of apples have been allowed in 1990, which I guess is a leg into the market, but it is really only a minute introduction. The question is: Again what can the Australian Government do? Does it simply throw its hands up in the air and say, `Because there are no official contacts we can have no trade contacts with those who claim to be the Administration within Taiwan; therefore, we can do nothing to further the interests of Australian producers in this regard'. From this answer we note that in March 1989 Taiwan announced that it would consider applications for the import of a number of other fruits, and this answer helpfully points out that that would be relevant to Australia in the areas of honeydew melon, watermelon, peaches, nuts, citrus and fruits. The question is, however, how the Australian Government can further the producers' interests if it is not prepared to speak to the decision makers on this aspect? Again this issue has tended to be--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the answers to supplementary questions, which I do not think are numbered. The copy I got is not numbered, but I understand a covered copy was delivered to my office this morning. I have to refer to that which was delivered earlier. It relates to Hansard page 16. That answer said that the Government supports strongly the elimination of all barriers. That avoids the question of how the Government will contribute to the elimination of these barriers which are hindering our access-in some cases introduction-to this rapidly growing market of an ever increasingly more affluent people. How will the Government improve this market if it is not prepared to enter into any direct negotiations on an important trade matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister is aware, shortcomings in the immigration procedures have hindered Australia's economic opportunities in Taiwan. The Minister is probably aware that the time it takes to grant student visas is still longer than that of our competitors and although the processes involved have improved, it is still a time consuming matter. In a very competitive world we cannot afford these extra barriers; therefore I asked whether it was true that two immigration officers were being put in. The answer from the Minister, as I read it, was that some further resources were being made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that the Minister has had time to reflect on the matter, I ask him again whether it is in fact the case that two immigration officers, clearly not acting in an official capacity and therefore in Taiwan on ordinary passports-I accept that-or two immigration officers on leave, or placed by some other method, are going to be placed in the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) office in Taipei. If they are, I would be very pleased to hear that. I would still be critical of the fact that visas must be issued in Hong Kong although the details are taken in Taipei, which seems to be clumsy in this day and age. It would, nevertheless, be some improvement and perhaps the Minister can tell the chamber whether that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The next issue I wanted to raise was that of a Foreign Affairs officer being put in the office in Taipei. I do not think the Minister need be shy about this matter. We have been urging for some time that the Government would do better if it had better political advice coming out of Taipei. Again, I accept that, if an officer of the Department was to be put there, it might be necessary for that officer to take leave or assume some unofficial status, but that does not worry me as much as whether the Australian Government is getting good information. I am led to believe that, notwithstanding the Minister really evading the question, an officer of the Department has taken leave and will be put in Taipei. If that is the case, I would like the Minister to inform the chamber today, and we will be the first to welcome that move in a positive direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to raise the issue of the ongoing sorry saga of the direct commercial air links. Mr Chairman, you would be aware that for years now-all the time this Government has been in office-at irregular intervals the Minister concerned, now Senator Evans, has come into this chamber and said, `Progress is being made; we are hopeful; we trust that we soon will have that direct air link'. We still do not have that direct air link. The last information we have had from this Government is consistent with what we have heard over the years, that is, `positive progress is being made; hope to make it; announcement of a successful completion of the project in the near future'. </PARA>
<PARA> The best information that I have been able to get to the contrary is that there are still major hurdles in the way of that link which this Government is trying to develop involving a subsidiary of Qantas to avoid the flag carrier issue. But it is extremely frustrating for Australian business when, for example, they are competing with other Asian business people. They see Singapore Airlines Ltd flying into Taipei, as do Thai Airways International Ltd, Japan Air Lines, and Asian airlines. They also see Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd flying in, which is the greatest embarrassment of all because Cathay Pacific is partly owned by the People's Republic of China. From Europe they see KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flying in. From America-which competes with us in a number of these markets and which I could have mentioned under the previous discussion of wheat-three airlines fly to Taipei: United Airlines; what was North-West Orient flies in-I think it has now got a different name; and Delta Airlines fly direct from the United States to Taipei. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian businessmen are trying to compete in this market, particularly selling lighter and higher value-added goods, and having to compete with these direct air routes. Australian producers, of course, have got to tranship through Singapore and through Hong Kong where, as I indicated a moment ago, they are likely to tranship to Cathay Pacific, partly owned by the People's Republic of China, for on-passage to Taipei, because the Australian Government has accepted the requirement of Beijing that an Australian national airline is not to land in Taipei. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Australia is in such a parlous economic state and we are all presumably looking at ways in which we can expand Australia's economic opportunity, this additional hurdle, this additional frustration that is having to be experienced by Australian business people, is just one too many. I raised with Senator Evans in the Estimates this question: If the Australian Government is not going to be able to complete its chosen path, that is, using the subsidiary of Qantas, why not become more active in encouraging the alternative options that are about?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian World Airways option is being promoted by a group from Melbourne who, I am led to believe, have run into nothing but hurdles from this Government because, of course, it might intrude upon its chosen path. If the Qantas subsidiary is not going to work, why not encourage Australian World Airways to get into the market? Being a non-government body, it overcomes one little difficulty. Perhaps it might have a greater opportunity of completing a deal that would benefit Australia's business. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister knows, even if that is not successful, there is also the very large Evergreen transport organisation, which I think is based in Taiwan and is one of the largest transport organisations in the world. It is looking to try to develop the option of direct air links between Taipei and Beijing, but it is also interested in developing direct air links between Taiwan and Australia. If we are not going to be able to achieve the Qantas objective, then perhaps it should be encouraged. In other words, it is no good that we be continually told that progress is being made when it is not being made. The Government will be doing better if it gives some of these other alternatives an opportunity to work. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN POLICY TOWARDS TAIWAN</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government today completed a review on Australia's policy towards Taiwan. The review covered developments since December 1986, when the Government had last conducted an in-depth survey of Australian policy towards Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> Cabinet agreed that there was no basis for variation of our basic ``One China'' policy, to which all Australian governments Labor and Coalition alike have adhered since 1972. Under this policy, we continue to recognise the PRC as the sole legal Government of China and acknowledge its claim that Taiwan is a province of China. </PARA>
<PARA> However, within this framework, Australia has been able to develop a healthy commercial relationship with Taiwan. We want this to continue to expand. Since we took office in 1983, two-way trade has tripled, and is now worth $3.8 billion per year. Taiwan has consistently been one of Australia's most important trading partners, ranking fifth in 1989. In that year, Australia was Taiwan's largest supplier of aluminium, wool, iron ore, beef and barley, and its second largest supplier of coal and zinc. This reflects not only the efforts of our business community, but also the solid backing which this Government has provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The following measures have been taken by the Government since 1986 to encourage Australia/Taiwan trade and investment:</PARA>
<PARA>establishment of the Taiwan Market Service (TMS) in Australia, complementing the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) operated by the Australian Chamber of Commerce, enabling both offices to operate a fully professional commercial advisory and assistance service for Australian business and government clients;</PARA>
<PARA>active support for the setting up of a visa facilitation service in ACIO, which enables Taiwan residents to visit Australia with the minimum of fuss and delay;</PARA>
<PARA>facilitation of the establishment of an Australian Education Centre in Taipei, to promote the sale of Australian education services to Taiwan;</PARA>
<PARA>passage of legislation, which has the effect of removing all doubt about the security of Taiwan investments in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>encouragement of visits by Taiwan business representatives to Australia, encouraging them to strengthen trade and investment links between Australia and Taiwan;</PARA>
<PARA>promotion of business migration, leading Taiwan to become our second largest source of business migrants;</PARA>
<PARA>continued extension of Developing Country Preferences to Taiwan, which is currently the largest beneficiary of the scheme;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The way the honourable senator carries on, he does not always justify that sort of favourable treatment, but never mind. I am delighted to give him a spare copy on this occasion. A number of the specific matters that Senator Hill has raised are addressed in that statement, although necessarily it cannot be perhaps as explicit as one might like on some particular matters of detail. Let me address some of the questions of detail that he has drawn our attention to today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, he raised the question of agricultural trade discussions and in particular in relation to wheat, making the point that there were difficulties in the conduct of that trade if contacts are not able to be made at government to government level. I acknowledge the fact that there can be difficulties if contact is impossible on a governmental basis. Nonetheless, it has proved possible over the years with Australia, as with most other countries with substantial trading relationships with Taiwan, to have unofficial contacts-unofficial, technical, informal contacts. It is the case that quite recently in the United States such contacts took place with a series of informal talks. Participants on the Australian side included meat and wheat industry representatives, the head of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) in Taipei, which is part of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, and officials with trade responsibilities. The Taiwanese participants included representatives from trade, agricultural and economic agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice of holding such informal meetings to discuss trade and commercial matters is well established and is one pursued by Australia and other countries which have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC). In these and previous such unofficial discussions which have taken place in Australia and elsewhere, Australia and Taiwan have addressed a range of commercial and technical questions, including access problems facing Australian exporters of beef, wheat and fresh fruit in the Taiwan market, as well as quarantine, taxation and customs issues. I make it very clear that such talks do not signify any change to Australia's longstanding one-China policy under which we recognise the PRC as the sole legal Government of China, acknowledge China's claim that Taiwan is a province of China, and refrain from official dealings with the Taiwan authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, what I have just said gives substance to the statement to which Senator Hill referred in the answer that he was given, to the effect that `the Government has given strong support to these efforts'. We have been giving strong support and the unofficial talks to which I have referred are one such vehicle through which that support has been made manifest. </PARA>
<PARA> As for visa questions to which Senator Hill drew attention, he will have noticed that one aspect of that statement today-I am afraid that I have just given him my only remaining copy-is a reference to the Taiwanese office in Australia being given the capacity to engage in visa facilitation processes to the same extent that ACIO does in Taiwan. I believe that that will be of some assistance in smoothing the path for these visit arrangements. There can be no question of direct issuing of visas by the respective offices in question, because that is a consular act of a kind that raises questions of incompatibility with the one-China policy which I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of resources in the respective offices, as today's statement makes clear, we have understood the argument of the business communities in both countries that both the level and strength of occupancy of those respective offices needs to be upgraded, and we support that view. The situation is that Australia's trade and economic interests in Taiwan are represented not by the Government but through the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei, which is operated, as I said earlier, by the Australian Chamber of Commerce, a non-government organisation based in Canberra. As such it is simply not the case that Australian Government officials in any capacity are posted to Taiwan. It is quite inappropriate for Senator Hill to seek a response from me in terms of officers of Foreign Affairs or officers of Immigration. The truth of the matter is that Australian Government officials as such are not posted to Taiwan. I am not in a position to give Senator Hill an answer in the terms in which he seeks it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that the ACIO is staffed by a number of Australian-based personnel. It is also my understanding that ACIO has made a decision to appoint additional Australian-based staff in Taipei to upgrade in particular the visa facilitation service that is currently being offered, particularly by developing a computerised visa issue system linked with the Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong, which computerised arrangement already exists in a number of other countries. It may also prove possible for ACIO to appoint further people on its staff with particular responsibilities in terms of policy liaison with the Taiwanese authorities. But that is a matter for ACIO and not for the Australian Government. I am afraid that I cannot answer those questions further as a result. In regard to the question of air links, again one needs to state at the outset that Australia's acceptance of the PRC as the sole legal Government of China, which I understand still to be the position of the Opposition, even though some competing signals are given from time to time--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that, although here as elsewhere the Opposition wants to have things both ways, our acceptance, and I hope the Opposition's acceptance, of the PRC as the sole legal Government of China, and our respective acknowledgment of Taiwan as a province of China, means that no Australian Government can conclude a government to government air service agreement with Taiwan; nor could a flag carrier such as Qantas Airways Ltd or Taiwan's China Airlines operate a direct Australia-Taiwan service. Such a service could be established only on the basis of a commercial arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the case that Australia Asia Airlines (AAA) has been negotiating with Taiwan interests for some time. I can certainly appreciate the frustration that the delay in setting up that air link may be causing. I share some of that sense of frustration myself because I readily acknowledge the utility of an air link in terms of a further rapid expansion of the Australia-Taiwan economic relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject completely any assertion or suggestion or implication that the Government is responsible for the delay. The fact is that the commercial negotiations in question have proven protracted, difficult and very sensitive. When the Government receives a proposal from AAA or any other commercial interest-and I stress any other commercial interest-we will consider it on its merits. I cannot anticipate the nature of that consideration. We would certainly be interested in any proposal that is consistent with our obligations and our commitments under our one-China policy. We hope that agreement can be reached on workable arrangements in the near future. Those negotiations involving AAA are certainly continuing- continuing, I believe, as we speak today. I certainly hope that the remaining difficulties can be identified and ironed out. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation regarding other airlines flying into Taiwan was made the subject of a final comment from Senator Hill. I would like to put the situation concerning other countries and other airlines squarely on the record, because I think there is a lot of misapprehension and confusion about this. </PARA>
<PARA> To our knowledge carriers from 12 countries plus Hong Kong currently fly to Taiwan. Taiwan's flag carrier, China Airlines, flies to 10 countries plus Hong Kong. Three of the countries which have air links with Taiwan, namely Brunei, South Africa and Korea, do not have diplomatic relations with the PRC, so obviously no question of sensitivity or difficulty arises there. Singapore has an air link with Taiwan. This will continue now that diplomatic relations with the PRC have been established. This predates the establishment of those relations. All but one of the others-and this is the important point-established services prior to their governments' recognition of the PRC.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said all but one. I am getting to that, if Senator Hill will curb his racing hormones. The exception is the Netherlands. Its establishment of an air link with Taiwan was, however, the cause of quite significant problems in the PRC-Netherlands bilateral relationship. The truth of the matter is that the bilateral relationship was nothing like as substantial between the Netherlands and the PRC as is Australia's. We have to take into account, rather than clumsily blustering into these things in the way Senator Hill and the Opposition might be minded to, the implications of acting in clear breach of understandings and commitments which have been entered into on a bilateral basis with the PRC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other case to date of an air link being established with Taiwan by a country recognising the PRC was that of Egypt, which in 1989 permitted a service by China Airlines that operated for a few months but was then suspended, I understand following some rather forceful representations to Egypt on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say finally in this respect that there are a number of countries in a position similar to Australia's which are also working to establish air links with Taiwan within the framework of their respective one China policies. They include the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Canada and New Zealand. Obviously we are monitoring very closely developments in the negotiations involving these other countries and we hope very much that it will be possible to announce a breakthrough quite soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To finish off the Taiwan aspect, I wish to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for his press release, which has just been issued. I have to say, wanting to be as generous as possible, that if what is new, which is stated on page 3-five points-is all that can be advanced to further develop the commercial relationship and commercial opportunities, then it is a very disappointing document. It raises the question of the comprehensive review which was undertaken and which was referred to in the Estimates committee hearings. I take it from this very limited press release that the Government will not make public the comprehensive review. The Minister might indicate whether that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gareth Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not. I think in the Estimates the Minister said that he wanted-to use his usual expression-`a robust, comprehensive review', and therefore it was unlikely to be made public. Whether it is robust or not we will never find out, or not for some little time, because the arguments that were put for significantly further developing a relationship obviously were not accepted by the Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister is worried about our sending wrong messages, I refer him to a headline in the Australian Financial Review of 5 October, headed `Australia closer to official recognition of Taiwan', which indicates that sometimes those who interpret these statements miss the subtleties. I only mention that because of the Minister's rather gratuitous comments in relation to our efforts to further advance Australia's commercial interests in its relationship with Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that there will be some upgrading of Taiwan's commercial representation, although the statement does not tell us to what extent, so that is really somewhat meaningless. I remind the Minister that in the Estimates I put to him the case of one junior official who had been waiting for six months to obtain a visa to enter Australia to man the office of the Far East trading company. The Minister passed the question off by saying that it was not his concern, that it was an immigration matter. It seems to me that they are matters that affect our trade, and he is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> On the historical record, in any event, Australia has done little to facilitate the further development of that office and, therefore, the trading opportunities that come out of it. This statement today simply gives us no real guide as to what is now being considered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised at the time, also in the Estimates, why the Far East trading company could not change its name to the Taipei Trade and Cultural Office so that those who wish to deal with the office can understand better what its function is. I received no answer of any substance. The Minister simply said that the matter was still being considered. I take it from this statement today that although it has been considered for a long time it has been rejected which, if that is a correct interpretation, is disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister that he mentioned Singapore and the way that the Singaporeans have been able to maintain the direct air link with the change of diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China. I bring to his attention-I presume he knows in any event-that Singapore has allowed the trade mission of Taiwan in Singapore to change its name to the Taipei representative office. The Singaporeans do not seem to be as shy as the Australian Government and I doubt very much whether they will suffer any consequences as a result of that change. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously I am pleased that there will be a Taiwan businessman on the advisory board of the multifunction polis, but that is not a decision of any great significance. The Government will investigate ways in which any double tax problems with Taiwan might be overcome. One would have thought that if the Government were doing its job it would have been investigating double tax problems and would have overcome them. So to announce that it will look at it I do not see as being of great consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that allowing Taiwan to operate a visa facilitation service in Australia could be a useful reform. The Government supports a further strengthening of the Australian commerce and industry office in Taiwan, although the Government will not tell us in what way; nevertheless, I guess that is pleasing. I have already acknowledged that that office has been increased in staff in the last year or two and said that it is in Australia's best interest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is really difficult to find much in this press release that today will give heart to those who see economic opportunities wanting because of the Australian Government's very shy and overcautious approach in relation to commercial activities in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister wants to put to me privately what is happening to the change of name of the Far East trading company, that is better than nothing. I think it is just one of those classic examples where it does not affect Australia's interests at all except to give Australian business people easier access to a body that can help facilitate their trading development. As far as the Opposition is concerned, the sooner the Australian Government faces up to some of these simple reforms, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the report to the Senate of Estimates Committee B, in the last paragraph on page 1, dealing with the question of acquittals, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In May 1990 the Committee expressed concern at the processes employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure the prompt acquittal of cash advances and the recovery of related debt. The Department's Explanatory Notes indicate that since May unacquitted advances have been reduced significantly and procedures tightened up (Explanatory Notes pages 233-234). The Committee notes this improvement and will continue to monitor progress in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to ask some further questions about the statement that procedures have been tightened up. In reviewing material that comes our way, we see that there is an enormous concern about this matter expressed not only by the Auditor-General and people at Estimates hearings, but also through the process of internal audit. If we read the explanatory notes, as is recommended in the report, we see interesting things, such as the fact that there have been overdue acquittals from the year 1984-85-that is, four of them-and at present the same four are outstanding. The value of those acquittals is some $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA> My first question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is: What are the new, tightened up procedures referred to in both the explanatory notes and the report of Estimates Committee B?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic processes involved are a requirement that people acquit their advances on time with all sorts of pressures upon them to do so. The success of that particular exercise is demonstrated by some figures that have just been put in front of me, which require a bit more interpretation than I think I am capable of giving them at the moment. They indicate that as of the beginning of November the outstanding sum in issue for these advances was $209,785. That is to be compared with, at the beginning of October, $307,000 in round figures; at the beginning of September, $260,000; and at the beginning of August, $279,000. So there has been quite a dramatic reduction, and that is particularly apparent when one looks at the short term advances outstanding. I think it is fair to say that that is a significant figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to advances that have been given quite recently-that is, within the 1990-91 financial year-as of the beginning of October the amount outstanding for this financial year was down to $105,000, as compared with, for previous months, $173,000, $134,000 and $155,000. </PARA>
<PARA> So there has been a dramatic drop in the short term advances outstanding which is, I think, the best demonstration that I can give the honourable senator of processes now actually putting a real discipline on officers to acquit those advances in effect as soon as the trip has been completed or the other expenditure has been incurred rather than sitting around and letting the paperwork accumulate, which was rather the problem in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I just say quickly, in defence of my officers: some of those I know whose paperwork has been accumulating most dramatically and which was the subject of some attention are enormously hard working and have made an immense contribution to this country's credibility in international relations in recent times. If, on occasions, the speed with which they have addressed the personal paperwork in these matters has not been all that we would desire, it is not necessarily because they are irresponsible or are not making a contribution in other ways. That said, it is obviously very important to maintain very tight procedures and practices in this respect and the evidence is as I have just retailed it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not find that the explanation of accumulated paperwork explains to me why the same number of items-that is, four-in respect of failure to acquit have remained on the books since 1984-85. I will come back to that question in just a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned short term overseas missions having fluctuated somewhat. I would be particularly interested to know the precise figures. The figures that the Minister just quoted to me no doubt show that in the immediate past the acquittal procedure has improved. I might say that that can only be after almost years of concerted effort and criticism on the part of the Auditor-General. But as at 20 June 1990, short term missions overseas accounted for $108,723.51. Medical and dental advances amounted to $56,000, and there were 29 of those. I understand that the rules have been changed and these advances will be handled in a different way now. </PARA>
<PARA> In asking for specific information, I would like to know how many of the 25 short term missions overseas that were outstanding as at 20 June 1990 totalling $108,723 have in fact been acquitted? Also, why do the four outstanding matters from 1984-85 remain outstanding? Indeed, we can go through the numbers of them that have remained outstanding through the subsequent years. But I am particularly interested in those four from 1984-85. Indeed, I might be interested to know which officers are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>1. ADVANCES</PARA>

I suspect that, if we had the 2,500 other officers of your Department present, we still may not get a satisfactory answer from you on this issue. From your answer, I can only assume that you either consider the matter to be of no relevance to you personally, as the Minister, or you consider the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of dollars involved in this matter not to be of interest to the Senate generally or to the public at large.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator Bishop, could you please take your seat. At this stage it might be timely to remind all speakers that they should address their remarks through the Chair. We are having a very direct, personal conversation between senators at the moment. While the prospect is that those remarks are considerably exciting for the gallery, they are not helping the discussion about this report. Senator, please address your remarks through the Chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be delighted to address my remarks through you to the Minister. I wonder whether I could ask for another piece of information that perhaps the Minister would be able to get for me. If one does an analysis of the age of the outstanding debts, one sees that as at the end of July 1990 there were 32 debts that were over two years old; 24 debts between one and two years old; 13 debts six to 12 months old; 33 three to six months old; 47 between one and three months old; and 22 less than one month old. From the figures which the Minister gave at the outset it would seem that in the latter months we have seen an improvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The executive summary of a further internal audit of the Minister's Department recommended a course of action that was pretty simple in that, when the Department was seeking to recover certain debts, it would be important to send them to the correct officer, with care being taken not to send them to a deceased officer, and that follow-up procedures should be entertained. When I asked the Minister about the way in which the Department was tightening up procedures it was along these lines that I was hoping that the Minister might begin to give me some answers. As the question has been taken on notice, I would be interested in seeing a copy of the letter and the documentation used to follow up the question of acquittals. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also interested to know whether the Minister could tell me right now whether there is one particular officer who has run up a series of debts by way of non-acquittals over a period of years, which amount comes into five figures. I ask the Minister not to come back and say that there is no such officer because the sum is somehow able to be described in somewhat different terms. I ask the Minister to tell me whether one particular officer has run up a considerable debt over a number of years and also the amount of that debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure who might have had a debt in five figures. One debtor achieved a degree of public recognition. In respect of that particular person, on advice just given I am able to say that he no longer owes the Department a cent, as a result of a flurry of acquittal activity that has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am able to advise some of the procedures that are in place in relation to advances currently accruing and needing to be acquitted straightaway. There is nothing new about this. This information was put down in the Senate Committee hearing. The basic rule is simply that an acquittal has to be made within seven days after return and no further advances will be made if they are not acquitted within that timeframe, which Senator Bishop will appreciate is a considerable discipline. That may need some supplementation to spell out in full the procedures involved. That will be subject to the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I am not in a position to say, without taking it on notice, what the processes are in relation to debts that have been accrued in the more distant past. I will see what further information it is possible to supply in terms of standard letters and so on going to staff members. I do not think it is particularly appropriate to be canvassing the situation of individual debts in this forum. There are processes by which these issues can be addressed. I will take the question on notice and see what information it is appropriate to provide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps when the Minister is acquiring that information, his officers could pay attention to an internal audit of 11 April 1990. The internal audit addressed areas that were identified as being unsatisfactory or deficient in some way and, as at 11 April 1990, the commitments for domestic travel costs, that is, all costs, and for the ticket component of overseas travel costs were not being recorded.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I go to bilateral relations, referenced in program 3.2. I draw the attention of the Minister to matters which arise out of the responses given to questions at Estimates Committee hearings and, more particularly, to questions that have been placed on notice. I refer the Minister to the questions that I asked him about respect for basic human rights and freedoms. Budget-related Paper No. 6.8 cites a performance indicator for the globals issue area of the appropriations being sought as being `advances in the promotion and protection of fundamental human rights'. Today, I want to find out just where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is at in its monitoring of human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The example that I gave was China. I asked the Minister what was happening to human rights in China in the population control area and in the workers' rights area. I asked the Minister whether these workers' rights had been violated. Had there been a tightening up of controls by the Chinese authorities over workers and workers' associations since the Tiananmen Square massacre? The response that the Minister has given indicates that there has been a tightening up and that there have been violations of the rights to assembly and the rights of association and that the Government has expressed concern about these. It says that in the last year new laws have been passed in China restricting rights of assembly in Beijing and Guangdong. Freedom of association has been further curtailed by the policies enacted on 31 January 1990 calling for intensified politicisation of associations already dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. These laws apply to all Chinese citizens, including workers. Martial law decree No. 10 of 12 June 1989 declared illegal the Beijing workers' autonomous federation, which had been formed in May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a regression by China into policies which violate human rights and specifically workers' rights in contradistinction to what is happening in most other parts of the world, including most other parts of the communist world. The Minister's response goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Other workers' organisations have been declared illegal although we do not hold specific details. On 14 November 1989 the governing body, the ILO, adopted a complaint alleging violations of workers' rights. </PARA>
<PARA>I go to this question of workers' rights being violated and workers' conditions and payments being undermined because workers, as human beings, are attempting to exercise their fundamental human rights. I go to a question that I asked as recorded on page B9 which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Department specifically raised with the Chinese authorities its concerns about the new local regulations in Shanghai-a very substantial area-which are operative from 1 August 1990 regarding family planning and birth control policy in that area and which involve inherently the violation of human rights and workers' rights?</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Department aware of the specific regulations which do include violations of human rights and workers' rights, specifically?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer that was given to me did not relate to Shanghai at all; it related to Hunan family planning rules and regulations approved by the Henan province-I think that is how it should read rather than Heran-authorities on 12 April 1990 to come into force on 1 July 1990. It said that the regulations in question laid down strict family planning guidelines and imposed a system of economic penalties for non-compliance with these guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The response from the Minister was that the Government had not raised this matter with the Chinese Government. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that the imposition of punitive measures in the area of family planning is a matter of some concern as it raises questions of the rights of individuals versus the economic imperatives of the state. </PARA>
<PARA>This does not really answer my question. I want an answer to my question about the new local regulations in Shanghai. Is the Department aware of those? As a backbencher, I am aware of them, but is the Department aware of them? Has the Minister been properly advised? Does he have the information? Will he insist that the Department get the information relating to human rights violations in this area?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am entirely familiar with Senator Harradine's concerns for the situation of human rights in China. Of course, I share many of those concerns, not least so far as the rights of assembly and association and the pursuit of traditional rights by workers and their organisations are concerned. I continue to share his indignation that there has been a significant deterioration in that respect over time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as human rights associated with the family planning programs are concerned, I am as puzzled as Senator Harradine is by the reference to Henan or Heran province, particularly since, whatever else it is, it is not Shanghai, which is what the question was about. All I can say is that I am in the process of getting some further information in this respect. I want to give Senator Harradine, as I promised I would, a considered review of what exactly we know or can find out about the way in which these particular programs are operating in Shanghai and the vicinity or indeed elsewhere that information comes to our hand. </PARA>
<PARA> I do take seriously the point that I have often made in these hearings that, whatever might be my enthusiasm for family planning in general and in terms of poverty alleviation and development assistance, I certainly do not think that should be conducted on a coercive basis and in a way that interferes with other rights of the people in question. If there was foundation for the suggestion that coercion was being used in these programs I would have a number of concerns. As I have discussed with Senator Harradine before, most of the time there is a difficulty in drawing a line between coercion and incentive at the margin. It may be that there is room for some differences of interpretation in that respect. To the extent that there is a question of coercion of some kind going on, that raises the human rights problems, and ones about which I would be very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in the middle of following this up. Unfortunately, the time constraints have just not made it possible to complete this in time for this debate today. I propose writing to Senator Harradine in some detail reviewing this material when I and my Department and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau are in a position to formulate a full and considered response, which is what he has now sought for a long time and what I think is owing to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). I will look forward to that. One of the reasons I focused on Shanghai is that it is the Shanghai medical electronic equipment factory that is purchasing the ultrasound machines that are being supplied, partly through Australian taxpayers' money through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) aid and the development import finance facility (DIFF) program, to the extent of roughly $2.5m. The Shanghai medical electronic equipment company is actually purchasing those ultrasound machines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that those machines will be used by the State Family Planning Commission. The other fact is that the Shanghai regulations, as reported by the Shanghai daily newspapers on 31 July 1990, set forth quite draconian punishments to be meted out to persons not complying with the requirements of the State Family Planning Commission which is receiving these machines from Australia. That is one of the reasons that I focused on the Shanghai regulations. One of the disciplinary measures to be meted out is, for a couple who have had a second child, a fine amounting to three times their combined average income as measured by their incomes two years before the second child. Those couples having a third child or further children would be subject to fines amounting to four times their measured annual income. Again, that is a violation of workers' rights in the exercising of their basic human rights which, incidentally, are outlined in a letter of 16 February from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade relating to the plan of action which was adopted at Mexico City:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . respect for human life is basic to all human societies; and that all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If that is to be followed through, clearly it is a violation of the rights of workers who are exercising that particular right. Furthermore, under the Shanghai regulations work units with unplanned births would not be eligible for selection as enlightened work units and would also be subject to fines. Of course, there is no shop steward in those areas because there are no unions. It is a gross violation of human rights and I will be very grateful if the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will pursue those matters very vigorously and continue to monitor those questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the answer that was given to me in respect of program 5.2, the environment assistance program. In the Estimates Committee I quoted that the Government had indicated:</PARA>
<PARA>As part of the four-year Environmental Assistance Program which commenced last year, activities focused on forestry, sustainable agriculture and population stabilisation will be undertaken in 1990-91 at both regional and country levels. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked a number of questions, including how this was to be put into practice. The response that I have received has not dealt with how this will be put into practice. I would like that question to be taken on notice and for an answer to be given to me at some stage. It is a matter of getting some clarification about that question. I apologise to the Committee of the Whole for having to raise this, but these were questions on notice to which I received responses and I have not had the opportunity in the Estimates Committee hearings to follow through the responses. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similar vein, I ask whether the Minister could provide further details at some stage in respect of the International Development Association projects in India about which there have been some responses, but I need to have more detailed responses in respect of the project that is at points 3 and 4 in the Department's responses to me. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the DIFF program, I want to follow up the points that were made concerning the supply of ultrasound machines to the State Family Planning Commission. This matter was raised initially at the Estimates Committee hearing by Senator Olsen. For the information of honourable senators who were not at the Estimates Committee hearing, I point out that the Government through a DIFF project has put forward, I think, $1.4m of DIFF money and $1.2m of aid money for the supply of what we had thought was 200 ultrasound machines to the State Family Planning Commission and what I now believe will be 100 such machines to the Commission in order to assist its population control program. I am not satisfied at all with the responses that have come forward, given the fact that the China program is a coercive program. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the Minister say today that at last the Department and the Minister will address themselves to the questions of violations of human rights that I have been raising for the last two years. It is quite obvious that the Department has not had the material on which to make a proper assessment as to whether these machines will be used for coercive purposes. It is quite clear from the responses that have been given to me that there has been an attempt to sidetrack the issue because the Department ascertained that the machines would probably not be used for the purposes of sex-related abortions. It will never be in a position to say whether or not that will be the fact. I do not know from whom it obtained that undertaking or whether the undertaking is worth anything, in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do have is clear evidence that there is a requirement in certain areas of China for women who have had one child to be compulsorily fitted with an interuterine device (IUD). There have been statements clearly made by experts in the field that many of those women are required, from time to time, to be subjected to X-rays to see whether they retain the IUD. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to the Sunday Herald of 16 September 1990 when this issue was reported following the meeting of the Estimates Committee that was held here in Canberra. Under a headline `Abortion row over exports to China' by Martin Daly, the national correspondent in Canberra, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia may be supporting China's ruthless population control program by supplying medical equipment that could be used to force abortions. </PARA>
<PARA> The equipment can be used to detect twin pregnancies, determine whether women have removed contraceptive devices under China's one child per family policy or to determine the sex of a foetus, potentially allowing female babies to be aborted. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Government did address itself to that latter question. The article, presumably quoting the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, says:</PARA>
<PARA> AIDAB claims it has been given a policy statement by China's State Family Planning Commission (SFPC). The agency claims the SFPC was not part of the abortion process and had a strong policy against discrimination against girls.</PARA>
<PARA> However, that's a line dismissed by another China expert, Steven Mosher, director of Asian Studies at the Californian Claremont Institute. ``That's simply not true,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Because of the one-child policy and the status of having male children, Chinese women often manufacture a history of illness so they can be examined on ultrasound. But the real reason is so they can kill the child if it is female,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of pressure that is being applied. I understand that the Minister has said that, at last, he is going to subject these matters to some scrutiny. The sort of pressure that is being placed on the women, in particular, in China is something which we should not be in any way associated with. I feel it is high time that the sorts of statements that have been emanating from the Minister-presumably written by AIDAB-have to be closely examined because they do not stand up to the light of day. </PARA>

<PARA> I repeat my undertaking to him that we will look very carefully at the material on this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise the question of the industrial relations difficulties within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which were raised in the Estimates Committee. Although the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to some extent wanted to pass off the responsibility to the Department of Industrial Relations, we were informed, as I recall it, that the matters were basically under control and that the work bans had been lifted because allowances were being reconsidered in the light of further charges that the Department wished to place upon officers serving abroad. At least the heat had been taken from the issue, and the difficulties that were experienced a little earlier this year were no longer being experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now understand that the work bans are back on at overseas embassies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not only officers in my Department that are affected by the overseas living allowance and rent and utilities contribution issue which has given rise to industrial difficulties. There are some 2,500 people overseas altogether, of which my Department represents about 1,000. Nonetheless, we are obviously pretty central to this issue. Because of the way in which it was dragging on, I did in recent times take a strong personal interest in this and engaged in a quite protracted process of negotiation myself with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in association with our respective departments, which have been working on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We came up with a package which, in the judgment of the three Ministers-and I readily express my support for it-was a fair and balanced one. It was not as generous as ideally I would like to have been able to provide for my officers overseas, who have, I think, been slipping behind in terms of their capacity to handle those situations financially. Nonetheless, given all the other constraints that are operating on Government, I think it is a fair package and one that did represent for most people a net advance or, in any event, a significant improvement in their conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> That particular package as negotiated was communicated to our officers, with results that are still not yet totally clear in terms of the nature of their reaction. But of the 32 posts of the 90 posts altogether that we have overseas which have replied to requests for reaction to the package, 14 have expressly indicated their acceptance of it. I think it is a reasonable assumption that a number of those posts which have not been explicit about it have allowed their silence, as it were, to speak for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made it very clear that there is no further scope for negotiation. This does not represent just some kind of offer from the Government that is now on the table; it represents a concluded decision of the Government as to what we are prepared to pay, and if there is any further resistance to it that is protracted then that offer will be withdrawn and the public servants in question will just have to take their chances through the arbitral process. </PARA>
<PARA> It is management's judgment that the position as reached in the way that I have described is broadly acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the officers concerned. However, it has not proved to date to be acceptable, it seems, to the leadership of the Public Service Union. It is on that basis that a campaign is still being waged and bans of a kind have been reimposed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a manifestly unsatisfactory situation. It is one that the Minister for Industrial Relations is now addressing directly. We are making it very clear in further circulars and so on that are going out to everyone what the precise nature of the offer is-its non-negotiable character. Unless it is accepted, people can expect to find themselves considerably worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want to be too ham-fisted about this. There is a real sense of grievance around, some of which I think is legitimate in terms of the past situation. People in those posts are working under very difficult conditions and I think they deserve our sympathy and respect. But equally there is no justification for putting Australia's interests at risk by insufficient servicing of visitors passing through or some of the other sorts of things that can be involved in these work bans. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply express the hope that cooler heads will prevail sooner rather than later and that this issue will rapidly be brought to a conclusion. I think that brings the Committee reasonably up to date on what the situation is, without going into endless details about tables and the details of the operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of small matters that I would like to get out of the way and it might be convenient to deal with them in a group. Honourable senators may remember that, coincidentally, the day of the Estimates Committee was the day on which it was decided that disciplinary action would be brought against an officer of the Department who in some way was deemed to be the `officers revolutionary council'. I believe that is the way the Minister put it. Some would say that he was one of the `officers revolutionary council', but the answer provided to us subsequently gives very little indication as to what is happening with that important matter. Obviously we are interested in whether he is dealt with correctly. Can the Minister outline to the Committee what action is being taken against him, how his rights are being preserved and what the timetable is for resolution of the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I want to raise is the question of a series of leaks of secret, top secret, AUSTEO secret, Cabinet-in-confidence and confidential documents out of the Department over a period of months. Some of these leaks were highly embarrassing to Australia. In the Estimates Committee the Minister advised us that these matters had been referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. That occurred some time ago. One would have thought that there would be progress, at least in relation to some of these inquiries. Yet the answer that has been provided to us says that as yet the investigations have not been concluded in a way that any action has been brought against any person. I would not have thought that they were particularly difficult matters to investigate, bearing in mind that one can trace the number of sources from which a document could emanate and start--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to do the work for the Australian Federal Police, but I give it credit in that it ought to be able to resolve an issue such as this unless, of course, all of these leaks are coming from different sources, in which case it indicates another problem in the Department of which we should be aware. So I ask for an update of the continuing leakages that are coming out of the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third issue I want to raise, which certainly was resolved unsatisfactorily at the time of the Estimates, results from the illegal visas that were given through our Lagos Embassy. It seems they were granted to Middle Eastern persons. This was obviously a fraudulent scheme. At the Estimates we were advised that there were four entries to Australia under illegal visas issued in Lagos which were subject to Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs compliance action. I ask the Minister to update the Committee as to the current position in that regard, as it is obviously a very serious breach, the full consequences of which we still do not know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not have a great deal more, but it has the actual list of the seven charges. I am just giving Senator Hill the page references to where he will find them. An inquiry officer from outside my Department has been appointed to investigate the charges. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Public Service Act, the officer charged will have the opportunity of making a full statement to the inquiry officer. Pending the outcome of the inquiry and any subsequent appeals, it really would be quite inappropriate-as I think it would be appreciated-for me to name the officer or to provide any further details other than the name of the charges themselves and the circumstances which gave rise to them. That is as much as I can say on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of leaks and the investigation thereof, I am not really in a position to say anything much more than has been put to the chamber. There are a number of such disclosures going back to July which are being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. While the documents in question did originate in my Department, it has to be acknowledged that the source of the leaks may well have been elsewhere as their distribution did include other departments and agencies. So it is not a simple matter to conduct an investigation of this kind with any chance of producing results and, indeed, no results are yet available. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made it very clear that obviously I take a serious view of breaches of security. I guess, on matters of rough and tumble political significance, one just has to live with them. But when one is talking about matters that go directly to the national interest and the conduct of foreign affairs, they are manifestly inappropriate. So we are taking the matter seriously. We are investigating it, but I cannot give the honourable senator any further information. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Lagos and the visa issue there, I am afraid I cannot give Senator Hill any more information. I know that supplementary information was sought by the Committee. We have nothing further that we can provide. It is in fact a Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs matter. Any further follow-up will have to be through that Department. We are simply not in a position to supply any further information. We do not have it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Before going to the answers to the questions on notice that were given to me by the Minister relating to the new amount that was set aside for the environment, I want to raise with the Minister the whole question of development aid education and point out to him, as he probably knows, that the Australian Development International Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) survey seemed to indicate that there was a lessening of support in Australia for overseas development assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a disconcerting feature and it is even more disconcerting that apparently that has been reflected in the overseas development assistance budget this year, which appears to represent an effective cut of $96m over last year. Some of the areas cut include an 11 per cent cut in funds for international agricultural research, which is absolutely vital and was recognised as such by AIDAB in response to questions I asked. Here we have an 11 per cent cut in funds for this most worthy and important tool for overcoming poverty in various parts of the world. There is a substantial cut in funds which have been going to a number of programs, including programs relating to reafforestation and the food for work program in Ethiopia; substantial cuts have been made to the funding going to the sub-Saharan region and so on. The list is quite enormous and I think Senator Teague-I notice him in the chamber-referred to the cuts which have resulted in the Overseas Service Bureau (OSB) having to postpone sending a number of volunteers overseas. I think it was 50, was it not?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a whole departure group.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That came about because of cuts to the funding for overseas development assistance in the Budget. That is most disconcerting and what concerns me is that while those things have been cut, the international population controllers have been able to get their hands on more money from this Government. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) have had their funding increased by this Government through the back door. As is evident in the material provided to me by AIDAB in respect of the new environmental assistance program, both those organisations are going to get a substantial whack of that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those organisations are going to get, I think, 35 per cent of the money earmarked for the new environmental assistance program. One must question why. On the one hand the Government is cutting millions of dollars from a program focusing on reafforestation, while on the other hand it is increasing the sums available to UNFPA by 44 per cent and to IPPF by 100 per cent. I challenge the Government that that is quite an improper thing to do. In my view, even to assist those organisations is a misuse of taxpayers' money. The United States of America refuses to provide any money to UNFPA. I quote Peter McPherson, the administrator of the US Agency for International Development who said:</PARA>
<PARA>UNFPA participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation in the People's Republic of China, within the meaning of the Kemp/Kaston Amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>When I talk about China, I am also talking about Tibet. On 29 March 1990 an article entitled, `Genocide through Abortion' appeared in the Advocate in Melbourne. It was written by Wendy Miller and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>China is trying to wipe out the Tibetan race through forced abortion and sterilisation programs, and its population transfer policy, said the Vice President of the Tibetan Women's Association in Exile, Ms Pema Dechem today. </PARA>
<PARA>The US Government refuses to fund UNFPA because it participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation, according to Mr McPherson. </PARA>
<PARA> Three days after the massacre in Tiananmen Square UNFPA voted $US57m to the China coercive population control program, supported by the Australian Government representative at that conference. That action was opposed by the US representative who attended the conference. If honourable senators want official statements, there are reams of official statements made by UNFPA officials about the China program. UNFPA officials have had a number of things to say. Let me give the chamber a couple of examples: Manfred Kulessa, China representative of UNFPA, in an article entitled `UN official praises China population control program' in the Xinhua General Overseas News Service, Beijing. The article was dated 11 July 1987, and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is significant that here in China . . . the government has shown its full commitment to a family planning program that has been internationally acknowledged as one of the most successful efforts in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote another UNFPA official:</PARA>
<PARA>China's ability to reduce the natural growth rate from 2.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent in the past decade has been a `fantastic achievement'. </PARA>
<PARA>That was by Aprodicio Laquian, China country program director of the UNFPA. There is no mention of or deference to the well-known abuses of human rights involved in that program in both China and Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad part about it was that when Nafis Sadik came to Australia to sell UNFPA, she went before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, gave her line there and was not questioned. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) says in statements to people who write to him that, among other things, UNFPA does not regard abortion as an appropriate means of family planning. Let me quote Nafis Sadik, who is now the international director of UNFPA and who wrote in a research article into the regulation of human fertility. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would say that a menses inducer which was self-administered perhaps could really change the course of family planning programs. Such a device would free women from having to ask anybody, husband or physician-a woman would then be free to take something, not after coitus or at any other time, but only when she thought she was pregnant. </PARA>
<PARA>That is UNFPA's and Nafis Sadik's attitude on that subject. So far as the International Planned Parenthood Federation is concerned, the United States Government again will not give one cent of US taxpayers' funds to that body. One of the reasons for that is that IPPF refused to sign the US-Mexico City policy and therefore removed itself from being able to receive US aid funds. The IPPF is in the forefront of moves to get a number of countries to have easier access to abortions. Here are our taxpayers' funds going to these organisations through the back door now; the environment assistance program being used to fund these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is an outrageous situation where the total aid budget has been slashed by 7 per cent and the funds for overseas development assistance have been slashed by $96m this year-slashed in areas including agriculture, research, reafforestation and various other worthwhile programs-and yet money is able to be found for international lobby organisations such as UNFPA and IPPF. I think the Committee deserves an explanation on those particular matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has raised a whole heap of issues. The first one was to suggest that there was a $96m reduction in the Budget. Let me simply say straight out that that is not so. The aid budget increased by 1.6 per cent in real terms or $19.7m in monetary terms this year. It is not as much as I would have liked, but it did represent a significant achievement in circumstances of real constraint. The figure of a $96m reduction that Senator Harradine has come up with is based on some rather spurious figuring by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, ACFOA, which bases it on a calculation of $1,174m being the basic aid vote in 1989-90, which was inflated by the bringing forward $100m of payments to financial institutions to that year. Then that was inflated by 7 per cent, an arbitrary figure that the Council used for inflation to come to a notional total for this year of $1,363m. When compared to the $1,267m that was actually put on the table by the Government, that represents a shortfall of $96m. But all of that calculation is suspect, not least for the 7 per cent inflation figure. The actual figure that was used by the Government was not 7 per cent but 6.1 per cent, which makes a significant difference to the figuring. Again, the effects of the bring forwards have been capable of all sorts of manipulation for public presentational purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I can say in that respect is that while it is the case that bring forwards increased 1988-89 expenditure-for reasons that are well known to the aid agencies-by approximately $100m, in the year before and in the two years after that aid has stayed constant in real terms. That has been the pattern pretty well since the large shortfall occurred in 1986. We have striven very hard to maintain the aid budget in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Where difficulties have arisen for this year's aid budget is not in any shortfall of the kind that Senator Harradine or ACFOA has identified, but simply by virtue of yet another significant drain on the aid budget being required this year as a result of commitments falling due in a way that had not previously been anticipated to international financial institutions-some $100m of extra commitments this year. Since the aid budget was effectively finite and we were able to get only a small increase from the previous year, not enough to accommodate the whole of that $100m, as much as I tried, that meant that there was very considerable pressure placed elsewhere on the aid budget because of the need to divert expenditure into the Asian Development Bank and World Bank commitments that I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA> That has made it necessary for there to be reductions in some other areas-regrettable deductions, certainly. I accept the point that is made about agricultural research. The drop back from $6.6m to $5.6m was regrettable. We were able pretty well to preserve ACR's real income intact and a number of other major projects but there as elsewhere, with a lot of bilateral programs and a lot of multilateral programs, we simply had to shave, shave, shave. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Overseas Service Bureau was one area that was shaved a little as compared with the expectations of that organisation, but in practice my understanding is that arrangements have been made to ensure that the number of Australian volunteers abroad operates at roughly the levels that have been established in recent years; namely, some 250 volunteers at a time. I have recently made available some additional money from another source within the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau budget to overcome a particular perceived problem in that area. I think Mr Armstrong and his organisation accept that. Certainly they have not been on my back in recent months. I think Senator Harradine's criticism is a little outdated in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> As for reduction here in these areas being accompanied by some massive increase in the population funding program, it is the case that there has been some increase overall but the orders of magnitude are very small-$4.5m up to $5.3m for a very wide ranging program that is by no means confined to the UNFPA itself. It extends to a number of other international organisations and organisations in particular countries like, for example, our population and family health project in Bangladesh. </PARA>
<PARA> I make absolutely no apology at all for the priority and the gradually increasing priority that we in the Government have been giving to family planning programs. I regard population issues as quite central in development policy. That is the view of most professionals in the field around the world and it is a view to which I will adhere. I do not accept the allegations that continue to be made by Senator Harradine about the UNFPA and coercive activities allegedly being supported by it in China. We have investigated that particular assertion which has been made periodically by the US agency to which he refers, but not to my knowledge by anyone else. It is not an allegation that we have found substantiated. I just want to make it absolutely clear that what Senator Harradine says about the UNFPA is, I believe, misconceived. It is a pity that he continues to ride that particular horse. It is not one that is justified and I am going to stick to my guns in that respect. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to make a few remarks on this matter. This was the first Bill under the new system referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which I chaired. I must confess that it was an amazingly easy task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not too sure that it was, Senator Powell. I did not do much at all. It is a bit like having a junior brief in the old days, and I am sure that Senator Alston will remember those days. I am referring to the sort of brief that was settled on the day one got it. In other words, one did not really have to exercise one's mind. Credit for its being an easy exercise for me as Chairman is due to a whole lot of people, and I think that it is appropriate that I name them. I first mention the Committee itself, particularly the Deputy Chairperson, Senator Vanstone. She should be mentioned because we dispatched the business that was brought before us in a civilised way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish to thank Senator Powell, who with her keen and kind mind got down to the issues quickly. I also thank Senator Hill, who acted as well as I have seen any silk act. I also thank the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, who brought all his considerable abilities to the handling of this matter. Indeed, all those who participated were like silks. I wondered why they were so well briefed and why they were able to come to such agreements as they did. They were very useful agreements, and this has meant that the Bill has gone as far as it has with great dispatch. I found out that their efforts resulted from the work of the people who briefed them. On Senator Hill's part we need to thank Veronica Hancock from his office, who guided him through the tortuous passage of the legislation with great skill. I also refer to the redoubtable Lesley Vick, whose help I know Senator Powell will gladly acknowledge. I also refer to Shaun Gath in the Minister's office, who gave more than splendid service. I also thank the people who so ably staffed the office which services the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I refer to Kathleen Gibson, Geoffrey Kennett, Mary-Louise Willheim, and Bronwyn McNaughton, the Secretary to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be interesting to see how the Bill progresses here and whether it goes forward with the admirable dispatch that it has experienced so far. If it continues to do so, life as Chairman of the Committee will be bliss. It will take me back to the days when a person was guided through the difficult passages by an outstanding silk, by great solicitors and great clerks. It took me back to those blissful days. I hope that I shall keep being taken back to those days by the reasonable people who so far have helped to guide this Bill through its consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with everything said by Senator Cooney. I wish to address the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and my view is that the Privacy Amendment Bill is still in a totally unsatisfactory form. However, so far as the work of the Committee is concerned, it has done its job admirably. Honourable senators who are participating in this Committee of the Whole may not be aware that we have probably saved about a week's sitting. No doubt Senator Tate will take that back to Senator Robert Ray as a demonstration that the new committee system can work well when it is approached in a spirit of goodwill, is well chaired, is well staffed and there is good backup staff on all sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be the first to acknowledge that this piece of proposed legislation is now in far better shape than when it was referred to the Committee. That means that as it will pass tonight we are happier than if it had not gone through that process, although we still have some fundamental concerns with the Bill. Unfortunately, the committee procedure is not one whereby we can achieve fundamental change and, although we went into the Committee with high hopes, they were perhaps a little unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA> We have agreed from the start that there is a need for regulation in this area-that of controlling credit reference reporting. It is interesting that the industry also agreed to that from the start of this debate. The dispute has been primarily- really wholly-about what is the best and correct way to regulate the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, which is now back before the Committee of the Whole, severely restricts the current use of credit reference reporting and totally prohibits it from being used by real estate agents, insurance companies and many others; and we think that that is regrettable, to say the least. It gives no automatic notification to individuals that access has been had to their files in these areas and it does not adequately reflect the information privacy principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition moved, in total, over 50 amendments to the Bill and to the Government amendments. The object of our amendments was to allow credit reference reporting for most commercial users, to make the Bill more practical and realistic, and to provide real protection for consumers. It is unfortunate that so few of our amendments have the necessary support in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It will no doubt be acknowledged that the Government has also moved many amendments to the Bill, particularly as a result of consultations over the past few months. We are supporting some of those amendments as far as they go towards improving the Bill, particularly those which will allow mortgage and trade insurers access to credit reporting services. The Government amendments to which the Opposition is either opposed or has moved amendments are Government amendments Nos 2, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 19, 30, 36, 40, 41, 44, 45, 45A, 46 and 47. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments moved by the Opposition fall under a number of different heads. I will briefly remind the Senate of them. The first is the artificial distinction between consumer and commercial credit. The Bill is based upon this artificial distinction. We have argued that the two should not be separated when, in practice, they often cannot be separated. The Government's argument in favour of its position has been that the industry would be moving towards positive reporting, which has been denied by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to separate consumer and commercial credit reporting also very significantly weakens the protective mechanisms of the Bill for individuals who are engaged in small business ventures. If a person applies for a personal loan and credit is refused because of information in a credit report, the credit provider must inform the person that the report was responsible for the refusal. The person then has a right of access to the report and has the right to challenge any information contained in it. If the report contains false or misleading information, the individual may also have a right to claim compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the same person, however, applies for a commercial loan and the application is refused because of a credit report, he does not need to be told the reason for the refusal and he has no right of access to the report and no right to query its accuracy. We believe that that distinction defies logic. The important point is that the distinction between commercial and consumer finance is often blurred, with working capital, including business borrowings, being applied to household as well as business users and personal finances being added to working capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area of great concern that we took to the Committee and that I want to mention again at this stage of debate in dealing with the Committee's report relates to publicly available information. Publicly available information is exempt from the provisions of the Bill. In the credit reporting context, such information includes details of writs, summonses and judgments recorded against an individual. The Opposition is of the view that this type of information is too important to be exempt from the privacy protection afforded by the Bill. It should not be so exempt, otherwise there is nothing to stop any person setting up a database comprised exclusively of such information and operating completely outside the scope of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill assumes that publicly available information is correct. The fact is that, once it is entered on a file, it may not be correct. Writs and summonses may be the subject of dispute and may be successfully defended; judgments may be set aside. If a file is not updated to reflect such changes it will result in a person being refused credit on the basis of wrong information. A person refused credit under such circumstances would not be advised of the reason for the refusal and would have no right of access to the information. There would be no procedure for the correction of wrong information. </PARA>
<PARA> The third remaining shortcoming that I want to refer to is in relation to monitoring. The Opposition amendments relate to a situation where it has become obvious that an individual is in default with several credit providers. The amendments allow a credit provider to `monitor' a customer so that he can be aware that a person is in financial difficulty with other creditors. They act to protect both the consumer, by possibly preventing insolvency, and the credit provider, by possibly preventing a bad debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that our amendments would not have allowed the system of general surveillance of that information. Information on a file could be used only in considering the appropriateness of financial counselling, a rearrangement of the individual's credit commitments, or a reassessment of his credit limit. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the lack of support for the Opposition amendments, we are reluctantly accepting the Australian Democrats' amendment, which allows a credit reporting agency to disclose information contained in a file where the agency has received information at least 30 days before the disclosure that a person is at least 60 days overdue in making a payment. In our view, we accept that as a second best situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area of shortcoming is that relating to general insurance. Under this Bill general insurers are excluded from access to credit information. This, in the Opposition's view, ignores the very serious problem of insurance fraud. The Opposition's resistance to this move by the Government has received widespread support. For example, I remind you, Mr Chairman, that at the Australian Insurance Law Association conference in Melbourne last year Douglas Meagher, QC, said that the Bill would make it almost impossible, firstly, to identify and then to investigate fraudulent claims. Organised fraud would be virtually undetectable. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many examples which clearly highlight the close relationship between insurance fraud and prior financial problems. At a time when insurance fraud is running at $1.5 billion a year, in our view the Government should not be introducing legislation which will make fraud even easier. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth area of shortcoming which I want to raise in this Committee relates to the real estate industry. Under this Bill, real estate agents are excluded from access to credit information files. At present, there are 650 real estate firms across Australia which are members of the Credit Reference Association. These firms represent approximately 90 per cent of all agencies involved in property management. They use credit bureau files for the purpose of assessing tenancy applications.  They do so because of a duty to their clients to check the bona fides of prospective tenants. The correlation between credit problems and unsatisfactory tenancies has been recognised for many years. In fact, in 1986 the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales was able to demonstrate this to the New South Wales Privacy Committee to the extent that the Committee reversed its original recommendation that real estate agents be excluded from access to credit files. </PARA>
<PARA> Although landlords have a number of protections available to them, such as rental bonds, it is not unusual for an unsatisfactory tenant to cease payment of rents some weeks before moving out, thus negating any protection the landlord may have had. If real estate agents cannot use credit reporting services, it will be a simple commercial necessity to set up tenant databases in each State. Because these databases will be outside the legislation, there will be no regulation and no automatic protection of the rights of individuals to access their files and no procedure to correct any wrong information. It is not a position the industry wants but it will be imposed upon it by the effect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth area that I want to refer to is amendments relating to the recording of information on, access to or use of information on credit reference files. These amendments relate to guarantors, collection agents, company directors, other credit providers, trustees in bankruptcy and liquidators. We are pleased that the Government is accepting our amendment 14A, which adds a provision for the recording of an inquiry by a credit provider about someone who has offered to act as a guarantor. It is disappointing, however, that the remaining amendments in this category have not received the same support. In particular, the exclusion of mercantile agents will have serious effects for small businesses which presently use those agents to collect debts. Those businesses will be forced to join the Credit Reference Association in order to use its information, thus making credit recovery more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh area that I want to refer to is dishonoured cheques. The Opposition is of the view that the presentation of cheques which are then dishonoured should be among the permitted contents of credit information files. Such behaviour is frequently an indication of credit difficulties, even though a dishonoured cheque given in payment for goods and services does not necessarily involve the extension of credit by a credit provider-for example, it may be for goods delivered cash on delivery by a retail store. Because the Opposition's amendments have not received the necessary support, the Opposition is supporting the Democrats' amendments on this matter, again as a compromise measure. These amendments provide for the recording of information about dishonoured cheques in certain limited circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The eighth category that I want to refer to relates to transitional provisions or those affecting use of information collected prior to the commencement of the Bill. Because of time constraints, somebody else may have to say something before I have the opportunity to finish what I want to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Chairman, and the Committee. I think the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) was indicating that he would have given me leave to finish. This is a long and complicated issue. Although the debate here tonight will not be so long, I think it is important that these fundamental concerns are restated when we are debating the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The eighth matter that I wish to refer to relates to transitional provisions, or those affecting use of information collected prior to commencement of the Bill. The Opposition's amendments, which were raised in the Committee, recognised that there will be a difficult period of transition for both credit reporting agencies and credit providers, as they will be in possession of certain information which will be proscribed by the Bill. Once again, the Opposition is supporting the Democrats' amendments, which set out quarantine provisions for information collected prior to the commencement of the Bill, as a compromise measure in view of the lack of support for our own amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninthly, I wish to deal with some miscellaneous provisions. The Opposition's amendments sought to broaden the definition of `credit provider' so that a business need only involve the provision of loans in order to be a credit provider under the legislation, instead of the present requirement that a substantial part of the business be the provision of loans. This is a far more realistic picture of the groups which were likely to require the services of credit reporting agencies. We were unsuccessful in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition moved three amendments relating to the role of the Privacy Commissioner, which I am pleased to note have received support from both the Government and the Democrats. Opposition amendment No.10 adds a further consideration for the Privacy Commissioner to take into account when preparing the code of conduct the likely costs to credit reporting agencies and their users. After all, there is no use in having standards in the code which are so costly, either to the agencies or their users, that their implementation is impractical. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition amendment No. 26 opposes Government amendment No.34 - proposed new subsections 18K(5) and (6). I understand that amendment No. 34 is being withdrawn. That is a wise decision as it is extremely bureaucratic in that it provides that the Commissioner may determine the manner in which information may be disclosed, including the manner in which an individual's consent may be obtained. Opposition amendment No. 27 achieves the same result with respect to the Bill itself as the previous amendment achieves with respect to the Government's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to word limits. Under Opposition amendment No.18, where an individual requests a statement concerning a disputed matter to be added to his file the maximum length of the statement is 100 words. Since the credit reporting agency is obliged to add such statements to the file, it is reasonable to limit the length of the statement to prevent files becoming unmanageably large. Because this amendment will not receive the necessary support, the Opposition will be supporting the Democrats' compromise amendment on this subject, which gives the Privacy Commissioner the power to determine what is reasonable in any circumstances of dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to consent, Opposition amendment No. 22 removes the requirement for a trade insurer to have the written permission of an individual to access that person's credit file. The amendment is necessary because trade insurers do not have direct contact with the individual whose debt a credit provider is seeking to insure. Therefore, obtaining the individual's written permission would be a difficult and impractical exercise. The Opposition proposes instead that there be a requirement that the individual must have been informed in writing by the credit provider before any access by the trade insurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The tenth area of concern which we raised is that of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The Opposition had moved an amendment to provide for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from a decision of the Privacy Commissioner. The object of the amendment was to provide some appeal mechanism short of the very expensive and formal Federal Court. However, we have agreed not to pursue this amendment on the understanding that the question of the jurisdiction of the AAT in matters arising under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission legislation generally is to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for examination under its cost of justice reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there were a series of amendments which have become known as the Corrs-the legal firm-amendments. That firm of solicitors recently raised the matter of a number of types of transactions which would be adversely affected by the introduction of the Bill. The types of transactions include the sale of loan debts, the sale of a credit provider which owns loan debts and the taking of security over loan debts. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Bill was originally drafted, the purchaser or chargee would have been unable to obtain vital information relating to the loans. The Government conceded that these effects were largely unintended consequences and has proposed amendments which meet some of the concerns raised, specifically so that disclosure is allowed to related corporations and to corporations which are proposing to accept an assignment of a debt owed to a credit provider, to accept a debt as a security for a loan or to purchase an interest in a credit provider. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we accept that, we do not believe that the Government's suggested amendments cover all the necessary points. In a few minutes we will be moving a further series of amendments under this head, some of which, we understand, will be accepted by the Government and some of which will not be accepted. The purpose of our amendments is to allow disclosure to the professional advisers of a corporation and to the managers of loan portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, whilst we think that the Bill is now a technically better Bill than when it last left the Senate and entered the committee process, nevertheless, there are still a number of fundamental shortcomings that I have referred to tonight which will not make it possible for us to support the Bill at the third reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> We regret that the Government has remained ideologically blinkered in this exercise, that it has not been able to take up these areas of reform which, I would have thought on any effective assessment, have a great deal of merit. The Government has also not been prepared to take up the Bill which we introduced in the other chamber as an alternative and better approach to regulating the credit reference industry. Nevertheless, before I sit down I reiterate my thanks to all of those who have endeavoured during this process to improve the legislation and to make our early experiment with the new standing committee procedure in the consideration of Bills referred by the chamber, at least in this instance, a success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Committee. I rise simply to make the point that I also commend the work of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs once this Privacy Amendment Bill was sent to it. I also commend the work of all the parties concerned in looking at the Australian Democrats' amendments which-contrary to Senator Hill's comments about their being compromises-I would term as improvements to the legislation. It is my contention that, on issues such as quarantining, dishonoured cheques, the word limit and other matters, what we have been able to achieve, particularly in the area of agreed Democrat amendments, has been improvement to the legislation rather than simply compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal appeals referred to in items 9 and 10 in the Committee's report was also of concern to the Democrats. We will be looking with interest at the work of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in this respect. We hope and believe that this important issue that was raised will be resolved in time. In the course of events tonight, we will be supporting those few additional amendments that are coming forward from the Government, from the batch of what has been termed the Corrs amendments, again in the interests of improving the legislation. Subsequent to that, we will be supporting the Bill at the third reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a few brief points in relation to the Privacy Amendment Bill. Of course, I fully endorse Senator Hill's comments. The concerns that some of us have with this Bill were well expressed in the evidence that came before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. One of the groups of witnesses that came before us pointed out that about 50 business groups remained opposed to the Bill in the form which was then before the Committee. We appreciate that Senator Tate and his colleagues were moved to address at least some of these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very rare occasion that one can get such a united front in the business community. A constructive approach has been taken by those of us on this side of the chamber. Senator Hill referred to the alternative Bill that has been introduced in the other place which addresses in a very real way many of the concerns that have been raised here. Not only business groups are concerned about this Bill; a major and detailed report was prepared on this Bill by the former Ombudsman, Professor Jack Richardson. The concerns he raised fully endorsed those matters that Senator Hill mentioned in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise two specific matters. One goes to a fundamental problem that we have in this chamber and in this Parliament that governments bring in Bills without any clear idea of their overall cost to the community at large. Some fairly horrendous costs were mentioned in the evidence brought before the Committee. It was put to the Committee that the likely cost of this Bill would range between $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion a year in fraud, bad debts and operational costs. It is interesting that, when this matter was raised with the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), it was fairly clear that the Government had no figures on the likely effects of this Bill on the industry. The costs stretching well over $1 billion were not in any way addressed by the Government in the evidence. When Senator Tate responds to the matters raised here today, I hope he will give some idea of the likely extra costs that this Bill will impose on the credit industry. By imposing extra costs on the credit industry, the Government is effectively imposing extra costs on all consumers. That is one matter that I wished to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> I also fully endorse other matters which Senator Hill mentioned about the rights of appeal. It became very apparent during the evidence which was brought before us that this Bill in many ways was not adequate; in one particular way, that it imposed very heavy burdens on those who wished to appeal against the determinations of the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I wish to raise has been very effectively expressed by Professor Jack Richardson in his report on the role given to the Privacy Commissioner by this Bill. On page 2 of the report Professor Richardson argues:</PARA>
<PARA>A disturbing feature of the legislation is the extensive powers and functions given to the Privacy Commissioner . . . The Commissioner's main tasks under the Act concern observance by Commonwealth agencies of information privacy principles. The Commissioner has yet to make good his role under the principal Act. The powers and functions which he is given under the Bill, will be exercised mainly in relation to private industry which operates quite differently from most government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>He urges:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill as it now reads is unbalanced and should not proceed in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Richardson goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The position is that the Commissioner performs a legislative function in issuing the Code of Conduct. He may then carry out the executive function of investigating possible breaches of his own Code and further proceed to the judicial type function of making a binding determination which he may seek to enforce through a court. In my view the combination of the three types of function in a single Commonwealth functionary is objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to conclude by stating my concerns, which were stated in the evidence which has come before us, about the role that this Government has defined for the Privacy Commissioner. It is a matter which I will be seeking to pursue in other channels, but not tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> (11) Government amendment 46, omit ``or 18nb''. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for these amendments, which I mentioned a while ago, was also foreshadowed at the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As is noted in paragraph 8 of the Committee's report, the amendments relate to certain types of technical but nevertheless reasonably common commercial transactions which would have been adversely affected by the Privacy Amendment Bill as originally drafted, including the sale of loan debts, whether specifically or in the course of the sale of a business; the sale of a credit provider which owns loan debts; and the taking of security over loan debts whether by taking a charge over debts specifically or over the assets of a company generally where the assets include loan debts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is of the view that four separate extensions are required in relation to the circumstances in which disclosure may occur in order to avert these adverse consequences while still recognising the need to regulate access to personal information in order to protect the privacy of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> First, an amendment is necessary to take account of the normal prudent commercial practice in which either before or after buying a loan debt the purchaser makes a due diligence inquiry about the debtor in order to obtain the information necessary to evaluate the loan debt. This information would include the name and address of the debtor, the amount of indebtedness, the terms of the loan and whether the debtor is credit worthy. Under the Bill as originally drafted, the purchaser or chargee would have been unable to obtain this vital information. Similarly, where a credit provider which owns loan debts is being sold, the purchaser of the credit provider's shares would have been prevented from carrying out a due diligence inquiry as to the assets of the credit provider. Secondly, an amendment is required to allow the provision of information to related corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government conceded that there was a need to address these two issues and has proposed amendments which the Opposition is accepting, allowing the disclosure of information to related corporations and the disclosure of information to a corporation that is considering whether to accept an assignment to the debt, to accept a debtor's security for a loan or whether to purchase an interest in the credit provider. The Opposition is moving amendments which allow a purchaser, in these types of transactions, access to credit information after the purchase, recognising that it may be impractical to do a due diligence inquiry on every debt in a portfolio beforehand and it may well be necessary at some stage afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area where problems would have arisen is in the context of loan portfolio management, where a credit provider or person who acquires a loan debt wishes to appoint an unrelated manager to manage it. The Opposition is proposing the necessary amendment to provide for the manager, in these circumstances, to have the access to credit information which he or she would obviously need. For example, such circumstances may arise where the credit provider simply decides that this is the most efficient means of management or where a chargee in respect of a loan portfolio wants, in the event of a default, to take possession of the charge loan debts and to appoint a manager to act on his or her behalf. The situation also arises in respect of an increasingly common type of transaction called debt securitisation, in which a credit provider sells debts to a buyer, who then appoints the seller as manager of the loan portfolio. If the seller does not perform his or her obligations, the buyer has a right to appoint another unrelated manager. It may also be necessary to appoint a manager of a loan portfolio where a credit provider or person who acquires a portfolio becomes insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Opposition is proposing amendments to provide for the disclosure of information to a credit provider's professional legal and professional financial advisers. Access by such people may be necessary, for example, to vary the terms of a loan, to advise on its enforceability or to advise on tax consequences of a loan. The Opposition is of the view that a credit provider's professional legal and professional financial advisers should have access to credit information as is generally necessary for them to perform their advisory functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is also moving an amendment which will specifically allow access to credit information for the professional legal and professional financial advisers of a corporation that is a prospective purchaser in three types of transactions: the sale of loan debts, whether specifically or in the course of the sale of a business; the sale of a credit provider which owns loan debts; and the taking of security over loan debts whether by taking a charge over debts specifically or over the assets of a company generally where the assets include loan debts. We are further proposing an amendment which will allow disclosure of credit information to the professional legal and professional financial advisers of a corporation which is a related credit provider. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition had considered a further amendment to ensure that auditors of a company would have access to credit information about its debtors. However, we have accepted the Government's assurance that the general powers to inspect accounts and records given to auditors in companies legislation is sufficient to allow them unrestricted access to credit information. Therefore, we will not be pursuing the matter at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Government has indicated that it will be agreeing to some Opposition amendments and opposing others. I suggest that the Committee consider amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 together and then the remaining amendments Nos 2, 5 and 7 to 13 together. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments 1, 3, 4 and 6 would bring into effect the Opposition's policy that professional legal and professional financial advisers should have access to credit information as is generally necessary for them to perform their advisory functions. They would also allow disclosure of credit information to the professional legal and professional financial advisers of a corporation which is related to the credit provider. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government is prepared to accept the modifications proposed by the Opposition parties to Government amendments 40, 45A and 46 as adopted by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The combined effect of these Government amendments is, broadly, to make provisions which will permit the continuation of legitimate commerical practices relating to the selling and purchasing of debts, the provision of security over debts and the management by credit providers of their loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the Opposition will extend the permitted scope of access to credit information to the professional legal and financial advisers of corporate credit providers. Although this was not provided for in the Government's original proposals, which were the subject of the recommendations by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Government accepts that there is a need to allow bona fide advisers to have access to information without which they could not properly discharge their advising function. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also accepts that the widened scope of access to facilitate accepted commercial practices related to buying and selling debts and taking securities over debts should include provision for access by a corporate credit provider where this would be necessary in order to permit the exercise of rights arising from the initial agreement. Thus, where the right of access is not taken up at the same time as the agreement in question, the access will be permitted to occur at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government notes that this wider access is limited only to the categories of persons who would normally be expected to have a need for such information. Moreover, appropriate limitations on the use and disclosure of the information are specifically provided to ensure the integrity of the privacy protection aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is unable to accept, however, the proposal that access be granted to an adviser merely `for use in performing his or her function' as an adviser. Such a purpose is too widely defined to be acceptable from a privacy protection perspective. While access in such cases may be convenient, such widely drawn purposes do not identify a particular need on the part of the credit provider's adviser in the context of advising on matters relevant to the provision of credit. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the Government accepts Opposition amendments 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 and opposes Opposition amendments 1, 3, 4 and 6. It also notes that amendments 9, 10, and 12 will require some minor deletions to reflect the decision of the Committee not to accept Opposition amendment 3. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments 1, 3, 4 and 6 negatived. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a third time. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on this third reading of the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 [1990]. In so doing, I am of course aware that this is a somewhat unusual procedure. Nevertheless, as I shall shortly explain, I will justify this indulgence on two separate but important grounds. First and foremost, this is, of course, a red letter day for the Australian consumer. For the first time consumers will be given a statutory right to have access to that most important piece of personal information-their personal credit file. Where that file contains information which is out of date or incorrect the consumer will have the right to have the file rectified. The Bill also creates the further right to complain to the Privacy Commissioner and to seek an order for compensation for damages suffered through any infringement of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all honourable senators will agree that these are fundamental rights in our modern society where a person's credit rating has assumed an unparalleled level of importance. Equally importantly, the Bill also imposes limitations on the uses of personal credit information. In particular the Bill firmly and unequivocally puts an end to any possibility of positive reporting in Australia. I am pleased to say that we in Australia will now never experience the extremely intrusive practices which have grown up in the United States and which have been so graphically documented in the recent reports of the New South Wales Privacy Committee. On the contrary, consumers may now, thanks to this Bill, rest safe in the knowledge that the information they provide about their personal financial affairs will only ever be used for purposes which have a direct and relevant bearing upon credit. </PARA>
<PARA> In a more general sense, the Bill represents a very significant further step forward in the Government's program to empower the consumer in an increasingly complex financial environment. As I indicated when addressing the annual general meeting of the Australian Consumers Association in Sydney last Tuesday, there is an undeniable and increasing need for consumer protection and awareness of consumer rights in the modern, deregulated Australian economy. I believe Australia should take a lead from the recent developments in the European Community, where a series of deregulative measures affecting financial matters have precipitated concurrent steps to ensure community-wide protection for consumers against deceptive, improper and unfair trading practices. I say here, as I said then, that precisely the same concurrent activity must be an absolute priority in Australia's own deregulated marketplace. I can assure the Senate that, as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, I am certainly doing my bit to ensure that result. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context this Bill sits firmly alongside other important consumer and financial developments which I have been able to secure. I refer to such matters as the agreement on uniform national credit legislation achieved at the meeting of consumer affairs Ministers in Perth in July. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these initiatives draw upon a common theme-the consumer is entitled to be informed and, where wronged, the consumer should have a means of effective redress. Undoubtedly, this Bill will play its own part in ensuring that Australian consumers have both the information and the means to more confidently assert the role that has been laid out for them in that deregulated marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> My second reason for speaking at this time is of more peculiar interest to those in this chamber. Many honourable senators no doubt would have passed an exhibition presently set up in the public area of the first floor of this building marking the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the Senate committee structure as we know it. I mention this because I believe the passage of this Bill has made a little history of its own. Indeed, it may be that in 10 years time the events surrounding this Bill will occupy a little space in the display which is established at that time. If ever there was a Bill which was going to really test the new procedures, it was this one. Not only were the issues technical and complex, but also over the 18 months or so which have elapsed since its introduction into the Senate some 120 further amendments from the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats were brought forward. In the event, the Committee was able to meet in a highly constructive fashion. Evidence was received from five witnesses, including the Privacy Commissioner himself. In the course of the examination of those witnesses virtually all significant issues were discussed in an informed and productive way. </PARA>
<PARA> When it came to consideration of the amendments, the Committee was able to quickly resolve upon a series of agreed amendments which reflected the considered and lengthy discussions which had taken place between myself, Senator Powell, Senator Hill and our respective staffs. In short, the exercise has been a great success. Considerable time of the Senate has been saved without, I believe, any reduction in the quality of the consideration of the issues which took place. It remains for me, therefore, to formally acknowledge the contribution to the final Bill which was made by a variety of industry groups, including a contribution in the later stages by Mr Bruce Bargon of the Credit Reporting Association of Australia. I hasten to add that, while the Bill does not enjoy the unqualified support of these groups, they engaged in very productive consultations which resulted in a number of helpful suggestions which have gone a long way to ensuring that the Bill in its final form is as good as it can be. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to publicly and formally acknowledge the very considerable work undertaken by my predecessor, Senator Bolkus. Senator Nick Bolkus was undoubtedly the first politician of national status to see the need for such a statutory based set of protections for the privacy of borrowers in the modern economy. He went through an exhausting set of meetings with industry and other interested groups towards the end of last year which in turn resulted in a significant number of improvements to the Bill. Whilst I have been able to build on his work, it was his initiative and his perseverance in the face of considerable hostility that have secured these very considerable protections for borrowers within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to extend an invitation to those same organisations, together with all other government, commercial, consumer and other relevant bodies and organisations, to consult with the Privacy Commissioner over the next few months as he prepares the code of conduct required under the legislation. I am confident that all concerned will wish to ensure that the final package-that is, both the Act and the code of conduct-is the very best that can be achieved in the interests of all. I wish the Bill a speedy third reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not a very large grant to begin with.

<PARA> I cannot quite recall the particular reasons and the particular programs or projects which underlie that increase. All I can say is that there was a general desire on my part, about which I have been quite frank, to increase as best we could within the overall constraints of the budget the relatively small amount of that total budget that was going to population planning. The International Planned Parenthood Federation is an organisation that has a high reputation in this business. The funding that we identified was, as to the increase, about half to its core operations and the residue to particular programs in the South East Asian area. Beyond that there is nothing more I can add at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner the Minister challenged my reference to the $96m slash in overseas development assistance. He rightly indicated that I had based my analysis on material that was available from aid organisations. In fact, I had a letter which was signed by a number of aid organisations which had made that assessment. The fact is, as the Minister indicated, there has been a diversion of funds as a result of a previous commitment to certain international financial organisations. The point I was making was that that diversion of funds-and this is conceded by him and the Government-meant that a number of very worthwhile programs and projects had been cut, some quite severely. I referred briefly to some of the areas where cuts have taken place. The cut in international agricultural research, though minor in dollar terms, was substantial in percentage terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the point made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) prior to dinner. Senator Evans addressed the point that I made as to why these programs were cut when we were able to increase by 44 per cent the amount going to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). The Minister has just said that he personally had indicated that that was where he wanted that money to go. He is nothing if not honest. He has stated perfectly clearly on a number of occasions that he has a high priority in this area. At page 58 of the Estimates Committee B Hansard, he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I happen to believe that family planning is the highest single aid priority in the world at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that is an extraordinary statement by anyone in this field of development assistance. It makes certain basic assumptions which are not held by anyone that I know; certainly not by anyone who is across the development assistance field. A World Bank official had a view on this subject which was not as extreme as Senator Evans's view. I believe her view influenced World Bank policy to a certain extent for some time. I referred to that author-Nancy Birdsall-at the Estimates Committee. The Estimates Committee Hansard shows that Senator Evans had not even heard of Nancy Birdsall. Anybody who is at all across the area of development assistance would have heard of Nancy Birdsall and would also have heard of a later paper which she prepared in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no consensus on the effects of rapid population growth on economic growth in developing countries. The assumption that rapid population growth was detrimental prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s-when the literature emphasized lack of capital (and savings) coupled with surplus labor in agriculture as the major constraints to economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the time to carry on this argument except to say that, if Senator Evans has got it wrong, the whole of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has got it wrong-if it is following what Senator Evans is saying. If it follows and carries out his top priority, which is that he believes family planning is the highest single priority in the world at the moment, we are dooming large numbers of people in developing countries to desperate poverty because we are not attacking the basic cause of poverty. I feel that the Minister needs to open his mind a little. He owes it to the taxpayers of Australia and to the poverty stricken people in developing countries to open his mind about the other possibilities and causes of poverty and underdevelopment. </PARA>
<PARA> A growing body of literature indicates that other factors are more significant, to such an extent that the assertion that population growth is a crucial negative factor in economic development is no longer sustainable. It is an assertion that must be questioned if we are to go to the true causes of poverty. In effect, to blame people growth as the problem and population control as the solution is to do a grave disservice to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a large number of problems involved and causes of poverty. I will name a few: the indebtedness of debt ridden countries to the Western financial institutions; the need to overcome unemployment; the need to assist with making fisheries and farming more attractive; the need to exchange technologies with developing countries to promote the environmentally sound and efficient use of resources; the need to reform inefficient or corrupt economic practices; the need to promote human initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I note UNFPA's own document, which was sent around to schools by AIDAB. That was a one-sided effort if ever I saw one and I will come to that in a minute. It talked about the reduction of food production in Africa. Questions must be asked as to why that has occurred. The solution offered by UNFPA-and we are throwing money at it-is population control. Of course, UNFPA is on the band wagon, but has the Minister read the statements made by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, which says that one country in Africa-Zaire-could feed the whole of Africa seven times over with just moderate agricultural input? Yet, as I understand it, there are food shortages in Zaire. There is a recent book about this subject from a woman's point of view which I feel the Minister should read. It was published only last year. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The power structures analysis poses one additional question to those advocating family planning as a means of enhancing human well-being and alleviating stress on the environment: Can reducing births reduce poverty, hunger and environmental degradation? Since rapid population growth is not the cause of these closely intertwined problems, we doubt that simply slowing growth can alleviate them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am addressing the whole area and thrust, it now appears, of the Minister with his fixation on this area. I believe it is essential that at some stage he at least looks at the evidence and the literature on this question. To go to the UNFPA, the Minister has again made an assertion that AIDAB has looked at it. AIDAB had better look at it more thoroughly than it looked at the China problem. It did not even have the material-the Department of Foreign Affairs might have had it-on China. Does it have the material on UNFPA? There is more available than what I have just quoted. The International Planned Parenthood Federation has been supplying vacuum aspiration kits for some developing countries-in other words, abortion kits. That organisation has been the most outspoken advocate of legal abortion services in developing countries. Perhaps we ought to have it all out on the table to see just who we are supporting, because it is being done through the back door. Thirty-five per cent of the program we are discussing-that is, the environmental assistance program-is going to these population control organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to refer to the educational material funded by this Budget. I believe a similar approach has been taken. It is an unbalanced approach, an approach where AIDAB has only had one eye on the subject and, extraordinary to say, it has not bothered to provide school students, among whom--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid I lack shame on the subject of my commitment to family planning and population control as a crucially important element in the aid program and in development assistance strategies internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I confess that hitherto the existence of Nancy Birdsall and her contribution to the literature on this subject has eluded me. I am entirely familiar, however, from innumerable discussions of development problems in many Third World countries, with how many other people in positions of leadership in those countries are struggling with the problems of poverty, health and every other set of personal tragedies that go with that. I am not surprised at how many others are less inclined to elevate Ms Birdsall to a position of superiority over the evidence of their own eyes and over their own commitment to population programs and strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> I call in aid quite specifically, as one particular authority whom I think I am entitled to draw some confidence from in this respect, in his identification of population problems as an appropriate development assistance priority, Mr Joe Wheeler, the chairman of DAC, the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. He, more than anyone else, is charged with the responsibility of coordinating, shaping and stimulating the developed world's response to the horrendous problems of poverty that afflict so many of our friends in other countries. He made a very explicit point to me-unprovoked, unstimulated and unprompted-when he said that one of the things which puzzled DAC about the Australian aid commitment was the dearth of resources, the poverty of the resources, that Australia devotes to the greatest single, most significant and important aid strategy of them all, family planning and population issues. He said to me just a few months ago in Australia that we ought to be spending at least around $20m on those programs rather than what was then the $4.5m, which I managed to get up to $5.3m, as I have said, in the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a perception all round the place as to the centrality of this issue. Of course, it is the case that indebtedness and the accumulated impact of that is a very serious problem which contributes enormously to the poverty issues we see. Food production problems may be capable of rectification through green revolutions and appropriate mobilisation of resources; nonetheless, the problem of drought and seasonal crisis is a reinforcing cause of disaster in so many countries which are struggling with over-population trying to share a very limited cake. When those sorts of production problems arise, the problem becomes exponentially worse. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems of poor administration in a lot of the countries in question that would do much to alleviate the misallocation of resources which presently exists. There are problems of lack of access to markets for commodities which do not enable the flow of income that would be able to sustain, yes, a higher population. That is one of the things we are trying to address in the context of the Uruguay Round-the desperate imbalance and the unfairness which exist in the world trading environment so far as the position of developing countries is concerned. Problems of war and civil strife all accentuate the difficulties of scratching out a tenuous existence in so many countries. But it beggars the imagination that the world's population, which has exploded over the past two decades to 5.5 billion, the present number-increasing all the time-is not in itself a hugely contributing factor to the poverty experience of people in so many countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to believe the reduction in those rates of growth of population. Stabilisation of their population balance would not contribute markedly and indeed massively to population alleviation in those countries. As the lawyers say, res ipsa loquitur-the matter speaks for itself. It really is shriekingly obvious, and there is ample justification one can find for this in the accumulated authority of people addressing these issues all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not on some lonesome crusade in this respect, I inform Senator Harradine. I have no difficulty at all in discussing these issues with AIDAB which has always had population programs very high on its list, and indeed has been increasingly taking the view that it does deserve to be left to the highest ranking authority; a view it is reaching quite independently of my own known preferences on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> But even with all of that, I repeat that in an aid budget of $1.2 billion we are devoting now just over $5m to population programs. On almost any view of the nature and magnitude of the problem, it simply represents a proportionally very small contribution within our total aid budget. I think we are destined, as we both know, to go on disagreeing about this time immemorial into perpetuity. Senator Harradine can state his point of view and I will state mine. I am happy to look at any authorities that he wants to cite and push in my direction so that I can be better informed about the range of considered and informed views on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certainly happy to scrutinise very closely the way in which particular programs do operate. For all the reasons I indicated earlier today, I do not believe they should be coercive. I think it should be a matter of education, of propaganda, of incentive to insignificant extent, and of government strategy generally, but I do not think anyone should be in the business of coercion here. That apart, there is not much more we can usefully debate on an occasion like this. We just are destined to have a different view of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) speak like that and say that we are destined to have a different view of the world. I thought we were both in the business of trying to alleviate poverty in the world and that is the important issue here. Whilst mention has been made of Nancy Birdsall, she has not completely changed her mind. She just said that there is just now no consensus about the matter, and she probably holds views closer to his than mine. As the Minister said, there can be no consensus. What we need to be doing is to having a look at how to overcome poverty and not to having the closed mind approach of the Minister or of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate an example on item 5.2, in global programs development education. In the Estimates Committee under 5.2 I referred to an essay competition that AIDAB was running amongst senior school students and I asked a question about that education program. An appendix to Estimates Committee B's report to the Senate refers to documents tabled during public hearings on the Estimates Committee. One of the documents is `World Population Essay Competition-background information sent to students'. I had a look at that and it was low level material supplied by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). Indeed, the document that was presented to us included an editorial in a newspaper called Educare News which praised the Government's essay competition. But what AIDAB failed to note was that the editorial was in response to, and on the same page as, an article that was critical of the essay competition approach to the population issues by AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did AIDAB fail to table the critical article in Estimates Committee B but it also failed to point out to the Committee the editorial which praised AIDAB for sending to schools the document which presented a balanced view on the population question, whereas such a document was never sent and never has been sent to schools at all. Where is AIDAB going? Why is it fooling us like that? It says something to the Committee and it has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The document criticising the thrust of the policy was never sent to schools. Is there some sort of censorship about the place? There is obviously censorship in the minds of some people but when that gets out to public places such as schools, why is there such censorship? This just indicates the closed minds of AIDAB on this following the closed mind of the Minister. To make sure that all of us have got closed minds on the situation, the Minister through AIDAB has now funded the Family Planning Federation of Australia some thousands and thousands of dollars so as to prepare a kit for parliamentarians on population control. When honourable senators get the kit they will now know that it is funded through this Budget and was prepared by the same people who have got the closed minds not sending balanced materials to school students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has got a very short memory on this subject. He thinks it is such a good debating point that he raises it again in terms that were squarely addressed when he raised it in those terms at the Committee. The particular editorial that Senator Harradine was referring to, which was only one side of the question because it did not contain the article itself it was criticising, was not sent out to schools. It was not part of the briefing material that was supplied to schools. It was simply information provided to the grown-up adult, hopefully, members of the Senate Estimates Committee to give them some indication of the nature of the essay competition and the response to that competition. We were not trying to persuade committee members as to the merits and the substantive arguments involved. It was not an attempt to give the committee members a balanced set of materials pro and against; nor was it material that went out to the schools. We resolved this at the time. Mr Stensholt said at page B85:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What was sent to schools was everything in that bundle except the last part, which is just part of the briefing that we are providing to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That followed a statement by me to the same effect that I am making now. Then Senator Harradine said:</PARA>
<PARA>I still raise the question as to whether, in providing it to the Committee, it is a balanced exercise to include an editorial against a particular article and not to include the article. Even you would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA>I responded that it was a debating point, and there Senator Harradine left it. That was as far as we got in the Committee. Now Senator Harradine is resurrecting the matter and, as I understand him, conveying the imputation that this material was sent out in an unbalanced or biased way to the schools.

Very well, it was one-sided to the extent that it did not attach the article that it was criticising. But we are talking hopefully about grown up members of a Senate committee. We are not talking about an exercise in persuasion, but an exercise in information about the nature of the debate or of the information that was being circulated. It is a very different issue from giving one-sided material to school kids, which is what aroused Senator Harradine's initial indignation.

This is a question not of privilege, but of the rights and duties of organisations that back up parliamentarians, such as the Parliamentary Library.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine is right. I have just been given the text of a reply that he was given, which was not fed through me, for whatever reason, so I was not personally aware of it, in which the answer was in the terms that he read out. I apologise for misleading him in that respect. There was apparently some subsidy provided to this organisation for the preparation of the briefing pack to which he refers. I have absolutely no recollection of what the particular project was about or how it has borne fruit. I guess it is another example of quite a number of bits and pieces of expenditure in the so-called development education field, some of which I have had a degree of reservation about in other contexts, given other competing claims on the aid budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That said, let me say that I see no prima facie reason whatever to think that it is wrong in principle that some exercise of this kind should not be set in train, given the significance of the issues that are concerned, given the role of parliamentarians as decision makers in approving the budget and so on for development assistance, and given the need, as I see it, for a significant proportion of development assistance to be focused on the problem of population as it impacts on development. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly will not be drawn into expressing some sort of negative reaction to this kind of program as such, but I do apologise; I have no recollection whatsoever of the particular detail of it and it came as news to me when the honourable senator made mention of it on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That just indicates the mindset of certain officers of the Australian International Development and Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) in that particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to subprogram 3.2-the Commonwealth Secretariat. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will recall that I did raise questions about the increases in our funding for the Commonwealth Secretariat. I was concerned about the rather substantial increase in the budget for the Commonwealth Secretariat and particularly anxious to know what sorts of controls we in Australia had over the budget setting of the Commonwealth Secretariat. Rumours have it that the bureaucracy of the Commonwealth Secretariat is expanding to a very great extent. One would have thought that the money could be better used within certain sections of AIDAB where officers are working very long hours on very important tasks. I would have thought that it would be far better to spend the extra money in that area than in the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge overall the work of AIDAB and the answers that I have received in all areas except the human rights area, but that is being attended to, apparently. The response given to me indicates that the Secretariat originally proposed an increase of #112,720-I think that is about $250,000 in current Australian terms-to fund a unit of three staff. It was to be a drug abuse prevention unit. I am not sure how a drug abuse prevention unit is appropriate to be established within the Commonwealth Secretariat. I am not sure whether $250,000 is an appropriate amount for a unit with three staff members. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we are dealing with small amounts of money. I believe that the Commonwealth Secretariat is trying to muscle in on a number of other areas which could be more appropriately dealt with by other organisations, such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, a voluntary organisation of members of parliament. I understand that the Commonwealth Secretariat has been rather anxious to become involved in monitoring elections in various countries which are developing electoral procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought-and I am not putting myself or any other senator into that job-that politicians of all people would be the most qualified to monitor elections in these particular circumstances. They would know where to look for the problems, not the bureaucrats from the Commonwealth Secretariat. I raise that matter in the Committee of the Whole so that maybe it can be addressed at a later stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just very quickly: Senator Harradine was advised in written answers to his questions that the total budget of the Commonwealth Secretariat is #7.3m, of which we contribute 8.31 per cent or #611,000 sterling, in round figures. So the amounts are not large, as Senator Harradine acknowledges, in the larger scheme of things. We have been trying very hard, particularly through our permanent membership of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, to keep expenditure under control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is the case that there is now scrutiny in focus on what the Commonwealth's function should actually be and what its priority program should be, and that is being particularly addressed in the context of a review exercise in which, again, Australia is represented and which will probably take the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the United Kingdom in January for a meeting. One of the things that is being scrutinised as part of this review process is the question of the degree of involvement the Commonwealth should have in election scrutiny. Might I say in that respect that, although these things are organised out of the Secretariat-one just recently in relation to Malaysia, and another one proposed next year in relation to Guyana-the kind of people the Secretariat is seeking to get to perform the scrutiny in question are, as I understand it, almost invariably politicians with experience of the kind that Senator Harradine refers to. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not these things can or should be organised in a different way with better guidelines, or whether they might be better left to some different organisation such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to do, is a question that can be debated. I simply make the point that there is this kind of scrutiny and attention being given to comparative priorities for the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as drug abuse is concerned, what is involved there, as I understand it, is a possible Commonwealth contribution to control the problem at source in a number of potential growing countries. This is a matter very much on the multilateral agenda generally worldwide these days and there is no reason, prima facie, to suppose that the Commonwealth cannot play a useful contribution in mobilising a response from Commonwealth countries where this is a problem as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we should make any automatic assumptions about what is or what is not appropriate for the Commonwealth to do, but clearly it needs to streamline its organisation and its budget accordingly, and we are doing our best</PARA>

One relates to the provision of housing for personnel located at RAAF Tindal and arises from considerations that are being given by the Defence Housing Authority.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The first question relates to program 1.9-Defence housing with regard to the Defence Housing Authority. An answer in a number of parts was recently provided to a very comprehensive question that I asked. The question referred in particular to an issue that was addressed in a publication entitled Defence Housing News of July 1990. In referring to the Northern Territory that publication stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A program to rectify defects in the Tindal and east Tindal dwellings is now under way. </PARA>
<PARA>In the answer to the series of questions that I placed on notice, an amount of $2m was identified as the amount that would be required as a Budget allocation to rectify certain defects. In other responses to the various questions, it was also indicated that this amount of money related to contracts covering the construction of 379 houses at Tindal and Katherine. </PARA>
<PARA> What is of particular concern, of course, is that in the saga of events relating to these buildings, probably the functional responsibility has passed from Australian Construction Services to the Department of Defence and, more recently, to the Defence Housing Authority. In the detailed answer that was given to me in which the amount of $2m was identified, I am particularly concerned to find that only $60,000 has been allocated for air-conditioning. I find it very hard to comprehend that only $60,000 will be required to rectify this rather major maintenance problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that 379 houses have all been found to have similar problems connected with air-conditioning. I am certainly aware that a number of recent surveys have been carried out to ascertain the extent of the problem. I understand that that problem is to do with the design criteria originally put forward by Australian Construction Services and the parameters that were set by the Department of Defence which in effect stipulated that the minimum temperature reading for these domestic air-conditioning units was to be set at some 25 degrees. That is a quite unrealistic level with regard to the provision of decent residential housing. I think most people would want to set their air-conditioning in the evenings at around 20 to 22 degrees. I find it rather amazing that only $60,000 has been provided to rectify this problem. Officers have indicated to me that this amount has been allocated probably for control units only in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be looking to establish that the Government is aware of the extent of this very major problem which will in effect cost millions of dollars to rectify. It should be a commitment of government to ensure that the housing problems are properly remedied. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked whether the Department of Defence or the Defence Housing Authority lodged a complaint in relation to the quality of workmanship on the houses. I received a one-word answer-yes. That does not establish the extent of that liability or give the criteria that will be established by Australian Construction Services or the Department of Defence to recover the money. </PARA>
<PARA> I am looking to the Government to establish, first, that there will certainly be a much greater commitment than the $60,000 in this financial year to rectify the air-conditioning problems of residents occupying the housing; and, secondly, that the shifting of blame and the commercial recovery of damages will be properly addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, of course, of those air-conditioning problems, as I visited Tindal some months ago. It is hoped that the $60,000 allocated this year will be sufficient to rectify the problem. If that does not work, more money will have to be allocated to make sure that the air-conditioning is of sufficient standard, given the climatic conditions in that area which are very trying in certain months of the year. I am informed that that amount of money has been made available for modifications this year. If that does not work, more money will have to be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for those comments. I trust that he will also make himself familiar with any consultants' work that has been carried out and reports that are currently on file.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to turn briefly to the question that relates to the provision of aviation fuel at RAAF Base Tindal. I found the answer to a question I asked, a copy of which I received only today, rather surprising in a number of respects. In my question I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>1) What steps have been taken to rectify the supply of aviation fuel into RAAF Base-Tindal?</PARA>
<PARA>2) What steps are currently being taken to increase storage facilities beyond that of fuel storage for peace time operations?</PARA>
<PARA>3) Has the Department of Defence placed any value on the Alice-Darwin railway as a further option for haulage for fuel?</PARA>
<PARA>The response I received indicated very clearly that there is a proposal to nearly double the storage capacity at Tindal. The answer states that it `is intended for authorisation this financial year'. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Additionally, reserve quantities held in the contractor's storage at Port Darwin are also slated for review. Other discussed storage in the Darwin area is also under investigation to determine its potential usefulness for all three services. </PARA>
<PARA>I find the answer inadequate in that very obviously the Department of Defence is acknowledging that there is a very major problem with regard to the provision of aviation fuel at RAAF Base Tindal to guarantee and ensure that the proper operation of that base, and in effect the fighter aircraft, can properly be carried out. I think the acknowledgment that there is a proposal to double the storage capacity highlights that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that the reserve quantities that are to be held in Darwin are `slated for review' or `under investigation'. These are not satisfactory answers in view of the seriousness of the problem. I would like the Minister to assure me that this matter is receiving a very serious commitment from government; that there will not be any question of the operation of important aircraft or the base at Tindal being compromised in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that I would like the Minister to consider concerns the long term commitment to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. The Department in its answer to this part of my question stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department recognises the undoubted benefits to Defence interests that would accrue from the construction of the Alice Springs-Darwin railway but it is not in a position to contribute funding to such an endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the acknowledgment by Defence of the undoubted benefits is very important to the long term planning of that transport route. I also note the following statement in the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department is also investigating alternatives to railway transport of fuels. </PARA>
<PARA>That returns to the first question with regard to the storage capability. I would like an assurance from the Minister that, firstly, the Department of Defence recognises that the undoubted benefits of the railway have met with some sympathy from the Government and are part of the long term commitments. Secondly, I would like to know more details about the alternatives to railway transport that are being pursued and the timing of the consideration of any of these subsequent reports and Budget considerations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The alternatives to rail are obviously road and sea. With regard to Senator Tambling's first point about the amount of aviation fuel storage, it was always intended to do this in phases. An additional provision is included in Stage 2 phase B. This is programmed for authorisation in 1990-91. Should that proceed, construction should start in early 1991 and be completed by the end of 1992-93. I point out that whilst we expend a lot of money, there are priorities in defence and the Northern Territory does not get every priority. It has done very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway has been around for a long while and it has probably been dead in the water for quite a while. There are obviously defence benefits to this project. If it has not come back on the agenda with the idea of using sale of government business enterprises, putting the money into retiring debt and using the interest on national infrastructure, naturally the project can be looked at again. I am not an expert on that. It is not within my portfolio. I certainly do not see it as the job of Defence to fund railways, roads or other infrastructure other than immediately on bases. I do not think Senator Tambling would either. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the fuel situation is in hand. It has always been planned to do it in phases. Those phases almost certainly should proceed. It is programmed for approval this year. If it is approved this year, construction will start in 1991 and be completed by 1992-93. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this issue a little further. I ask the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) whether the proposals by government about timetabling are consistent with the recommendations of a report within the Department of Defence-I think it is entitled the Christopherson report-and whether the Government's commitment to funding has picked up the internal recommendations both with regard to the needs at Tindal and the storage in Darwin and also the long term implications about transportation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Tambling is getting to some fairly detailed areas that I am not fully across. In any event, decisions are not made simply on the basis of one internal report. Decisions as to expenditure are made in relation to other priorities. There are many good projects in Defence that do not proceed because of prioritising when allocating funds to the highest priority. That is the nature of defence expenditure under this Government. It was also the nature of defence expenditure when the coalition was in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are always an infinite amount of things we would like to fund and there is always a finite amount of funding. As I said before, it is all part of a planned phasing operation. I am quite sure that the way in which the planners have it, it is meeting the necessary priorities and necessary timetabling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I do not wish to keep the Committee very long. I have only a few matters which I would like to raise this evening. I would like to comment on a couple of items in the report. The report referred to one item when it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One specific area raised during the hearings was the need to develop measures to evaluate effectiveness of the various advertising campaigns undertaken by the department. </PARA>
<PARA>In my questioning during the Estimates Committee hearings about an advertising campaign entitled `Bottom Line', it was quite clear that there was a need not just in that campaign but apparently in all the Department of Defence advertising to have a proper evaluation process. It is a serious matter because there is considerable expenditure by the Department of Defence on advertising. I cannot imagine any private sector firm undertaking the Department's expenditure on advertising without knowing exactly how it was being targeted, how effective it was, whether the money was well spent with this agency or that agency and whether it was achieving the results that were sought. I find it strange, after all the years that the Department of Defence has been a major advertiser it does not have these programs in place. I am glad that the report referred to that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only in advertising that the Department appears to be deficient in evaluation and cost benefit analysis. For example, I draw attention to the education allowance. For a number of years I have been plugging away at the need to do better by our Defence Force personnel and their children. When the nation as a whole is looking to have a better educated population and it is becoming more and more important for young adults to have educational qualifications which will fit them for the challenges of the next century, it is very serious to disadvantage the children of these service personnel who have to move from State to State on a regular and overfrequent basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that the parent's employment requires this, it is clearly essential that the employer-in this case, the Commonwealth-make proper provision for mitigating these disadvantages that these children suffer. As a result, education allowance was introduced. Nevertheless, it has been provided in a most miserly manner. There is a great deficiency in its effectiveness, where it has been provided, in keeping defence personnel in the forces. We have not been told whether the use of this allowance has helped to keep people in the Force. I understand for instance in the British Defence forces, the educational allowance which provides assistance with boarding is widely regarded as a major incentive for keeping families in the Force. Yet, in Australia, the surveys that are done and the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force-Report and Recommendations-the Cross report -show that the education of secondary schoolchildren and the problems associated with it, is one of the major reasons that parents eventually decide to leave the Defence Force after massive amounts of money have been invested in their training. </PARA>
<PARA> One would want to know why no assessment appears to have been done about how effective that allowance is as a retention measure and how widely and effectively it is explained to members of the Defence Force. Clearly it is not being taken up in the numbers one would expect in the Force and I want to know why this is so. Year after year I have asked questions in the Estimates committee about this and we find that no improvement seems to be taking place. There does not seem to be a sense of urgency that this is an important issue going towards the retention of our high cost defence personnel. One has to ask why. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that does not seem to be evaluated is the question of school cadets. In questioning during the Estimates committee hearings this sitting, I received a number of answers relating to school cadets. One answer was that cadet units are not individually costed and the cost benefit analysis of a cadet unit can be applied only to regional cadet units which receive full support. Of course, they are few and far between. The representatives of the Royal Australian Air Force said that cost benefit analyses have not been conducted by the Air Force Office. </PARA>
<PARA> This is extraordinary because it is widely believed in the forces that school cadets in the past have been very important in providing a focus for recruitment of young people into the forces either at the other ranks level or, alternatively, as military officer cadets. If we do not know enough about it, we do not know how worthwhile it is. </PARA>
<PARA> As an investment of the taxpayers' money, I would have thought that it was a very important matter to assess how many of these young school cadets go on to a career in the defence forces. The money invested in the school cadet units could then be seen to be serving an extremely valuable purpose. I remind honourable senators that young people go into the Defence Force or into the military academies and, before long, they march out. I believe that, if people understand what the Defence Force is all about and have had a grounding in school cadets, the chances of their being equipped and trained and then marching out again will be reduced. These are all things which need to be evaluated. A cost benefit analysis needs to be carried out on school cadets. I am surprised that that does not appear to have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to another matter relating to the report. The Committee was pleased to note, as honourable senators would notice, the considerable improvement in the program format of the explanatory notes of the Department of Defence. We understand that this has been a complex and a difficult matter for the Department and that a number of matters are still being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to raise an item that I did ask questions about. But I am still not satisfied with the answers I have received. I refer to question Nos 76, 77 and 78 which I placed on notice. They relate to an item of $91m, provision for contingent salaries. This year, that item was placed in the Defence personnel part of the Budget Papers rather than in `Defence Other', in which it had featured in previous years. Its effect-whether that was the intention-of that change in placement was to artificially inflate the Defence personnel size of the total budget to 41.7 per cent over the previous year, whereas, without including that $91m in the Defence personnel part of the Budget, the total Defence personnel share is actually 40.6 per cent, which is the same as last year's Defence personnel total. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a pie chart in the Budget statements which shows that in 1989-90 there was `Defence Other' and Defence personnel, et cetera. There, Defence personnel was shown as 40.6 per cent. At that stage, there was a provision for contingent salary of $80m. In fact, that was shown in `Defence Other'. When we turn to the 1990-91 Budget statements we see that the pie chart shows that personnel has gone up to 41.7 per cent. But when we turn to page 3.62 we see that the provision for contingent salary is $91m. That has moved over into personnel and out of `Defence Other'. Why is this so? Perhaps from the answer I get to that I will able to take the matter a little further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clearer because we will spend it on personnel. I would have thought that the explanations for 76, 77 and 78 were fairly clear in what they said. I do not really have much to add to those. Senator Newman has raised the question of evaluation of advertising. That was noted in the report. Next year the Department will have to be in a position to bring more justification to the expenditure. The Department has taken note of the Committee report and hopes to improve its performance in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that Senator Newman's basic assumption-I do not know whether it is, but it is almost implied in her question-that cadets exist almost purely for recruitment reasons is wrong. Cadets are there for many other reasons. I think that answers that particular question. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that we had been helpful with the answers to 76 to 78 in saying that it is just a more realistic description. We cannot give actual estimates yet because the various rises that have to be accommodated are not all through the system and will not be through for some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on record that I do not believe that school cadets are precisely recruiting farms for the defence forces. They have many worthwhile features. But if we are to look at them in a cost benefit form, which is a reasonable thing to do when they are costing us money out of the Defence budget, I want to see what benefits Defence gets out of it. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect the Department to know that. Equally, although the Minister did not address it, I expect Defence to know whether the education allowance is currently a valuable input and whether it can be used to more effect, as I said, as a retention measure. I am happy simply to flag that I would have expected more study to have been made of those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the answers that the Minister said that I had had from the Department on question Nos 76, 77 and 78. In answering my question No. 77, the Department stated that it was considered appropriate to move the provision for contingent salaries and related increases to the personnel costs and retirement benefits subfunction of the Estimates. Was it Defence or was it the Department of Finance that considered it more appropriate to move the component? Why was it considered necessary to change the practice of previous Budgets?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. But the answers to both questions 78 and 76 would appear to imply that the positioning of the contingency in the salaries subfunction of the Estimates will provide a more accurate assessment of the expenditure outcome for the financial year. Yet the response to question 76 maintains that the position of a contingency reserve of not being appropriated under Estimates appropriation Acts, but under Additional Estimates procedures, is being continued. I ask the Minister: has the Department been able to improve its predictive power regarding likely increases in salaries and allowances during the course of a financial year to produce its more realistic assessment of expenditure outcome, or is it simply felt that movement of the component will provide the increased accuracy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try not to detain the Senate for too long. I think honourable senators are aware of the fact that there has been agreement that there now be a national bank inquiry, which I have been pursuing for two years. I hope to appear before that inquiry and go in with a wheelbarrow with all of the material that I have tabled in the Senate over the last two years-around about 80-odd cases out of the 350-odd that I have been pursuing-in relation to what I have referred to as malpractice and corrupt practice in banking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to chronicle briefly a particular case which I think is an outstanding one, relating to Mr and Mrs Somerset who have been in dispute with the National Australia Bank Ltd. This is a case which I will be placing before the inquiry, but I think it is essential to place it before the Senate beforehand. At the end of this brief statement I will seek to table approximately 33 attachments which substantiate the allegations which I will be placing before the Senate. I understand that that is acceptable to both the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who are on duty in the chamber and who have perused the material earlier in the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr and Mrs Somerset were successful farmers and graziers who, after 32 years in the rural industry producing wheat, sheep and cattle, sold their western rural holdings and retired to Toowoomba in Queensland. In 1952 the Somersets had commenced as soldier settlers who balloted land in the first Brigalow land development scheme in Wandoan in Queensland. In the development and growth of their rural properties and their production, the Somersets had held numerous appointments and dealings with banks, bank managers and senior bank officers, always finding them to be people of integrity on whose word and ethic they could rely as trusted officers of financial authority in the banking industry. That was their opinion of bankers. </PARA>
<PARA> In Toowoomba the Somersets became interested in the purchase of a property and enterprise known as Gunnadoo, was situated within the city boundary, priced at $625,000 and sited on a vantage point overlooking the city. Figures documented and produced by the vendor showed a net figure in excess of $400,000 as being certainly an appropriate valuation of the property. The Somersets frankly did not believe the valuation that was placed on the property and the vendor, Mr Cardell, in an endeavour to encourage a sale, introduced the Somersets to his bank manager, one Colin Herbert Cannon, of the National Australia Bank, 441 Ruthven Street in Toowoomba. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Somerset, by appointment with Mr Cannon on 30 October and again by appointment on 1 November 1984, discussed the property and enterprise with Mr Cannon as well as the financial investment and the cash flow of the vendor Cardell before signing a contract on 2 November 1984. By appointment on 6 November, Mr and Mrs Somerset met with Mr Cannon and became customers of the National Australia Bank at the address which I have just stated in Toowoomba. The cash flow and profitability of the contracted property was the purpose of the discussion. This was Mrs Somerset's initial introduction to Mr Cannon and his bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Settlement of the contracted property, Gunnadoo, was to be on 16 November 1984. The Somersets informed Mr Cannon that they had previously been interested in the acquisition of a property called Glenhaven-a largely undeveloped run-down 100 acre property in close proximity to Gunnadoo. However, now with their investment in Gunnadoo they were not in a position to proceed. Cannon told the Somersets that Gunnadoo had an excellent cash flow, made enhancing statements concerning the property and paid personal tribute to Cardell, indicating in the monetary sense that Cardell's financial figures and position-as evidenced in figures from Cardell-had been derived from Gunnadoo production and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> Cannon placed special emphasis on the trading record of Cardell and indicated to the Somersets that they would have no difficulty servicing a bill finance facility of $300,000. Cannon further advised the Somersets that he could facilitate in the Somerset's acquisition of Glenhaven but that the Somersets would have to transfer their business to his bank. An appointment was made for the Somersets on 8 November 1984-the day preceding the advertised National Australia Bank mortgagee sale in possession of Glenhaven by auction on 9 November 1984. By appointment on 8 November, Cannon advised the Somersets that the National Australia Bank had approved finance to the extent of $300,000 to assist in the purchasing of Glenhaven and issued the Somersets with an interim five leaf cheque book from which to operate at the auction. When the Somersets left Cannon's office on that fateful day they were completely unaware that Cannon had participated in a fraud of mammoth proportions, so great that in a few years they would be destitute: recipients of, and dependent upon, age pensions for their very survival. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent inspection of bank documents did not disclose that two contracts purchased Gunnadoo-one for $310,000 for the property and one for $315,000 for the business, including apportionment, goodwill and strawberry plants worth $250,000. Bank records indicate that the property was purchased for $625,000 in one contract. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now quite obvious that a conspiracy by bank personnel commenced immediately the Somersets made initial contact with the National Australia Bank and the bank gained knowledge and saw confirmation of their net worth of over $1m and their interest in property investment. The bank used them to recover large potential losses contrary to the customer's-that is, the Somerset's- interest. </PARA>
<PARA> At auction on 9 November 1984 the Somersets successfully bid $320,000 and contracted the property Glenhaven, sold by the National Australia Bank as the mortgagees in possession. Bank documents now reveal no prior appointments with the Manager, Mr Cannon, prior to 8 November 1984. In his position Cannon could not approve the finance in his own right. In order to issue such an approval he would have had to have the approval of his immediate superior, the Regional Manager, one Robert Arkell. </PARA>
<PARA> The Glenhaven contract was signed on 9 November 1984, witnessed by the National Australia Bank, and required settlement within 30 days. Settlement did not take place until 22 March 1985 due to the fact that there was an outstanding South East Queensland Electricity Board requisition order which had been in force since September 1984. This was not advertised, nor was it disclosed at the auction. Discovered documents reveal deliberate deceit by the National Australia Bank, including by administrative officers, even though they were fully aware of the existence of this major charge on the property. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Manager, Cannon, obtained verbal approval from his Regional Manager, Arkell, for $300,000, he was aware that this amount was completely insufficient to enable the Somersets to meet this commitment to the bank. In the period from 8 November 1984 to 1 February 1985 the Somersets had numerous interviews with Manager Cannon to complete the financial documents. However, Manager Cannon departed, purposely leaving everything in abeyance, on four weeks' annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 November 1984 the Somersets transferred their banking business to the National Australia Bank at the address in Toowoomba, in accordance with Mr Cannon's statement of 6 November 1984 and the arrangements contrived by him. The relieving manager, Mr Albion, during Cannon's absence obtained his administration's approval for three loans aggregating $575,000. The loan documents were signed on 14 March 1985. By July 1985 the three loans were all in default and all repayments until this time had been made from the Somerset's personal resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1985 Robert Cardell's son informed the Somersets that they had-to use his term-been `conned'. Official inquiries revealed Cardell's criminal record for fraud. The son revealed that Cardell's National Australia Bank overdraft had increased from $50,000 to $260,000, and after many extensions the final deadline with the bank was 31 October 1984. This was completely contrary to what Cannon had led them to believe. The Somersets instituted Supreme Court proceedings against Cardell for fraud and won the case. In the meantime, Cardell had disposed of all of his assets and the Somersets received nothing from the proceeds. Legal advice was that the Somersets should commence legal proceedings in the Federal Court against the National Australia Bank for false and misleading conduct under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. They lost on technical grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the appeal was denied. Leave to amend the appeal pleadings to include fraud was denied because fraud had not been in the original pleading. Leave to appeal to the High Court was denied. The trial commenced without full and complete discovery from the National Australia Bank. Some duplicate documents produced as evidence at the trial were different in content to those produced in discovery which had been produced and stated in interrogatories as the original documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Somersets' solicitor engaged on their behalf a former senior, now retired, National Australia Bank manager with 36 years experience in the National Australia Bank, including 16 years at managerial level. His examination of the bank records has revealed that vendor Cardell's bank account with the National Australia Bank was extremely troublesome and had a history of chronic irregularity. Cardell was unable to service his overdraft indebtedness in the prior 12 months to the contracted sale date. In fact, the overdraft had escalated from $55,000 to $240,000 in the previous three years. No other income was shown and none of this was disclosed by the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> To obtain formal approval for the Somersets' loan application for $300,000, manager Cannon stated to his superiors, `Cash flow confirmed at $50,000 per month is consistent with this property'. The actual monthly average confirmed by bank records was $12,936 for the previous 12 months as opposed to the $50,000 per month stated to the Somersets. Manager Cannon apparently relied on each cash flow projection which, when compared to the actual trading from bank records for the previous 12 months, amounted to 14 times the actual cash flow.</PARA>
<PARA> To gain approval for the Somersets' application, manager Cannon increased the market value of the National Australia Bank Gunnadoo security, dated 22 November 1984, by 82 per cent. Documents reveal that some 10 weeks earlier than 22 November 1984, manager Cannon increased the property market value by 23 per cent in the bank records. Documents further reveal that Cannon deceived his administrators by recording the property area as four hectares when the actual area was two hectares. </PARA>
<PARA> Before taking annual leave and leaving the loan application in abeyance, manager Cannon once again increased the market value of the bank's Gunnadoo security by $100,000 to $575,000 offering no evidence for the increase. The relieving manager, who has now had to submit a new application, was assured of the success of the application because of manager Cannon's valuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Manager Cannon stated in evidence that improvements by the Somersets had justified the increase. In fact, the improvements were a demountable building and the proprietorship was with the Somersets' family company over which the National Australia Bank held no security whatsoever. In fact, there were no fixed improvements to Gunnadoo which had been used by manager Cannon as the rationale for that 82 per cent increase in valuations. </PARA>
<PARA> In its dealings with its clients, Mr and Mrs Somerset, the National Australia Bank, through its manager Cannon, and in flagrant disregard of its fiduciary interest to its clients, deceived them as to the worth of both properties. In the case of the Gunnadoo property, the Somersets were used to rid the bank of a large potential loss and thereby protect their manager from internal disciplinary action. Similarly, in the case of the Glenhaven property the bank, as vendor, consciously concealed the requisition on the property, which in itself is a breach of its legislative duty as well as its fiduciary duty. When the Glenhaven contract was signed the bank knew that it could not settle as required by the contract. Despite its fiduciary relationship with the Somersets, the bank threatened to sue the Somersets if they tried to rescind the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> In both instances the bank has used its privileged position of trust to protect its own financial interests against, and to the detriment of, the interests of its customers. By its fraud, deceit and greed the National Australia Bank has reduced previously wealthy customers to penury. To add insult to injury the National Australia Bank is now attempting to force Mr and Mrs Somerset into bankruptcy. It is doing this, well aware that they have no assets left, with the sole intention of further discrediting their previously unblemished reputation and preventing any further legal action against the bank. This type of financial thuggery must be resisted by all fair minded Australians. I seek leave to table 33 documents in support of that case study.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following answer has been provided by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There have been 123 places in Western Australia containing some form of forest which have been nominated for inclusion in the Register of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Of the 123 places which have been nominated, 47 have been included in the Register of the National Estate and 9 are on the Interim List. The Australian Heritage Commission has decided not to register 5 places.</PARA>

The other three areas were all entered in the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate on 25 March 1986. Objections are outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA> The nomination of the entire Shannon River Basin and the objections to the three Interim Listed areas have not been finalised for a number of reasons. In 1986, the then W.A. Minister for Conservation and Land Management, the Hon Barry Hodge MLA, asked the Commission to defer assessment of outstanding forest nominations and objections until regional land management plans for the Central, Northern and Southern forest regions were completed and released. The Commission agreed to this request noting that the management plans would provide information which would help the assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the release of the management plans in 1987 the Commission found that it needed more detail on the national estate values of the forests and decided to assess all the W.A. forest nominations and objections in the context of an old growth forest survey. This was commenced in 1987 but ceased at the end of 1988 with the establishment of the National Forest Inventory (which was to include its own old growth forests study).</PARA>
<PARA> The National Forest Inventory has not proceeded as quickly as had been hoped and the Commission has now decided to re-commence work on the W.A. forests.

The Commission relies on co-operation in its dealings with State and Territory authorities and has no coercive powers in relation to them.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Australian Heritage Commission and the W.A.

<PARA> (1) Can the Minister comment on forecasts by Friends of the Earth to the effect that nuclear capacity is likely to peak at 356-366Gwe globally, and 300-310Gwe for non-Comecon capacity in the year 2000, and is likely to decline rather than grow from that point on, due to the crippling costs outlined in recent UK House of Commons Reports.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) In view of the sale of the Government-owned stockpile of uranium for $11/lb, compared with the recent floor price of uranium of nearly $30/lb, is it unwise to bring even more uranium on to the market which would in turn lead to an even lower price.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3960" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The forecasts of Friends of the Earth (FOE) are based on several assumptions made by FOE about individual state's plans for the development of their nuclear industry and on FOE perceptions about the likely future role of nuclear power in electricity generation. Although the assumptions on which the shorter-term forecasts are based reflect generally recognised difficulties which the nuclear power industry has experienced, they would seem not to make appropriate allowance for planned growth in nuclear generating capacity later in the decade. They are, therefore, probably on the conservative side. FOE's longer-term forecasts assume, arguably somewhat prematurely, a major decline in the nuclear power industry. This does not accord with the heavy reliance several countries will continue to have on nuclear power for their energy needs. Additionally, FOE itself notes that ``major new reactor ordering round the world in the next 12-24 years would change FOE's predictions''.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The uranium demand forecast mentioned is based essentially on FOE's forecasts and assumptions relating to nuclear generating capacity. In this respect alone, the demand forecasts will be conservative (see comments in (1) above). In forecasting uranium demand, many other assumptions have to be made relating, inter alia, to reactor capacity factors, fuel management techniques, enrichment tails assay, and the impact of reprocessing and use of recycled nuclear fuel. Such assumptions can vary uranium demand forecasts considerably.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The figures referred to, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 September, 1990, were uranium demand forecasts of the London based Uranium Institute. They are higher than FOE's for reasons associated with assumptions and forecasts made about nuclear electricity generating capacity and the technical aspects affecting demand, as outlined in (1) and (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government-owned stockpile has not as yet been sold. Sales of Australian uranium are approved by the Government on the basis that contracts contain fair and reasonable market prices. This accords fully with the Government's uranium contract pricing policy and is in line with the Government's approach to the export of other mineral commodities over which pricing controls are exercised.</PARA>
