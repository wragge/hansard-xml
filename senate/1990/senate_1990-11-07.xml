<TITLE>Australian Broadcasting Commission: Education Broadcasts</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of concerned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The Education Broadcasts of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a service which is vital to the maintenance and improvement of educational standards throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of these Broadcasts would severely disadvantage children and other students and their teachers, particularly in remote areas, causing an inequity of access to learning resources;</PARA>
<PARA> Cutbacks in funding of educational resources, both human and other, has already significantly hindered the potential of teachers and educators across the nation to improve educational standards;</PARA>
<PARA> There are no viable alternatives to obtain the kinds of resources currently broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should introduce legislation to:</PARA>
<PARA> Protect and increase current funding for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to continue to broadcast and produce Education Broadcast material for schools throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> Provide, protect and increase funding to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to other production companies to produce material suitable for broadcast as part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Education Service.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> That there is urgent need for the United Nations to adopt an Environmental Bill of Rights using the 1987 Report by the World Commission on Environment and Development.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament pass an `Environmental Bill of Rights', therefore giving Australia a leading role in environmental protection.</PARA>

<TITLE>Conservation of Resources</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and senators in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA> on 1 September 1989 the Australian Tax Office sought to discourage the recycling of glass bottles by imposing sales tax on the cost of reacquiring such bottles and on crating, classifying, storing, sorting, washing and cleaning them;</PARA>
<PARA> this will result in major beverage manufacturers abandoning the use of bottles in favour of plastic containers, which are made from valuable non-renewable and imported resources, and which are then thrown away to become waste;</PARA>
<PARA> furthermore, the Income Tax Assessment Act encourages businesses to throw away valuable equipment by allowing full write-offs only if the equipment is scrapped.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled should take steps to amend tax laws:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) to encourage the conservation of resources rather than the throwing-away of resources;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) so that no sales tax is payable on any recycled or re-used components;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) so that a penal sales tax in the form of a waste tax is imposed on all throw-away products.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

In particular (a) and (b), the making of rules and the representations received, of course, would give a very important indication about the extent to which advice was given to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs with regard to the ability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait island people to vote whether or not they were on the electoral roll. Point (c) of my motion seeks to establish that the Minister did take into account the considerations that were importantly put down by this Senate, and in particular by Senator Coulter on 6 October last year when certain information was established. That should of course be re-established before this Senate. Finally, with regard to point (d) of the motion, it is important to establish the circumstances with regard to this issue and particularly the details that were made available to the Minister in reports received by him from the officials. These are important issues and should be canvassed. In the debate yesterday the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), said:</PARA>
<PARA> I personally would have no difficulty in acceding to Senator Tambling's notice of motion and tabling the documentation I have read. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that was a very important concession on the part of Senator Collins and the Government in acknowledging that there would be no withholding by the Government of any information sought by the intent of my motion. As I mentioned yesterday, it was unfortunate that Senator Tate took a stance different from that taken by Senator Collins-and an intimidatory one-when he said that we would certainly not get leave today for this motion and that that would, by his choice, be a matter of my choice. That was an unfortunate issue and obviously Senator Tate has the numbers over Senator Collins, because that is the way in which the Government unfortunately chose to proceed with this matter this morning. It was totally unnecessary. The information that is sought should be fully available. There should be no constraint with regard to the access of this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw a press statement yesterday by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs relating to this matter in which he tabled advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission where ATSIC is claiming that it is the guilty party. Unfortunately, once again, an officer of ATSIC, Mr Michael Stewart, was named in those statements as the scapegoat. Members of the Senate will remember that Mr Stewart was the officer connected with all of the lack of information and poor advice with regard to the Aboriginal Development Commission and so many other issues relating to the past inquiries of the Senate. I find it very unfortunate that the Minister has chosen to hide behind the officers of ATSIC in this manner. The information sought in my motion is a most important consideration of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I move an amendment to the motion in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Omit all words after ``that'', substitute ``there be laid on the Table of the Senate, on or before 13 November 1990, all relevant and essential documents relating to establishing:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the circumstances surrounding the failure to observe the requirements of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to table the instruments under sections 113 and 116 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the legality of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections held on Saturday, 3 November 1990''. </PARA>
<PARA>My amendment maintains the thrust of Senator Tambling's motion, which is the procurement of certain documents. It defines what the Australian Democrats believe are the necessary and essential documents for this debate, they being those documents which are related to, firstly, the failure to table the rules before the elections were held and, secondly, the consequent legality of the elections held on Saturday, 3 November. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe this should be the subject of the debate. It should not be an opportunity for any indirect redebating of the whole Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill. We share the Opposition's view that there has been an appalling lapse in administrative procedure. An examination of the relevant and essential documents will enable the Senate to come to conclusions as to the detail. The tabling yesterday of the Torres Strait Regional Council rules was against the spirit and the expectation of the whole ATSIC legislation, but in the narrow sense it was technically sound in that the rules were tabled on the last day before the time limit expired. It is deplorable that the other rules were not tabled at all. However, it is true that the rules were used in the election and that the court has already recognised that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter and I have seen the rules, particularly those relating to the filling of casual vacancies in which Senator Coulter expressed a specific interest during the committee stage of the debate. We have no objection to the rules we have seen. In fact, I place on record that we would not have voted to disallow those rules which were not tabled and we will not vote to disallow those rules that were tabled yesterday. We are committed to ATSIC and to the important role it will play in the future of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With some degree of appreciation for the speeches of both previous speakers, Senator Tambling and Senator Kernot, I will also be very brief in this debate. The issues were canvassed yesterday. First of all, in defence of my colleague Senator Tate, reference to the Hansard record yesterday-I was here yesterday during the debate-will show quite clearly that he did not attempt, as Senator Tambling suggested, to intimidate anyone. I could not think of anyone in this chamber less likely than Michael Tate to want to intimidate anyone. I have said to him on a number of occasions in the past 3 1/2 years that I wish he would be a tad more intimidatory towards the Opposition than he is. He is one of the gentlemen of this chamber. I reject Senator Tambling's accusation against him categorically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tambling also said that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner)-I guess it was expected that the Opposition would say this-was trying to hide behind officers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and absolve himself of the blame. I point out to the Senate the basis for Senator Tambling saying that was his `perusal of the papers' which I promptly and immediately tabled in this chamber yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> They were the papers available to me. I had them and I tabled them. I had a meeting with the Minister last night and I can assure the Senate that the Minister will have no difficulty in complying with the Australian Democrats amendment, which the Government intends to support, and in tabling the papers required by that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would advise the Senate that we will not have to wait until 13 November. I was hoping to have had the papers here this morning to table at the conclusion of this debate. As this debate will thankfully be short, that will not be possible. But I do expect to have the papers today. If I have them today, then I will be tabling them in the Senate today. There is no difficulty with that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said yesterday, and without wanting to repeat it, the Government and the Minister deeply regret what was an inadvertent administrative problem that caused this. It should not have happened; it did happen. Corrective measures are being put into place right now in ATSIC to make sure that it never happens again, but it did happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a little cute of Senator Tambling to accuse the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs of attempting to hide behind an officer of ATSIC on the basis of material which I freely and happily tabled in the Senate yesterday in compliance with what Senator Tambling wanted. The Minister in the chamber at the time having immediately tabled the papers that he had, it is a bit rich for Senator Tambling then to say, as a result of reading of the papers, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is trying to hide behind ATSIC officers. </PARA>
<PARA> What the papers demonstrate, as Senator Tambling knows, is that the Minister scrupulously inquired of ATSIC well before this problem occurred-that is, in September-whether all the necessary and required procedural matters had been attended to by the officers of ATSIC in relation to the tabling of documents in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. He received a categorical written response-not prepared, as Senator Tambling would suggest, as a put up job for the purpose of extracting the Minister from some difficulty in this debate, but a piece of correspondence dated 19 September last-which gave the Minister a categorical assurance, and some detail: 400 copies of the rules were brought to this Parliament and no doubt languished in a room somewhere. They were deemed to have been tabled in the House of Representatives, but because of a foul-up, which is detailed in the second document that I tabled in the House yesterday, that did not happen, despite written advice to the Minister that it had. </PARA>
<PARA> Is anyone in this chamber seriously suggesting-I do not think that anyone could with a straight face-that one would expect the Minister personally to carry 400 copies of the rules down to the Senate Table Office and say, `Here they are, I am required to do this to make absolutely certain that my responsibilities are discharged and that rules are tabled in the Senate'? That would be a ridiculous assertion to make. The Minister did what he was required to do. He made a specific request for advice as to whether the procedures had been dealt with by ATSIC officers, and I regret to say that on this occasion they clearly failed him. He could not have been expected to do any more. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by repeating what I said a few minutes ago. The Government will comply, to the extent possible, with the amendment that has been moved in the Senate today. When I say that the Government will comply with this in so far as it can, I would point out one of the difficulties that may be raised. I put this in as pure speculation on my part at this stage, considering the speed with which this debate has proceeded; I know that all senators will appreciate this, as it is always a problem with parliaments and privilege. One difficulty is that there are very serious legal proceedings in train currently in the Federal Court in regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will be a party to those proceedings. It would be improper of me to attempt to canvass any opinion on those proceedings, and I do not, but I simply state to the Senate as a matter of fact that the Commonwealth's position during those proceedings will be that the elections were valid and can continue to be held by the court as valid. For that reason it may well be that there are documents relating to confidential legal advice which has been given to the Minister in relation to the proceedings that are now on foot in the Federal Court that could not be tabled and therefore made public for obvious reasons. I am simply canvassing that as a problem that has come across my purview a number of times during the time I have been in Parliament and that may well be the only difficulty that arises. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again: I have seen a comprehensive range of papers providing written advice to the Minister confirming that all the procedures that the Minister was inquiring about had been adhered to, and I know that there will not be the slightest difficulty in disclosing them. The one area that may be difficult, considering the fact that these proceedings are on foot as I speak and considering the position that the Commonwealth will be taking in the Federal Court, is the sensitivity of some of the legal opinions that have been provided for the Government in relation to that specific matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak only briefly on this matter. I remind those honourable senators who were here before the last election that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation probably received more attention in this chamber than any other piece of legislation throughout history. My memory does not go back beyond 1987, but I remind the Senate that we sent that legislation to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which sat for six months. It was then debated in this chamber for, I think, 41 hours in the second reading and committee stages, and it received a very thorough review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have to agree with the Opposition to the extent that one matter in great contention through both the Senate Select Committee considerations and the considerations which surrounded the debate in the chamber was the processes of election for the regional councils. I would also have to agree with members of the Opposition that a great deal of care went into the debate in relation to the tabling of rules for the elections. They have correctly quoted the Minister who was then in the chamber, Minister Tate, with respect to undertakings that were given concerning the tabling of those rules. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to add my voice of beration to the Government and to officers who were evidently responsible for those undertakings not being fulfilled. Undoubtedly, the spirit which lies behind the tabling and the period for disallowance has not been met in this case, and those responsible for the failure of that mechanism to be observed deserve the very strongest condemnation of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I must return to the two points that my colleague Senator Kernot has made; that is, that there are two important issues at stake here-and not the wide ranging issues which could be opened by Senator Tambling's original motion. Those issues are, firstly, the circumstances surrounding the failure to table those documents and, secondly, whether the elections which were held on Saturday last were legal. The effect of the Australian Democrats' amendment is to confine the investigation to those two matters and to bring forward the documents and evidence which are relevant to those two matters so that the Senate can be satisfied in the first instance that this failure to table documents will not be repeated as far as that is preventable and, secondly, that the very important elections which were held last Saturday were or were not legal. </PARA>
<PARA> While accepting that the failure to table was against the spirit of the process for tabling and for disallowance, nonetheless it is my understanding that, to the extent that legal opinions are available at this stage, the technical requirement has been met. I find that unsatisfactory, but it does bear very much on the second issue which relates to the legality of the elections. As Senator Boswell and Senator Collins have pointed out, it is in the hands of the court at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that both Senator Kernot and I have had the opportunity to look at the rules. We would certainly not have disallowed those rules had they been available. To that extent, in our view, the elections are legitimate in that they have properly elected those members of the Aboriginal communities which elect regional councils. Although in a sense it has an element of retrospectivity about it, in that we are now entering the period for disallowance, we must put it firmly on the record that we would not seek in any way to disallow the regulations and we would seek to support the legality of those elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I propose to move a minor amendment and will speak to it very briefly. The reason I sought the leave of the Senate to do so is that I know Senator Tambling wishes to speak to his motion and it will give him an opportunity to comment on what I propose. A few minutes ago I canvassed the essential matter that must be adhered to, and always adhered to, and that is to maintain the correct separation between this Parliament and the courts of Australia. The legality of the elections-I am sure the Australian Democrats and the Opposition have no argument with this-is a matter that will be determined by the Federal Court in the very near future. Certainly it is not for this chamber to attempt to pretry that issue. For that reason, and to allow the Minister to be as comprehensive as he can be in terms of tabling documents, and to relieve him of this legal difficulty in terms of the privilege of this Parliament and the proper role of the courts, I propose to add an amendment to the Democrat amendment after paragraph 2. Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until now I had intended to vote for the amendment, but the amendment moved by Senator Collins appears to gut the Australian Democrats' amendment. It will not provide the information that the Senate requires as indicated in Senator Tambling's motion. I understand the point that was made by Senator Kernot that the Senate has had the debate on the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), that this is not the appropriate forum to reopen that debate at this time, and that if the debate is to be reopened it ought to be done by way of some substantive motion, but there are matters about which the Senate needs further information and I would certainly like to have that further information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a member of the Senate, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the subcommittee which inquired into the ATSIC elections, I would like to have this information. In my view, the material now proposed to be excluded is quite vital. Honourable senators are entitled to receive that material. It is appropriate that the Government see its way clear to tabling those documents so that honourable senators can examine them to see just where we are in this whole area of ATSIC elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want-and I do not intend-to canvass the matters that were included in the debate last evening. I think that the debate that has proceeded today has been on a rather more reasoned level than that of yesterday. But Senator Collins, by excluding the particular documents that he referred to, is denying the Senate material and documents to which I believe it is entitled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has put forward a very reasonable amendment. As I read it, the very terms indicate what is sought to be excluded. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . but excluding documents relating to legal advice regarding the issues which are currently before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Macdonald would know and as the Australian Democrats know, as indeed does everybody else, if a case is being conducted before a court it is proper that the parties to that particular action be able to communicate with their legal advisers and get such advice as would help them to forward that case. It is now a tradition that is well and truly embedded in the law that neither side should have to give up those documents and that advice which is pertinent to the action that is taking place. That rule is there so that the court can consider properly the various submissions that are put before it and so that it can go forward without being straddled by outside opinions, particularly opinions from a place such as this which is-and I use the word in its truest and most proper sense-an august body. I consider the Senate to be one of the best bodies that there is, but the opinion of that body should not affect the deliberations of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that it is really a problem related to the separation of powers. We, as a society, have said that the courts are the appropriate bodies to decide a dispute between two parties. Constitutionally, I think the Senate has a right to have documents if it so desires, but as a matter of propriety and convention it is proper that this chamber does not try to override or affect-it does not even have to be a conscious attempt-the proper resolution of the courts concerning a particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the middle of this brilliant speech in which I am defending the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins)-in fact, I was going to sway the Senate and I think everybody was going to vote, on the basis of my speech, for all that I was arguing for-I have received a message from the Minister, whom may I say that I have rushed in here at some cost to defend, which says, `Good speech'. That is a comment with which I agree entirely; but the message continues, `but I am going to withdraw the amendment'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell a little story and then I will sit down. During the time when Mr Lionel Bowen, the Attorney-General as he then was-a great attorney and a great friend of mine-was trying to get a Bill of Rights through the Parliament, I was down in Hamilton, the territory where Mr Fraser used to be, addressing an audience of about 500. I thought I was going very well putting forward the absolute necessity of having a Bill of Rights, and how this country would fall apart unless the Bill of Rights was got through. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not altogether a friendly audience, because it was Mr Fraser's home territory, but I thought they gave me a good hearing. I thought that on that occasion I was persuading the audience, too. The only thing was that my opponent on that occasion, Mr Spender, who was the shadow Attorney-General, got up at the end of my rather brilliant speech and said to the audience, `That was quite a brilliant speech from Senator Cooney, but the only thing that concerns me is that, if the various principles that he has fought so hard for, said he would go to the wall for and, indeed, suffer martyrdom for-those great concepts which are set out in this Bill and which I oppose but which have been very adequately vindicated by Senator Cooney tonight-are as good as he says, why has the Attorney-General withdrawn the Bill?'. Apparently, he had done that just before I made the speech and it came over on the news. I thanked Mr Bowen, the Attorney-General, with a certain tone to my voice, and I use the same tone on this occasion to Senator Collins. </PARA>

<PARA>Notwithstanding failure to satisfy and comply with the provisions of this subdivision the Commissioner may allow deductions claimed notwithstanding such non-compliance if the Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to allow the deduction.''</PARA>
<PARA>This new subsection has the purpose of providing the Commissioner of Taxation a discretion to apply the substantiation provisions with fairness and common sense. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I am generally opposed to `discretions' as being incompatible with the new system of self-assessment, the ``discretionary'' aspect of the Bill is tightly drawn and it is stated in simple terms to ensure its passage through this Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>In no way have we attempted to weaken the general thrust of the substantiation requirements. The Bill is here to ensure justice and equity. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two basic reasons for the need for this Bill. One, the substantiation provisions are too strict and have resulted in cases of injustice. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the ATO has already recognised the problem and has declared that in the future, the substantiation provisions will be applied with ``common sense''. It is the interpretation of this view that troubles me. </PARA>
<PARA>If it means that the Commissioner will enforce the ``Substantiation provisions in accordance with the terms laid down by the Parliament then, so far as the Commissioner is concerned, there is no problem. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Commissioner's duty to enforce the Act as laid down by the Parliament and interpreted by the Courts. Therefore, the Commissioner will need to continue to administer the Act as in the past, penalising in many instances honest taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, the need for this Amendment, to give the Commissioner the legal basis to give relief to honest taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, if we do not give the Commissioner this legal basis and he proceeds to apply the present law with ``common sense'', in these instances the Commissioner will be placing himself above the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxpayers will then not be able to ascertain what the law is or be sure that it will, or will not be, enforced in accordance with that other standard. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner, in applying ``common sense'' to the present law, will be giving himself a privilege of deciding whether or not to enforce the laws enacted by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of the point can be seen when considering the position in the cited case-W124. Clearly, in that case the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was of the mind that, for the precise prescriptions enacted by the Parliament and the failure of the Taxpayer concerned to comply with them, he would have been entitled to the Income tax deductions claimed. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is obliged to apply the law as enacted by the Parliament and interpreted by the Courts, it did not have the authority to grant the relief which, but for those prescriptions, it might have thought appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>In reaching that decision, the Tribunal had available to it to be exercised all the powers conferred by the Parliament on the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>Now it seems that the Commissioner claims the power not to enforce the law when it suits him to do so, yet the Tribunal, acting in his place, does not have the same authority. </PARA>
<PARA>To remedy this injustice, I have proposed by this Bill to grant to the Commissioner a discretion to grant relief from the strict enforcement of what would otherwise be the law. Parliament thus remains the final lawmaker. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, to go back to my first reason, the substantiation provisions of Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Sub-division F, are far too strict and have resulted in cases of injustice. </PARA>
<PARA>The comments made when the decision which was handed down in favour of Australian Tax Office in the Evangelist's Case W124 demonstrates the absurdity of the position. </PARA>
<PARA>The distinguishing feature of Subdivision F is that it requires in relation to certain expenses not only that the taxpayer should satisfy the substantive requirements of other provisions of the Act, (such as Section 51) and bear the burden of proving his claim in so doing (Section 190 (b)), but also that the evidence to be relied on in support of his claim must be in specific form. </PARA>
<PARA>The substantiation provisions have been enacted in terms which emphasise form above substance. They tend to concentrate the attention of those required to enforce the rules on question of forms and to distract attention from the more basic question as to whether what is represented on the forms is true, in the sense of being both honestly stated and accurate. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, we have the situation in this case of the church worker who, because he did not sign each entry in his motor vehicle log book, even though all entries were dated and in his own handwriting, the expenses claimed were not allowed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was satisfied with the genuineness and accuracy of the claim. In pursuing this case several more examples of this kind occur. The effect of the substantiation provisions were to deny deductions to which otherwise the taxpayer would be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore the duty of this Parliament to provide a more appropriate set of requirements as to``substantiation'' of claims honestly made and a more just procedure on a matter of substantial importance to a very large number of citizens, including the honourable members seated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to remind the Chamber that this amendment does not relieve a taxpayer of any obligations to meet the substantiation requirements. They must still establish that ``having regard to all the circumstances'' some non-compliance should be excused. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I see the need for the amendment proposed and I, therefore commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>An earlier version of this Bill was drawn up by Senator Michael Tate-An Act to amend the Defence Act 1982-relating to conscientious objector status for conscripts to the Australian Defence Force. It was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Conscientious and Legal Affairs in 1985, since when it has apparently dropped into a legislative black hole. </PARA>
<PARA>However the Bill I am presenting today is an entirely new piece of legislation and not an attempt to amend any other Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the experience of the Vietnam War, there was an urgent need to clarify the status of conscientious objectors to conscripted military service and to put into legislation some ruling on their rights for future reference. </PARA>
<PARA>I doubt if many honourable senators will object to this procedure apart from those who believe that no-one should be exempt from compulsory military service as with young men in Israel, Iraq or China, for example. </PARA>
<PARA>However, since the time of Vietnam there has been an increasing tendency for young men who have joined the military as volunteers to feel that while they are prepared to fight and die to defend their country, they are not prepared to go and fight in some other country's war. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent examples include resisters to the Vietnam War, who included conscripts in Australia's case, the British resisters in Northern Ireland, white resisters in South Africa sent to Angola, Namibia and the Black townships in South Africa itself, and now resisters to the Gulf deployment. </PARA>
<PARA>We should also remember the 120 Iraqi officers who were shot on 3 August for refusing to take part in the invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>There are those senators who would argue that sending troops to the Gulf involves the defence of Australia in a wider sense but I want to question this for a couple of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, it was the Prime Minister who volunteered to send ships to join the US blockade. The UN certainly did not invite us to join and there was obviously no direct threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact it was a very selective choice because there have been other examples of invasion and occupation in the last decade which the world, including Australia, chose to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer, for example, to Soviet interventionism during the Brezhnev era, to French intervention in Africa to prop up discredited dictators, to US interventionism in Grenada and Panama, and the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>The hypocrisy of this selective choice for national outrage, extending even to a military response, is staggering. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, if you consider the Dibb Report and the 1987 Defence White Paper which outlined Australia's area of defence interest, the Gulf falls clearly outside the region delineated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore not surprising that Terry Jones and other sailors chose to question their orders to go to the Gulf, just as a number of US military personnel have chosen to ask the same questions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Navy might say that this is a matter of discipline but I would rather commend such individuals for making considered decisions rather than for blind obedience to orders. </PARA>
<PARA>If we are to have a volunteer army, the military will have to face increasing numbers of young men and young women who will say that while they are prepared to defend their country, they are not prepared to go off to the Gulf or other parts of the world because of some foreign policy dictate that is dangerously reminiscent of the days of the Boer War, Gallipoli and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>It was only this April, on the occasion of the 75th commemoration of the ANZAC sacrifice, that Mr Hawke said that this country would not be sending any more young Australians off to die on a foreign shore but that is what might happen in the Gulf, if war breaks out. </PARA>
<PARA>We may choose to support the US blockade for what some Australians would consider very good reasons, but those who agree with the decision to send the ships must ask themselves why the Australian Government, with the support of the Opposition, chose to support this military action and did not intervene, say, when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980?</PARA>
<PARA>And why, in 1975, did the Australian Government remain silent when Indonesia invaded East Timor? This omission, in our region, was, and remains, unpardonable. We refused to lift even a diplomatic finger to challenge the Indonesian occupation of sovereign territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill seeks to take note of this changing situation and thus ensure that military personnel who have a selective objection to a particular war beyond our shores, have the right to opt out of a particular operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill applies to volunteers as well as conscripts, should the question of conscription arise again in future. </PARA>
<PARA>The nature of the military has changed markedly in the last generation. </PARA>
<PARA>In Europe, where there are still largely conscript armies, there are now trade unions for soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA>Alternative service for conscientious objectors is now widely recognised, at least in most of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>In the United States, conscientious objector status has been available to military service volunteers and not just conscripts since 1962 but only if they became absolute pacifists after entry to military service. </PARA>
<PARA>An average of about 1,000 men and women per year have a change of heart after enlistment and apply for conscientious objector status. Conscientious objectors discharged from the military are not permitted to re-enlist, but retain their rights to any post-service benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. They are granted honourable discharges, and no penalty is attached to their stand. </PARA>
<PARA>The nature of war has also changed in recent times. Only 15 per cent of the 130 or so wars fought since 1945 have consisted of one country invading another. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore hardly surprising that there are service personnel who, while prepared to defend their country from attack, are not prepared to participate in operations that are an extension of foreign policy rather than to counter an attack on national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously for the sake of army morale, it is preferable to have troops who accept what they are told to do, rather than to face internal resentment, as the United States military did in Vietnam or the Soviet Union faced in Afghanistan from 1979 or in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Another unacceptable alternative is open dissent within the ranks during operations. </PARA>
<PARA>From the military point of view surely it is better to have a clear-cut way of dealing with dissenters, rather than having discontent festering within the ranks and infecting other service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>It is for these reasons that I choose to introduce this Bill, because I feel that we must recognise the conscientious right of thoughtful individuals who question military operations which do not involve a direct threat to their country. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not a question of lack of discipline. It is an issue of selective objection. It will not undermine the Australian Defence Force because I doubt if many serving military personnel will feel the need to avail themselves of it, but we should recognise the right of those who choose to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>A hypothetical example from our multi-racial society might include a young Moslem heading for the Gulf who decides that he cannot in all conscience take part in a war against his co-religionists. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would give the RAN and other branches of the ADF the opportunity to clarify their positions regarding objectors. It was particularly odious to former Leading Seaman Terry Jones to hear the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, claim that deployment to the Gulf was voluntary. This was not the case in his experience. </PARA>
<PARA>As his defence lawyer, Michael Adams QC, pointed out, the Navy had some responsibility for Jones's decision to go AWOL as there had been a flaw in Navy leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>The Navy should have made it clear that he could apply to be transferred out of the Gulf task force. </PARA>
<PARA>Had the Commanding Officer of HMAS Adelaide been aware of what Leading Seaman Jones had said, it would have been sensible for him to have arranged a transfer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Defence Force has a responsibility to make it clear to ADF personnel whether a particular task force is for volunteers or not and to tell those personnel the criteria on which they could be transferred. </PARA>
<PARA>In his testament to the military tribunal Michael Adams QC claimed that none of this occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also important to understand that such a decision would not be taken lightly. It was an emotionally expensive exercise as Terry Jones found. </PARA>
<PARA>Neither was it a matter of cowardice, but clearly one of conscience, as he stated at the time:</PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to die to defend my country but not to protect United States oil lines. The largest insult I felt personally in the whole affair was turning on the television last Tuesday night and seeing Mr Bush on the international media refusing to discuss what negotiations were going on (over Iraq) while he was on holidays. </PARA>
<PARA>Up until this point I had no intention of jumping ship but after seeing one of the parties responsible for it all on holidays playing golf while committing thousands of young lives, including those of Australians-it was enough for me to decide not to be part of the killing, knowing that I might have killed innocent people for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not a coward and I would be prepared to die for my country but I am taking a political stand because this is not our war-we are just following the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that most serving military personnel would not choose to question their orders, even in a situation where they are going to a place which they had never heard of before, like the British going to the Falklands or the Americans who went to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>But I am concerned about the small minority who do have a conscientious objection or a selective objection and it is for their sake that I ask you to support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most dramatic developments in the history of the second half of the twentieth century has been the recent rejection by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe of the communist political and economic system. In rapid succession, and within an astonishingly short period, the countries of this region have set off on a new course based on the adoption of parliamentary democracy, political pluralism and more market oriented economies. </PARA>
<PARA>This momentous change in direction brings enormous potential benefits for the future development of Europe, for global peace and for improvements in the lives of the citizens of the countries involved. By its example it should also encourage further reform in many other countries around the world that are currently subject to autocratic political and centralised economic systems. </PARA>
<PARA>At a meeting of heads of Government of the European Community held in Strasbourg in December last year, an agreement was reached in principle to establish, as soon as possible, a new Bank to assist in the reconstruction and development of Central and Eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>Preparatory work began immediately, with participation by not only European countries, but also a number of others from outside the region, including the United States, Japan, Canada, the republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand. After intensive effort, on the twenty-ninth of May last, forty-two prospective members, including Australia, signed the articles of agreement to found a new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be located in London. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the agreement, the purpose of the Bank is to foster the transition towards open market oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in Central and Eastern European countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics. The Bank will assist recipient member countries to implement structural and sectoral economic reforms, including demonopolisation, decentralisation and privatisation, to help their economies become fully integrated into the international economy. The bulk of the Bank's activities will be directed to the private sector and to assist the privatisation of state-owned enterprises: the articles provide that not more than 40 per cent of the Bank's financing shall be provided to the State sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Membership of the Bank is open to European countries, other countries that are members of the International Monetary Fund, the European Community and the European Investment Bank. In recognition of its European character, a majority of the capital will be held by the European Community members and institutions as a financial institution, the Bank will be able to invest in recipient countries in a variety of ways. It will be able to take a direct equity stake in private enterprises and in state-owned enterprises that are operating competitively or in transition to private ownership and control. It will also facilitate access by such enterprises to domestic and international capital markets and, where other means of financing are not appropriate, underwrite the issue of securities. This sort of operation carries greater risk than straightforward lending: careful assessment and management of operations will therefore be essential. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank will also make loans to enterprises either on its own account or through cofinancing with multilateral institutions, commercial Banks and other sources. It will also provide technical assistance for the reconstruction and development of infrastructure, including environmental programs necessary for private sector development. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank will not lend to Governments to support programs of economic adjustment, such as to finance balance of payments deficits. This will remain the preserve of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, both of which are of course already very active in assistance for Central and Eastern European Countries. Another feature of the articles is the explicit commitment given to environmental improvement. Tackling the sad environmental legacy of central planning is an urgent task in all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The Bank will be obliged to promote environmentally sound and sustainable development in all of its activities and it will report every year on the environmental impact of its operations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank's operations will be limited to countries which are applying the principles in the agreement and are proceeding steadily in the transition towards market oriented economies and the promotion of private and entrepreneurial initiative. Progress in each country in this regard will be reviewed by the Bank's board of Directors at least once a year. Recipient member countries under the agreement are Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Concern was expressed that because of its size the Soviet Union might become the principal recipient of credits, reducing the Bank's capacity to assist other countries. It was therefore agreed that, at least for the first three years, the Soviet Union will be eligible for loans only up to the level of its paid in capital. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank will have a capital base of ECU 10 billion (approximately $A15 billion) divided into paid-in shares of ECU 3 billion and callable shares of ECU7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>The callable capital will provide backing for borrowings by the bank in international financial markets. Lending by the Bank will not be subsidised, but the backing provided by the Bank's callable capital, together with sound operating policies, should allow it to lend on favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has been allocated 1 per cent of the total shares. The paid in cost of Australian membership will be ECU30 million (approximately $A45 million), payable in equal instalments of approximately $A9 million a year over a five year period. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will provide authority for the payment of Australia's subscription to the initial authorised capital stock of the bank. Its passage will allow Australia to proceed with its membership and ratify the agreement. The detailed articles of agreement are set out as a schedule to the bill. Australian membership of the bank will provide access to information about opportunities for procurement and other financial and commercial activities in Central and Eastern Europe. It will also provide an Australian voice in important aspects of the reform process through the Bank's policy dialogue with its borrowing members. </PARA>
<PARA>But more importantly, Australian participation in the Bank will demonstrate our support for the political and economic changes that are occurring in Central and Eastern Europe. A democratic and prosperous Europe is desirable in the long term interest both of Australia and of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter relating to anti-dumping and countervailing legislation be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for urgent investigation and report by 31 March 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> The operation of the revised procedures for implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing actions introduced in 1986, and the need for legislative changes to part XVb of the Customs Act 1901, with particular attention to the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) while recognising requirements under the GATT, the scope for and appropriateness of assessing and taking into account injury to suppliers of components and raw materials used in production of goods allegedly being dumped;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the desirability of implementing cash securities on prima facie dumped goods after the 55 day preliminary investigation of a dumping or countervailing complaint;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the development of a clearer methodology for estimating material injury in industries which have long production periods or processes;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the appropriateness of the current requirement for a new inquiry after countervailing duties have been imposed for three years when the circumstances which led to the implementation of duties have demonstrably not changed, and the scope for a fast track review mechanism in these circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the availability of timely and adequate statistical data from the Australian Customs Service to ensure the prompt acceptance of applications for anti-dumping and countervailing duties; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) whether the Australian Government's interpretation of obligations under the GATT anti-dumping and countervailing duties code is consistent with the approach by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday I presented to the Senate the terms of reference for the establishment of an inquiry into anti-dumping and countervailing measures. Today I seek the support of the Senate for that motion. As members of this chamber would be aware, I have often spoken of the amount of food products that Australia imports and the levels of subsidies that those products attract in their countries of origin. In the midst of the crisis currently hitting our rural community, Australia is importing about $2 billion worth of food products every year. This represents about 10 per cent of this country's current account deficit. In July this year Australia imported $30.3m worth of fruit and vegetables; $1.4m in meat; $9.23m in cereals; and $31.65m in fish products. Much of this product is dumped at unrealistic prices on our domestic markets, or receives excessive government subsidies in its country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> The current anti-dumping and countervailing legislation is time consuming, cumbersome and biased against industries with long production time and fluctuating cost structures. I am referring these terms of reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and I am sure that this Committee will examine the existing problems within the legislation and recommend ways of correcting some anomalies. I would like to acknowledge the support of the National Farmers Federation, state farming organisations, trade consultants and industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference are a combination of thoughts and ideas of all sections of Australian primary industry. These terms of reference are broad and question legislation which affects many different parts of Australian industry-both primary and secondary. It is my hope, however, that the members of the Committee will see the urgent need to complete the investigation into primary products as soon as possible and will work to ensure that this section of the inquiry is under way quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian rural industries are in crisis and the Committee must recognise this. The total gross value of Australian farm production for 1990-91 is estimated by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) to be $22.2 billion. Rural exports for the same period are estimated to be worth $14.5 billion. Just over 12 months ago, I brought to the notice of the chamber the plight of Queensland pineapple growers, whose canned products were being swamped by cheap imports from neighbouring countries. Processors in these countries enjoy developing country tariff preferences and a much lower wage structure, and receive government subsidies like tax holidays, freight assistance and free land. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, at least another 20 industry associations have come to me expressing their concerns at the flood of dumped and subsidised imported food products. Australian horticultural products are fast becoming an endangered species. The list is growing every week. First it was pineapples; now it is bananas, canned fruit, peanuts, navy beans, peas, beetroot, beans, potatoes and other vegetables as well as apricots, dried vine fruits, rice, orange juice, apple juice, jams, mushrooms, dairy products and fresh meat. In fact, a whole smorgasbord of imported foods is entering our market as cheap and subsidised products. At the same time, our farmers are having to plough back their products into the soil. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian community is starved of export income and burdened by foreign debt, yet our table is groaning under the weight of imported foods entering our country. The Australian community should not be deceived. It is not a simple case of the consumer's access to cheap imported food which will have no side effects on the economy. Almost every part of the Australian community, both in the city and in the country, will be affected if this flood of subsidised and dumped imports is left unattended and allowed to close down our smaller primary industries. I say to Senator Cook that I include unionists. Not only will growers of those products be affected but also the entire support network that is dependent on these industries will suffer-the rural communities, the transporters, the processors, the canners, the packers, the storemen, the factory workers and, of course, in the end all Australian consumers will be seriously affected if the horticultural industries are forced to close down. </PARA>
<PARA> When consumers buy an Australian grown and processed product, they are guaranteed the best quality product in the world. Australian primary products are grown and processed under strict health and hygiene conditions using the highest level of food technology available. The same guarantees cannot be given for the imported products. The major supermarket chains are perpetuating the situation as they import a large percentage of this food for resale under their generic and home brands. They must also consider their community obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> We must take action now to prevent the demise of Australia's horticultural industries and ensure that our primary producers can take action against unfair competition. I want to make it very clear here that I am not talking about trade barriers, quotas or tariff protection. Every one of us here in this chamber should know the benefits of the goal of a free world trade, and hope that one day in the not too distant future it will become a reality, although one wonders about that. What I am talking about is a form of recourse against dumped and subsidised products. Australian farmers have to compete against heavily subsidised products. It is bad enough that they have to compete against the corruption on the world market, but now corruption is being imported onto the Australian domestic market and creating an unfair trading situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that Australia interprets the existing trade guidelines established under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in a similar way to our trading partners. What I want to outline are some of the problems with the existing anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. Growers are currently being told by the Government that their answer to the rising flood of imported food is through anti-dumping and countervailing legislation; that all they need to do is to establish the level of subsidies and the price of goods in the country of origin, then initiate an anti-dumping or countervailing case against the offending product. That is fine in theory but it does not work out that way in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The associated problems in initiating a case are numerous and cumbersome. The terms of reference identify six major areas that need to be reviewed. In the first instance, an industry has to suffer material damage before a case can begin. The Australian Customs Service and the anti-dumping authorities can take up to 295 days to decide whether the case is positive. This is far too long. Cash securities can only be applied after the case has been under way for almost five months and well after the case has been accepted as being positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference suggest that these securities should be applied after a preliminary positive case has been determined, that is, after the initial 55-day investigation period. If the anti-dumping authority agrees with the producer that the material damage has been suffered and sustained, and the products are being dumped or subsidised, then a duty is imposed on the incoming goods. However, the producer then has to take that case back through the entire process every three years to have the market situation reassessed, otherwise the imposed duty automatically expires. That is time-consuming and expensive, because it can take up to $200,000 to re-establish a dumping duty. Many Australian primary producers just cannot afford to do that every three years. The necessity for these sunset clauses will be questioned in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem identified in the terms of reference is that only the injury to like goods can be assessed. Therefore, in the case of canned peas and beans, for example, it is only the injury to the processor and not the injury to the primary producer which could be assessed. The vegetable growers have suffered extensive reductions in their incomes and have been forced to plough their crops back into the ground. Yet only the material damage done to the cannery is admissible as evidence in an anti-dumping case. </PARA>
<PARA> In many situations the case is to be mounted against the importers of the processed product, usually a major retailer that is also the main customer of the Australian canner, and the retailer is very reluctant to take on its customers in court. By the time a case has been prepared and presented and the Australian Customs Service has made a decision on it, so much damage can be done to one of our industries that sometimes it just does not consider it is worth the money or the trouble, and it walks away and just lets the flood of imported products wreck its industry. There is no alternative; the anti-dumping legislation needs to be made more user friendly. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian primary industry organisations have neither the time nor the funds available to chase the information required by government departments. One of the terms of reference questions the availability of statistics from the Australian Customs Service. It is time that the anti-dumping and countervailing legislation was made to work not solely for the benefit of the Australian producer but to give him some protection. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a problem with the methodology used when assessing material injury to industries, such as agriculture, which have long production periods and fluctuating incomes. The terms of reference note the difficulties associated with establishing prices of processed food in foreign countries and establishing some of the subsidies that imported goods receive. The onus and expense in discovering this information should not be the complete responsibility of the primary producer. The Government also has a role to play in this. Some of the primary produce subsidies are obvious, such as those under the United States export enhancement program. In 1988 the United States Government paid out more than $21,000 per farm in agriculture subsidies. The European Community (EC) has similar export subsidy schemes. Last year a tonne of cheddar cheese exported from the EC to Australia attracted a $1,000 per tonne subsidy to compete against Australian producers. Currants were subsidised at $1,300 per tonne to compete against our Australian producers. Japan spends over $6 billion a year subsidising its domestic rice growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year Canada supported its pork producers by between $37 and $41 a hog. Canadian pork producers are eligible for more than 20 different subsidy programs-to name just a few, the feed freight assistance program, the western transportation industrial development program and the Alberta crow offset program. Even though the Federal Government is well aware of these Canadian subsidies, it has lifted the ban on imported fresh and chilled pork meat and has advised the industry to enact the anti-dumping and countervailing legislation if its industry suffers damage. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the Government has said that it knows that this pork product is subsidised and it will let it into this nation. If the producers want to challenge it through anti-dumping, they can; that is their option. I am asking the Senate inquiry to investigate products coming into Australia that are known to have subsidies applied to them. Other subsidies are hidden and difficult to verify. These schemes are many and varied, including free freight, free land and fertilisers, electricity, tax holidays and in some cases a complete ban on competing products sold in their countries. </PARA>
<PARA> How can Australia's rural community compete with this? We have high interest rates, high transport costs, soaring production costs and soaring wage costs. The rate of effective assistance to rural industry in Japan as determined by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was estimated at 72 per cent in 1989. Switzerland takes the cake, with 75 per cent, and the subsidy in Norway was estimated at 74 per cent. It is interesting to note that we do import cheese from Norway. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community currently is feeling righteous, being just below the world average at 38 per cent. The United States is slightly lower, with a 27 per cent level of protection. However, Australia has the second lowest rate of assistance, at 10 per cent, with only New Zealand having a lower rate, at 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation I have outlined today is just the beginning. Our industries have not yet collapsed but they are standing very close to the cliff. They are almost at the point of no return. </PARA>

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations are not looking good at the moment. There is talk in the media of renewed agricultural trade wars between the European Community and the United States of America if the Uruguay Round is not concluded satisfactorily. Such an outcome could be the final gust that blows our primary industries over the edge. What the inquiry will do, I hope, is throw them a rope.

<PARA> I believe that the Australian primary industries need fast, efficient, and reasonably priced access to anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. They need a form of recourse against dumped and subsidised imports which is fast, reliable and readily activated. I hope that, after hearing submissions from growers, processors, unionists and workers employed in the canneries and packing houses-in fact all parts of the industry-the Senate Committee will recommend significant changes to the legislation. These changes will benefit not only the primary producers of Australia but, I hope, the country as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I see that Senator Boswell's notice of motion has come to fruition in this form and that we will be seeking to refer this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I intend to state somewhat of a case for arguing that there should be unanimous support from this place for such a reference. I can see no reason why anyone would want to deny the Committee the opportunity to make, as Senator Boswell described it, the operation of this anti-dumping and countervailing legislation more user-friendly. In fact, the aim of finding something that could be operated in a fast, reliable and readily activated manner is laudable and I see no reason why that could not be unanimously supported here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make a few remarks on some of the terms of reference devised by Senator Boswell-and, I must say, devised after lengthy consultation with interested parties. He was kind enough to show me those terms of reference and ask for our concordance before they were finally submitted. We appreciate the communication that has been offered to us by the Nationals on this matter, and they have our concordance. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (b) of the proposed terms of reference has the potential to redirect the onus of action in this matter away from the injured to other parties. I hope that the Committee will take this a little further in considering the direction suggested in paragraph (e), which refers to developing a clearer methodology. It might also be able to recommend a means by which, for example, a statutory authority has the capacity simply to ensure that dumping does not occur. Rather than rely on the injured party to demonstrate that dumping may occur, if a statutory authority has the charter to ensure that dumping does not occur, the onus of action is taken away from the injured party to another party which has that as its main responsibility. That is a matter for the Committee which I hope it will consider very carefully in finding its methodology. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) directs itself to that reference. I hope that the Committee will not only develop a clearer methodology for estimating material injury, but will also devise a methodology which ensures that injury does not occur. Surely that is the whole point of it: if our producers and traders are suffering material injury, then we as a country are suffering as well. If we can devise a way of preventing that from happening, then I think we are doing the right thing. At the moment it seems that the message is that we rely on just the producers. We think that they are a separate group, that it is up to them, and that they have to carry the can all the way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many good reasons to ensure that an expedient and reliable method of properly addressing this whole business of anti-dumping is delivered. Senator Boswell has accurately and comprehensively described the sorts of industries that are affected in this way. Paragraph (c) is particularly directed to industries which have long production periods or processes. I am sure that we could all think of industries which have large initial capital investment and which do not provide a quick and reliable revenue return. In the primary industries, orchard crops come to mind instinctively. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Boswell" NAMEID="YE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator Boswell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what it is designed for primarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but other more exotic crops are equally vulnerable, which might not be immediately apparent. For example, one such crop is asparagus in Tasmania. Asparagus is a plant which does not reach full production for three or four years. While there is some production in the first couple of years, the season's production is worth much less than that of the fourth and fifth years. If unfair competition from an overseas supplier caused damage to an asparagus producer during the first couple of years, the estimation of injury would be much lower than for the potential production from seasons four and five.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Senator Boswell is proposing in paragraph (c) is of value to a wide variety of industries. I welcome that paragraph. I think it can serve a good purpose. Another good example is those aspects of the livestock industry where products are developed from animals after a long breeding or product identification process. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would probably agree that programs involving animals such as angora goats or fallow deer are particularly relevant to Tasmania. Those programs are particularly sensitive to market price manipulations. </PARA>
<PARA> If overseas market opportunities are lost because our producers are undercut by subsidised or dumped products, then the effect is felt in the Australian market-a market which, in many of these sorts of areas, is in its infancy. It is complicated, but that is what international trade is all about. The more complicated it is, the more likely that we in Australia will suffer when we try to follow the simplistic deregulated free trade route. The sorts of industries I have been talking about are industries where we have been showing some initiative in recent years. If our investment and our initiative are destroyed by a couple of seasons of subsidised or dumped entry of products, then we lose more than just the initial investment from the producers-we lose as a country our access to a variety of products and we lose our spread of investments as a country. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate this I do not think I need to go any further than one of my regular topics over the past few months-that is, the carpet wool industry. We all realise that currently we have closer economic relations (CER) with New Zealand. One could say that our economic dealings with New Zealand have been essentially deregulated. Perhaps we could describe the situation as resembling this Government's aim of free trade with all nations. Until October, carpet wool producers in Australia paid a wool tax of 25 per cent while New Zealand producers paid 6 per cent. When, after much pressure, the Government exempted our carpet wool producers from almost 20 per cent of the tax, Australia's carpet wool industry and I were very pleased. However, that pleasure was short lived because, through some manipulation, computation and permutation of their arrangements within New Zealand, New Zealand growers are now being paid something like $2.50 for their carpet wool but it is being sold in Australia for something like $1.50 a kilo. Obviously this is wrong, unfair and dangerous to Australia's industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The carpet wool growers, who have just begun to see some opportunity to sell wool-and that is a real achievement in the current wool market situation-have been out-hustled by the New Zealanders yet again. I do not know whether this qualifies as dumping or not; that is my point. At present it is difficult, time consuming and costly to mount a case to prove that dumping is occurring. It is especially difficult if it is suspected that the closer economic relations agreement has been manipulated. But in this instance the plain effect is that our producers are being unfairly undercut. Our industry is one of those requiring a lengthy buildup. For example, the carpet wool industry requires a breeding program to move through Corriedales, Romneys or whatever to the actual carpet wool sheep such as Drysdales, Elliotdales or whatever. That is an expensive undertaking for the entire industry. The industry can be wiped out in a couple of seasons because our present anti-dumping legislation is too clumsy to provide effective protection. If that is what closer economic relations means, we have been taken for a sucker yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be symptomatic of this Government's lack of understanding of what happens in country Australia as a result of its passion for deregulation. While Australia has been deregulating with the blind faith that all other international traders are fine, honourable people and that they will follow Australia's example, these international traders have been busily doing what they have been doing for centuries. They have been trading-selling their produce in whatever way and through whatever mechanism is available to them. Invariably we see foreign governments understanding and supporting their producers in this regard. We see that the effect-let alone the reason for it-of New Zealand's recent currency devaluation is to enhance the position of that country's carpet wool producers vis-a-vis Australia's producers. If New Zealand can be such an aggressive and successful competitor within closer economic relations, we must be doubly concerned about the competition we face from other nations. I suggest that international trade is not a polite, genteel occupation undertaken by philanthropists interested in Australia's best interests. As far as we are concerned, we should view international competitors as evil, scheming, dirty rotten scoundrels-out to make a buck whenever and wherever possible and, if possible, they will make it from us. </PARA>
<PARA> If the whole country-government, producers and agents together-can appreciate this point of view and act in unison as an aggressive, street-wise operator in the jungle of world trade, then our country as a whole will benefit from the opportunity of the increased sales. </PARA>
<PARA> I see this inquiry as an opportunity to send a signal to our producers that we in this place realise that dumping is a problem and that we in this place can do something-I was most entertained by Senator Boswell's phrase-`to make the legislation user friendly' and get it to the stage where it actually works and so demonstrate that we in this country can act in unison and as an aggressive competitor in international trade. If this inquiry can send a signal that we are capable of acting together and that we do realise some of the problems being faced by some of our producers, then the inquiry will have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry could also send a signal to our international competitors that we are at last getting our act together and that they had better stop seeing us as an easy target for dumping, manipulation of subsidies, or the sorts of practices which seem to have brought into the Australian market the very sorts of products that Senator Boswell so accurately listed. It is that competition that cannot be left to our producers to fight. The producers need the assistance of the Government and of the Australian community as a whole. It is the Australian community as a whole which eventually benefits from viable and successful rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have been supporting the rural industries and suggesting that we are deregulating too rapidly, I have been challenged with the suggestion that we should not expect the Australian community to support our rural producers with subsidies, tariff regulations or more effective anti-dumping legislation. My answer to that has been that it is the Australian community which has decided that our rural producers-in fact all our producers-have to bear the burden of award wages, health regulations, inspection fees and the other sorts of costs associated with operating in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Several times in this place we have heard a litany of the sorts of costs which all producers have to face. Some of the costs, as Senator Boswell said, are very hard to determine. The sorts of potential subsidies which governments in other countries could give and are giving are often difficult to determine. That is the very reason that we have to make the point that the whole community benefits and the whole community has the potential to support our producers. If we as a nation and our producers are suffering from unfair competition from overseas, then it is up to us to recognise this and to try to see where this country can support itself and the members of its community. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, this is a very good way to start on this path of giving support. I hope that the Senate gives unanimous support to this reference to the Committee. I also hope that the members of the Committee can see the direction which this inquiry could take and at last give some sort of support and indication to rural Australia that this Government is interested in its welfare. When I say `this Government' I mean it in its fullest sense, comprising all members of the Parliament. We should show that we are all interested in the welfare of the rural community. If that signal can be made through this Committee I will be most satisfied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole question of dumping and countervailing certainly needs clarification and simplification. I am pleased to be able to support this proposal to refer to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology the questions that have been put before us so that the problems being experienced in this field can be looked at and solutions suggested and hopefully implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal and National Party coalition is determined to do something to stop unfair trading practices, to stop dumping and to give some reasonably simple way of getting redress where these procedures and actions by importers interfere with and severely affect the rural producers of Australia. I congratulate the mover of the motion, Senator Boswell, for the work that he has put into this and for the attention to detail that has gone into getting the references correct. I think the wide-ranging support for this proposal to submit this matter to the Committee is something that we, as Australians, will reap the benefits of in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to see the Australian Democrats supporting this motion and I am sure that the Australian Labor Party will see the merit of it and will also support the referral to the Committee. Anything that will get better rules, systems and procedures for bringing actions and investigating these matters must be of benefit to Australia as a whole and to rural producers in particular. It is essential that this be done now, at a time when rural industries are in real crisis and the primary producers are suffering more every day. </PARA>
<PARA> It is something that the Liberal and National parties are very keen to see implemented. The inquiry should be wide- ranging. It should delve into these matters, and I am sure that the members of the Committee will do that. If I have a reservation concerning the reference, it would be that it may not be wide enough. I sometimes wonder whether we should not have included also in the reference to this Committee an examination of quarantine matters, because a lot of the problems being experienced by rural producers could be exacerbated a hundredfold if some of the crops that they are growing were to be wiped out because quarantine was relaxed to the extent where diseases could get into Australia through foreign produce. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned before in this Senate an inquiry by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service which is examining quarantining procedures concerning rice and altering the rules to make it easier to bring in foreign rice. Making it easier increases, at all times, the risk of bringing foreign diseases into a disease-free industry in Australia. If the Quarantine Inspection Service gets it wrong and allows in rice that is contaminated, it could wipe out the Australian rice industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many arguments for and against different levels of quarantining but I think that not enough attention is paid to the dictum that if there is a doubt, that doubt should be decided for the benefit of Australian producers rather than for the benefit of importers and overseas producers. I think too often when quarantine matters are being considered the fine dividing line of the argument is decided against Australian rural producers. This is a problem in the rice industry. It is also a problem in the banana industry, where bananas are being imported and there are doubts about the correct quarantine procedures. If something goes wrong the whole industry could be wiped out. The list goes on. Citrus products are coming in. There is doubt about the quarantine procedures concerning them, and if some germ or disease gets into the country, again, a very substantial rural industry could be wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems, together with the dumping of these crops, have particular relevance to the areas which I represent. If dumping and quarantining are not handled in the correct way, whole towns could disappear off the map. The town that I come from, Ayr, has a very substantial rice industry and the town further north in the Atherton Tablelands, Mareeba, is very heavily dependent upon rice; and dumping of cheaper, subsidised overseas products and failures to look properly at quarantining matters could ruin those industries, ruin the enormous infrastructure that has gone into them, ruin the capital input that has been put into them and ruin the jobs of many of the people who work in the plants that process those things. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the towns of Tully and Innisfail are reeling from competition from cheap and, I suspect, subsidised imports of bananas from other countries. A lot of people laugh when the word `banana' is mentioned, particularly in relation to Queensland, but it is a very vital and important industry in the Tully and Innisfail areas of our State. It is an industry which, at the moment, is reeling because of what is said to be unfair competition from subsidised and otherwise supported imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland citrus growing areas of Mundubbera and Gayndah are also feeling the pinch of imported products and are doubly concerned at not only the dumping aspects of it but also the quarantining aspects. If that industry really is affected badly, a whole section of Queensland could well move off the map and again the infrastructure, the jobs and everything else that goes with it would be in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in the sugar industry there is competition from cheaper and, I suspect again, subsidised overseas imports. That is almost unthinkable for a country which has the most efficient and most effective sugar industry in the world-one that for many years has supplied all of Australia's wants and, without question, is run more efficiently than any sugar industry anywhere else in the world. Yet we are importing sugar. Fortunately, at the moment, it is only small portions, but it is coming in. To me, that can mean only that somewhere along the line the imported sugar is being assisted in some way. I hope that this inquiry will enable investigations into that and enable the action that can be taken to be taken more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up the time of the Senate any longer on this question. I am only a very simple person, and I simply ask this question of whoever might be able to answer it: in these matters relating to dumping, countervailing and quarantining, I cannot understand why it is only Australia that seems to be playing by the rules. We are a very small country. Our influence on world trade would be minuscule. Yet we seem to be the only ones doing it. That is a question that I cannot understand. Nobody seems to be able to tell me, but there must be some reason why we do it and nobody else does. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the concept of world free trade is excellent. It is a concept that I think would probably have greater benefits in other countries, but we seem to be the only ones doing it. I hope that somewhere along the line in the not too distant future someone will be able to tell me why we do it honestly, why we do it deliberately and fairly, but nobody else seems to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry that has been proposed for referral to the Senate Standing Committee is an excellent idea. It is one that I hope will come up with some suggestions and recommendations that can be implemented and can put a new light on these problems and, in that way, can assist the rural producers of Australia in getting their products onto the market without unfair competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I have great pleasure in supporting today the motion moved by Senator Boswell, the Leader of my Party, the National Party of Australia. I thought one passage of his speech was of particular interest. He said that one day free world trade in agriculture will become a reality. We in the National Party of Australia look forward to that day because we have absolutely no doubt that primary producers in this country are the most cost efficient and most effective in the world. What concerns me, as it concerns Senator Boswell, is what will happen to our primary producers between now and when that day finally comes. What we face around the world-in the European Economic Community, in Latin American countries, in China and in North America-is a tide sweeping against free trade in agricultural produce. We see continued efforts by governments in those countries to stymie any attempts to open up agricultural markets around the world to free trade. It concerns me that we in this country allow this to happen, allow goods that are produced through heavy subsidies, goods that are dumped in this country, to destroy the agricultural base of Australia's economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What worries me and frightens me enormously is the possibility that, when the day finally comes when free trade in agricultural products is a reality, there will be no farm sector in this country to take advantage of our natural opportunities to produce better quality goods more cheaply than anybody else. I am particularly concerned at the mechanisms currently existing within the Australian Customs Service (ACS) for the analysis and examination of countervailing and anti-dumping applications. </PARA>
<PARA> When we heard evidence from the ACS in Estimates Committee A earlier this year, I asked its officers whether the procedure was satisfactory for protecting Australian farmers from dumping and countervailing. They said, yes, they felt the process was satisfactory because they did not get many complaints afterwards. I said, `Look, this is a non sequitur'. The reason it was a non sequitur, and the reason it remains a non sequitur, is very simple: the whole process of making an application for protection against dumping and countervailing is so complex, so costly and so time-consuming that by the time the ACS comes to the conclusion that there might not be a case, half the time the people who originally made the complaint are either bankrupt or cannot afford to proceed any further and make an appeal against that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the motion moved by Senator Boswell is absolutely critical. It flushes out into the open the unsatisfactory methods currently used by the ACS, and it shows once and for all a very real need for the ACS to have a clear view of what dumping and countervailing is all about and what it does to Australian primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I note too the answers given to my questions on notice put in Estimates Committee A with respect to the number of agricultural complaints as a percentage of total complaints and the number of agricultural complaints upheld as a percentage of the total. For example, in 1987-88 only 20 per cent of total complaints about dumping and countervailing came from agricultural industries. In spite of the number being so small, not one complaint was upheld by the Australian Customs Service. I am very pleased to see that in the last financial year the figure for agricultural complaints has finally crept up to 27 per cent, with the number of complaints upheld being 29 per cent, but I believe that there is clear evidence-and Senator Boswell in his speech today has done a magnificent job of making that evidence very clear-to show that the cases for anti-dumping and countervailing complaints by the Australian agricultural producers should perhaps be substantially higher than that. </PARA>
<PARA> We face around the world governments in other countries that are persistently and wilfully subsidising inefficient farmers for their own ends and in contradiction to the fine words they mouth in forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). It is very clear when one looks, for example, at Japan that its level of subsidy is wholly unsatisfactory. Japanese farmers on average receive 72 per cent of their income in the form of government subsidies. In other countries, such as the United States of America, the level of government subsidy is something like 38 per cent. These are figures I have cited in the Senate before and figures I will continue to push, because it is very important for the Australian public to understand the plight of the rural sector in this country and understand exactly what makes it very difficult for Australian farmers to survive at the moment. It is not because Australian farmers are inefficient; it is not because Australian farmers cannot compete. They can compete, but they are not being allowed to compete. That is what this inquiry is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I read with interest today in the Sydney Morning Herald an article on page 3 relating to the macadamia nut industry. It is interesting that the macadamia nut is a native Australian nut. In spite of this, the macadamia nut industry in this country is on the point of collapse. One reason for that is that the industry is having difficulty competing with subsidised products from South Africa and Costa Rica. Goodness gracious-we are now finding that an industry we gave the world less than 20 years ago is now about to collapse and growers are going to go out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> While these conditions in the Australian Customs Service continue, while the ACS fails to take the necessary tough stance on dumping and countervailing, all I can say is that we will continue to see Australian agricultural industries collapse. We will continue to see a loss of jobs for Australian farm workers and people in processing industries. It is absolutely critical that we in this country recognise the risk, recognise the threat to Australian livelihoods and jobs, and take the necessary steps to stand up for Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments that were available to me this morning I compiled a list of some of the industries that I recognise as being under threat from dumping and countervailing. Of course, these are not the only ones, but they are some that have come to mind. They include the pine- apple, banana, citrus fruits, orange juice concentrate, apple juice concentrate, and canned fruits industries. Jam is coming in from Hungary; frozen peas and beans from the Netherlands; and potatoes from Canada. Cucumbers, beetroot, mushrooms and canned tomatoes are being brought into the country. The sultana industry in Sunraysia is in dreadful straits, as of course is the sugar industry. There are many other such industries on top of those. </PARA>
<PARA> Allow me to address just a couple of industries that I believe are very important. An industry very dear to my heart, being a Queenslander, is the banana industry. We have awful problems in north Queensland because our banana growers have had a number of very tough years and, just as the industry looks like picking up, they face the very real threat of having to compete with subsidised products coming in from Ecuador-products that bring with them the risk of black sigatoka and moko, two diseases that have the potential to decimate, if not totally destroy, the banana industry in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said it before and I will say it again: if we allow moko to come into this country, we will contaminate the soil in banana growing areas and there will be nothing we can do to allow those areas to grow bananas for 20 or 30 years. The jobs of thousands of north Queenslanders are at risk. An industry worth in the vicinity of $150m to this country every year will be destroyed if we allow these cheap subsidised products to flood the Australian markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Golden Circle pineapple cannery in Brisbane is another case in point showing the dangers of what happens when cheap subsidised products come into this country. In Queensland we can grow some of the finest pineapples in the world-beautiful sweet pineapples-yet we face the prospect of losing our pineapple industry as cheap, inferior products come flooding in from the Philippines. It is not just the farmers who will suffer. I know for a fact that workers at the Golden Circle cannery are very concerned about the future of their jobs, their livelihoods and their families if the Queensland pineapple industry is destroyed by Filipino imports. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why we on this side of the chamber and, in particular, we in the National Party believe that it is absolutely essential that this inquiry go ahead. One of the strange things is that many of the so-called home brands-I think in particular of Home Brand peanut paste-are in fact not home grown products at all. If you go into the supermarket and buy a jar of Home Brand peanut paste, that peanut paste almost invariably comes from Israel or China. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a sad irony that the company that manufactures and markets it in this country should pretend that it is a home brand, because it is anything but a home grown product; it is a product brought into this country and subsidised by the government of the country of its origin. It is brought in here for the sole purpose of undermining a very viable Australian industry such as the peanut industry. In my part of Queensland the peanut industry is very important and Senator Bjelke-Petersen will refer to it in more detail very shortly. These are the sorts of problems we face. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another problem, of course, is the pork industry. Senator Boswell so ably said today that the Canadian pork producers are eligible for up to 20 different subsidies. We have already seen how the Japanese farmers receive 72 per cent of their income in the form of government assistance. Do honourable senators know what percentage of total farm income in this country is government assistance? It is one per cent. One per cent of total farm income in this country comes from government assistance and if the Government has its way and wipes out drought relief, the only government assistance worth talking about will not be assistance to keep a farm going; it will be the money the Government pays to the farmer to get off the farm, to leave the land forever and to destroy another generation of Australian farmers. The time has come when we must take a firm stand on the cheating and frauding of international agricultural trade by countries overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before that Australian farmers in our free trade environment stand stark naked before the chill winds of international trade. I believe that the developments in the European Economic Community, the downturn in the GATT negotiations and the Uruguay Round show that it is not just a chill wind that our farmers currently face, but a full blown blizzard and they need assistance. They need somebody to stand up for them and protect them from what is being done to them overseas. We have seen generations of Australian farmers supporting the future and wealth of this country. It was long said that Australia rode on the sheep's back. But that very simplistic statement forgets all the other agricultural industries that have over the years supported the wealth of this country, for example, the wheat industry, the sugar industry and all of the other industries that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> We recollect during the war the fine efforts of Australian farmers to feed the mouths in this country and to assist in providing agricultural produce for our allies overseas. During the Second World War our Australian farmers were fighting a war of their own and they fought it valiantly. As we supported our soldiers, so too must we support our farmers. We must recognise the contribution of those generations of Australian farmers to the wealth and prosperity that we all enjoy today. I refer not just to generations of farmers that have preceded us, but to the generations of farmers to come. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this chamber frequently see school groups come to visit us and I notice that there are a couple of school groups in the galleries today. Many of those school children come from rural and provincial Australia. As they come here they ask what we have to offer for their future. What will we do to ensure a livelihood for the next generation of young Australians in rural and provincial Australia? I believe the move made by Senator Boswell today in putting forward this motion and bringing about this inquiry is a very brave step to ensure the future prosperity of this nation and of future generations of Australians who will be dependent upon agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying that I agree with Senator Boswell's sentiments. I look forward to that brave day when free world trade in agricultural products will become a reality and we will work towards that end. But until that day comes around we in the National Party will have no hesitation in standing up and fighting for the rights of Australian farmers and for all those in this country who depend upon them because the future of our agricultural industries is absolutely essential to the future economic strength of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be brief and to the point because most of the detail of the issue has been covered. I support this inquiry. It is a very important inquiry, because under the current anti-dumping and countervailing legislation industries in this country, in particular agriculture, cop it on both ends. We get penalised through dumping actions in terms of our inputs. The best example I can give is in terms of fertiliser being imported into this country against the monopoly situation which exists as far as manufacture is concerned. In that instance we find countries such as China and India, which use three times as much fertiliser as Australia, having access to fertiliser traded at world prices which is not available to Australian producers. On the other side of the coin, when it comes to countervailing actions, we see that in terms of those countries which are subsidising their producers we do not have effective action to correct the situation. So in both instances we have a problem in terms of free trade and what is commonly termed the level playing field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point I want to highlight is the method of assessing damage or estimated material injury. This needs to be clarified and cleaned up. An aspect which is crucial to this whole issue is the way that these actions can be strung out. In fact, on the most recent figures I have seen, the average time is almost 12 months to get an action sorted out as it goes through the processes. The amendments which were made in 1986 were designed to speed up the whole process. In actual fact, if a party wants to string out an action to get a decision-whatever that decision might be-I believe it can take up to 457 days. We have a ludicrous situation in this country where we are being denied access to inputs at world traded prices. On the other hand, we have entry into this country of subsidised products, particularly in the horticulture, dairy, fruit and dried fruit industries. </PARA>
<PARA> So we on this side of the chamber support this inquiry. We hope that it will address some of the issues in the anti-dumping and countervailing legislation and address the distortions that are created by the present decision making process now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Boswell's motion that the anti-dumping and countervailing legislation be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have certainly told us of all the industries that have been affected by dumping of cheap products on the Australian market. This is a real problem as far as peanuts and navy bean imports are concerned. I want to refer to those industries in particular in my remarks in the Senate today. My home district, South Burnett and Kingaroy, is the peanut and navy bean capital of Australia. I was certainly very interested to hear Senator O'Chee's remarks about peanut paste. I must admit that I do not buy Home Brand peanut paste; I always buy Kraft peanut paste. So I hope it comes from home grown peanuts. It is always very nice.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ND4">Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I believe it is very important that we emphasise our home grown peanuts because they have been at the basis of our economy in South Burnett for a long time and they are suffering very much as a result of peanuts being imported, as I will tell the Senate shortly. The Burnett region normally produces 90 per cent of Australia's navy beans and 70 per cent of its peanuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Crops are down to 25 per cent of normal levels this year, owing to either drought or wet harvests. The run of bad seasons has sapped the confidence in what was regarded as one of the nation's safest climatic regions. The peanut industry, for example, has had five particularly bad years of weather. Indeed, as I read in our local paper just recently, this year the peanut growers have had to borrow money to plant their crops. That is a very bad start, because then the growers really do need a good season to ensure that they get a crop to pay back their debts and, of course, the bad seasons have caused growers to get lower yields for their crops as well. </PARA>
<PARA> But to compound the problems the growers are facing, peanut processors are importing peanuts-those imported peanuts used in the production of the peanut paste that my friend Senator O'Chee was speaking about earlier. Most of the imports are coming from China, and if the same crop had been grown in Australia it would have been rejected because of the high levels of chemicals that it contains. We have two policies on this issue in Australia. We expect our peanut growers to have a relatively pollution and chemical free product. Yet we then import a subsidised product that would normally have been rejected by our authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the navy bean industry the situation is similar. The navy bean industry is enduring a difficult time at the moment for two reasons. The first, as I said earlier, is the succession of adverse seasonal circumstances. The second is the declining profitability in the gross margin of production, which is then compounded by the need to compete with inferior products which are currently being dumped at obviously cheaper prices on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> Droughts and floods are facts of agricultural production in any year and are elements over which control cannot be exercised. I am certainly very pleased indeed that I do not have to have any say in the control of the weather because I am afraid neighbours would be very upset. There would be some people who want a nice dry season to harvest their crop, and other people who are anxiously praying for rain so they can plant another one. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmer profitability is a matter that cannot escape attention. Put simply, the cost to produce a crop of navy beans has exceeded that which can be recovered through the selling price to Australian manufacturers. This industry has lost a 25 per cent tariff protection and consequently purchase prices are kept in line with import parity values. </PARA>
<PARA> In the South Burnett region, navy bean growers are having to compete with imports of canned baked beans from Eastern Bloc countries. I can assure senators that this product is not the same high quality in standard that we have come to expect from Australian primary producers, and notably the navy bean growers in the South Burnett area I come from. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ND4">Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is. The ability of the industry to maintain an acceptable level to growers must be regarded as an essential aim, since price will always be rated as the chief criterion on which farmers will assess their decision to produce or not. What has happened in my district is that what was among the dearest farming country in the State in 1982 and worth $2,640 a hectare is now valued at $1,350-a very severe slump. This equity crunch is expected to drive at least 200 of the region's 1,000 peanut and navy bean farmers out of business this year, according to the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. The slow reduction in peanut and navy bean crops has turned the nation from exporter of these commodities, adding to trade deficit problems. This situation has been compounded by growers in developing countries exporting to Australia at rock bottom prices because of preferential tariff treatment for the Third World.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter that Senator O'Chee mentioned in his very excellent speech earlier was the macadamia nut industry. I just want to say to Senator O'Chee that it is the Queensland nut industry. The macadamia nuts have been growing in Queensland for a long time and they were originally called the Queensland nuts. I must say they have got terribly hard shells and are very difficult to crack but they are an excellent nut; there are no two ways about that. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems very ironic to me that they can be having competition from other countries producing the same nuts and nearly driving the macadamia nut industry completely broke. I think that this, too, is rather a sad effect of the dumping of all sorts of products in Australia. I agree with all the list of products that Senator O'Chee mentioned before, including the pineapple industry in Queensland which is also having problems. I could go on and on, but I think we really have had quite a long explanation regarding these matters from many senators. A farmer in our area, Ian MacFarlane, told The Bulletin:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a common comment up here that people could have handled bad seasons, low prices or high interest rates but to get them all at once is too much. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is devastating to see the erosion of farmers' financial positions . . . the problem we are facing is that the costs of growing these crops has quadrupled since 1983 while the price has not altered-</PARA>
<PARA>and that is a hard cold fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Combine that with high interest rates and the high value of the Australian dollar and it is a serious situation. </PARA>
<PARA>What he is saying to the Australian people is quite simple really and simple enough, I hope, for all the Labor senators and members to understand, that is, that, with high interest rates and a high dollar on top of unseasonably bad weather for quite a few years, these imports that I have been talking about are the last straw for the growers. I believe it is very important that this anti-dumping reference be referred to the Senate Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Accordingly, I support Senator Boswell's notice of motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. The Government will not be opposing this motion and I understood we made that clear two hours ago. Nevertheless it is still the case, notwithstanding the speeches that honourable senators opposite have made. It is a pity that we have had quite so much duplication. There have been some examples of talking about important subjects instead of saying something important; nevertheless there is an issue of concern to people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear there is majority support for it being referred in the Senate, so the Government will not be opposing it.

If they do not I regret to say that I predict that they will come back and seek an extension of time. But that is not an crisis and we can cope with that if it happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am very gratified to hear that the Government is supporting the motion, which means that the subject matter raised in the motion will have the unanimous support of the Parliament. We have heard speakers from the Australian Democrats, the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia and now the Australian Labor Party supporting this motion. I am sure that all the primary producers who are affected will be grateful to know that they have the support of the Parliament. Senator Bell raised some questions and as he is a new senator, I might offer him the advice that, if he wants to make a submission to this inquiry, it is not unusual for senators to place a submission before the inquiry and it will be given the same consideration as any other evidence taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald raised two questions. He thought that the inquiry should cover quarantine. If he had a criticism, it was that the inquiry was not wide enough. Although I recognise the problems that Senator Macdonald raised in relation to importing disease into Australian primary industries, it would be difficult to combine quarantine with an anti-dumping inquiry. Another way to stop the flow of subsidised imported products into Australia relates to correct labelling. But it is very difficult to combine quarantine and labelling under an anti-dumping inquiry. I recognise that the point that Senator Macdonald made is valid. I took up the labelling point with Senator Bolkus, when he was the responsible Minister, and recently Senator Tate has corresponded with me on the issue. We have not come to a final position yet; we are still negotiating on labelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee made a very worthwhile speech, pointing out what is happening to rural industries, in Queensland in particular. Senator Bjelke-Petersen took him to task about calling our Queensland nut a macadamia nut and I am sure that he will not make that mistake again. I was particularly grateful that Senator Bjelke-Petersen made a very strong speech supporting the industries around her home territory, the South Burnett. Senator Bjelke-Petersen and her family are under stress at the moment in other areas, but that has not stopped her coming into the chamber to defend the rural industries of Queensland, as she and her husband have done for over 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing the debate I would like to thank all honourable senators who have made a contribution to the motion to have this Senate inquiry reference. I do believe it will help overcome some of the problems that are affecting Australian farmers at the moment. As I said, apart from high interest rates and the high value of our dollar, the problem of subsidised food coming into Australia is probably third on the list of areas that are hurting farmers in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australia Council Act to implement the Government's decisions in response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure Inquiry into Commonwealth Assistance to the Arts. The Report of this Committee, entitled``Patronage, Power and the Muse'', is generally known as the McLeay Report after the Committee's Chairman, the current Speaker of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response to the McLeay Report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 May 1987. At that time, the then Minister for the Arts, the Hon. Barry Cohen, MP, outlined the process of wide consultation with the arts community which led to the conclusions of the McLeay Report and the development of the Government's response. The Australia Council was involved in the consultation process and conducted its own review of its role, structure and functions at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of the McLeay Report's recommendations focused on the Australia Council, the Government's arts funding body. The Government agreed with the McLeay Committee that the Council's administrative structure should be streamlined and that the Council should take account of Government policies at the Commonwealth, State and local government levels. The Government also agreed that community cultural development should be accorded a higher priority in the Council's activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australia Council supported these recommendations and has already acted to implement those aspects of the Government's response to the McLeay Report which did not require amendment of its Act. In other cases, it has set up interim mechanisms which give expression to the intent of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill was introduced into and passed by the House of Representatives in 1988. However, it had not been passed by the Senate before the March election and consequently lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of this Bill enable the Australia Council to complete the implementation of those aspects of the Government's response to the McLeay Report which relate to the operation of the Council. The main provisions of the Bill are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>- The Act is to be amended to ensure that the Council has regard to Government policies and, where practicable, the policies of State and local governments as they relate to the arts. The amendments also provide for the Council to have regard to any matters which the Minister may specify in writing. The Minister will have the power to issue directions to the Council but this power will not apply to the Council's ability to make or refuse to make grants. The important `arms length' principle of arts funding is to be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>- The amendments allow representatives of the community interest to be appointed to the Council and its Boards. This will allow the Council to broaden its focus to better reflect the concerns of the consumers of arts programs and the general public. The amendments also remove the requirement for Government representation on the Council and ensure all Board Chairpersons are members of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>- In keeping with the streamlined administration which the Council has put in place through the amalgamation of Boards, and also to enhance flexibility, the maximum membership of Boards has been increased from eight to nine and the minimum membership has been reduced from six to five. </PARA>
<PARA>- The amendments also allow the Council, its Boards and its Committees to conduct meetings by tele-conference or any other means. In this way the Council would be able to respond quickly to situations which require immediate decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>- Another major change is the establishment of a new co-ordinating Board which may have a membership of thirteen, including the Chairperson. This new Board will have a large, flexible membership which may comprise the Chairperson and members of the Council, the Chairperson and members of Boards and wide representation from community arts and the broad public interest. The new provisions allow the Minister to establish this Board as a Community Cultural Development Board to further the development of community cultural activities, in line with the Government's response to the McLeay Report. The Council has already set up a Community Cultural Development Committee in anticipation that it would form the basis for the new Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Community Cultural Development Board will have as a major objective supporting and encouraging the active participation of communities in the development of their own culture. It will seek to identify and develop training opportunities, promote the theory and practice of contemporary arts, support community cultural organisations and encourage research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments to the Act will not require any additional funds for implementation. Since the time of the McLeay Report the Council has put in place significant economies in its administration. </PARA>
<PARA>I am confident the amendments provide the impetus to carry the Australia Council forward into the nineties with a structure which is both responsive to changing needs and priorities and in line with prevailing community wishes. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reiterate the points I made in my speech before the adjournment debate last night which related to the appropriation for and associated matters concerning the Antarctic Division and the Commonwealth's presence in the Antarctic. Yesterday, I raised concerns about the tender for the Antarctic vessel Aurora Australis. In particular, I am very concerned about a decision taken in undue haste to charter a second ship, namely the Icebird, for the next three years. The decision to charter the Icebird for the 1990-91 season cannot be changed, regardless of any circumstances, but the decision taken to charter a second ship for the next three years should be reconsidered. The opportunity to charter the Russian vessel Akademik Federov seems financially advantageous. From private briefings I have had with the Director of the Antarctic Division and from what he has told me in Estimates committees, the Division would prefer to have control of its own vessel and of its own circumstances in the Antarctic. Nevertheless, at this point in history where we have peaceful cooperation with our Soviet friends it might be prudent for Australia to reconsider its attitude towards cooperation with the Russian scientists. I can think of no better way than using one of their up-to-date high-tech modern icebreakers, such as the Akademik Federov which was launched in only 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was in the Soviet Union recently with a parliamentary delegation I raised this matter with members of its parliaments and others and they were very keen to cooperate with Australia. That is natural, because they are in need of hard currency and foreign exchange. In Australia, we are in a rural crisis which we have just heard about from previous speakers. We are trying to place our wool, particularly with Russia, which has stopped buying it because of a shortage of funds. This is an ideal opportunity where we can barter trade with that country, to our advantage and to theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> With that short background, I will continue my remarks about some shortcomings in the tendering process for the charter of the second vessel. On 14 August 1990 Anderson Hughes Australia invited expressions of interest and firm proposals for providing a ship to the Antarctic Division for three seasons, 1991-92. The closing date for response was 7 September 1990. The matter is now under scrutiny. Several aspects of the actions of Anderson Hughes are a little unusual, to say the least. The first is that it is usual for an expression of interest to be sought first on the basis of an outline specification in order to establish a pre-qualified short list of interested bidders. When this process is complete, proposals are then sought from the short list to whom a more detailed specification and, just as importantly, a proposed charter party are provided. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that the specification and details of the charterer's requirements provided in the invitation were sketchy, and there have been concerns as to whether they were sufficient to make the required firm proposal. As an example, the details provided did not mention the maximum operating draught of the vessel, which is normally 7.7 metres so that the ship can navigate the approaches to Australian stations. </PARA>
<PARA> My most serious concern is that, with no visible time constraints apparent, for some reason Anderson Hughes-one can only presume that it was at the behest of the Antarctic Division-allowed only three weeks to make firm proposals for a charter worth in excess of $10m which will not commence until mid-October 1991. It is very difficult to see how such a minimal amount of time can in any way serve Australia's best interests. I believe that such a time frame may have had the contrary effect and worked against our interests. The process by which proposals will be evaluated has not been divulged. However, Anderson Hughes has indicated that the Antarctic Division may seek tenders from specific vessels or owners, or may go out to open tender with the specific requirement. The whole process appears very vague and the material provided does not befit a $10m charter. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, when recently in Russia I spoke with the governors and politicians in the Khavarovsk and Primorsky prefectures. Because they face the Pacific, they are very interested in joint venturing and joint operations with Australia-not only in regard to vessels in the Antarctic but in terms of fishing. If we were to avail ourselves of the very generous offer that seems to have been made by the Soviets, there would be benefits not only to Australia but I believe to my own State of Tasmania, particularly the port of Hobart. We would have an opportunity to show the Soviets and other foreign countries that we are quite capable of providing very good services in refuelling, provedoring and bunkering for the vessels that come to our port. We will be able to prove that Hobart is not only a good jumping off place for Antarctica, but is also one of the leading ports for any international ships that wish to use our port as a forward post to move to their stations in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many moves by both the previous State Government and the current Government in Tasmania to set up an Antarctic Centre and research facilities in Hobart. We already have the Antarctic Division and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation with significant operations in Hobart. I believe that, by encouraging ships from other nations to use Hobart as a last port of call to Antarctica, the port of Hobart and Australia will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that Russian vessels should be given any particular commercial advantages, as it is obviously prudent for the Antarctic Division to choose the most economical and suitable vessels for the purpose. However, I believe that, when there are considerable advantages to be gained from the use of Russian vessels, such as the Akademik Federov, we would do well to undertake a thorough examination of the issues involved. I do not believe that the given period of three weeks was sufficient. It is my understanding that the tendering arrangements which Anderson Hughes implemented in this instance caused some difficulty for the Russians. I am sure that honourable senators would agree that it is almost impossible for detailed proposals to be sent from Russia in three weeks, particularly when it involves such a large amount of money. From my experience on the recent parliamentary delegation to that country, I found that communications were almost non-existent; it was impossible to telephone from one side of the country to the other. For us in Australia to expect the Russians to come up with firm proposals suitable to our conditions in as short a time as three weeks is not only impossible but does not work in the interests of either the Soviets or ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would reiterate that, given the fact that Mr Hawke and Prime Minister Ryzhkov entered into negotiations when Mr Ryzhkov visited our country, the fact that we even issued a set of stamps highlighting the cooperation between the Soviets and the Australians in Antarctica, and the fact that in the past the Soviets have been very cooperative and helpful to Australian expeditions in the Antarctic by flying out some of our injured people, we would do well to cooperate with them in any way we possibly can because who knows when the situation may again arise when we need their help. Frankly, I do not believe that there are any other vessels or any other countries, apart from the United States, which is a fair distance removed from our bases in the Antarctic, which could help us in a meaningful way. I call upon the Government to do what it can to put some pressure on those responsible to look again at the offer made by the Soviets. Who knows, perhaps an arrangement may be made between our two countries that can be of assistance to us all and for the good of us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The economy is still the centre of debate in Australia and is crucial to the way of life we are able to pursue. The nearer we come to getting it right, the closer we are to the standard of living that we want for all the community. Economists, as their very name suggests, ought to be the ones best equipped to guide the community to where its material welfare is most happily provided for. They should be the ones able to set out the steps to be taken and to give encouragement to economic recovery in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, the economists try to cure the material ills of the nation. They are forever writing prescriptions for it. During the eighties they have called for deregulation, for the floating of the dollar, for privatisation, for freedom of entry into the financial sector, for less government expenditure, for Budget surpluses, for unfettered buying and selling of companies, for uninhibited market forces, and for lower wages. As one mechanism is tried without returning the promised result, another is urged upon us as the ultimate answer to our economic woes. The latest is the deregulation of the labour market: if only that were done, all would be well. </PARA>
<PARA> Too many economists seem to see the world as a piece of machinery which can be happily controlled if the right lever is pulled. The Petty cartoons in the Age capture their thinking with exquisite accuracy: press the right button, push the correct pedal, find the appropriate gear, pull the steering wheel in the proper direction and all will be well. The only thing is that reliance simply on mechanical formulas never quite works. Though easy to proclaim, economics by rote falls short of success. It often requires mightily little evidence to satisfy proponents of ideologies, theories and intuitive insights of their validity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is need for a realistic and empirical appraisal of what would best advance Australia's prosperity. That involves more than working out the best way to operate economic levers. Changing interest rates, extending privatisation, impugning unionism, deregulating the labour market, lowering tariffs, selling equity overseas, increasing Budget surpluses, or reducing public expenditure will not by themselves bring about the happy state that we all want. Yet experts have an unhappy tendency to advocate that the economy be run on such robotic principles alone. The result of doing so will fall short of the one promised. </PARA>
<PARA> The best outcome will be gained where directors, management and the work force generally adopt common goals, readily undertake their tasks in cooperation, and are all dedicated to producing quality as well as quantity. For this to be achieved, a development is needed in our industrial culture. That involves matters of the heart and soul. It will not be achieved by resorting solely to economic levers. Japan and Germany have the strongest currencies in the world. They produce and export vast quantities of quality goods. They have the industrial culture that enables them to do so. A central dimension of that culture is the sound relationship that exists between those involved in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be for everyone's good if industrial productivity could be improved in Australia. Any attempt to do so by employing identical processes to those used in Japan and Germany will be flawed. The social histories and cultures of the three countries are different, and trying to achieve reform here by employing means simply because they have been successful elsewhere is acting at odds with reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Media cover of the economy is prolific. Prescriptions for its cure come thick and fast. The common message is that Australia should produce more, particularly for sale overseas, and consume less in foreign goods and services. This is an easy strategy to proclaim, but a hard one to carry through. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial gains are best obtained by enlisting the goodwill and dedication of directors, management and workers. This is unlikely to happen where force, fear, blame and censure are used as the primary impetus for change. Yet there is an unhappy tendency to employ one or more of these to improve Australia's production. Management berates the workers and their unions; workers berate management and their organisations. All censure the Government, and it can be moved to reply in kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Hostile criticism is apt to damage the spirit of cooperation and dedication that might otherwise exist between the groups needed to ensure Australia a sound economy. The adversarial climate in the workplace throughout the country does it harm. The events engendered by the procedures used for the handling of dichlorobenzidine at the Hoechst plant in Melbourne are evidence of this. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord, in its various stages, has sought to calm the turbulent course Australian industrial history has taken. It has striven to allay conflict, to encourage shared commitment and to increase productivity. It has successes to its credit, prominent among which is the improved climate in the workplace. It has achieved this while keeping to Australian culture and traditions. If it is abandoned, whatever is put in its place should preserve the gains it has made. Adopting a program that provokes conflict will serve the country badly. </PARA>
<PARA> Where each of the various groups involved in Australia's economy blames one or more of the others for its present state, there is danger that the endeavour needed for its improvement will not be undertaken by any. All the groups fall short at times of producing the best of which they are capable. Accordingly, each is susceptible to criticism by the others. But where those others concentrate on that criticism to the exclusion of a proper examination of their own shortcomings economic progress will be sadly hampered. While managers see workers as the sole brake to better productivity, while workers see managers in the same light, while private enterprise attributes all its problems to government, and while none feel moved to change their own conduct, reform will lag. </PARA>
<PARA> For one group to impugn the efforts of the others while avoiding any self-criticism may show a lack of confidence in its own abilities. Had it faith in those abilities, it might well exercise them to gain the success desired rather than seeking to excuse a feared failure to do so by laying the blame at the door of others. Where there is a fear of responsibility there is a readiness to displace it elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Economists are apt to be delators. They admonish government for its policies, managers for their administration and workers for their industry. If their own prescriptions do not work it is usually because some group of people other than themselves has failed to act as it should: companies have invested unwisely, employees have received too much or governments have pursued wrong policies. People, unhappily, deviate from the fiscal and monetary path laid out by economic experts. They allow spiritual, social, cultural and political values to lead them astray. If only these things could be suppressed things would be better. Yet it is these values which are needed to assure Australia's future. </PARA>
<PARA> Long term prosperity will not come solely through the operations of fiscal and monetary levers, nor will it come by looking only to self-interest or greed. Without people generally having a commitment to high values, a sense of propriety, a generosity of purpose, a wide expanse of vision and a proper degree of tolerance, any lasting gains will be confined. These attitudes do not spring from economic theories but from values inherent in the spiritual, social and cultural convictions of a community. It would pay us to be more attentive to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's Melbourne Herald-Sun on pages 12 and 13 is the headline, `What our future holds'. Comments are set out by various people, including Barry Jones; the Archbishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth; and Robert de Castella, Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. There is a photograph of Janine Haines, who formerly led the Australian Democrats in this place. The economy was commented on by Neville Norman, reader in economics at Melbourne University. There is a contribution by Professor Sir Gustav Nossal, the Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. There are also articles by Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Hugh Morgan, the Managing Director of the Western Mining Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The layout of the contributions these people make illustrates what Australia needs to do; that is, to face the problems that it presently has on a variety of fronts. It is not simply a matter of looking to economic principles alone to get us out of our present problems. The principles espoused by Archbishop Peter Hollingworth and other religious leaders, including people such as Archbishop Sir Frank Little in Melbourne, will lead us on to a sense of nationhood-if I can use that concept-and will lead us forward. I think it is time that we started to talk in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great problems of economic hardship and economic downturn is that they tend to produce unhappy reactions. It is said that the first casualty in war is truth. As Mr Justice Vincent in Melbourne has said, one of the first casualties in hard economic times often is a proper sense of social morality. There is some danger that, where we do have an economic downturn, as is presently the position, the more lofty concepts that we would like to attach to ourselves as human beings tend to be diminished. Instead of looking to the future-this article in the Herald-Sun does that; it looks forward to the year 2040-we tend to look to our immediate problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic downturn that we are going through arose as a result of actions that were needed to stop an overheated economy that, had it not been slowed down, would have brought us to an unneeded disaster and a much greater struggle than we are presently going through to recover from. We had economic problems in Australia during the 1980s which had their origin, as has often been said, in previous decades, and those problems must be faced. This Government has taken steps, included in which is its high interest rate policy, to slow down the economy, not as a means of inflicting pain and distress on people-because the very statement of that proposition indicates that it is wrong, and no government of any colour would do that-but as a means of making Australia a prosperous, happy and well adjusted country in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many things in Australia which this Government has contributed to producing which ought to be looked at in favourable terms and preserved. For example, Australia is among the most tolerant nation in the world. It has had a successful immigration program. Governments of both colours have contributed mightily to the nation. That is something that we should be more than proud of not only here but also in international circles. Australia has had, by and large, a very good judiciary which has inculcated a sense of fairness into the system. Again under governments of both colours, an administrative system has been developed which has reined in excesses that the Executive might otherwise have perpetrated. Through bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office and the Social Security Appeals Tribunals, much has been done to bring fairness and justice into the system. That is something that we as Australians can be very proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> Our record on the environment has been quite outstanding by world standards. Again, that is something that we can be very proud of. The efforts that we have made to bring Aboriginals into the human circle have been quite outstanding. Senator Collins, who is sitting in front of me, has played a magnificent part in that. I am sure that Senator Collins will not be embarrassed by my saying that he has also been part of bringing structural adjustment to Australia and to its industry in a humane and civilised manner. The way he has gone about obtaining reforms on the waterfront is the way that we all, as Australians, should follow. He has attempted to do that not with a big stick and an aggression that must invoke one side to act against another, but in a way which will lead to lasting reform on the basis of agreement and where each side concedes what ought to be conceded and a lasting culture that will lead to productivity will develop. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that in our debates in this chamber, and indeed in Australia, our problems should not be seen simply in economic terms and nor should they be answered purely in the principles of a sterile economic theory. When I say `sterile', I do not mean that the theories are necessarily wrong but that unless they are informed by some sort of spiritual, social or cultural dimension they are doomed to failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs aware that Mr and Mrs Stephen and Helen Bakker of Lavington have distributed a pamphlet in the Albury area making a number of allegations about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child including claims that the Convention will become part of the law of Australia, that the signing of the Convention will dramatically alter the relationship between parents and child, that the proposals in the Convention will have the effect of taking away a large measure of control that parents now have over their children and that parents will have to give up their rights as parents?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Childs has kindly drawn my attention to a particular pamphlet apparently circulated by Mr and Mrs Bakker at Lavington. I must say that on reading the pamphlet I was shocked at its clearly misleading nature which will only upset and cause grave misgivings amongst otherwise good-intentioned people who will have, as I say, grave misgivings aroused by this pamphlet. For example, I notice that it says, amongst other things, that the effect of backing the Convention will be as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Parents are NOT ALLOWED to influence in any way a child's view on morality or religion-Article 14.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 14 in respect of the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion quite clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA> States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in relation to freedom of thought, conscience and religion-</PARA>
<PARA>in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite evident that Stephen and Helen Bakker have decided to arouse these misgivings in the community either because they are invincibly ignorant and illiterate or because of a malicious intent.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be incredible, would it not, for the Holy See to be amongst the first of the States parties to ratify this Convention were it to have the effect claimed in this particular pamphlet that children are to be torn from the bosom of their parents and subjected to the totalitarian regime of some nation state. The Holy See said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Holy See regards the convention as a proper and laudable instrument for protecting the rights and interests of children. By choosing to be among the first in acceding to the convention, the Holy See would like to encourage all countries and peoples to join in assuring legal protection and effective support to the well being of all the children of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>One may add to that that many organisations in Australia, including of course the Uniting Church in Australia and Mrs Rosemary Sinclair, who heads a nationwide organisation most concerned about the abuse of children in our community, have given their support to this particular Convention and Australia's role in relation to it.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Australia's role in relation to this Convention has been one that has particularly ensured that the rights and responsibilities of parents are acknowledged. Indeed, an article was inserted into the Convention precisely to achieve that particular effect. Article 5 of the Convention was inserted at Australia's initiative. It requires States parties to respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or others legally responsible for the child to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the child's exercise of the rights recognised in the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the totality of the Convention one certainly sees that we have an international benchmark against which nations that sign and then ratify the Convention can be judged in the international community. By itself, even ratification-and Australia has not yet ratified the Convention but has signed it-does not make the Convention part of the law of Australia; action is still required by the elected parliaments of this nation responsible to the electorate before the Convention can become part of the laws of Australia or any of the States.</PARA>
<PARA> I noted that the Liberal Federal Council dealt with this matter. I do not want to arouse any partisan issue, but it is important to note that contributors to the debate at that national council meeting of the Liberal Party, such as Senator Robert Hill, played a very outstanding role in explaining to delegates the true significance of this particular Convention. Senator Hill has dealt very honourably with this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA> This pamphlet that is circulating will only unsettle people. I hope that they will take some reassurance from the support, from major organisations which are much concerned with the welfare of children in Australia, for the signing of this particular Convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I and the Government, as I am sure is the case elsewhere in the chamber, deplore the murder in New York yesterday of the Jewish activist, Rabbi Meir Kahane, just as we deplore the use of senseless violence anywhere. In saying this, I naturally do not in any way endorse the views and activities of the late Rabbi Kahane, which were extreme, unpalatable and incompatible with peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli dispute and which themselves, it has to be said, did tragically contribute to the cycle of violence in Israel. I also make the point that Rabbi Kahane, who advocated the expulsion of the Palestinian population from Israel and the occupied territories, was not representative of mainstream Israeli opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He became a member of the Israeli Knesset in the 1984 elections with one-eightieth of the popular vote and his movement was in fact banned in 1988 on the grounds that it was racist and undemocratic. Despite his limited appeal to Israelis, his murder nonetheless could obviously provoke retributive acts of violence in the occupied territories and Israel in the current tense climate. In fact, it is the case that two Palestinians are reported to have been murdered in the occupied territories overnight, possibly in response to Rabbi Kahane's death. We of course deplore those deaths as well.</PARA>
<PARA> I say again that I hope that both Israelis and Palestinians will realise that further violence on top of what is now more than 30 deaths on both sides in the past month cannot possibly help the situation in Israel and the occupied territories and will only make the task of achieving a peaceful settlement more difficult. The Australian Government calls again on both sides to refrain from actions that will worsen the situation. I urge Israeli authorities, in particular, to ensure the protection of Palestinians from any possible acts of revenge in response to Rabbi Kahane's murder.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to his recent proposal for a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Asia (CSCA). I ask: Does the Minister share the view of many specialists in international relations that a regional security forum such as this should allow all nations around the Pacific Basin to be represented? Does the Minister accept that the establishment of such a forum is made more necessary by the prospect of increased arms spending in the region and more possible by unprecedented advances in regional conflict resolution, especially in Cambodia and Korea? Given that the establishment of such a forum would require substantial resources, what resources would the Minister intend to commit on behalf of the Australian Government to the development and promotion of this proposal? Finally, what response has the concept of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Asia had from regional states and, in particular, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Japan, Indonesia and Vietnam?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3608" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I have been, as Senator Bourne said, one of those people who have been generating discussion about a possible Asian equivalent to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), I do not think it is appropriate to jump too quickly to conclusions as to what, if any, particular institutional structure might be appropriate in the Asian region in order to advance the cause of regional security. It is my view that countries in this region, including Australia, need to look ahead to the kind of new institutional processes that might evolve over time as an appropriate framework for the discussion and handling of security issues. It is obvious that if such a regional security forum or structure does evolve it would be very desirable, to answer the honourable senator's first question, that all countries in the Asia-Pacific region be represented there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that the rapid changes that are occurring in the global and regional strategic environments, including recent advances in conflict resolution, have important implications for the region as a whole and these changes reinforce the view that current arrangements, or indeed the absence of any integrated regional security arrangements as distinct from a multiplicity of bilateral ones, will not equip us as well as we could be equipped to handle what is likely to become a very much more fluid strategic environment in our region over the next few years. It is in that context that I and others in the region have been suggesting that perhaps it is time for some new thinking about all of this.</PARA>
<PARA> The response so far to suggestions of a CSCA-type concept has been mixed, but there is a growing recognition by countries in the region of the need for enhanced processes of dialogue on security issues-which is, after all, what this is all about. Nobody, least of all me, assumed that there was any easy translation possible between the CSCE and the CSCA, simply because of the totally different strategic environments-a single frontier in Europe versus multiple frontiers and multiple ideological conflicts and so on in our part of the world. The Association of South East Asian Nations member countries have been emphasising the primacy of the concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, or ZOPFAN, in South East Asia. The Soviet Union has put forward a proposal for a meeting of all regional Foreign Ministers in 1993 with a lead-up process to that. The United States has had a somewhat more reserved approach to these issues but it is indicating that it is open to discussion. Japan has particular security concerns which again we need to take into account. A number of countries have taken the view-not totally unreasonably-that it is better to develop these processes of dialogue at bilateral and subregional levels and then evolve something out of that.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the common thread in all of this, and a view which I think we all ought to endorse, is that the priority at the moment is the development in the region of a shared sense of strategic and security interests and the development of new patterns of cooperation, including the development of confidence-building measures of various kinds in the region from which greater confidence in the regional security environment will grow and perhaps lead ultimately to a wider regional structure. With regard to resources, obviously it is premature to be committing financial resources to something which is in this early stage of evolution, although we have committed significant diplomatic resources to the task of determining how Australia might best participate in strengthened dialogues in regional issues in the way in which I have been describing, and how it might most effectively promote the development of a sense of regional community and shared security interests. These will remain important priorities for us in this Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the manoeuvres in the upper House of the Western Australian Parliament by the National and Liberal parties to block legislation for daylight saving which would bring Western Australia into line with eastern States? What is the effect on labour costs in the finance, communications and aviation industries which are required to alter their hours of work to fit in with the whims of the Western Australian Nationals and Liberals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October all of the States of Australia except Western Australia advanced their clocks by one hour to introduce daylight saving. Western Australia did not do that. There is now a three-hour time gap between Western Australia and all the other eastern States in Australia, and a 2 1/2-hour time gap between South Australia and Western Australia. It means that at 9 a.m. in Perth it is midday here, and at 5 p.m. here it is 2 p.m. there, meaning that there is a five-hour working day, effectively, because of the refusal of Western Australia to join the rest of Australia in introducing daylight saving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should report that the Lawrence Government proposed a Bill to the Western Australian Legislative Council, which is a body that has a National Party and Liberal majority, and that Bill was not given a first reading. A response to the position of the coalition in Western Australia is best illustrated by my quoting an article from the West Australian of 17 October as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Big business has vowed to step up its fight for daylight saving in WA after the Liberal Party yesterday rejected a proposal to put clocks forward in summer to match the eastern states.</PARA>
<PARA> The WA Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of WA Industry warned that the issue was not dead and foreshadowed a stronger public campaign next year to win support.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Confederation executive director Lyndon Rowe said WA's main trading partner, Japan, was an hour ahead of WA and daylight saving would put the Japanese on the same time.</PARA>
<PARA>He was thus refuting the key argument advanced by Mr McKinnon, the Leader of the Opposition, that Western Australia moved more with the Asian time zone than it did with the eastern States of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Western Australian Industry, representing all of the major employers in Western Australia, and the Chamber of Commerce and the Stock Exchange in Western Australia have supported daylight saving and supported the Australian Government in seeking to introduce it into Western Australia. In opposing the actions of the Legislative Council in that State I think most Federal members, who have to put up with the jet lag induced by the three-hour time difference, also would support daylight saving. I should also mention that on popular radio, particularly 6PR and the Howard Sattler show, there has been a stream of calls in support of daylight saving in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect on industry is quite profound, particularly industries associated with transport and communications, where new shift rosters have to be reworked to fit Western Australia into the rest of the civilised States of Australia. In particular, given Western Australia's hot summer, opportunities for workers to start earlier in the cooler part of the day and not work through the hotter part of the day have been passed up by this refusal by the Western Australian upper House. I add that, of course, daylight saving is a positive feature in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA> No better example of the impact on Western Australian industry and business of refusing to move to daylight saving can be given than in the sporting field. Over the last few months Western Australians have been proud of the performance of the West Coast Eagles in the Victorian Football League, but they all recognised that the distances the team had to travel and the time zones it had to traverse affected its performance. They are also proud of the performance of the Perth Wildcats, who won the National Basketball League title, but recognise that in the three-round play-offs it lost its first matches in the semi-final in Melbourne and the Grand Final in Brisbane, but won its concluding matches--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is for the Minister for Social Security. Can the Minister indicate whether there have been any positive outcomes in respect of indexation of British pensions in Australia? Are there prospects for reciprocal social security agreements with Greece and Turkey? Are these developments a consequence of the Minister's recent talks with his European counterparts?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3612" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I am sure honourable senators would be aware, there are something like 130,000 British pensioners in this country who do not have any indexation of British pensions, which is a little disturbing, given that Great Britain has signed agreements agreeing to indexation with a whole range of countries around the world including, most recently, the Philippines. That we do not rank with them is a source of some ire. It means, of course, that British pensioners who came here many years ago stay on the same level of pension that they brought into the country on the day they arrived. That brings about inequities and, of course, extra costs for the Australian Government in supplementing the often meagre amount that some of these pensioners receive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was in London a few weeks ago I signed a new agreement between Australia and Great Britain. While it does not bring about indexation, it was an advance in that at least it removes from the agreement between the two countries the underwriting of the British refusal to index those pensions. The fact that Great Britain agreed to remove that clause does, I think, give us some hope for the future.</PARA>
<PARA> I did discuss with the Minister for Social Security in Great Britain, Mr Newton-at least he was then; there has been a reshuffle in the last few days and I am not sure whether he is still the Minister-a number of options which the British Government might like to undertake short of granting full indexation, which would cost it $250m in a full year and which it says it cannot agree to do in one hit now.</PARA>
<PARA> I did discuss with him a number of options short of that which would at least give an indication to British pensioners in Australia that the British Government is moving in that direction. While I received no undertaking that my suggestions would be taken up, they were certainly to be considered and I hope that in the course of the next few months we will get some positive response. I also put them to the Opposition spokesman in Great Britain, Mr Meacher.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Greece and Turkey, which I also visited, the Greek Minister, Mrs Giannakou, was very encouraging in the way that she conducted our discussions. There will be a delegation coming from Greece in the next few weeks. Mrs Giannakou is very confident that a reciprocal agreement between the two countries can be negotiated and signed prior to 1 July next year. She believes that the hurdles which we were previously unable to jump-namely, those which restricted the movement of currency out of Greece-have been removed and that her Government will be moving very quickly to sign the reciprocal agreement, which Australia has indicated it would seek to sign.</PARA>
<PARA> The indications in respect of Turkey were also good-probably not as hopeful as those from Greece, but hopeful nonetheless. While the Turkish Minister, Dr Aykut, suggested that there may be some hurdles still to jump, negotiations will be conducted in February and she is also keen that we proceed. I made it very clear that no negotiations would take place with either Greece or Turkey until our Government had received a concrete undertaking in writing from each of their governments that the currency restrictions which applied in both countries had been removed. I am confident that those assurances will be received and I believe we can look forward with hope to signing agreements with those two countries at some stage in the next 12 months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Quite clearly, the Federal Government gives a high priority to the prevention of cervical cancer. Of course, it is susceptible to prevention strategies. I know that senators from all sides of the chamber have taken an interest in this matter, particularly in Estimates committees. My good friend and colleague Senator Walters, for example, understands this to be a major matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987 the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC) commissioned the cervical cancer screening evaluation committee to oversee a $2.5m Commonwealth-funded evaluation of existing cervical cancer screening programs and services and to develop strategies to encourage greater participation in screening programs by those women most at risk of the disease. The report prepared by that evaluation committee was considered by AHMAC at the end of October. It identified, and Senator Foreman has alluded to this, a number of problems with the present screening arrangements and made a number of recommendations about how to improve their effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> Problems identified include the fact that, despite the fact that pap smears have been available to Australian women since the 1960s on a fee for service basis and at negligible cost to women since 1984 as a consequence of the availability of Medicare rebates, only 50 per cent of lives threatened by cervical cancer are being saved when 90 per cent is an achievable figure. Many of the 350 women who die of cervical cancer every year have never had a smear test. Tragically, over three-quarters of all deaths from cervical cancer occur in women over 50, the group with the lowest rate of pap smears. There are other problems also in the program.</PARA>
<PARA> The evaluation committee believes that a much better directed and efficient cervical cancer screening effort could be achieved by addressing the issues of recruitment, recall and follow-up, quality control, management of abnormal smears, laboratory costs and monitoring data collection and evaluation. Such an organised approach would not only save double the number of lives, it is estimated, but cost less than current government expenditure, which is extensive- I think some $125m a year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government as a result will undertake extensive consultations on proposals outlined in the report to improve Australia's cervical cancer screening efforts. Implementation of such a coherent strategy is regarded as an absolute priority, and I believe that by next March, when all health Ministers meet to consider this matter, the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Brian Howe, will be in a position to inform them of a better directed strategy which will help prevent the needless loss of the lives of so many Australian women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the comments now made by Mr Howard and Mr Hewson in identifying as an area of excessive growth the area of executive salaries. I hope that it is a salutary lesson to them that before they knee jerk out of prejudice into calling for restraint from the sector of the work force that has exercised restraint they should in future review the evidence impartially of where restraint has been practised and where it has not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I quoted yesterday from a Cullen Egan Dell Australia Pty Ltd survey of the percentages of increase in executive level remuneration compared with that of wages. I wish now to table in the Senate some tables of further evidence of problems with excessive executive level salary growth. This is evidence culled from 23 annual reports of the largest companies in Australia. They show that the total directors' remuneration for this group of companies, comparing performance in 1988 and 1989, was $245m all told, which was 16.5 per cent more than the previous year. This compares to a growth in average weekly earnings of 7.4 per cent for the same period.</PARA>
<PARA> This establishes that an average increase for directors of holding companies in 1989 was more than 22 per cent. It shows that four of the 23 companies reduced executive remuneration in the period, three were at the same level as for ordinary workers or less, but 16 of the companies were higher than the rates paid to the ordinary work force. In four of the 23 companies, directors' remuneration rose by 50 per cent; in 12 of the 23 companies directors got increases of more than 20 per cent; and the total remuneration for the 10 highest paid executives of the 23 companies rose by more than 17 per cent, to nearly $110m all up, between the years, as I have said, 1988 and l989.</PARA>
<PARA> I have heard Mr Howard talk about the need to restrain executive level incomes, but some of the reports are quite confusing. It is not clear whether he is proposing to do that by wrapping it into the national wage case when it is held and therefore obtain some ruling, if he is able to, to do away with the leave loading compulsorily. But if he is proposing that, we would be looking at, on the one hand, a compulsory removal of the benefit for workers while, on the other hand, whispering sweetly into the ears of executives that they should volunteer to forgo executive remuneration. I do not think that is a level of equal treatment. But I am not quite sure whether Mr Howard is saying that because, in other interviews that I have heard from him, he seems to be saying that this should be negotiated on a plant by plant basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and concerns the proposal to increase the tax on Australia's livestock industries to 100 per cent of the cost of abattoir inspection services in contrast to the 60 per cent the industry currently pays. I remind the Minister that this decision will be borne by the sheep and cattle industries, which are already experiencing severely depressed returns. Is the Minister aware of the May 1988 statement `Primary industries and resources: Policies for growth', where it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In recognition of the national benefit attained through inspection of both export and domestic products the Government will continue to meet a proportion of the costs.</PARA>
<PARA>I also ask the Minister, in light of the already financially struggling primary industry sector, and in light of its previous commitment: will the Government reconsider the introduction of this tax and honour its policy by maintaining at least the current contribution of 40 per cent of the cost base of abattoir inspection services?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to Dr Hewson if I called him Mr Hewson. I am sure that that is not a monumental offence, but I apologise. What I understand Senator Bjelke-Petersen to be asking is that ordinary Australian taxpayers should pay for an inspectorial service at abattoirs to guarantee the quality to export level of carcasses that are being exported there for the purposes of returning a dividend to the agents or to the farmers. The question being addressed therefore is: Is it right that those who receive an income from the inspectorial service because of their ability to sell at higher quality or higher levels into other markets should pay, or should taxpayers pay part of what Senator Bjelke-Petersen calls a tax? In the circumstances the Australian Government has decided to phase in full cost recovery to the users of the service, so that the users pay rather than the broader Australian electorate. I think that that is a reasonable thing to do and in the circumstances I do not have anything else to add to the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I refer him to the aircraft accident report of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation on 5 January 1990 involving a Qantas 747 jet flying from Sydney to Singapore on 1 June 1989 in which 65 people were injured. I ask the Minister: Firstly, is it true that the aircraft was out of control for two to three minutes before the captain and the first officer regained control? Secondly, is it true that the incident was primarily due to a chronic fault in the plane's autopilot system which had not been repaired despite having malfunctioned on several previous occasions? Thirdly, is it true that the flight crew were not aware of these previous malfunctions despite a common practice for flight crews to acquaint themselves with an aircraft's history? Fourthly, is it true that the situation was worsened by a delayed and inappropriate response by the aircraft's flight crew? Finally, in light of this, what action has the Civil Aviation Authority taken to ensure that a similar combination of error and fault will not again threaten the lives of passengers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer each one of those five questions in order. The answer to the first part of the question is no, it is not true that the aircraft was out of control for two to three minutes. I will explain that by answering part 4 in a minute which in fact is a repeat of that question whether the incident was worsened by an inappropriate response from the captain and first officer. The aircraft was not out of control for two to three minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Was it true that the incident was caused by a chronic fault in the autopilot that had not been repaired? No, that assertion is not true, either. It is a fact that the autopilot on board the 747, which is an extremely complex piece of equipment, had had an intermittent fault in it previously, but it is not true that it had not been repaired. The autopilot had in fact been checked out as serviceable before the flight. I might add that these autopilots on board these aircraft are incredibly complex pieces of equipment which is why 747s carry three autopilot systems, that is, one system and two backup systems, because of their complexity and because they do fault from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> Is it true that the flight crew were not aware that the equipment had malfunctioned despite a common practice of air crew making themselves familiar with the maintenance history of aircraft? Frankly, I do not understand that question because air crew, particularly in companies with large flights, routinely move from shift to shift from aircraft to aircraft. There is absolutely no requirement on the flight crew to have any knowledge at all of an aircraft's maintenance history. Before the flight the air crew accept an aircraft with an engineering clearance which in fact certifies that that aircraft is in every respect airworthy and ready for flight. There is no responsibility on the flight crew to be aware of any malfunction on any aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> The fourth part of the question was in fact a repeat of the first one-whether the incident was exacerbated by a delayed and an inappropriate response by the captain and first officer. The answer to that question is also that that is untrue. The flight crew in fact behaved very promptly and with the proper action. What they did when the autopilot malfunctioned was to immediately transfer the aircraft to manual control. When the aircraft was under control they then switched in a second autopilot system.</PARA>
<PARA> The fifth part of the question was whether the Civil Aviation Authority has taken appropriate action to ensure that this does not happen again. The answer to that question is that I do not know. It is obvious from my answer that I have received the initial report on this incident from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigations. But I have not had time yet to speak to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about what action they have taken but I will. I would expect to find out, as I have on previous occasions, that the CAA on this occasion, and because of the seriousness of the incident and the injuries that occurred, has done what it normally does, that is, taken whatever action is appropriate. But I will, of course, personally check that and advise the senator of the answer to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I ask the Minister about a press conference he gave in Islamabad on Sunday, 5 August-three months ago. Did he not directly address the question of the Australian sale of 50 Mirage aircraft to Pakistan? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Pakistan newspaper Dawn the next day which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans admitted on Sunday that the 50 mothballed Mirages that were to be delivered to Pakistan by Canberra within six months from April 1990 when the contract was signed by the two countries would now be supplied sometime early next year.</PARA>
<PARA> Answering a question at a Press conference here on Sunday, the Australian Foreign Minister clearly attempted to play down the reasons for the delay in the delivery, but could not completely satisfy those who thought the slippage was somehow linked to the Indian objections to the deal.</PARA>
<PARA>Having alienated India one week he was alienating Pakistan the next. Will the Minister explain how both the Indian External Affairs Minister and the press of Pakistan came to understand the same matter, that is, the matter denied yesterday by the Minister in Senate Question Time that he communicated to the Indian Government that the supply of Mirage aircraft would be delayed until 1991?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess all I can say is that what I said at the press conference did not translate too well into Urdu, because I certainly did not say in those terms that the aircraft would now be supplied next year. In fact, because it was drawn to my attention, I did see that report in the Dawn newspaper a day or so later, and it led to me to remark that the newspaper ought be renamed the `False Dawn' in light of that particular report. It just misunderstood the point that I made, which was exactly the same point that I made in India publicly and privately and that I retailed yesterday, namely, that there was no question of any new agreement to have delivery delayed until early in the new year. There was no question of any undertaking or assurance that the delivery be delayed until early 1991. It was just a question of it being assumed by me and by the Australian Government that it would be likely that the delivery would be delayed until then because of the absence of movement until that point on behalf of the Pakistani Government. People do get things wrong, as I think even Senator Teague in his least charitable moments would acknowledge.  The detail of that particular position was simply not accurately reported.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer to his answer to Senator Childs's question on the Convention on the Rights of the Child when he used in support of the Government's position the accession of the Holy See to the convention. However, when acceding to the convention, the Holy See actually made several reservations, one of which in respect of parental rights was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . that it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Holy See-</PARA>
<PARA>interprets the articles of the Convention in a way that safeguards the primary and inalienable rights of parents, in particular insofar as these rights concern education, religion, association with others and privacy.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of that, is it fair for the Government to go around quoting the Holy See in support of its position, unless the Government intends to make those reservations? Is the Minister aware that, aside from some outlandish reasons given both for support and opposition to the treaty, there have been valid questions raised by informed critics of the convention which do require Government consideration, clarification and action? Would the Minister agree that tabling the Rights of the Child Convention in this Parliament almost a year after it was made in New York is not a satisfactory situation, particularly when at present there is no opportunity for this Parliament to debate it?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3619" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the latter point, to my knowledge the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been subject to exhaustive discussion within Estimates committees over several years. It seems to me that there honourable senators have had more than adequate opportunity to acquaint themselves with the terms of the convention and with the process which led to it being formulated in the way in which it was finally put forward for signature and ratification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the role of the Holy See and its note accompanying the accession of the Holy See to the convention, it is true that it indicated its understanding of the convention as requiring the pre-eminent role of the family to be properly recognised. That accords very much with the Australian Government's position. I anticipate that when the Australian Government ratifies the convention, should it do so, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It would be surprising were that not the case, given the fact that Australia inserted article 5, meaning that for the first time in the international community a document was open to ratification which recognised that pre-eminent role of the family, parents or legal guardians in giving guidance and direction to children in accordance with their evolving capacities.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine is correct to say that there are those who support the convention, such as the Catholic Bishops in Australia, who nevertheless say that it requires certain action to be undertaken by governments. If it is to be more than a sham or a public relations exercise, certain steps need to be taken, in particular in relation to the care of homeless children in our community. For example, it would be quite wrong for the Australian Government to ratify this convention and not follow up the Burdekin report, the report of the national inquiry into homeless children, which brings to the attention of all of us the plight of the homeless and destitute children in our society who are without the care and protection, the nurture and security, of a normal family household. I acknowledge Senator Harradine's point. There are those of goodwill in the community who support the convention but see it as a challenge to the community, and one which I hope the Australian and State governments, community organisations, voluntary groups and individuals will take up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Somewhere amongst this mass of papers I have sighted the Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts inquiry into drugs in sport. From the outset, while there are matters in the report with which I disagree-and I propose to do so in the most gentle way possible, by way of modest chiding-from my superficial reading this document appears to be a serious attempt by the Government to respond to a very important report which has had a substantial and perhaps profound effect on the drug taking ethos in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a refreshing change from the first blush of frivolous irresponsibility, uttered by presumably an inexperienced and new Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) who, in pursuit of seeking to attract votes from the sporting sector, claimed in a most disgracefully irresponsible way that we had rather gone over the top in our concern about drugs in sport in Australia. It did not matter that just some weeks before she made that grossly irresponsible statement a young man by the name of Ferranti had died an agonising death by taking the sorts of drugs about which Mrs Kelly was claiming our concerns had gone over the top. </PARA>
<PARA> She compounded that by making some other crass comments suggesting that 20 of the athletes who had tested positive were appealing. I rang the Minister's office, curious to know the names of these 20 athletes, to be told that they were not available, least of all to me so that I could pour a bucket on them. The Minister hardly understands the processes of parliament, nor does she understand the propriety with which I deal with these matters. I put that statement in writing to confirm what had been said and as events transpired, none of those cases were subject to appeal; she had just got that muddled up like everything else. I can only hope that the Minister is now getting better advice. I rather think that the Minister, Mrs Kelly, suffers from an acute sense of inability and a lack of knowledge of her portfolio, which seems to be seeping through to all the other portfolios which she dares touch. </PARA>
<PARA> I was equally disappointed by the comments made during the inquiry by Mr John Brown, who, as I recall, was at one stage the Minister in charge of sport and who, as Minister, was responsible for the appointment of some people to senior positions in the Australian Institute of Sport. He was outrageous enough to claim that the inquiry had done great damage to sport in Australia. The report, of course, had highlighted the problem, highlighted the fact, that Australia was not immune to the conduct that was taking place in the international arena of sport. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the actions of relevance known to have been taken since the inception of the Committee's inquiry into drugs in sport. It is documentation of action taken since the interim report was brought down, and primarily as a result of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the role of the officials. When the first interim response was made by the Commission, even the Minister was sufficiently concerned when he read what he judged to be a very superficial and totally inadequate response that he wrote back to the Commission and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Ultimately, I will be called upon to respond to the final report when it is tabled in Parliament. Because of the intense publicity and community interest in the findings of the Black Committee, its conclusions and recommendations will be closely scrutinised. I may well be called upon to defend the actions of the Committee in response to the interim report and I would appreciate your assistance in ensuring that I am able to do so convincingly. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that following the first inadequate effort of the ASC to respond to the findings. That demonstrates that Senator Richardson had great anxiety about having to come into this place to defend the Australian Sports Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's findings were based on the most remarkable premises, one of which was that Miss Jane Flemming provided her evidence in camera. I find these the most unrelated, irrelevant premises on which to make a recommendation, but it is alleged quite improperly that she came before the Committee voluntarily to provide this information. She provided it in camera, which was at her request. She considered that the Committee's attitude was to treat her as guilty until proved innocent. In fact, she came before us ultimately when she knew that Mr Merv Kemp, a coach from the AIS, was to appear before us the next day to tell us what he knew. He had bothered to tell her that he was to tell us what he knew. This prompted her to come rushing to us to make sure that she told us what she thought she knew. That was her reason for appearing before us, and not an unreasonable one, I might say. She went on to say that we treated her as guilty rather than innocent. I have to say that we made no judgment. The facts were given to us and we contemplated and reflected upon them at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, by way of mitigation, she was greatly disturbed by her appearance before the Committee. I have no doubt she was. I have to say that I was pretty disturbed when I heard what she had to say. But none of those matters, in my view, lead to the response of the Australian Sports Commission. The truth of the matter is that Miss Flemming did not volunteer her evidence. In fact, she was particularly reluctant to give her evidence and in the circumstances, given what the evidence was to be, we could all understand her reluctance to provide it. For instance, she said, when talking about Maurie Plant, the man who asked her to make the substitution:</PARA>
<PARA>Maurie Plant . . . is a friend of mine, too, so I would not have said anything about this but I know that Merv was going to say something tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, she was not going to say anything because Maurie Plant was a friend of hers. This was the man who was supposed to have coerced her, stood over her, intimidated her and reduced her to a nervous wreck, which compelled her then to give a urine sample. She was talking about him as a dear friend whose activities she was concerned to have made public. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, when she was asked what she had done when she was contacted by the Australian Athletic Union, she said that she did nothing about it-`They wrote to me once and did nothing about it'. I asked whether that was because she did not respond, and she said, `Yes, that is right'. I asked, `What is their attitude?'. She said, `I do not know what it is'. But I give her credit for saying that in this evidence, as distinct from what she said publicly. The Chairman commented:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not see any differences between cheating and providing the wherewithal to allow someone else to do it, so you are in the same boat . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She said:</PARA>
<PARA>No, neither do I, but you have to understand the situation that I was in. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise those points because I think that it is important to understand that Jane Flemming came to us with a great deal of reluctance. Primarily she appeared because, as she said in her evidence, she knew that Merv Kemp was to appear the next day. I asked what was the reason for telling us. She said, `Merv Kemp is going to say something and I just wanted to be able to tell you what the story was from first-hand knowledge'. Any suggestion she came to us voluntarily is quite untrue. In fact, when she was asked in public about her knowledge of urine substitution, she said that she did not have any first-hand knowledge at all. The only reason that the matter came to light was that Merv Kemp, a coach at the Institute, learning second-hand and accidentally of the activities, wrote to the Australian Athletic Union; and one might well ask what it did about it. That is a pretty simple but sorry story, too. The union wrote to us and explained how Mr Kemp's letter was discussed at length. This is its response in respect to the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA>Miss Flemming declined to comment on the matter other than to say that she had produced a sample. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Miss Flemming advised that she would not put anything in writing regarding this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that Miss Flemming was not prepared to make any further statement and the British Board categorically stated that the identity of athletes at all testings under their jurisdiction was never in doubt, the Board of Management of the Australian Athletic Union at its 17th meeting in June, 1987 resolved not to proceed with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the problems that arose with Miss Flemming not prepared to make a written statement, a mail vote of the Associations conducted at the time amended the law regarding investigations to read:</PARA>
<PARA>``If the person or club or association concerned fails to respond to the request for a Statutory Declaration within the specified time, the person, club or association shall be suspended forthwith until such time as a response is received''. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the action that the Australian Athletic Union had to take because Jane Flemming refused to cooperate, refused to give it evidence. So let us not have it any other way. That is where the matter rested. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the Australian Sports Commission seems to be more concerned with justifying its position than with anything else. It says that we treated Miss Flemming in an unkind way. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The ASC questions the purpose of the Committee's recommendations that the ASC considers its response to Miss Jane Flemming's part in the alleged urine substitution incident. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that a very senior member of the Australian Institute of Sport-in fact, the head coach of track and field-had written to us and had said that the evidence that Jane Flemming gave us in respect of himself was thoroughly untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> The head coach in the track and field area had written to us. He said that the evidence Jane Flemming gave us in respect of him was thoroughly untrue. He alleged that she had told lies before the Committee. I do not have a view about that; I do not have the knowledge. What I do have is conflicting evidence. We suggested to the ASC that it might inquire into that matter because it is germane to Miss Flemming's integrity, the integrity of Mr Rice and the integrity of the investigation. Finally, the ASC notes that there was no urine substitution. It is my guess that that is the case, but I have to say that that is not a mitigation for Miss Flemming because on the very day she appeared before us she still understood that the substitution had taken place, notwithstanding the fact that her best mate, Plant, was alleged to have poured the urine down the drain. He just had not told her for two years that he had done it, which really begs the question, does it not?</PARA>
<PARA> Another matter was raised by the Australian Sports Commission. It stated that it noted the alleged incident did not breach any IOC or IAAF regulations; that is, the International Olympic Commission or the International Amateur Athletic Federation. It went on to say that the Commission has expressed that it is appalled at the findings of the Committee towards Miss Flemming. </PARA>
<PARA> That to me sums up the attitude of the Australian Sports Commission. What it does not go on to say, and what it is silent about, is that every scholarship holder at the Australian Institute of Sport is required to sign a code of ethics wherein, inter alia, they agree to abide by both the rules and the spirit of the sport. I would have thought at least it might have said that Miss Flemming's conduct was deficient in terms of her moral obligation to the taxpayers and to the good name of the Australian Institute of Sport, notwithstanding that at the time it was not an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> That begs the question: Why was an attempt to substitute urine not an offence? The reason was that it had never occurred to any official that it would ever happen. The athletes have adopted much more sophisticated techniques since Miss Flemming's day. Now they directly inject somebody else's urine into the bladder; they do not do the sloppy stuff and the risky stuff of substituting samples. That is the reason it was not an offence. As soon as it became known, as soon as it was a revelation, the rules were changed. Frankly, simply to cry out that a person had not committed an offence sums up the Commission's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Flemming had done nothing illegal, but there was no contemplation about whether it had been immoral. That was further highlighted by Brian Roe, the Chairman of Athletics Australia's Doping Control Commission. He stated that Jane Flemming had committed no offence, had done nothing wrong and should not suffer any penalty. Technically he is right, but surely morals have something to do with sport in Australia as has sportsmanship, goodwill, fairness, and not cheating. That is where the matter really rested. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all of us, I regret that Miss Flemming responded to the public findings of the report in the way she did. I put it down to very poor advice by people she ought not to turn to in future. To put it the way she did, to suggest that she had done nothing wrong, to suggest that she was innocent, and to suggest that the Committee had done badly by her, did her no credit whatsoever. If she had responded differently and the Australian Sports Commission had responded properly, my view is that this matter would have died a very long time ago and Miss Flemming would not have found herself subject to unfortunate and ongoing publicity. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it outrageous that Mr Plant concedes a potential error of judgment. It was not an error of judgment to go to an Australian athlete and ask her to help him to cheat, to help him to conspire with another athlete for the purpose of allowing her to cheat! According to Mr Plant, that was not an error; it was simply a potential error of judgment. It seems to me that an error is never committed until the fix is properly on. I was pretty disappointed again with Mr Roe, when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Maurie was placed in a situation where he could only see athletics and Australia being damaged and he panicked. It was not premeditated. It was a knee-jerk reaction which was properly reversed. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it absolutely remarkable that any official who thinks one of our athletes will get caught for cheating, testing positive, immediately rushes off to try to fix the test to ensure it does not happen because he is worried about Australia's reputation. That is a remarkable attitude to morality, particularly coming from a very senior sports official in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it regrettable that that matter has been compounded by Neil King, the General Manager of Athletics Australia. He said that because Plant had indicated that he did not subvert the collection or testing process it was probably reasonable to classify this as a potential error of judgment. I do not think it is helpful to sport in Australia to have the General Manager of Athletics Australia agree, because he had not actually got away with the cheating, that it was only a potential error of judgment. I rather wonder what would happen to a bank thief who botched the job. I suppose he would get off because it was only a potential error of judgment-he had not actually got the money. I find that very sad. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Plant is no longer to be an official of the Australian teams, but he is now the International Amateur Athletic Federation's delegate on the circuit, so he has very close and ongoing contact with Australian officials, whether that be right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other matters which time, regrettably, will not allow me to pursue on this occasion. By and large, with some exceptions, I think that the report is objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In my view, the report tries to apologise for the Australian Sports Commission for the way in which it handled this matter. No doubt there will be another letter to the President by Mr Harris saying that he has been defamed and he wants to recommit his own words to Hansard. Frankly, his attitude has been thoroughly unhelpful to the Committee, thoroughly unhelpful to the ASC, and thoroughly unhelpful to the athletes for whom he has to carry some responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of matters that I would quickly like to go to. I congratulate the Government on its response, even if it is almost derelict in the time it is taking to introduce legislation to set up the Australian Sports Drug Agency as an independent statutory body with its own Board divorced and removed from the clutches of the Australian Sports Commission. A number of recommendations have not been taken up in terms of its wider terms of reference, but I will discuss those on another day. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Mr Haynes and I congratulate that body which has played a very important role in cleaning up drugs in Australia and has given decent, honest, drug-free athletes in this nation an opportunity to run on their merits and to be found to be running on their merits, because they are tested now and they are found to be innocent of any drug use. </PARA>
<PARA> One other quick matter I want to touch on is the question of the Privacy Act concerns. It was our recommendation that athletes who are found positive and are subject to funding, particularly by the Commonwealth, should have their names made public in an annual report. It was not to punish them, but it suggested that that will breach the Privacy Act. I will be interested to look at that. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens now apparently is that the Australian Sports Drug Agency tells the various sporting clubs and officials the penalties imposed but nobody is allowed to know about it. I wonder what happens if half a rugby team is found guilty of drug taking and does not appear on the field one day. I suppose there would be markers in their places saying, `Bill used to be here', but nobody needs to know why he is not allowed to be there. I am not certain what the mechanics of that will be, but no doubt it will be cleared up in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that professional sport in Australia has responded effectively, enthusiastically and genuinely to the Committee's recommendations. It is not without significance to note the way in which the Australian Rugby League dealt with the problems it had. It knew it had a problem with one particular club with the amount of marijuana being smoked and it fixed it. It was good to see the family of the young man who got caught for using I think cocaine which in the end, rather than going on with the facade of lawyers, appeals and court cases, stood up and said, `Enough is enough. We know that he has a drug problem. Let's fix it'. That ought to be the attitude of more people. In the case of the Australian Football League, we brought one matter to its attention. It did not procrastinate. It did not try to justify or deny it. With a phone call the man was gone and the matter fixed. It quietly got on with the job with no offence or difficulty; just a great deal of smooth, professional administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise another matter and that is the question of an appeals mechanism. In my view, Alex Watson would not have been dragged through the trauma and drama that he was dragged through if there had been a proper mechanism for sports men and women to adjudicate, look through the evidence and call witnesses. That recommendation has not been accepted by the Government. It suggests that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is the appropriate body to deal with such things. Frankly, I think it is reasonable, given the unique nature of sport and the activities that are carried on, to have some sort of appeals mechanism. Such mechanisms are divorced from sports per se. </PARA>
<PARA> The great difficulty-and I say this in perhaps the kindest way I can-is that sport in Australia, perhaps because of our small population, is so incestuous. The officials have either been coaches, they are coaches or they have close relationships with the athletes. If they are not their sons or daughters, their best mate is coaching them. There is a great temptation to feel sympathy for an athlete who finds himself in trouble. Therefore, there is a temptation to be subjective about how we deal with these athletes. If we have an independent body quite divorced and quite removed from the emotions of knowing athletes, training them, working with them, cheering for them and helping them, we are better able to make the right decisions in their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that a number of matters relating to State responsibilities have been taken up, not least the control, supply and administration of anabolic steroids. I found it rather cute when we first started the inquiry that it was an offence to give a racehorse a veterinary anabolic steroid but it was quite legal to give one to an athlete. However, I suspect that that has now been overcome by State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that the recommendation on weight-lifting is to be looked at by a committee of the Australian Sports Commission. I hope that it will be looked at because, quite frankly, I think the administration of weight-lifting in Australia absolutely stinks. It claims proudly that it has had no positive results because the moment it thinks it is going to get a positive it pulls the athlete out; he either goes bush or he does not go to the contest for which he has been trained. So by and large it can be claimed, in a rather perverse way, that the athlete has not been found positive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sadly. But her name has been mentioned again and again. As I understand it, she gave evidence in camera which has now been made public. It seems to me that raises the question for the Senate and the committees as to what should happen when evidence is given in camera. As I understand it, it is quite clear that it is a matter for the committee and indeed the Senate to use evidence and release evidence whether it is given in camera or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very reluctant to take in camera evidence for two reasons: firstly, if it is not used because it is heard in camera, I am not sure what good the evidence does for the committee or for the senator; and, secondly, if it is used, why was it taken in camera? It seems to me that one way over this might be that if anybody does give evidence in camera it should be made quite clear to that person that the evidence is likely to be used in public. If a committee, or indeed any member of the Senate, allows people to give evidence in camera, leaving them with the impression that the evidence will not be used, or alternatively failing to tell them that the evidence may be used, it would be fair for that person-if the evidence is used-to feel that an injustice has been done. Things ought to be made quite clear to any witness who comes before the Senate or a Senate committee. In other words, the Senate has the right to use that evidence, whether it is given in camera or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not dispute that but I do say that, as a matter of fairness to any witness, the rights of the Senate and the entitlement of the Senate to use that evidence should be made clear to everyone. Simply because a person has committed an offence, or is alleged to have committed an offence, should not make any difference as to the process used in respect of the evidence that he or she gives. If the process of warning people is to be used only because we think a person is beautiful, lovely and entitled to some sympathy, it is not much of a process. The real test of the validity of any process is whether it is used in respect of not only the good and the beautiful but also the allegedly bad and the ugly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me put Senator Crichton-Browne's interjection on the record. He said that everybody should be treated absolutely equally. I entirely agree with him. The case of Jane Flemming is an example we can use to discuss the issues that I have raised. Senator Crichton-Browne has quite rightly debated the issue of drugs in sport in Australia. He has done so on a number of occasions now and on each occasion with sincerity and cogency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not confine this to the statements that Senator Crichton-Browne has made but one of the problems we face in this chamber-and this may not be soluble-is that people's reputations can suffer and suffer quite severely because of the need for free and open debate. We ought to keep that in mind. We have tremendous power. We are able to speak without the laws of slander confining us or any other form of restraint except those we put upon ourselves. In those circumstances we should, as I think we do on most occasions, act responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Crichton-Browne said quite fairly, Jane Flemming committed no offence but the morality of the act perhaps was not as high as it might have been. Also, that happened some time ago. Fortunately, even criminals have a limit put on the penalty that they suffer. No matter what the degree of the crime, they usually have a limit put on the length of the sentence. At some time we must say, `All right. He or she-whoever has been accused-has expiated the offence or the moral turpitude that he or she has committed and we ought to look at the other side of the coin and see what contributions he or she has made'. Certainly, Jane Flemming has made great contributions not only to Australian sport but also to Australian life as a whole. I add that-and no doubt Senator Crichton-Browne will be very happy that I put that in-to balance any of the unintended effects that any speeches made in this chamber may have had on her character. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is difficult for Jane Flemming to put a view in this chamber. I suppose she could apply under the proceedings that we now have to have some statement put into Hansard. But in my view that is not the appropriate course to follow. If Jane Flemming has suffered any unearned damage to her character, it was certainly not the intention of anybody in this chamber. They are the points I wanted to raise. I will now let, as I understand it, Senator Michael Baume make another fine contribution to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under standing order 191 I would like to make an explanation about what has been said by Senator Cooney, who referred to what I said. I believe that he-I was going to say `accidentally' but there is a more sophisticated word-misunderstood what I was saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not freely using in camera evidence. Implicit in what Senator Cooney was saying was that I was introducing a whole range of new in camera evidence and there was some concern about that.  That is not the case. The in camera evidence that was used, with two or three very modest exceptions and just a few lines, was contained in the report. The reason it was taken in camera was that Miss Flemming had a great deal of very damaging hearsay evidence about other people. I have a golden rule about that, and that is that if we are going to hear it at all it must be heard in camera and it ought not ever be reported in a report whether it is in camera or on the public record. That is why it was taken in camera. </PARA>
<PARA> As there was a clear misunderstanding of what I said, I should also say that the witnesses who came before the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts were advised that it was not possible for the Committee to guarantee that the evidence that was given in camera would remain in camera, and that it was within the capacity of the Committee or the Parliament to so make it available. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no selective application of criteria in respect of those matters; it was more concern for other people and not the witness, who had, by her own admission, told at least, I think, a dozen people of the events. The information that Miss Flemming gave to us in camera was subsequently given to us by another witness in the first place or subsequently. I would not want it thought that I had misled the Senate. I would not want it thought that in my presentation I was giving the impression of having a view about Miss Flemming's conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said from the outset, this is a matter of concern to me not because of Miss Flemming's conduct but because of the incompetence and the mismanagement of the Australian Sports Commission and its failure to deal with the problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite prepared to have Senator Crowley bounce up and down like a yoyo every time I make some kind of remark about the Labor Party and the way it has conducted itself within its own ranks on this very important matter of drugs in sport. If the Labor Party wants to have internecine wars and if Senator Crowley wants to take up the cudgels here on behalf of the Labor Party, that is fine; that is her business. But there is a very important report before this chamber. I started my remarks by saying that I congratulate the Government on its response. I am saying that, however, there are some elements of that response which require examination because they do not fit in with what I believe is the otherwise generally high level of response by the Government in this report. These areas need examination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne pointed to one of them, concerning the question of a tribunal. I think the Government really should re-examine its outright rejection of the Black Committee's recommendations. Quite frankly, it seemed to me that had the Government taken a different view there might have been a prospect of Senator Black becoming the chairman of such a tribunal. He certainly would have had a depth of knowledge and a competence in the area that may have made him a suitable appointee. But the fact simply is that the Government has proposed not to give the powers to the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA), which will be doing drug testing. This is revealed on page 4 of the Government's response. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is proposed not to give ASDA certain functions specified in Interim 4, namely:</PARA>
<PARA>* developing sports drugs policies;</PARA>
<PARA>* liaising with law enforcement agencies, customs and health departments;</PARA>
<PARA>* adjudicating on penalties imposed by sporting federations; and</PARA>
<PARA>* conducting investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>It states that it is not to be, in effect, a tribunal. I think all of these matters should be re-examined by the Government. I do not think the argument advanced in this response is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Why on earth has the Government decided not to allow the ASDA-the organisation which will actually do the drug testing, which will be collecting all of the information and which will have a mine of information which will be unavailable to any other organisation in Australia-to participate in an operational way in developing sports drug policies? No-one in Australia will have the same depth of knowledge on this matter as the ASDA. Yet it is not to be allowed to develop sports drug policies. That strikes me as extraordinary. The reason for that is contained in the Government's response to the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes drug policy at Federal level is better handled by the Australian Sports Commission and liaison with other Federal, State and Territory authorities by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. National Sporting Organisations also have a role to play in imposing penalties and giving athletes a fair hearing. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply cannot agree with the Government's conclusion that in taking this position the Government is conscious of the need to separate the testing process from the broader issue of the policy of drugs in sport. I do not know why there is a need to separate those two functions. It is not established in the response. The Government response goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>It was decided to provide ASDA with a relatively narrow and virtually nondiscretionary role . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, as if there is some merit in giving it a non-discretionary role. This body, with the potential for having the greatest volume of information, knowledge and potential advice concerning drugs in Australia, is to be given a non-discretionary role and a very narrow role. I do not believe that is in the best interests of the athletes of Australia or of the sporting public of Australia-or, in fact, of those people who have a genuine concern to remove drugs from sport. The Government response continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The issues of `guilt' or `innocence', inadvertent or deliberate use, length of sanction, Commonwealth view of the appropriateness of the sanction and so on are therefore issues for government and non-government authorities other than ASDA. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This does not mean that ASDA will isolate itself from these broader issues. </PARA>
<PARA>But it is being prevented from playing an effective role in them. The ASDA, our drug testing agency, is to be a eunuch in a harem of drug takers. I find that to be absolutely extraordinary. I hope that the Government will re-examine that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not accepted recommendation 48, which is contained in the Committee's second report, that the ASDA should include in its annual report the names of athletes tested and results recorded, on the basis that it would infringe on the privacy principles in the Privacy Act. The legislation will provide that only those with a genuine need to know the results of positive tests will be informed; namely, the athlete, his or her national sporting organisation and the Australian Sports Commission in those cases where government funding is involved. It is an interesting change of morality. If a person is knocked off under the consumer affairs legislation that person will get his or her name in the paper, but if a person is knocked off for cheating on his or her opponents by taking drugs, under this arrangement that person will not get his or her name in the paper. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne interjects, if such a secret situation developed where an athlete was in fact suspended by his organisation but no information about that was revealed, it would be interesting to see how the sports commentators would explain why some high profile athlete was magically absent for a year. The fact is unless there are very strong sanctions-and the greatest sanction in this area is publicity-I believe the Government is not doing all it can to stop this insidious, awful, destructive and murderous trade in performance enhancing drugs. I regret that the Government has not taken what I believe to be appropriate action in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that I note in the Government's response to the report is that funds are to be provided to ensure that the international accreditation that our local drug testing operation has received is maintained. That accreditation is now assured of being maintained by our permitting the purchase of sophisticated equipment and training and participation in relevant International Olympic Committee (IOC) activities. As I have said, I commend the Government for its support for that. On behalf of the Opposition, I reiterate that our support for the war against drugs in sport would lead us to the view that we should support a similar situation, and we would be keen to ensure that such accreditation would be retained by the Australian drugs mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of an appeals tribunal, the Drugs in Sport report recommendation, as contained in the Government's response, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that such a tribunal be established ``to adjudicate on disputed drug tests and the penalties imposed by sporting federations on athletes testing positive for banned substances''. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that the tribunal should `have authority to investigate all sports drug matters' and `have access to all evidence presented to the Senate Drugs in Sport Inquiry, both public and in camera' and `should have powers approximating those of a Senate Committee to ensure that it can collect evidence, protect witnesses and inform the public'. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government says, the Committee clearly formed the view that an expanded tribunal was necessary and should have investigatory as well as appeals functions. The Government says, in response, that there is, of course, a conflict in one body having both an appeals and an investigatory role. I must say that that logic escapes me. It says that these matters are better handled by the sports themselves, where, in fact, there is often a genuine conflict between the desire and the need for maximum performance from the people representing that sport- particularly in international competition-and the desire to ensure that the sport is entirely drug free. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that in the great bulk of Australian sports that conflict has been satisfactorily resolved. It is only in a handful-and we have seen examples of them-that that conflict has not been satisfactorily resolved. Nonetheless, there is clearly a far greater potential for conflict of interest in the area where the Government has now decided this matter should reside than in the proposal of the Black Committee. I think the Government's response on that matter is not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that, as we look through the situation, there appears to be some need for an overall Federal authority of some kind to provide some sort of supervisory position to look at the way in which sporting bodies administer their anti-drug activities. I agree with the Government that it is basically up to the sporting bodies-particularly, of course, those linked with the International Olympic Committee, which has very strict rules on drug taking-to administer their own sports. But I believe there must be an ultimate authority to which people who are dissatisfied or concerned about the level of enthusiasm and the competence with which those inquiries by the sports are conducted can go if there are additional concerns. It is wrong for the Government to imply in its response that having a tribunal somehow precludes the other supervisory bodies within the sports themselves from proceeding. All it would do is ensure their good performance. There is also a question about the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but I do not have time to go into that at great length. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne says, in his view as a member of the Committee, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is not appropriately equipped to pursue it. The other matter that concerns me is that, if matters of ultimate penalty are left entirely to the sports concerned, there may well be a range of different penalties which may well not suit the Australian situation. Page 17, paragraph 69, of the Government's response states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While there are still some differences between sports at the international level, the Government agrees with Australian peak sporting bodies that these sanctions are appropriate. DASETT together with ASDA will work through international agencies to endeavour to achieve uniformity in these sanctions internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>They have not got them. There is no uniformity. If we have not got that uniformity, how irrelevant is the Government's response in paragraph 72, where it rejects the recommendation of the drugs in sport Committee that an independent tribunal should adjudicate on the penalties imposed by sporting federations on athletes testing positive for banned substances? The Government's response says:</PARA>
<PARA>National Sporting Organisations will assess individual cases but will not impose a suspension for a lesser period than that imposed by the sport's international body. </PARA>
<PARA>If we do not have uniformity, if we are still only endeavouring to reach it, it seems to me to be an irrational response to deny the recommendation of the drugs in sport Committee on this basis. The Government says not to worry about that because, as the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Sports will be required to abide by the ASC Doping Policy, which incorporates the mandatory sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>A breach will automatically bring into question the continued Commonwealth funding of that sporting body. </PARA>
<PARA>`Bring into question' does not necessarily involve an automatic or substantial sanction. I think there is scope for a more effective response from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the question of to whom does one make an allegation if one believes a sporting body has not acted effectively. We have heard the problems of people coming before the Black Committee. I believe they did not have an opportunity of going anywhere, basically, until the Black Committee started up. They often would not go to the sporting body concerned because it might involve an attack on, say, a sporting official of that body or there could be legal implications in their allegations. It seems to me that the Government's response on this score is not very good at all. At paragraph 79 the Government says:</PARA>
<PARA>The absence of a Tribunal mechanism will not stop athletes making accusations against fellow athletes. They will simply-</PARA>
<PARA>how is this for chaos and disorganisation-</PARA>
<PARA>address these accusations to different bodies-ASDA, ASC, AOC, ACGA or the relevant national sporting organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>And Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all. Unless there was a simple body where people knew they could go, where they could make their allegations and would not be subjected to the risks of response-particularly if they were complaining about someone who may well be a selector in the sport in which they are seeking to represent their country or State-then, obviously, they would be very reluctant to rock the boat. It is an unsatisfactory response of the Government to this report on that score. The Government's response goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Action that peak sporting bodies or National Sporting Organisations choose to take on allegations reported directly to them is entirely a matter for them. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is simply not satisfactory. I make no suggestion that the major sporting bodies are made up of anything other than people of total propriety, but we did notice in the report of the drugs in sport Committee that there were some sporting bodies which develop a reputation for a willingness to live with drugs in their sport. Under this arrangement action may not proceed if someone makes an allegation. Cover-ups are certainly not unknown and, as I said, were exposed by the Committee. Unless there is a tribunal people can go to, they have no guarantee-and the Government effectively admits that-that allegations soundly made will be properly looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we need some kind of body, particularly when one examines paragraph 80 in greater detail. Later on, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>They -</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the sporting bodies, and it is up to them what sort of decision they make-</PARA>
<PARA>would have to weigh up any proposed action, against their own constitution, agreements they have with the ASC, the peak sporting bodies and their international federations with respect to drugs, the reputation of their sport, and the possibility of legal action. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the serious problem. The sporting organisations may well not take action and may well not investigate allegations because of, as the Government admits, the possibility of legal action. Yet the Government will not agree with the report of the drugs in sport inquiry. The Government will not agree to institute a tribunal to give protection against the risk of legal action if one makes allegations in camera, if necessary; that is, private allegations which do not in fact publicly damage anyone. This Government has decided it will not provide that capacity to avoid the risks that matters may well not be properly examined, which the Government itself basically admits in paragraph 80. </PARA>
<PARA> A sport such as body building is not an International Olympic Committee (IOC) sport. It does not get government funding. What sort of supervision in terms of illegal and improper drug use will exist in that body-in that body in every sense-if there is no overall tribunal and, by the way, if the use of these drugs is to remain legal? I believe that is a major challenge for this Government which it has not yet accepted. The State Government of New South Wales is taking action, as I understand it, and I hope that this Government will proceed down that path. But it underlines the need for a more effective response to this section of the report. The Government says, `Oh, look, never mind. Don't you worry about that', as someone else might have said; it says in paragraph 81:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Commission and ASDA are to hold a national seminar of National Executive Officers of all National Sporting Organisations and peak sporting bodies to address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>So just as we did not have to worry about the economy of this nation because there was going to be an economic summit, and just as we did not have to worry about tax because there was going to be a tax summit, we are told not to worry about drugs in sport. We are told, `We have no structure that we can guarantee will mean allegations will be properly examined, but don't you worry about that; we will have another summit'. The Australian people are sick and tired of summits; they want action.</PARA>
<PARA> While I commend the goodwill and sincerity of the people who have recommended this course of action, I find it unacceptable. I am also concerned that one factor the Government has given as influencing its decision to reject the creation of a tribunal is its cost. A tribunal would consist of only four people, but the Government states:</PARA>
<PARA>With secretariat, office accommodation and other overheads this could be expected to add significant costs to the already considerable Commonwealth sports drug budget, particularly as other mechanisms (eg. administrative law) are in place and appeals can be greatly constrained through tight practices and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that, in order to save a few dollars in a multimillion dollar campaign against drugs in sport, we will not get the result which I believe would make this process watertight. I commend the Government for its campaign against drugs in sport, but it is running the risk of damaging the effectiveness of that campaign for the want of a few dollars in a questionable decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Australian Sports Commission for its internal responses to the Drugs in Sport report. The great bulk-in fact, I think all-of the serious matters that the Drugs in Sport report looked into related to issues from some years ago. There is no doubt that, as the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and the Sports Commission have responded in paragraph 125, legitimate criticisms were raised by the Committee which were relevant to current policy and procedures, and those procedures have been reviewed and tightened. Of course, the basis on which the criticisms of some years ago were made is now no longer sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> Other actions were taken by the ASC to reinforce procedures and policy already in place. For example, the drug testing program has been expanded and since 1988 has been administered independently. Another very important response has been that the Executive Director of the Australian Sports Commission now has the power directly to order blood tests on AIS athletes, and these tests are more specific and complete than those done by the ASDA on urine samples, for example. There has been an education program for all AIS athletes and procedures for purchase and prescription of medical supplies in the AIS have been strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a useful and commendable response, but I am still concerned about other bodies-for example, those that do not get Federal funding-and the extent to which there can be effective control by any tribunal or any government over drug taking. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Crichton-Browne said, the Australian Rugby League has taken a very up-front and, I believe, correct approach to protecting its own sport and its own sportsmen, because they are the people basically being protected by an anti-drug policy. While I recognise that the Sports Commission is quite entitled to be concerned that the rights of the athletes undertaking drug testing are protected and that all sporting organisations have regard to due process in applying sanctions to athletes returning positive tests, I believe nonetheless that testing should not be done in such a way that it allows someone who appeals against a positive test to be able to compete until the appeal is settled. There is no need, when an appeal system exists, for innocence to be maintained until the tribunal determines. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I commend the Government. I believe that one reason we need a tribunal is that international bodies, particularly in the Commonwealth and developing countries, say they simply cannot afford proper testing procedures. I do not think it is right that Australia should compete against people who are not playing the game, but I think the fact that there is such a range of confusion about what is acceptable and what is not means that we have to take a positive response. </PARA>

Senator Michael Baume made it quite clear that he deplores this. Later we find another point of disagreement between the two honourable senators opposite.

If it is possible that I have misunderstood Senator Crichton-Browne, of course I hope he knows that I did not intend to do that. But as I listened it seemed to me there was some disagreement between the two honourable senators opposite in terms of their assessment of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also true that many of us dealing with this Government response are handicapped by the fact that very few of us had the opportunity to hear the evidence of a very extensive and very effectual inquiry. Whatever else one might want to say about the drugs in sport inquiry it is quite clear that it put that headline on to the agenda for the Australian people and made it quite clear that drugs in sport were not acceptable. I think that is now a well understood and well held view by the Australian community-sporting and non-sporting. But I have to say that it is very difficult for us at this time to appreciate what it was like in the sporting arena, whether we go back to 1980 or to 1985, when, as honourable senators opposite have said, there were no clear definitions. Indeed, in some areas those definitions are still lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it of some concern that Senator Crichton-Browne wanted to suggest that it was not an offence, that it was not illegal, and that there was no law about it; however, we would want to get them under some kind of moral code. Certainly, there are times when people's actions quite clearly flout what is a commonly held standard which we might want to call a moral or ethic value held by the community. But one should not stand in this place and say that an athlete or official should stand condemned because he or she can conclude that no action can take place, that nothing illegal was done, and that there was not an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should hasten very cautiously into practising moral judgment on people when the law is not defined, when what is meant by a drug is not defined, when what is meant by an offence of action is not defined and when all the other things that I will come to in a minute are not defined either. I simply say to Senator Crichton-Browne that we should hasten slowly before we leap to judgment, particularly when there is no law to offend against. That was one of the problems and one of the great challenges of the inquiry. To the extent that it has produced those two reports it has handled it splendidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The report pointed out that those definitions were needed. It needed to make clear the community standard that this sort of practice is not acceptable any more. But saying that means that we then have to proceed to what those definitions are. What is an illegal practice? What is an offence? What is punishable? What are the punishments? A lot of that work remains to be done and I certainly want to go on the record as saying that I think we should hasten slowly in these areas. Let us have the definitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume referred to the rugby team in New South Wales. As I understand it from Senator CrichtonBrowne's contribution-I do not understand the full examination of it-the drugs in question turned out to be marijuana and cocaine. As far as I know, there is very little evidence to say whether they are performance enhancing or performance reducing drugs. </PARA>

But I think that what we are very confused about here is whether we are going to a general moral standard about the use of drugs in the community or whether we are talking about the unfair practices in sport when people are using performance enhancing drugs. One of the other appalling things is that lots of drugs have never been documented as performance enhancing. There is a sort of sucking-in of breath and then a gasping at how wicked people are to use drugs and yet there is no evidence that they have actually enhanced performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not quite understand what people are wanting to get upset about here, but I prefer to work on data and evidence and hasten slowly into judgment. In fact, many people are flying on moral outrage. I think it is a very dangerous background from which to start suggesting codes of behaviour. There is no evidence at all whether some of these drugs are actually performance enhancing. `It's a good idea, everybody else is doing it, let's have a shot'. Did it improve performances? Did we see any times drop?</PARA>
<PARA> What we have, as I understand it-Senator Crichton-Browne could no doubt help me on this-is clear evidence that some of the steroid drugs in particular have been performance enhancing and that is not in doubt. I do not know whether that has been very accurately or very properly documented. I think we conclude that people on these drugs were putting themselves at an advantage which in the sporting arena is called unfair. As Senator Michael Baume said, it is not playing the game. In colloquial language it is cheating. It is sailing against the wind of commonly understood practice. On the other hand, if we were in the field of athletics and it was said that everybody was doing it, where would we stand if we did not then put ourselves in an equal opportunity situation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr Acting Deputy President. I feel that in looking at this Government response what we have is a point that Senator Crichton-Browne, as I understood it, wanted to endorse, that is, a clear move to establish the Australian Sports Drug Agency as a separate clear entity, relocated away from the Bruce campus of the Australian Institute of Sport, as well as the creation of an advisory group having broad representation including one Australian Sports Commission board member. In particular, it will be able to conduct research, select sports people for drug testing, collect samples, dispatch samples to an International Olympic Commission (IOC) accredited laboratory, receive results and report the results to the appropriate sporting federation and the ASC where Commonwealth funding is provided to the person concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was proposed that it should not have the following functions: developing sports drugs policy; liaising with law enforcement agencies, Customs and health departments; adjudicating on penalties imposed by sporting federations; and conducting investigations. This did not mean, according to the Government's response, that the Government had failed to address these issues, but it made decisions about where those functions were more appropriately addressed. The Government, in its report, says that drug policy at the Federal level is better handled by the Australian Sports Commission. I do not think that anyone would deny that that is a very appropriate role for the Australian Sports Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The point needs to be made that that kind of separation and clear outline of what ASDA's task is and what its task is not allows for more appropriate, specific and accurate functioning of such bodies. I think it is particularly necessary in this time because of the history in this arena over the last decade-certainly it is near enough to a decade. Those are the very points to which I was alluding before in terms of definitions. The definitions may go to what is a drug, when is a medication a drug and how far before or after a performance can a medication or a drug be used without offending or contravening the drug laws. Those definitions all need to be made very clear. That will be an ongoing process as new medications, new procedures and new techniques emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> If I understood what Senator Crichton-Browne said, athletes have already found ways to circumvent the collection of urine for testing. I suppose that is a very good example of why there needs to be an organisation charged with not only the ongoing `keeping an eye out' role but also increasing and extending the definition role. There are other things that need to be defined. What is the sports drugs policy, what are the arrangements with law enforcement agencies and what are the appropriate penalties? All of those things need to be appropriately defined and the responsibility of the Australian Sports Commission and not ASDA. I do not think that would contravene the intent of the drugs in sport report at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that concerns me greatly is the problem of in camera evidence, which has been raised both in this Committee and in a number of other places. I think Senator Crichton-Browne would appreciate that from time to time I have been very concerned at remarks made about this report precisely because I think they sail very close to contravening the respect and rights of people's privacy. I have had the experience, on various Senate committees I have been on, of the value of being able to take in camera evidence which I might say applies very infrequently. An example was hearing in camera evidence from the Australian Federal Police in the inquiry into Australian Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, which was clearly an appropriate use of the in camera provision to take evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have much dispute with what Senator Cooney had to say, but I do feel that evidence once taken in camera-even if properly advised to the witness that it may indeed be ordered to be released at some later time-should be regarded with the greatest respect, and orders to release that evidence or to make it public ought to be done only under the most serious of circumstances and with considerable justification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of such concern or such gravity that you are suggesting, Minister, that it would be perhaps more properly the matter for the full Senate, and indeed it may well be. I take that interjection and thank the Minister. Certainly, the problem for the Committee which I now chair is that evidence taken in camera and ordered to be released is now ordered on a subsequent motion not to be further released by the Committee. We more than understand that the bird once flown cannot be brought back; that evidence out in the public record is not able to be made not public. That is not the question of dispute. The Committee's intent is to say what we regard is the status of in camera evidence. Other people may have access to that information now it is out there. The Committee still wants to indicate how seriously it regards in camera evidence and how infrequently it would want to order that release. So it has made that clear statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very pleased to have the Government's response to this drugs in sport inquiry because I hope the debate and emphasis to this point will shift away from what Senator Crichton-Browne called `the unfortunate and ongoing publicity being attached to certain athletes'. I would very much support the cessation, certainly in this place, of unfortunate and ongoing publicity. I would hope that we could move to addressing what is contained in the Government's response to this matter, that is, addressing the issues rather than individual athletes in this place and that the processes can be set up following that report and its recommendations in the Government's response. The Senate inquiry ought not confuse its role with proceeding to carry on as though we were in danger of becoming an executive arm of government because that is not the appropriate role for a Senate committee. It is for the Committee to take the evidence and to put the issues on the public record. Indeed, I think the drugs in sport inquiry did that splendidly, and that is not in dispute. But I think the history of that whole thing now is overtaken by the Government's response to the report. We should be focusing on this report and whether or not we feel the Government's response is sufficient to the task. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to some of the things Senator Michael Baume said, I would have thought that there will be a need to review the processes into the next year or two to see whether indeed the best response by Government to that report and its recommendations is sufficient, more than sufficient, or will need modification. I would not think it unusual-particularly in this area where so much is still awaiting clear definition-that an ongoing monitoring role will be the only appropriate response by Government further to its response here. But having set mechanisms in place, it is going to be very concerned-as I understand the Minister and the Government-to see that those mechanisms do what is expected of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I take some issue with the honourable senators opposite in their complaining about the Government's failure to respond to recommendation for the setting up of a tribunal to take appeals. Paragraph 74 in the Government's response reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The final category of potential investigations is perhaps the most difficult of all. Advocating drug usage or alleging drug usage has no relationship to a positive drug test. It therefore does not fall within the tight procedures that have been developed for testing and for the application of sanctions resulting from positive tests. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there are lots of areas for if not illegal then certainly harassing or intimidatory behaviour that athletes, sports people, coaches or whoever would properly want an appeal against, but they would not want to go through the appeal mechanism that pertains properly and appropriately to drug testing. The questions concern different issues and they do not in any way deal with the mechanisms and the methodology for the drug testing procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think that the Government's response has actually picked up the need for different mechanisms to deal with the different nature of complaints. These need to be understood as very serious complaints, particularly in the light of what I said earlier that so many athletes and sports people do actually make a considerable contribution to their lifetime's earning by their performances as sports people. We are particularly addressing here elite sports people. While I know that there is concern about drug usage amongst community sports people and at the recreational level, this report and the whole thrust of the inquiry were to concentrate on the drug usage by sports people at the elite level. Those sports people can expect a considerable financial return from their performances. So one would have to appreciate the very significant consequences to them if their good name was smeared by accusations that they were using drugs or providing or promoting them. They are matters of the gravest concern. </PARA>
<PARA> In other areas of endeavour in our society, and in this place over time, I am sure that many senators have stood up to defend the rights of people to be protected under the law by having a clear definition of law and, as Senator Michael Baume said, to be presumed innocent. What I understood the honourable senator to say was that if a person were found guilty and then actually went through some kind of appeal mechanism, he or she should not be allowed to compete while guilty but under appeal. Again, we are into a very difficult and challenging area here, but certainly people who are found guilty in other courts of law and proceed to appeal do not in most cases serve that time between a guilty finding and appeal in gaol. They are judged to be citizens still able to use the law and have access to appeal mechanisms to further clear their name. It would be very unusual and indeed a very dangerous precedent to be setting different kinds of standards for practice in this arena where, until very recently and perhaps even still, some of these things are not defined as illegal offences or not even defined as offences. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to appreciate that in its response the Government has appreciated a whole series of levels of differences of appeal, of the different prospect of offences and in setting these mechanisms in place I think it is challenging the bodies with those responsibilities to make clear very quickly what the definitions are so that all the people in this arena will be clearer about how to proceed. None of it takes away from the clear commitment by Government and the community of Australia to abhor the use of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> `Drugs in sport' is a lovely set of words but it is very very difficult to know exactly what it means. What is a drug? When is it a drug? I have made that point before but I think we have to continue to make it. In particular, we might actually risk working out whether or not these things called drugs have any effect `positive or negative' on performance, and we might have to work out whether we are more outraged or whether it is more illegal if a person uses a performance enhancing drug that does enhance performance and at the same time creates a terrible risk against the good health of that person. What would we also say about drugs that, properly measured, do not enhance performance but do put a good person's health at risk?</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of health and good medical practice, we rarely forbid people to make choices even though those choices may be injurious to their own health, and in this area we should exercise the same proper caution about interfering too directly in the choices of people's lives. If, as I say, there were no measured performance enhancement but clearly there was medical damage, how do we recommend-that this person is not guilty of illegal behaviour, just foolish choice? In fact, there has been great confusion between what is legal and what is moral, so-called-it is undefined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not have similar rules; that is my point entirely. We need to make clear what these orders are. In some of these areas I note that we have even allowed the rights of privacy of patients under usual medical practice to be circumvented so as to make sure that the restricted people who need to know about the use of drugs will have access to that information. For me, being in the medical profession, and for anybody concerned about the protection of privacy, that is a very serious step. If it is judged to be necessary within the proper constraints I am sure that in monitoring it we will see that it works well. But we have to hasten very slowly in providing a different set of rules in this area, whether legal or moral, from those we have in other areas in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of points have been raised in this debate in times past that should not be canvassed over and over again. I sincerely hope that we can move away from what seems to be practising judgment on individual athletes and talk more to the principles on which we can allow the more appropriate other people, whether newly established committees or existing sporting organisations, to make those judgments about individual or team athletes or sports people. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my contribution I simply say that there is much grey in this area. While there is such a lot of grey, we should not be making black and white judgments. Senator Crichton-Browne alluded to the difficulties of sports people circumventing the testing procedure and, therefore, not being found guilty. Unable to be found guilty may have been a more accurate way of describing some of them, if I understood Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution. We have a clear example that a negative score does not equate with innocence. We also have evidence that positive scores do not necessarily equate with guilt. </PARA>
<PARA> While those two claims can be made in this area, we should look very closely at this Government response. We should appreciate that it has been a thoughtful response to an excellent inquiry. It is thoughtful because it has canvassed all the recommendations made by the Committee. It has taken account of them. It has not dismissed those recommendations; but it has said that it judges that the principle of those recommendations is better employed through different mechanisms or through a different committee. As I commented earlier, I am absolutely sure that our Committee will be interested to keep an eye on how the procedures set up under this Government response do achieve the intent of the drugs in sport inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief remarks about the Government response to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts inquiry into drugs in sport. On my brief reading of this document-as Senator Crowley and other honourable senators have said, the time we have had to look at the response has been short, even though the time which has been dedicated to it this afternoon is dragging on-the Government has clearly recognised the great contribution that this Committee made to the whole area of sports and the nasty aspects of drugs in sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This sort of inquiry is not a pleasant thing; it is not something that people enjoy participating in. We saw the incredible spectacle of the 100-metre sprint final in the Olympics, the sight of which raised the adrenalin level of people all over the world, and which was destroyed so soon after by the winner of the race being disqualified. That same feeling occurs when we see on television football teams dragged off in paddy-wagons with some of the team being found to have taken cocaine or marijuana. The same can be said of pentathletes and other athletes. It takes the gloss off a spectacle which is part of the Australian culture, where we look to our athletes-no matter in which sport they have their endeavours-and many of us aspire to have the same athleticism as they do. Those athletes encourage young people. They have a positive impact on Australian life, particularly on the lives of young people. The insidious drug problem in sport is not a popular subject and a committee does not enjoy looking into it. There is much controversy about this. When we bring prominent Australian athletes into the fray and they have their names mentioned so often in parliament, in public and across the newspapers, there is not a lot of good politics or friendliness about it. It is not a fun business. </PARA>
<PARA> As a new member of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, our new reference on the effects of tourism on the environment will be much more enjoyable, much less contentious and not as nasty as having to look into drugs in sport. However, the bipartisanship that was shown during the drugs in sport inquiry was unique and something to be aspired to. Some of that bipartisanship rubbed off on some of the members of that Committee. Senator Crichton-Browne's remarks that the conflict between the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Chairman of that inquiry, former Senator John Black, was an unfortunate byproduct of the Committee's excellent work were correct. I repeat: this work has been recognised by the Government having picked out so many of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley has stated that the report raised many issues about the legality and illegality of drugs. She said that there are many grey areas about what is punishable and what is not punishable within the area of drugs and sport. She also said that our Committee should be keeping an eye on this problem of drugs in sport, how the Government handles it and how the Government's response is implemented. As a new member of the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee, I argued that we should retain that reference on drugs in sport. Senator Crowley has really supported the arguments in the Senate today, even though she did not support the plea of the Liberal senators on that Committee, to maintain the drugs in sport reference as we watch the Government's efforts to respond to the report and to implement many of the points in this response that has been tabled. It is very unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, when we have a Prime Minister who has made it part of his political game to be seen wherever there is a winner-and even a Treasurer who goes to football games-it is not difficult to see why the Government, at the first meeting of the Committee in this new Parliament, got rid of the reference into the nasty stench over drugs in sport in Australia. That is unfortunate, but I am sure that the members of the Committee will keep an eye on this problem. I would have thought that with the drugs in sport reference maintained, we would be able to do that far more effectively. If we were able to keep that reference, we may have been able to clear up some of the grey areas and do more work in proceeding with the problems that Senator Crowley has raised about drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issues that have been raised this afternoon by some of my colleagues and some honourable senators on the other side of the chamber related to whether in camera evidence should be released. As Senator Crichton-Browne said, people giving in camera evidence are advised that the evidence may be released at some stage. Senator Crowley does not think that is a fair covenant to put on it and that no in camera evidence should be released. But that was the case and it is not unusual for in camera evidence to be released. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that should be made in relation to Jane Flemming's involvement and the unfortunate publicity that has surrounded her involvement in this inquiry is that there were implications of Senator Crichton-Browne having other than impeccable motives in relation to his treatment of the Jane Flemming incident. I think that Senator Cooney specifically referred to that. I think that it should be made a matter of public record, and should be widely understood by senators and members of the public, that Senator Crichton-Browne was specifically responsible for influencing the decision-the quite absurd and outrageous decision-of the Commonwealth Games Association to exclude Miss Flemming, and indeed many other Australian athletes, from attending the Commonwealth Games. We all remember that taking place before those games. Indeed, without Senator Crichton-Browne's efforts, it may well be that she would not have gone to New Zealand and represented Australia and would not have won two gold medals for Australia at those games. It should be made clear that there is no good politics in taking famous Australian athletes through this sort of process, but the important point to make is that, if this whole issue had been dealt with properly from the outset, the matter would not be alive today. It would be well dead and buried. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to another point of the Committee's behaviour in relation to this issue: its haste to get rid of it. Currently there is a need for some of the in camera evidence to be given to the Australian Sports Commission; indeed, that Commission has requested some of that evidence. Labor Party members on that Committee have refused that request. As Senator Crowley said, that evidence was published. She and her colleagues on our Committee have sought to unpublish that evidence, which I think is a contradiction in terms. As she said, one cannot let a bird fly away and then fly it back in again. But in a very real way the Labor Party members of the Environment, Recreation and Arts Committee are stopping the further investigation and the finalising of the matter by refusing to accede to the Australian Sports Commission's request. Therefore, this matter is not dead and the Labor Party members of the Committee have it within their power to see a hasty conclusion to it. I suggest that at our next Committee meeting we should reconsider the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those points for the record. I think that the Government's response will see much more consideration. It is a fairly hefty response, and again I reiterate that the depth of the response reflects the very good work of what was a very powerful, public and contentious committee. It is work that, I guess, has only just begun and I suggest that all honourable senators should take an interest in continuing it. In that vein I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report before the Senate is the first report by the present Inspector-General, Mr Holdich, who was appointed on 28 September 1989. It is a very important matter from a parliamentary point of view because the post of Inspector-General reports on how the Australian security and intelligence organisations are operating with respect to their charter. I would expect the Parliament to take a great interest in this because it is the most effective way it has of looking at how the intelligence organisations operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The post of Inspector-General was set up under the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act of 1986. Basically, the function of the Inspector-General is to be a watchdog of the four agencies that we have-the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the Australian Security and Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate, and the Joint Intelligence Organisation, which has now become the Defence Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach that has been taken by this Parliament to make the agencies answerable and accountable has been to set up the Inspector-General's post. The whole matter of accountability of security agencies is a very difficult question. We must have these intelligence organisations because we have got to know about matters relating to internal security. They are directed principally towards politically motivated violence. The two common forms of that are racial violence or racially inspired violence within the community and, more likely in this country, terrorism. We can see from the relative freedom that Australia has had from both of those afflictions that the intelligence supplied by the internal security organisations has been quite good. In relation to external security, national security and matters of national interest are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Security agencies by their very nature are secretive and the whole question of accountability is very vexed. We cannot take time in the five minutes allowed to discuss this report to go into its ramifications. One of the approaches that this Parliament has taken has been to set up the position of Inspector-General. Those powers have been defined and they are quite extensive. The other move that the Parliament took to get some insight into the operations of one of the agencies was to set up the Joint Committee on Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to look at the operations, again under very closely defined powers, of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the Inspector-General's report deals with ASIO. It is comforting to find that he saw no evidence at all of any malpractices or any actions by ASIO during the past 12 months that caused him any concern at all. He comments on the public issue of the matter of the Queensland special police files. It will be remembered that a large number of allegations were made by Australian Labor Party members and Labor Party civil liberties organisations in the community that certain malpractices had occurred-namely, that there had been a wholesale transfer of files from the Queensland Special Branch to ASIO before the December election and that information with respect to politicians, both State and Federal, had been provided to ASIO. In essence, it was alleged that a great number of files and a great deal of information had been passed at the end of 1989 or early 1990 to `subvert the intentions'-and I quote the words of the Inspector-General-`of the new Government'. On all those points he unambiguously comes down with the recommendation that no malpractices in any way at all took place. Not only that, but he found that these events simply did not take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only a limited knowledge of Mr Holdich, but I have found him to be a mature, intelligent and extremely conscientious Inspector-General. I have every confidence in his integrity and ability to discharge the post. I am also the Liberal representative on the Joint ASIO Committee and I have found the members of ASIO that I have met to be extremely knowledgeable of what the Act defines as their terms of duties and responsibilities. My very limited experience of ASIO supports the findings of the Inspector-General that it is a body working very closely within the letter of the law and for the good of the country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Wool Corporation on its annual report and on the work it has done to try to increase the commercial returns to woolgrowers through marketing, promoting the use of wool, funding and administering research and development, and owning and managing the wool stores. As I read the report, I noted that the Corporation's operating loss for the year was $336.1m. According to the report:</PARA>
<PARA>This was incurred after allowing for abnormal losses totalling $613m caused by the write-down of stock and trading losses due to the lowering of the floor price; and redemption of investments to pay for the stockpiling of wool. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman, Mr Hugh Beggs, states in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 31 May directed the AWC Board, against its commercial judgment and advice, to lower the minimum reserve price for the 1990/91 season from 870 cents a kg to 700 cents. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope honourable senators noted that this action was taken against the commercial judgment and advice of the Board. Mr Beggs continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government intervention raised fundamental questions about the management of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>As I told the Senate earlier this year, that action should not have been decided by a group of economists sitting back in Canberra with some flawed economic theories. Economists have a very good track record of getting it wrong. In this case they got it very wrong. Unfortunately, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and the Labor Government followed their wrong advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. The wool industry has over time provided much of our export earnings. It is Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. Ninety-nine per cent of Australian wool is Australian-owned and 97 per cent of wool is exported. Wool has always helped Australia pay its way. The situation that has occurred during last year is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted in the report that in 1986-87 and 1987-88 sales of wool from Australia exceeded production by one million bales. Just two years later demand at auction was three million bales below the amount presented for sale. This situation was made worse by the large quantity of wool held over from the previous year and the amount of early shorn wool offered towards the end of the year to avoid the lower price in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may think it helped the industry by its action of dropping the floor price, but I say to honourable senators that all it did was to help destroy the industry-an industry in which we now daily read of farmers who have to shoot their flocks because it is not even profitable to ship these worthless animals to market; an industry where, as one newspaper headline said, `$1.80 will buy you one beer or 18 sheep'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators from my own State of Queensland would have read in the last few days of a plan by a Brisbane Catholic priest, Father John McKeon, to use some of those worthless flocks for the hungry and needy. I believe that in Western Australia the same thing has happened. Mr Geoffrey Mountjoy, a grazier at Amby Hills near Mitchell, west of Roma, said he would rather donate the sheep to help others than shoot them or lose money transporting them to market. So Father John McKeon organised transport companies-Frasers, McIvors and W. and M. Meat Transport Pty Ltd-to handle the sheep, workers at Ipswich regional abattoirs to slaughter them and Woolworths Brismeat to cut and package the meat. </PARA>
<PARA> This was all done at no charge. Many people were able to share in the 30,000 kilograms of lamb and mutton distributed to hungry Queenslanders by the St Vincent de Paul Society. I think that is excellent. I compliment Mr Mountjoy, Father John McKeon and all who had anything to do with it because I believe that it is very worth while indeed. It is dreadful that this once great industry has been reduced to such circumstances. It is certainly very worrying for Australia and for its export earners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very traumatic year for the Australian Wool Corporation, as it has been for the entire Australian wool industry. I take the opportunity to address a number of matters raised in the annual report for 1989-90. The first thing I noticed when I read the report was the value of the wool industry to this country. In 1988-89, wool exports were worth $6 billion to this country-at a time when the market indicator was 980c a kilo. In the following financial year-1989-90-wool exports were worth only $3.8 billion to this country with a market indicator of 870c a kilo. I am gravely concerned that the reductions in the floor price that occurred this year will have further market effects upon the value of Australia's premier export earner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Admittedly, we did have a problem with supply. The report highlights the fact that, whereas supply was expected to increase only 8 per cent in the preceding year, it in fact increased 17 per cent. But I believe that a number of facts are very important when we look at the vexed question of the floor price. The Australian market produces some 1,049 million kilos. The five major wool exporting countries together produce only 1,665 million kilos, so Australia represents approximately 60 per cent of that large segment of the market. We also note the fact that, just prior to the intervention by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in this matter, the market indicator was rising. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes it very clear that at the opening of the season the indicator price was 889c a kilo clean. On 15 December the indicator price had sunk to 879c a kilo clean, but on 6 April it had hit 900c a kilo clean. Clearly, the indicator price fell not because of a change in demand so much as a change of confidence in the industry, prompted by the unnecessary intervention of the Minister in the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before, and I say again: when we control such a large segment of the market, as the Australian wool industry does, we do not increase the amount of wool, or whatever produce we have to sell, if we cut the price. All we succeed in doing is cutting the amount of money earned. When we are in a monopolist situation, as Australia is when it comes to wool, we run a further risk in that, by cutting the price, we drive buyers out of the market rather than keep them in it. This has unfortunately been proved to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Buyers have been driven out of the market for two reasons: first, a general lack of confidence in the Australian wool industry now as a result of the Minister's intervention and a desire to teach the industry a lesson; and, secondly, a belief that the price can be driven down further. I believe that it is wholly appropriate that the floor price be maintained and that at every opportunity we all extend our support for the floor price and, in so doing, extend our support for Australia's premier export earner. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in the long term wool will once again become our premier export earner. I believe that it is necessary for us in the difficult months ahead to have foremost in our sights the obligation upon all of us to support the industry and give it whatever assistance is necessary to get through the tough times so that it can start earning the massive export income for Australia that it did in 1988-89 and will do in the future. </PARA>

I draw the Senate's attention initially to page 43 with regard to sources of International Wool Secretariat (IWS) funds. Senator O'Chee in his comments made the point that Australia produces 60 per cent or thereabouts of the wool which is traded on world markets. It has been consistently a concern of mine in terms of IWS funding that Australia has paid a significant percentage more than what should be its fair share for an internationally funded operation such as the IWS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important in these troubled times in the wool industry that the Australian Wool Corporation and the negotiators do everything in their power to get the percentage lifted by the other contributing countries and also identify those countries which produce wool but perhaps do not export a large amount of it but benefit enormously from the work that is done by the IWS in promoting it. It is very important in the current situation that more effort be made to target middle range consumers rather than the top of the market. In the long term, if the wool industry is to recover and continue to grow, it is very important for it to expand its market base or market opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to page 45 of the report we see the consumption figures for the period in question. Unfortunately, they are not reflected in what is occurring in the marketplace at present. I strongly urge that strenuous efforts be made by the Wool Corporation to come to some arrangement to get wool moving through the pipeline again, particularly in Russia, eastern Europe and China. While I recognise that this is going to be difficult, I note that for each two years that a bale of wool is in the stockpile it costs just over $300 a bale when interest, rental on buildings, et cetera, are added. It would seem to me that there is scope for some investment of that $300, rather than its being utilised and in effect going down the drain, to get that into the pipeline and maybe pulling some of it back later on in the processing line. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point in the report that I would like to bring to the Senate's attention relates to training. I want to place on the record that the wool industry was one of the leaders, if not the leader, in putting in place an industry plan for training. I have correspondence with the appropriate Ministers on this point. Currently there is some concern in the industry because it looks like copping a double whammy with the industry training levy. I think that provision should be made to exempt those industries that have taken the initiative to put their own training requirements in place, and conduct them on what I term an industry driven level, from the necessity to be levied compulsorily through the industry, because that is collected through the mechanism of the wool levy fund. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Wool Research and Development Council is presented in a most entertaining way. As Senator O'Chee remarked to me when we were looking through the document, there are some most attractive photographs which give a very good idea of the breadth of concerns that the Wool Research and Development Council has. There is also an attractive presentation of the various programs in which the Council involves itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to home in on a particular program that is mentioned in the report. I commend page 46 of the report to all honourable senators, and anybody else who happens to be listening. Page 46 highlights the Council's research work in an area which is often neglected. The section is headed `Earthworms: the Neglected Allies'. A lot of people could derive great benefit from reading this very short, succinct but most informative section. Without reading every word of it, I will highlight a couple of parts. At the beginning there is a little history on why earthworms have been neglected over the decades. The Council suggests that earthworms have been overlooked in the burgeoning of agricultural research since the 1940s. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Now, as the idea of sustainability becomes a central theme of modern agriculture, the earthworms beneath pastures and broadacre crops are again receiving the kind of attention that many would say they have always deserved.</PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with that. I wish to quote further from this section and highlight the fact that the research that has been conducted by the Council has shown that earthworms cycle organic matter and prevent accumulation of undecomposed organic matter on the soil surface; increase soil porosity and water infiltration rate; increase the activity of microbes; improve soil structure; increase pasture production; and incorporate lime and fertiliser into the soil. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest anybody thinks that that is the totality of it, the further research that has been conducted by the Council, and in particular in Tasmania, has shown that there is a close link between earthworm populations and pasture productivity.  Again I say that if anybody is really interested in pasture productivity across all aspects of agriculture in Australia, they would be wise to refer to pages 46, 47 and 48 of the report which tell us something of the research that has been conducted in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I must mention in passing that a very successful farmer who has been involved with the development of his property at Rushy Lagoon, Mr Bert Farquhar, has been a great advocate for the use of earthworms in agriculture. There are photographs of the property in the report and the sorts of pasture improvements being brought about by earthworms. Obviously the Council has worked well with this and has found out some very interesting information. I got to my feet to mention this only to make sure that it did not pass unnoticed. I feel sure that if we can only see more of this research, we may have a little bit of hope that indicates we do not have to throw money and chemicals onto our farms to increase productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Another section of the report refers to the possibility of seeking alternative marketing strategies. A section on page 90 mentions what is happening in China. I commend that part of the report to anyone who is interested in reading how we might improve our agricultural situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell is quite right: this report of the Wool Research and Development Council is particularly interesting. In addition to the very interesting matter on earthworms, I note the efforts of the Development Council in attempting to find a vaccine to protect against blowfly. Many people in the cities may not appreciate the problem that blowflies are to sheep production. Anybody who has seen a flyblown sheep carcass knows what a particularly gruesome thing it is and what a major threat it is to the Australian wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the economic research that the Development Council has done, particularly with respect to China. Until the recent wool crisis, China was a major buyer of Australian wool. Ultimately it will be countries such as China and Japan coming back into the market that will lead the way for the recovery of the Australian wool industry. I take note of some of the observations made in the report on the Chinese economy and the consequences for Australia's export earnings in wool. One of the comments made is that China presently has a greatly overvalued currency. The report goes to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This makes its export goods expensive, discouraging exports, and so limiting earnings of foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> Reading that, one could almost think that Australia was being spoken about. China has to earn hard currency and, until it can earn that hard currency, it is difficult for us to sell our wool to China unless we do it through trade lines and lending by Australian institutions to China to enable it to take our exports of wool. China has a great demand for wool. Some 85 per cent of woollen garments produced in China are sold into the domestic market. Only 15 per cent of the garments are actually sold overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, I believe, great potential for improvements in sales of wool to China as China becomes more prosperous. People in that country will be looking for higher standards of garments than they currently receive. I believe also that, as the Chinese market gains expertise in fashion and fashion design, the products that come out of there will be sold elsewhere into international markets. Ultimately, that will benefit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to say that China is not currently a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and that is a problem. It makes it harder for China to export its manufactured woollen garments. I hope that China will soon become a signatory to GATT. Ultimately, increases in Chinese exports of garments translate into increases in Australian wool sales to China and ultimately to increases in the prosperity of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a major problem in the international market. Whilst China and Japan remain out of the market there is, some would argue, an oversupply of wool. I am a little concerned that the current sheep culling that is going on in Australia alone and not elsewhere in other wool producing countries may in the long term disadvantage this nation by reducing its share of wool production around the world and its share, therefore, of the total earnings of the market. This bothers me greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> While some people believe that a slaughter scheme is absolutely essential, we have to look at means of increasing the sale of wool and promoting woollen garments, both at home and overseas, in order to increase the demand. We do not solve the problem by attacking supply; we must also increase demand. Some of the things being done to promote wool and woollen products are absolutely outstanding. I am sure that if sufficient funds are devoted to them in the long term sales of woollen garments will improve. Therefore, so will the fortunes of the wool industry. I take this opportunity to say that whilst other people may be running down the wool industry and prophesying doom and gloom we in the National Party will do whatever is necessary to keep fighting for the wool industry and for its survival. When others go to water on this issue, we stand firm. We are totally behind the wool industry. Therefore, we are totally behind Australia's export earnings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report entitled Operation Ark of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority contains a majority report. Immediately behind that there is a qualifying statement, sometimes referred to as a dissenting report. I need to make a few remarks about those two documents which form the one report from the whole Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report raises some very serious questions about the operation of the National Crime Authority (NCA), especially in South Australia. True it may be that under Justice Phillips things in the National Crime Authority will change. Things will be different, very different. But none of that discharges this Committee from its responsibility to report to Parliament on what has already happened in that Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past two weeks the Government has been strangely silent on the substantive matters raised in the qualifying statement. I, for one, would be interested in hearing from Government senators and other honourable senators this evening as to why the Committee, charged with the task of reviewing the performance and the effectiveness of the Authority, should not be making inquiries to resolve, in its mind, the many inconsistencies in the evidence before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I would be very interested in hearing what honourable senators, particularly Government senators, have to say about the substantive issues raised in the qualifying statement. For example, I would like to hear whether Government senators believe that the Committee has ever been misled. I would like to hear from them whether they believe the Stewart report really was completed by 30 June. I would like to hear what the former chairman, Mr Faris, has to say about this matter, and what the Chairman before him, Mr Stewart, has to say about this matter. I would like to be able to make an assessment about whether this whole fiasco is simply a function of personality disputes. I would like to know whether the Labor network around Australia has something to hide. I would like to know how inconvenient it would have been for the South Australian Government had the Stewart report-as it was then-been delivered given the impending South Australian State election. </PARA>
<PARA> I look to what the majority report tells us about these matters-and it does not tell us anything. I see that the majority report tells Parliament very little-almost nothing that you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President, could not have read in the local papers. That begs the question: why have a joint parliamentary committee to oversee the operations of a national crime authority if all it is prepared to tell Parliament is about the fiasco of the NCA in South Australia, which all Australians have known about for several months. It is a question that Government senators might like to address their minds to. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Loosely says that in camera evidence has been inappropriately revealed. He says, `How can people make a judgment on snippets of evidence here and there?'. I wonder what judgment he thinks can be made when what has been reported is simply what the media has reported. I invite Senator Loosely to come into the chamber and tell us how he thinks Parliament can make a sensible assessment of these matters on the basis of the majority report. As I say, Government members have avoided the real issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman is reported to have said that the evaluation inquiry, that is, the inquiry of this Committee into the effectiveness and efficiency of the NCA has now been severely constrained. That is what is reported in the Adelaide Advertiser with a heading, `MP fears NCA inquiry may be hamstrung'. The Chairman says that he is now forced to warn people that evidence may be made public. I trust that those remarks were not made by the Chairman as a means of frightening off potential witnesses from coming forward. Surely that would not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I quite agree that people should be warned that evidence may be revealed. It has not been done in the past on this Committee and it should be done in the future. I am very concerned that potential witnesses reading the remarks of the Chairman may feel that they have something to fear in coming before this Committee, which is unmitigated rubbish because they have nothing to fear. </PARA>
<PARA> I have other concerns about the Chairman's reported remarks. He is reported as saying that he knows that the NCA was concerned about the use of in camera evidence in the dissenting report. I have two reasons for being concerned about that. Firstly, the NCA has not expressed that concern to me or, to my knowledge, to any other member of the Committee who signed the qualifying statement. Nor, for that matter, has it expressed that concern to the Committee as a whole. I hesitate to think that the NCA is so weak as to seek to make press statements via the conduit of private conversations with the Chairman of the Committee. I am very loath to come to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second concern I have is that for the public to have confidence that this Committee is doing its job properly in reviewing the NCA, the public must see at least an arm's length distance between this Committee and the NCA itself. One cannot review something that one is going to bed with at night. One has to maintain an arm's length distance in these matters. It is my view that the Chairman's reporting of what he says is the view of the NCA does not encourage confidence that that arm's length distance is there. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the use of in camera evidence. I heard earlier today in the chamber Senator Crowley giving her views on when it should and should not be released. I found that, by and large, I substantially agreed with what she said. She said that in camera evidence should be used only in the most serious circumstances. Prior to that I think she said that there was a process to go through in order to decide what evidence one would take in camera and what one would not. I quite agree that when the decision to take in camera evidence has been taken in light of the nature of the evidence to be given then, yes, use of it must be very carefully considered. </PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, that is not the situation with this Committee. Just about every meeting that it has with the NCA is in camera, whether witnesses from the NCA simply tell us what they had for breakfast or what they are actually doing-and the latter would be the more rare occasion. It is my view that one should look at the use of evidence that is put into dissenting reports, or into majority reports for that matter, not with regard to the name that may be attached to it-that is the procedural form-but with regard to the importance and relevance of the information to Parliament and the consequence of that evidence being made public. I can assure the Senate that every member of the Committee who signed that qualifying statement asked themselves again and again, `What have we put into this report that we would not ask at a public meeting and we would not expect an answer to at a public meeting?'. There is not one piece of evidence in that report that I would not have been happy to seek at a public hearing and I would have been very unhappy if the questions had not been answered. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the serious circumstances that Parliament needs to know about? There are serious inconsistencies in the evidence which was put before the Committee. Parliament needs to know that, not only because of what it says about the NCA but also because of what it says about the functioning of the Committee. The evidence reveals enormous tension in the operation of the NCA in South Australia and, in my view, the Committee should be able to make some assessment of the impact of that tension on its operating effectiveness. Its administrative efficiency is obviously related to its operating efficiency. The other night Senator Loosley made some very serious charges, to which I say let him put up or shut up. He said that there is a determined plan to wreck this Committee-by inference, a determined plan by coalition members. Parliament is no place for the games of the New South Wales Labor Party-those games with which Mr Loosley is so familiar. When one makes an allegation in this place one should back it up or back off. I invite Senator Loosley to come into the chamber and back up his allegation. It is my view that his allegation is a case of the pot calling the kettle black-it is an attack mechanism as a means of defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is an absolute shame that Government members in this chamber seem to have given away the very significant attempts made by former Labor senators, such as Senator Mulvihill, Senator Keeffe and Senator Cavanagh, to protect the rights of individual senators. Senator Cavanagh made a very substantial contribution to this chamber, part of which we heard revealed by Government members as a consequence of his death recently. I invite Government senators to turn back to the likes of Senator Cavanagh, Senator Keeffe and Senator Mulvihill and read what they had to say about the very important need to protect the rights of individual senators. Once we get to the stage where an individual senator cannot come in here and, on the basis of his or her own decision- making powers, put a view before Parliament; when this chamber is run by the executive of either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, we are finished as an effective chamber. That is what Government members need to consider. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (NCA) I wish to address some of the issues of substance which have given rise to the conflict that was described by Senator Vanstone. The Ark report deals with Operation Ark which, in turn, arose out of Operation Noah, carried out in South Australia in 1989, which was concerned with issues related to drug trafficking. Thirteen complaints were listed which implicated, to some extent, South Australian police, suggesting that they were either aiding or hiding or were in some way involved in drug trafficking in South Australia. These complaints did not reach the proper channels; in particular, they did not at that time reach the Commissioner of Police in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of that the Ark inquiry was conducted and hearings were held by the then Commissioner of the Authority for South Australia, Mr Mark Le Grand. He arrived at a report which was highly critical of a number of South Australian police officers in the context of the Ark operation and the Noah operation, as well as the procedures that were used by police in that State. He worked on his report, virtually until the day when the chairmanship of the NCA changed from Mr Justice Stewart to Mr Faris. There is some dispute as to whether his report was completely finished and whether Mr Justice Stewart was justified in issuing a note of transmittal for this report. As it was, the report was intercepted-I think that is the right word to use-by Mr Faris who had then commenced his duties as Chairman. The report was judged to have been incomplete. It was held back and, ultimately, a different completed report was presented to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that the second report was very much a sanitised version of the first report, to the extent that it omitted a number of names of police officers which were mentioned and the descriptions of a number of specific occurrences and operations, and it did not deal in any great detail with any of the 13 complaints that had been lodged as a result of Operation Noah. The report-the so-called Stewart report, if I may call it that-was not publicly available but it had come into the possession of the South Australian police and I obtained a copy of it following its tabling by Mr Le Grand at a hearing of the NCA Committee. In comparing the two reports, I formed the opinion that at least six of the 13 complaints which were originally listed required further attention and investigation and at a hearing with the South Australian police in Adelaide I ascertained that they in fact were using both reports for their continuing investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, to some extent, the issue of whether the first report should have been published in substance does not matter any more. The police are continuing their inquiries. They have also stated that they have had contact with the National Crime Authority on the conduct of these investigations and that they have received cooperation. Whether or not that report should have been published-and there is some argument, justified I believe, that it should not have been on the basis that it was publishing the names of officers who were still subject to investigation as to the allegations that were raised against them-it is now a question of pursuing whether or not these issues have been followed up adequately either by the South Australian police or by the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last meeting of the Committee with the Authority I notified the Chairman that I would continue to pursue this matter with the National Crime Authority, and I have been advised that this would not be resisted by the National Crime Authority. In that sense, we can say that the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is continuing its work of assessing and supervising the work of the National Crime Authority. I express some concerns that echo the statements made by Senator Vanstone that this role of the Committee must be protected and must be expanded from its present role in the sense that the secrecy provisions which currently operate as a result of section 51 and section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act hamper its work. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Mr Justice Phillips, the new Chairman of the Crime Authority, is prepared to cooperate with the Committee. However, that obligation of the Committee to supervise the work of the Crime Authority cannot depend on the goodwill of the respective chairmen or membership of either the Authority or the Committee. It is necessary, in my view, to look at the Act, to review it and to amend it to ensure that even this current review of the effectiveness of the process that is intended to supervise the National Crime Authority can be effective. To that extent the Australian Democrats will certainly continue urgently to pursue amendments to the Crime Authority Act to ensure that the Committee can fulfil the task it has been set. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I joined the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training very late in the inquiry when it was completing its report. I would have liked to have been involved in the whole inquiry because I regard it as an extremely important area not only for those who are involved in the higher education field, but also for the wider community, who deserve to have quality service from those who have had the benefit of a tertiary education. Everyone deserves to have the benefit of well-educated teachers, doctors, dentists, engineers, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee covered a wide range of issues relating to the quality of higher education, broadly grouped under the headings of curriculum, communication skills, quality of teaching, continuing education, access and equity, and efficiency and effectiveness. Of course, these are all interrelated. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, under communication skills the Committee drew attention to the needs of many students to have the opportunity to increase communication skills, both oral and written. This is directly related to the need for better communication by tertiary teachers, some of whom have little skill in communication and most of whom have no training in teaching-that is, in communicating with their students. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend most of the short time I have on quality of teaching as I believe that students, and therefore the wider community, have a right to expect academics to be skilled teachers. A short quote from the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the promotion of good teaching within higher education institutions be designated a national priority area and that, in the context of the development of profiles, institutions be requested to provide information on policies and programs which they have adopted to achieve this aim. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that teaching should be given greater importance, since the future quality of the professions, the trades and the occupations depends on quality teaching and training as well, of course, as the other benefits of a tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> An emphasis on research can, in fact, militate against good teaching. Teaching can suffer from a lack of commitment and a lack of reading and preparation time if it is sharing the time available in a limited cake with research, when the teacher knows that his or her future progress and promotion may depend largely on the volume of research and even the volume of publication. </PARA>
<PARA> During three tertiary courses which I have completed I can count on only a few fingers more than one hand the number of really good teachers I studied under. Only one, to my knowledge, ever became a professor; and that may be significant.  Others may well have sacrificed promotion to a wish to be quality teachers. Indeed, I know some academics who consciously have done this. Many enjoy teaching and regard it as their primary occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the matter of an emphasis on research and publication being an encouragement to less ethical academics to engage in the sort of questionable practice which surfaces from time to time in research and the publication of research. I am talking not just about high profile research which has received publicity when it is found to be invalid or to be untruthfully reported, but about the use by some academics of others' research to boost their chances of promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the experience myself of an academic who offered to provide a computer program to analyse the data from a piece of research I had conducted in educational psychology. He later published the results of my research under his name, adding my name as one does a minor contributor or an assistant. This practice is not uncommon, unfortunately, even at senior levels of academia. </PARA>
<PARA> Some tertiary institutions do have good programs to increase the teaching skills of their academic staff, but I know of none in which participation in such a program is a requirement for employment and/or promotion. Indeed, some of the former colleges of advanced education tended to offer better teaching than universities, perhaps because there was not the same emphasis on research-not that I condone the lack of research in those institutions-but also because they tended to attract staff who had taught formally or informally in their previous positions and were motivated primarily to teach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I would like to spend the few minutes left on access and equity, a question which is fundamental to the existence of a just and democratic society. The Committee concluded as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A higher education system which in any way resembles an enclave for a select socio-economic group is unlikely to be a useful foundation for a society faced with the widespread consequences of social and technological change. </PARA>
<PARA>For anyone who is concerned about this question I recommend reading chapter 5 of the report, which refers to the variety of barriers which exist to access. I was horrified to learn just a few years ago, when I was part of a task force considering the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme, that many of the large tertiary institutions did not know the gender proportion of their own students, let alone the number of students seeking admission who might be disadvantaged on a range of grounds. Of course, many of these barriers must be addressed years before a student is thinking about access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only what children study at school and what access they have to a good secondary education, but also factors such as parental expectations for, say, a child with a disability or, indeed, a daughter, must be considered. My experience when I was a student counsellor in a high school was that it was often fathers who discouraged their daughters from continuing their education, considering it a waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the conclusion to its chapter on access and equity, the Committee said that it regarded `the attack on unequal participation rates as a priority goal for higher education in the coming years'. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This is important not just in terms of social justice considerations but also to ensure the background and life experiences of graduates are increasingly in tune with those of the whole Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>From my own experience both as a teacher and as a student, I would say that this is particularly important for graduates in education, whether they teach at primary, secondary or tertiary level, as, indeed, I believe it is very important for parliamentarians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The three Bills we are debating are Appropriation Bill (No. 1), Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. With the passage of these Bills the Government will, with the consent of the Parliament, appropriate from Consolidated Revenue a total of $17,263,029,800. I suppose that if one says that quickly enough it does not sound so much, but we need to remember that all of this money comes from the taxpayers of this country. Government of itself does not grow money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought it appropriate as we consider these requests for appropriations to see what an appropriation is. The Macquarie Dictionary gives several definitions, which include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> to set apart for some specific purpose or use: . . . to take to or for oneself; . . . to filch; annex; steal . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Most of us know that we are acting under the first definition, but I cannot help but wonder whether the many hard-pressed businesses and individuals in the community at present struggling to survive and to pay taxes may not perhaps identify with the third of those definitions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the amounts appropriated are both very large and in some cases very small. Today I want to refer to some of the very small items, because they deal with matters that are of great significance to individuals. In fact, the amounts, though very small, mean a great deal to some people, who may have difficulty in finding them. </PARA>
<PARA> The money is used for a wide variety of purposes and everybody is affected. It is either a benefit or it has some impact. It is difficult to relate to very large figures such as the total amount I read out at the beginning of my speech, but all of us in dealing with constituents come across people who are affected by the appropriations of a department, the way the Government raises this money in the first place and the way it then hands it out or spends it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention some of the concerns I have. The first one relates to use of appropriated funds by the Attorney- General's Department at the request of the Department of Finance-in effect, the Attorney-General acting as the solicitor for the Department of Finance. It relates to the tardy payment by the Department of Finance of superannuation money due to a person who has retired from the Australian Public Service. I am referring to the case of Mr Milton, a former Commonwealth public servant who retired in 1988. He subsequently sued the Commonwealth for compensation for lost interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter in Parliament before and at the Estimates Committee. When I first questioned the then Minister for Finance about it, he indicated that a number of late payments were a consequence of people not giving the Department adequate information and that in a sense those people were responsible for late payments being made. He implied that that was frequently the case, but I believe that is not so and certainly was not the case in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Milton took his case to the Small Claims Court and successfully sued for $929.49, being lost interest, and $20 for his court fee. As I said, within the scheme of things the amount we are talking about in these Bills might seem so little as to be of no consequence. However, to most Australians it is an amount which is very significant indeed. The magistrate said that it was quite clear that Mr Milton, who had retired on 30 June 1988, had been entitled to his money on 4 August but he did not receive it until 13 days later. </PARA>
<PARA> A representative of the Commissioner for Superannuation indicated that his office had heavy workloads and was busy. If that be the case, it is not properly served with staff to see that the job it is required to do is in fact done properly. The magistrate indicated that he could not see any way in which Mr Milton's claim could be defeated. The money had been withheld for 13 days without any authority and he was therefore entitled to the interest. I quote specifically from the magistrate's judgment:</PARA>
<PARA>By way of comparison, no commercial financial institution engaged in the superannuation industry could withhold investors funds beyond the due date without payment of interest on those funds. </PARA>
<PARA>We can all imagine the outrage of a Minister answering a question from one of his own senators had a private superannuation company done this. Honourable senators can imagine the question being put in this place-`Is the Minister aware . . .?' and all the rest-and the Minister being absolutely indignant that any private company would withhold money in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might think that the story would end there, and so it should have. It is astonishing to find that the Department then planned to appeal against the decision of the magistrate. There are two aspects of the matter that flow from that. As I said, I raised the matter in the Estimates Committee, and the written response I received was that the matter was still being pursued. I would ask: At what cost to taxpayers is this matter being pursued?</PARA>
<PARA> The might of the Commonwealth, with all its resources, is pursuing legal action over this small amount of just over $900 against an individual retired public servant when it is quite clear that he ought to have this money and it was withheld quite wrongly. The might of the Commonwealth is being used to crush an individual and other taxpayers' money is being used to fund this, taxpayers who, as I said, are having difficulty finding the money to pay for it at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that since this came up, and I read this in the Canberra Times, the Commissioner for Superannuation has recognised that there is a problem with delays in payments and has agreed that he should, and will, pay interest on delayed payments in the future. Notwithstanding that fact, he is still pursuing Mr Milton in the courts at a cost which will probably drive Mr Milton bankrupt because the Commonwealth has the resources to do it. But I want to look at the legal costs and see where we stand. </PARA>
<PARA> I was told at the Estimates Committee hearing that no department pays legal costs for such action. So no matter what the cost to the taxpayers of this country, the Department of Finance can instruct the Commonwealth solicitors to take this action for an amount of just over $900 to the High Court, no matter what the cost, because the Attorney-General's Department does not render an account to its client as is the normal case in any other legal action that any of the rest of us would be involved in. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked at the Estimates Committee what costs were incurred and what hours were involved. I am told it was 40 hours of the time of a principal legal officer (PLO) and eight hours of the time of a senior legal officer (SLO) at-this will astound anybody who has had dealings with legal matters-an estimated cost of $1,480. In addition, there are disbursements totalling $2,167.50 so far. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the trouble to look up the salary of a principal legal officer. It is in the range of just over $50,000 to just over $53,000, and the salary of a senior legal officer is just over $42,000 to over $45,000. Forty hours of a principal legal officer's work, taking it as a 38-hour week, would mean approximately $1,000 a week and eight hours at the senior legal officer rate of $826 a week is $165 a day. It is ludicrous that the Attorney-General then notionally costs out the time of these people at that price. </PARA>
<PARA> That is just the salaries. There is absolutely nothing in there for the cost of the accommodation of the solicitors and nothing in there for the superannuation or any of the other benefits that the employer has to pay for those employees. Forty hours of the PLO's time would be worth at least $2,800 and 8 hours of the SLO's time would be $460 and yet I am told the total amount is only $1,480. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government uses taxpayers' funds to pursue this action, and if it wins against Mr Milton at the next hearing and gets an order for costs against him, will it then only ask for its costs at the rate it has told me, that is, $1,480, or will it seek to recover from Mr Milton at the rate which is the proper legal cost? I wonder. I find it absolutely astonishing that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) allow a matter like this to proceed, wasting the money that they have taken from taxpayers and using it in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to moneys appropriated by the Government for expenditure by the Department of Community Services and Health to assist people with disabilities. This is a purpose which is totally legitimate and totally necessary; but I am talking about the administration of some of this money. I have spoken before at some length about the case of the Multiple Sclerosis Society in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I shall not deal in absolute detail with the story as it is. I set it out in considerable detail when I spoke on 31 May in this place. I have since had correspondence with the Minister, Mr Howe, in which he quoted to me the requirements of the Disability Services Act. I say to the Minister that if the Act is so ridiculous, why does he not do something about changing it and making it work in the interests of people who require respite care. </PARA>
<PARA> To recap briefly, in case anyone did not hear the story last time, the Multiple Sclerosis Society with the support of the people of Canberra and, in particular, Miss Gloria McKerrow, has built a splendid day care facility in Deakin where it obtained a block of land. It works extremely well. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are able to go there during the day and I shall not go into detail on the benefits that flow from that. On the same site, which is a large block of land, but about half a kilometre from residential areas, they built a respite care centre so that people with multiple sclerosis could, for a short period of time, move to respite care, be looked after by the carers there, enjoy the day care centre during the day, and return to their homes in due course after a period of respite care. </PARA>
<PARA> For some reason, the regulations under the Disability Services Act require that a respite care facility must be in the general community. This, I have just told you Mr Acting Deputy President, is about half a kilometre from residential areas. It is placed precisely where it is of benefit and of use to those who have multiple sclerosis and who can be cared for a short period. Nobody is talking about taking multiple sclerosis sufferers out of the community and putting them in some artificial place. The action that this stubborn Minister is taking is clearly punitive in my view. The Society has been criticised by the Government for not approaching the Government before daring to establish this facility. It put it where experts advised it that it was most appropriate. Members of the Society talked locally and interstate to those experienced in the provision of these sorts of facilities for disabled people and they funded the entire capital cost from their own funds. They were entitled to seek expert advice, which they did, from the people who were most qualified to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely incomprehensible that the Commonwealth Government still quibbles over the location. It has refused to fund any person going into the respite care centre so that the Society, having almost exhausted its resources, will have to close. The facility for respite care will not be available to MS sufferers in Canberra when this money runs out. I can only conclude that the Commonwealth could not care less about multiple sclerosis sufferers in the ACT and surrounding districts. The Minister says that he wants such facilities sanctioned by the Government and in a residential area. The simple fact is that there is not such a facility which is empty and waiting around to be such a place. Why can it not be where it is? If the regulations preclude it, the regulations are absolute nonsense and they should be changed. Just about everybody seems to know of this, but for some reason the Commonwealth Government refuses to look at what has occurred. As I said earlier, the sufferers are those who have multiple sclerosis and would benefit from this facility. I urge the Minister again to look personally at the merits of this case, to deal with it and resolve it as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I next turn to the matter of education and the funding of higher education. I was present when Senator Panizza in his speech dealt with the matter of Austudy. As I said earlier, all the matters that I am dealing with in this appropriation debate are of comparatively small amounts, but to individuals in this community the small amounts are frequently of more significance than the large amounts. It is individual taxpayers who provide the money which is then appropriated to government. They have to find it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been talking about the clever country; a very easy use of words, the sort of little catch phrase that flows. But a look at the facts suggests that the Government is not really putting its money into education in the way that it would like everyone to believe it is. The Government is very keen to boast that enrolments in tertiary institutions have grown by 50 per cent since Labor came to power but funding has declined by 11 per cent. So what are we really achieving? It is fine to claim credit for a 50 per cent growth but then try to hide the fact of the real decline in the money being spent. As a proportion of our gross domestic product, Commonwealth expenditure on higher education was 1.05 per cent in 1980-81. In 1989-90 it was 0.85 per cent which is a highly significant drop. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training on funding relativities in higher education has concluded that there is both under and over funding-on the basis of its formula-in a number of institutions. One of the institutions identified as under funded is the very new University of Canberra, formerly the Canberra College of Advanced Education. While the suggestion that certain institutions are under funded is a matter of concern; it is a question of the adequacy of funding available to the tertiary institutions. It is all very well for the Government to boast about growing student numbers and more people completing tertiary education, but it cannot be legitimately claimed as an indication of success if these students are being crammed into inadequate, overcrowded institutions becoming increasingly ill-equipped to cope with the demands which are being made upon them. How often do we hear about the facilities in science and engineering for teaching students falling behind modern standards? The Government is not able to replace what is needed in these laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also not overlook the fact that there have recently been unprecedented strikes by academics which should signal to the Government that there is a very real problem in higher education. The clever country strategy will not be well served if our tertiary institutions become run down and lose the best and brightest teachers to industry, government or overseas institutions. If the Government's bottom line is that it does not have the money in these tough economic times-and we all recognise that-to adequately fund higher education, then why is it not more imaginative? Why does it not cast off its ideological hang ups and look to encouraging and allowing the tertiary institutions to turn to other sources for some funding? No-one suggests that the money is readily available but let us at least find other ways of seeing that our students are being well served. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth matter that I refer to is also one that comes into the category of taxation. Again, it is a very small matter but highly significant to many in the community. I have raised this before in a question and got an answer that I do not regard as satisfactory. I was contacted by a retired public servant of pensionable age in receipt of a very modest superannuation pension which totalled less than the amount of the age pension. She contacted me because she had learnt that she is liable to pay tax on her income above the threshold of $5,100, whereas a pensioner can earn income of $8,262 before having a tax liability; a discrepancy of about $3,000 against the person who has not claimed an age pension. As I said, I took the matter up in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the answer that I have received that the Government is saying that any recipient of a full or part pension will be eligible for a tax exemption. But the question that remains is whether the Government is satisfied that the anomaly which is created whereby other retired people who for a range of reasons may not be eligible, or may simply choose not to take a government pension, is acceptable. How are we as taxpayers going to accept that this should be the case? I would like an unequivocal reply from the Government, because I believe that with all that the Government has said about encouraging people to make provision for their own retirement, and the need to lessen the automatic expectation of a government pension at the end of their working life, the Government should be removing such anomalies and should be encouraging people to think less of just taking the pension or a part pension to qualify for tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, it is bizarre. Persons may choose not to apply because they feel that basically they can live on their superannuation and their other income without the balance which they would be entitled to obtain for a part pension. They may choose to remain that way because of all the intimidating paperwork that anyone who applies for a pension gets caught up with on a regular basis. What we are really saying is that persons in this situation are virtually forced to ask the Government for a part pension of perhaps only a few dollars a week, which they might have otherwise chosen to forgo, to qualify for this tax exemption. Otherwise, they will be taxed on a threshold of just over $5,000 whereas the person receiving the pension has an exemption of over $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It is beyond belief that the Government's policy should be to force people to take a part pension in this situation. It is beyond belief that other taxpayers have to bear the burden of an anomaly such as this. I hope the Minister will clarify this matter and see that this anomaly is abolished. I say again in concluding that I have dealt with matters that deal with four quite small sums of money, but they are significant to those who pay tax and to those who are involved and are relevant to the Appropriation Bill debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to add another fact that I think is important to the deliberations of people in receipt of superannuation. I understand what Senator Reid was saying and I appreciate very much her point and would not want to be seen as being in support of anomalies. But in considering the benefits of people in retirement, there are many who have not enjoyed the tax concessions throughout their working life while people in receipt of superannuation certainly have. I would certainly also appreciate that some receivers of superannuation have modest superannuation indeed and probably only enjoyed modest tax concessions, but they have had that over their working life and some kind of consideration of these issues should take that into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid also mentioned higher education and pointed out that the Government has dramatically increased the number of tertiary places. She suggested that it is a bit sad that the funding has fallen as a percentage of gross domestic product. I am not in a position, nor do I have the figures here, to say whether that has been a real increase. Presumably, there would be some difference if we looked at the figures. In providing those extra tertiary places, the Government has also changed the funding for tertiary institutions, taking, as I understand it, a large amount of money previously going to tertiary institutions and reallocating those funds to research funding. The amount of money that previously was paid to tertiary institutions directly for them to allocate for research is now differently directed, but perhaps it does not get to the education institutions under the same vote. </PARA>
<PARA> In mentioning education briefly, we cannot overlook the enormous benefits and contribution of this Government's policies over the past seven years in dramatically increasing the number of tertiary education places, and introducing the higher education charge that means that nobody is disadvantaged as they enter education but are able to return, through tax revenue, some modest contribution to the cost of their education. With the reallocation of research funding we have seen a dramatic increase in the way in which students-postgraduate students in particular-are able to continue their studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make clear that I do not wish to fight with Senator Reid on this matter but I want to add the consideration that the scholarship payments to postgraduate students are now considerably increased and most postgraduate students are exempt from paying the higher education charge. The Government is more than aware of the importance of providing funding to assist not only the development of more research but also to encourage our fine young researchers to not flee this country. We do not want to see a brain drain from Australia. The Government's proposals have made quite clear the intention of its support for research. The way in which that has been taken up indicates that many young Australians are very pleased to partake of that assistance and to contribute to the pool of intelligence in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to talk about, as I have in this place before, the dramatic increase in child-care funding and the benefits of that to Australian families. We have heard many claims, particularly from the Opposition, that this Government's policies are very damaging to families. The Government's child-care policies are exactly the opposite. The contribution to family income as a result of the extension of fee relief to public child-care centres, to non-profit child-care centres and, from 1 January, to private child-care centres means that those families currently paying for child-care will see a reduction in their fees. Fee relief has been extended to families with an income of up to $56,200, where previously the cut-off point had been $38,600. The fee relief has been extensively increased and that will contribute to family income by making child-care more affordable and more available. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have we extended fee relief dramatically-as I have said in this place on behalf of the many of us who are committed to the public child-care arena and its standards of support, that has required a change in Labor Government policy-but we are prepared in the name of economic reasonableness to see that change implemented, and provided, and the only proviso we have put on it is that the minimum standards of care in the public child-care arena be extended to the private child-care arena. The private child-care centres in this country mostly do reach those standards of minimal care, and I do not believe that the users of many centres will be denied the fee relief. It is not improper for government to set standards of child-care and to require those minimum standards-with some plus and minus-to be the same across the nation. We have also had evidence in this place that the standards of child-care vary from State to State. If there are other differences, it is not unreasonable for the Government, with its introduction of fee relief and the introduction of the accreditation committee, to take responsibility for seeing an agreement or uniformity of minimum standards for child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, all child-care centres will be automatically deemed to be accredited from 1 January and all users will be entitled to the fee relief. Over time, as the accreditation standards are established and the necessary implementation is put in place, those centres will be visited and the subsequent ratification of the accreditation will be more formally established. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefit is not only as a result of the extension of fee relief but also from the dramatic increase in the number of places. Over five years, there will be an increase of 78,000 child-care places around Australia. It is estimated that up to 90,000 low to middle income families currently using Commonwealth subsidised child-care centres will benefit from the increase in fee relief. As I explained, that is through the extension of the cut-off for family income from $38,600 to $56,200. It is also estimated that up to 35,000 families with children in the not-for-profit centres will enjoy fee relief by 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate at which fee relief is withdrawn for every dollar earned over $370 a week has been reduced so that it allows for the extension of fee relief to those with much higher family incomes. It is very important to remind the Senate again that these reforms not only go into a dramatic increase in child-care places, but a very dramatic increase in the extension of fee relief will be of huge benefit to families by providing them with the capacity to retain more of their family income. In effect, that will put money into their pockets-money that will no longer have to be outlaid on child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> The serious requirement of child-care cannot be overlooked. We have moved away from the language of dragging children from their mother's breast and forcing women into the work force. That is some kind of modest shift in debate; but I do not think it is too much of a modest shift in terms of understanding what women in Australian society are doing. Many of them are choosing to exercise their option to work, full time or part time, now that they have access to quality, affordable, child-care. I do not believe it is the Government's business to interfere with how people make choices. It is our business to provide facilities to allow them to make those choices. Women in Australia are using child-care centres for many reasons, the most important being so that they can enjoy employment. That contributes to family income, although for many people using child-care it contributes to a single parent income. Further, many women are using child-care centres to have the opportunity to study, to train, to get some tertiary accreditation. They are looking to longer term prospects for their own lives and the benefits for their families, including their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Women are using child-care centres for what is called occasional care-for all the numbers of things that women have to do, choose to do and want to do when it is not particularly helpful to have little children along at the same time. We have talked of the importance of hospital visits, and even such things as dental appointments and so on are often managed much more easily when one knows that one's children are happily catered for in a child-care centre. There are women in this country who exercise different options for their child-care. We are interested in ensuring that those provisions are looked after too, that is, women have opportunities and choices. Under the Budget allocation there have been dramatically increased amounts of money for fee relief and extra places in child-care, and I think that this Government deserves great credit for that and it should be acknowledged and appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> That contribution in child-care does not stand without relationship to other initiatives taken by the Government for and on behalf of children. There has been a dramatic increase in payments for children or to parents for children. Benchmarks were set by Minister Brian Howe when he was Minister for Social Security. Those benchmarks, in terms of the cost of maintaining children or as assessed payments on behalf of children, are now enshrined in legislation and are indexed. That is the first time that has ever happened in this country. It is one of those benefits or landmark steps that do not get the acknowledgment that is due to them: because those payments are indexed, they will never fall without a change of legislation. I have never understood that it is the intention of the Opposition to reduce those payments. Indeed, I think that the Government has appreciated its support for those initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Family allowance supplement-a payment to families on low incomes, either not working or in the work force-has made a dramatic difference to low income families. It has been one way, though not the complete way, in which that poverty trap has been met. It enables people to move from being on a pension back into the work force so that they will not lose all the payments for and on behalf of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> When this is considered along with the two stages of the child support legislation that has been introduced into this place-in which the Government has appreciated that it requires or expects, as do most Australians, that parents have a responsibility to support their children, whether or not they have the custody of those children-there is shown a pattern of concern and regard for the values of fairness that Australian society so strongly endorses, particularly the targeting of that assistance to those on the lowest income. The payments for children cover family incomes up to $56,000 in respect of child-care, and beyond that for family allowance. The Government recognises the importance of assisting families with children in order to enable those families to exercise some choice in the way they provide for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area which has not received much comment but which I believe is important is the contribution under the Community Services and Health portfolio of ongoing funding announced in last year's Budget-a figure of $6.4m over four years-to examine the best way to assist with home birthing in this country. There is a growing indication from the community-very strong in some areas-for a requirement for changes in the process of birth and a desire to move away from the interventionist hospital birthing processes. In some of our large hospitals considerable change is already happening so that `birthing centres' is the phrase that is used about the labour wards in those hospitals. As well as that, some babies are being delivered at home by qualified midwives or by doctors with the necessary qualifications, or both. At the moment, the Government is still looking with the States at the best ways to provide remuneration payments, in particular to those in attendance upon people who have home births. </PARA>
<PARA> Some very interesting figures released from a study in New South Wales this year give one considerable pause in terms of the number of women who would have either instrument births or caesarean sections. The figures are very much higher than the World Health Organisation standards that are reasonably set for a country such as Australia. In some pockets of this country the number of interventions in the child birth process is a cause for grave concern. Furthermore, it is a cause of great pain, suffering and anxiety for the women involved. The home birthing program which is funded by this Government to investigate the best ways in which to proceed from now on deserves our appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to move on to make a few comments about another area of real interest to me, that is, the allocation of research moneys under two particular headings. One is the increase in the allocation to Australian medical research. It is a very considerable allocation of $45m for capital works for medical research institutes over the next five years. I think that is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to excellence in research at all levels, but in particular, in terms of this funding allocation, to medical research. </PARA>
<PARA> In some areas Australia is quite clearly a world leader in its medical research. Indeed, so good are some of our researchers that they are being poached by other countries-at a considerable loss to Australia. I think that we do have ways of patenting intelligence, but we need to look at how we can patent the people involved. I do not know that we can ever hope to do that. Indeed, the whole patenting of intelligence is a question of considerable aggravation. I would like to think that at some stage we could become a world where knowledge was valued for its own sake and not bought and sold, but at the moment the knowledge and the expertise of Australian research are being bought and sold. I am very pleased to see this commitment from the Government to further allocations for medical research so that we may see a continuation of the excellence of medical research. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Peter Baume recently spoke to the annual report of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). If I had not been occupying the chair at the time, no doubt I, too, would have spoken to that report. I can only confirm, reiterate and support the remarks made by Senator Peter Baume about the excellence of medical research in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that under this Government there is a specific allocation for medical research under the women's agenda. In 1990-91 the National Health and Medical Research Council is supporting nearly $8m worth of research into the area of women's health. I am delighted to see that, because for too long areas of women's health have not been main ticket items for the allocation of research dollars. It is important that new money has gone into that area of NHMRC research. I endorse that and I am delighted to see it there. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of research allocation that has interested me-indeed, I asked a question about it yesterday-is the establishment of cooperative research centres in this country. It is an exciting initiative where we hope to see an optimal wedding of the groves of academe and the halls of industry, if that is the right phrase. This wedding will provide for the development of research targeted in a slightly different way. It will be targeted with a view to its application, but in no way doing away with or in any way denigrating the importance of pure research, so-called. Indeed, one of the important challenges for the cooperative research centres-I think that the Minister said that 120 people had applied for the funding of such centres, although I am not sure of the figure-is that 15 of them will be established in the near future. That funding over four years will reach a figure of $100m a year, in 1991 dollars, by 1994-95. That is a very significant commitment to implementing the new wedding of industry and science in research. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two areas of problem for those research centres. The first is the definition of intellectual property and patenting. Indeed, those people involved with the cooperative research centres, I believe, have established a committee-or one is about to be established-to deal with this thorny issue. To whom does the wealth that emerges from any of the research developments belong? Does it belong to the university, to the individuals or to industry? If it belongs to them all, on what kind of formula is it shared or divided among them? I know that this very important issue is receiving considerable thought and development. It is something like the challenge of patent law, but it is also a little different. I would be very interested to keep an eye on it to see the outcome of that, particularly as the benefit of that will accrue to Australia to further Australian research and to further development of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of the cooperative research centres is that in this country we have, again and again, invented and patented wonderful new systems, machines and mechanisms, but Australia suffers terribly from the challenge of having to find sufficient venture capital or risk capital to get many of those initiatives or inventions up and running. It is a question that I have raised on a number of occasions. Indeed, I believe that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other Ministers are seriously addressing the question of how we can urge our financial institutions to address the question of venture capital or risk capital in this country. It is a very big challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the previous Minister, Mr Barry Jones, would tell us that in America the large institutions would reckon a return of one in 10 of the research projects that industry adopted was a good return on their investment. That means that they must have some understanding and an expectation of writing off some of their investment. I do not think Australia has reached that stage yet, and if these cooperative research centres are to return to the country the benefits that are expected with their development, we will have to see not only an understanding of the apportionment of intellectual property and its returns but also the appropriate venture and risk capital to support the development of some of the initiatives and inventions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to make a few remarks about the very problematic and difficult debate that has been in the community in the last few days about the care of the aged folk in this country. I was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes not too long after I came into the Senate. I believe that one of our recommendations suggesting that there should be a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities for people in nursing homes was supported by everybody on that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been very disappointing and somewhat shocking to see the way that debate has run in this community over the last few days. I am particularly disappointed for two reasons. Firstly, the opposition to this charter of residents' rights and responsibilities seems to have originally emerged from some representatives of the Catholic church, subsequently supported-as I read my newspapers-by some representatives of other religious organisations. I find it very disappointing because those organisations have been the standard setters for adequate, beautiful, dignified care in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> When people in this country sought to find a place in a nursing home, it was very often as a highest priority with the religious or not for profit charitable nursing homes. Practised in those homes for many years was the sort of attention and care that took regard of treating people with dignity, of providing services and care for them, of their individual differences. The very sorts of things that have been written in this charter of residents' rights and responsibilities I thought were best practised almost as an example to the rest of us in those very nursing homes. In fact, I am a bit shocked that the religious organisations did not come out and say, `We strongly endorse this because that has been our practice for many years'. I think we could say that in large part it has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not accusing anybody of anything. I wish the Opposition would stop ascribing intention and motive to me. I am simply saying that the way this debate has gone is a matter of disappointment and sadness to me when a charter of residents' rights that was a recommendation-I think a unanimous one, but I will not insist on that-from the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes appreciated the importance of acknowledging the rights of people in their last years and, in particular, recognised that some nursing homes were not providing that standard of care or regard for people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am disappointed to see the way this debate has gone because I thought the standard setters in the nursing home industry were those religious and charitable or not for profit nursing homes. I am surprised that they would not have been the first to endorse this charter of rights precisely because they have been doing it in the largest part. </PARA>
<PARA> This charter of residents' rights and responsibilities is a responsible and reasonable statement of rights, going not only to the rights of residents but also to their responsibilities. This is not weighted entirely on one side. In essence it is a recognition that once people have been moved to a nursing home they should be able to expect the same kind of regard for their rights as they would have had in their own home; for example, the right to privacy, the right to privacy with their banking account, the right of access to their money and an expectation that that money would be protected on their behalf. All of us could probably tell tales of when things such as that were not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We would also expect that people might reasonably live much of their time, particularly if they are not bedridden, in ordinary clothes and not be required to live for years in pyjamas or nightclothes. We know that many people somehow feel less able to brave the world if they are not dressed in civvies or street clothes. It is one of those small, unspoken ways in which we treat or regard a person with a different kind of respect and right. </PARA>
<PARA> I am terribly disappointed that this debate has become a kind of objection to a notion of rights for people in nursing homes. The principal right, of course, is to adequate care. In our report we were able to show where some nursing homes failed miserably not only in the care of their patients but in delivering basic nursing and medical care, when patients had to be moved to a large public hospital that was able to restore many of them to good health-certainly not what they were receiving in one or two of the nursing homes. We all know of the report of one nursing home last week that was closed because of insufficient standards. I hope that this debate on human rights will get back to where it ought to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 tonight, I cannot help responding to some of the things that Senator Crowley has just been talking about in terms of the rights of residents of nursing homes. I do not wish to go into the matter in any great detail because I believe that there is another time for proper debate on this issue, but I would like to say that I believe that residents of nursing homes do have rights but that, equally, proprietors have rights that should not be overlooked. I do not believe that we should have to blackmail any of the proprietors into signing anything that runs counter to their beliefs purely on the basis that they will have their funding cut off if they do not sign on the dotted line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way in which Senator Crowley is sarcastically going tut-tut makes me believe that she agrees with Minister Staples in the way in which he is blackmailing the Little Sisters of the Poor and other nursing homes which have chosen to speak out on their beliefs. It all hums very much the same way in which there was blackmail to the States that they either drop their alcohol limit from 0.08 to 0.05 or run the risk of having their road funding reduced. At a stage when they have had so little road funding from the Commonwealth anyway, to have that blackmail-and now this blackmail-is a very sad state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the proprietors must have rights. I happen to know personally of the way in which the Little Sisters of the Poor conduct their nursing homes. They have an excellent reputation within the industry and among the families of those who are residents. We should not start belittling those people purely and simply because they have beliefs that they have the courage to stand up and fight for. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I will return to the issue that I care to talk about tonight and that is the 1990 Budget. The Appropriation Bills are an accepted means of evaluating the state of the economy and its management by this Government. Even though the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has had the good grace to admit that he is glad that his Government does not have to face an election, there is still a massive air of unreality about his regime. As recently as 22 August the Treasurer stated that we are living through `the golden years of change'-what golden years they have been-having stated two years before that `we are now well on our way back to prosperity'. Heaven help us: we have a long way to go. In April last year he was talking of having proved Labor's supposedly superior economic strategy and performance. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know, if we are to be honest with ourselves, that there are people out there who are hurting who do not see these as the golden years of change and do not see any way back to prosperity. All they see is the rear end of the unemployment queues. Just who does the Treasurer think he is fooling? Australia is moving from a situation where business enterprise is crippled by interest rates to one where activity slumps through lack of confidence, the classic economic depression. Certainly he has succeeded in crushing economic activity in what at best is a recession-led recovery-only the nature of any recovery is uncertain. It is a national problem, but one that is having a particularly severe impact upon my State of Western Australia. Could it be that the Treasurer was anxious for the West to participate more directly in national experience by giving it an extra dose of his own carefully created recession?</PARA>
<PARA> With unemployment now standing at 7.4 per cent we are seeing the inevitable result of Labor's policy of dampening demand through interest rates while neglecting productivity and the control of inflation. Over the past year on a national level there has been the loss of 55,000 jobs in the wholesale and retail sectors, and 19,000 jobs lost in the hospitality area. I might say that the hospitality industry is forecasting an even gloomier picture in the near future. Australia is down 36,000 manufacturing and 16,000 construction jobs. And these are meant to be the golden years!</PARA>
<PARA> Where have jobs increased? You guessed it-in the Public Service, in public administration, where however good a job is done it can only be supported by the taxes of a diminished private sector. The number of full time job losers has risen from 150,000 to 219,000. These are, in the words of the Treasurer, the golden years! In Western Australia we are not only crippled by the Hawke Labor Government; we have the double-barrelled crippling effect of the Lawrence Labor Government that has wasted thousands upon thousands upon millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. No-one can deny that because, after all these years, it is now on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia unemployment now stands at 8.7 per cent, the highest of any mainland State. Since July, youth unemployment has risen from 15.6 per cent to over 20 per cent, with young workers being sacked at 18, thanks also to an unrealistic wage structure that this Labor Government has not tried to change. It would simply prefer to see these young people out of work, never getting the experience that will lead them on to any career path or future for themselves as the years go by. High youth unemployment is directly related to a fall in jobs, particularly in the retail sector which is of course highly exposed to falls in economic activity and consumer confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas on a national level-according to an Australia and New Zealand Banking Group survey-there was a 40 per cent fall in advertised jobs from April last year to September, in Western Australia the fall has been 65 per cent-25 per cent more than the national average. While Australia-wide-according to figures released on 2 October by the Department of Employment, Education and Training-there was a 46 per cent drop in professional and trade job places over 12 months, the Western Australian figure was 68 per cent. The last three months had seen a 22 per cent drop in these Western Australian job places against a 12 per cent national drop. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia is really hurting. What is this Government trying to do about it? What is the Lawrence Government trying to do about it? The answer is absolutely nothing. Figures released on Tuesday show a further decline in vacancies to 50 per cent below the level of the same three months to October 1989, with the decline in Western Australia still running above the national average. While Western Australians who have jobs now consider themselves lucky-lucky indeed they are-they are hurting worse than the national average in the fruition of Labor's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation that was 7.7 per cent in 1989-90 reached 8.6 per cent in Perth, while wages in Western Australia rose 4.6 per cent compared with a national rise of 6.6 per cent. One does not need to be a genius in mathematics to realise that this adds up to a big decline in purchasing power. Indeed, in 1988-89 household expenditure in Western Australia rose above the national weekly average at $512 compared with $502. </PARA>
<PARA> Bankruptcies is another problem pertaining particularly to Western Australia, but needless to say it is a problem right across the country. In Western Australia they reached nearly 1,200 in 1989-90, a rise of 34 per cent over the previous year. On a national level, the 9,100 bankruptcies represented only an 11 per cent increase. When I say `only an 11 per cent increase', I do not mean that to be interpreted as saying that is not too bad. The fact of the matter is that yet again the national average is 11 per cent and Western Australia has had a 34 per cent rise in bankruptcies. Not for the first time I must remind the Senate that bankruptcies are an indication of a far larger number of businesses that cease trading before they reach this point. They also mean that unpaid debts can spell grave difficulty for other small enterprises that are their creditors. </PARA>
<PARA> The business community in Western Australia knows exactly what we face. The latest quarterly survey of business opinion across all major industry sectors follows an equally pessimistic survey of the June quarter. With one per cent of firms declaring conditions good and expecting an improvement, 77 per cent stated that conditions were poor and 75 per cent expected them to remain poor in the December quarter, despite its traditional boost. They understand that people simply have not got the money to go out and buy things. They do not have the money for luxuries. They are simply battling to stay alive; battling for survival. Yet the Government went absolutely cock-a-hoop today. To see the Prime Minister and Treasurer on the television news one would think they had won Lotto single-handedly because there has been a marginal drop in inflation today. The reality is that that will not help anybody who has lost a job in recent months or is about to lose a job, particularly this side of Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixty per cent of firms reported reduced sales turnover and 41 per cent expect it to fall in December, and that is leading up to Christmas. Fifty-five per cent report lower profitability and 37 per cent have experienced a fall in employment, with 35 per cent expecting to reduce it in the December quarter as against 9 per cent looking forward to increasing it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ominous that 43 per cent reported greater labour costs per unit with 9 per cent stating the reverse. So the trend is clearly there. Business is hurting and the economy is in recession but, oh no, we have this little game going on with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer not wanting to say the word `recession'. They would get far more respect from everyone concerned if they were honest and up front and said, `Yes, we are in recession and yes, there is a possibility of turning it around'. But to do that they have to change policy direction. They are not prepared to take the hard decisions. Therefore, we can expect the decline to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also highly significant that 52 per cent of all businesses surveyed expected capital expenditure to decline over the next year. We must consider that as against the 12 per cent expecting it to rise. We are seeing the lowest level of capital expenditure in over a decade, representing a level 15 per cent below that of the 1982-83 recession. That is the period that we, in the Opposition, get rammed down our throats. Day in day out Government members say that things were crook back in 1982-83. Things in 1982-83 pale into insignificance compared to today. But are those opposite prepared to admit it? No. Here we are 7 1/2 years down the track, after those opposite came to government, yet they still blame the Fraser years for their economic ills and woes and policy decisions of today. So much for the claims of this Government that those days were worse than the current crisis. Not even the harshest critics of the Fraser Government could honestly say that the 1982-83 slump was deliberately engineered, unlike the Keating recession that we are going through today. </PARA>
<PARA> Until now, a superficially healthy picture of the Western Australian overall economy could be maintained because of the profitability of the minerals sector. Even here, however, there is little room for further expansion with perhaps a one per cent annual increase in iron ore. No export industry is helped by Labor's monetary policy, which has resulted in an over-valued dollar. It would be well for this Government to be more aware of the role of mining in preventing a total economic disaster. Only a few months ago it was considered smart politics to kick the mining industry by such landmark pieces of political opportunism as the Coronation Hill decision. If this Government continues to prostitute itself to the greenies and not make the tough decisions that will see the economy of this country pick up, we will see ourselves going further down into the mire. </PARA>
<PARA> It is such a tragedy. Not only is it the Government's economic decisions that are affecting this country today, particularly the mining sector, but it is also the Government's dealing that it has done for cheap, quick votes. Additionally, the industrial relations policy ensures that we are viewed by overseas as an unreliable exporter of minerals. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, if the tough decisions were made, and made now, maybe there would be some chance. I admit that they should have been made months ago. Even if they were made now there would be a chance. But no, we see the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying, `Steady as she goes'. Steady as she goes is right-steady as we sink further. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing and construction sectors are notoriously subject to rapid fluctuations. The story from Western Australia points once again to a massive slump caused squarely by the interest rate policy of the Hawke Labor Government. Now that interest rates are declining at 15 1/2 per cent to 16 per cent for home loans, this still being a rather large figure, the housing industry must contend with a general crisis of confidence. Yet, as I say, today the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are excited because a few elements have led to a minute reduction in inflation. One is the price of housing, which has come down. Is it any wonder?</PARA>
<PARA> The price of cars has come down. Is it any wonder? Car factories-such as Ford Motor Co. of Aust Ltd-are having to close because they have too many cars. The dealers are having to sell their cars at greatly reduced prices. Is it any wonder that the cost of motor vehicles has come down? They cannot give them away, let alone sell them. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing starts from January to August this year are down by 27 per cent compared with the same period in 1989 with a 33 per cent decline for all residential units. In Perth, 21,000 housing starts in 1988-89 fell to 12,000 the following year, a drop of 43 per cent, with a further decline to 11,000 anticipated for the year 1990-91 despite a most positive campaign by the housing industry to encourage new home purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the industries to try to boost their own markets. It is highly desirable and it is necessary. But when they are being strangled from a position that they cannot change because their marketplace simply does not have any money, what else can happen other than these disastrous figures I am referring to tonight?</PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia overall there was a fall of over 10,000 housing starts from 1988-89-a fall of 38 per cent. The bottom line significance of these figures is that the industry knows that it is in a worse situation now than in 1982-83 when Labor rode to power in Western Australia on community anxiety and a depressed housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Things are a darned sight worse today than they ever could have been back then. People are now seeing the exact results of the Burke leadership in Western Australia, the Dowding leadership in Western Australia and now the Dr Lawrence leadership in Western Australia. The events of recent weeks with various trials in Perth have really started to make people wonder about what they actually lived under in those years and the waste of taxpayers' money that has gone on ad nauseam, unchecked and unaccounted for. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment in the home building industry is often disguised by the fact that many subcontractors are down to a three day week. But the loss of income here is a further component of the Western Australian version of the Keating recession. But has anything been done? No. We just hear `Don't worry about it. Hide the west across the Nullarbor'. </PARA>
<PARA> Further hard evidence of the havoc wrought by the Hawke Labor Government in Western Australia appears in the biennial review of the Master Builders Association, which reveals that there has been a 15 per cent decline in the 53,600 construction work force in the year to August. Over the 12 months, 6,600 full time jobs have disappeared in the Western Australian construction industry and unemployment runs at 8.8 per cent. While the jobless have risen by 2,400, the number employed has fallen by 10,000. This points to a more serious consequence of the Keating recession, with the permanent loss of skilled labour storing up industrial inflationary pressure in any revival in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In September, 133 advertisements for skilled on-site workers represented a further 6 per cent decline since August. In one month, there was a further 6 per cent decline and the lowest level in five years since the monitoring series first began. The demand for starting trades-brick- layers and carpenters-is down to one twentieth the level of 1989. That is just a bit more than what could be called a `seasonal variation'. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also that, on top of the problems that lead back to the failure of the Hawke Labor economic management, the review notes that the latest disguised Labor tax, the training guarantee scheme, could impose `some hardship during a period of reduced activity'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only a few months ago that Labor and the Australian Democrats imposed this tax on the business community with the recession clouds looming, showing once more their lack of concern for private enterprise. We raised the concern in that debate that it was looking very likely that we would be going into a recession, and we asked the question, to which we never received an answer, why the Government and the Democrats sought to impose another tax on business at such a crucial time. But, no, the marriage of the Labor Party and the Democrats went ahead and business copped the extra taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sign of the times that one leading Western Australia company, Bunnings Ltd, reports a 39 per cent decline in operating earnings, deferment of a new headquarters, a four-day week, staff cuts of 450 and a 20 per cent reduction in dividend. This is a company in which Western Australians invest for steady income and growth. Had such a firm succumbed to the lure of heavy borrowing it would be in dire straits indeed. It is no thanks to the policies of this Government that this respected local company still keeps its head above water. Again, as a leading timber producer it has suffered from the disinformation propaganda of environmental extremists that this Labor Government has cynically encouraged. I certainly hope that the Government is going down the path of ditching those extremists. It is not that I am not environmentally aware-we in the coalition are very much environmentally aware and our record proves that, dating right back to the Menzies era. But we cannot afford to have Australia conned by a group of extremists in the way in which they have conned the country to date and conned this Government in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> While there can be no question that the Western Australian business sector and economy are suffering because of the failure of the economic management of the Federal Labor Government, the State Labor Government, as I say, has also played its part. Of the $425 in extra tax that it is estimated Western Australians will pay this year-a real rise of 1.5 per cent-$336 is the work of the Federal Labor Government and $89 is the work of the State Labor Government. In order to meet the actual expenditure forecasts for 1990-91 of a State Government confronted by its own squandering of public money in WA Inc., another $293 from each Western Australian taxpayer may be necessary. The dishonesty and incompetence of Dr Lawrence's Government will be visited, to a great extent, on a business community that must pay the bulk of taxes and charges. It is no accident that the exemption level for payroll tax- $320,000-is the lowest threshold of any State. </PARA>
<PARA> The slump in the housing industry has been intensified because construction by Homeswest is down by 36 per cent, while the State Labor Government indulges in acts of ideological grandstanding in building a handful of units on prime riverfront land in north Fremantle, or paying people out of taxpayers' money to tap phones. That is where the taxpayers' money goes-on little exercises like that. It is absurd that Western Australians are forced to pay $6,500 a month for a private investigator to tap phones. That is just remarkable. Meanwhile, on 14 December, Wills Industries, a clothing firm that supplies 200 jobs and $10m to the local economy, will close down and move to South Australia. Another straw in the wind; another failure for Western Australia; another failure that can be directly attributed to the policies of both the Federal and State Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural crisis is another major component of the grim economic reality in Western Australia. Of the State's 16,000 broadacre farms, 1,200 could be at very serious risk and all are feeling the effect of falling incomes and constant costs. This year the average farmer is set for a trading loss of $193,000 compared with a $3,000 profit for 1989. Many have less than $20,000 a year with which to support their families, compared with $28,500 in 1988-89. This Government deliberately brings about policies that are not designed to help the rural sector because it believes that it will never get that sector's vote. That is cynicism of it. Because it is the wealthy rural sector the Government wants to put an assets test on it. Yet earnings are now less than $20,000 a year per family. I would like to see some of the Ministers in this place trying to feed their families on $20,000 or less. </PARA>
<PARA> An 18 per cent drop in the value of rural production, posting a loss of $1.6 billion for the Western Australian economy and the possible exodus of 5,000 from country towns, shows clearly that the farmers' problem is the State's problem. Even farmers who are free of debt will expect a $30,000 loss this year. I have no intention of standing here and blaming the Government for the fall in world wheat prices, falls in the demand for wool, or for the structure of wool marketing. I do, however, blame Labor economic management, with its high interest rates and the overvalued dollar that results, for adding to the difficulties that the rural sector faces. Interest rates are a very real part of the picture when the average debt for 5,800 wheat farmers stands at $147,000; when average farm costs of $141,000 include a $14,000 interest rate bill; and when it is estimated that farmers require 80 per cent equity to survive the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> It reflects emphatically on the Treasurer's mismanagement when the Director of the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia joins the Western Australia Farmers Federation and the State Minister for Agriculture in calling for a lowering of the value of the dollar. It reflects upon the unreality of the approach of this Labor Government that on 9 October the Prime Minister evidently thought that he could talk the dollar down by stating that he was not happy with its value. It is getting beyond a joke. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is not sufficiently conscious of the fact that every one cent change in the United States-Australian dollar rate means a $170m difference in national farm income. It is typical of this Government's underlying attitude to the rural community that at a time of such grave crisis it is moving to deprive many farming families of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. Only a Government that was fundamentally uncaring about families that generally do not vote for it could bring in an arbitrary assets test with a $300,000 threshold that the Prime Minister admits was plucked out of the air. While there may be a proper case, there is certainly not a case in these circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are addressing the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 and the very important aspects of this year's Budget in relation to the broad community. In the time available to me this evening I will also attempt to look at the Budget in the context of the recent announcements and statements of the Special Premiers Conference and relate those two matters. In the time that will be available to me tomorrow I would like to look very specifically at how the Budget impacts on northern and regional Australia and how the Budget's issues, which have been identified in so many matters during the consideration of the Estimates by this Senate, should also be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In turning to the relationship between this year's Federal Budget and the Premiers Conference, I think it will be very important to note that regional and northern Australia will not be fooled by the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the five Labor Premiers have very substantially changed ground at the Premiers Conference. The total economic ineptitude of the present Hawke Labor Government has become so apparent and the profligacy has become so transparent that the Special Premiers Conference of the last couple of weeks has seen that very significant changing of the goalposts by Mr Hawke, Mr Keating and the five Labor Premiers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only through the actions of the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, and the Chief Ministers of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory that we were able to see that the policy stances taken at the Premiers Conference were consistent and holding to the long term planning and development that they had been advancing for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look very carefully at the communique that was issued, we can analyse the areas where it has been acknowledged that there were past inefficiencies. To use the words of the communique, many areas of the economy need to be `competitive and flexible'. Why competitive? Why flexible? If the Hawke Labor Government had in any way had a decent agenda and a decent commitment to economic achievements for the past seven years, we would not now be in the hole or the mess that this country has arrived in. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now seen that it is going to be necessary for the Premiers to sit round the table in a number of very special conferences in order to get this whole process changed; and that is going to mean very fundamental changes in the five Labor States. They are the ones that are going to primarily feel the consequences and the winds of change that are going to have to go through not only issues such as their revenue raising capacity, but also the whole basis and undertaking of the way in which the financial relationships are tied up. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that there has been duplication of services between the Federal Government and the State governments, of course, has been very apparent over the past couple of years, but it has now become necessary to become involved in a very fundamental change to the whole principle of federalism. It will also be very interesting to watch and to target the changes that will be necessary at the next Labor national conference, because that is the body that will be indicative if the Australian Labor Party believes it has any hope of holding on to office federally or in any of the five Labor States. I think we are going to see a lot of blood on the floor between now and that national conference next year or whenever the Labor Party has the guts to get down and address some of those particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to look at the fundamental areas to which the communique of the Premiers has had to turn attention. Of course, there are the issues relating to regulatory reform, road transport changes, electricity generation and transmission, and the regulation of the financial institutions. These are all areas where the incompetence of the Labor Government has been so obvious, and it has been coming out particularly in the State arenas over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most telling part of the entire communique is this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The most efficient level for delivery will most often be at the State or Local Government level. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, does have a major impact on regional and northern Australia. In the Northern Territory, with which I am most familiar, that means that there will need to be very important reviews of Commonwealth agencies that still are being run from Canberra rather than transferred more appropriately to a Territory government. I refer to institutions such as the Office of the Supervising Scientist, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service administration of Kakadu and Uluru and, of course, the administration of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. It has to be acknowledged very seriously that these issues of function must be transferred back to the appropriate legislative body and, of course, that is the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very interesting to note an editorial in the Northern Territory News, the premier newspaper of the Northern Territory, on 2 November, when the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, Senator Bob Collins, took a severe caning from the Northern Territory News over statements that he had made with regard to the Premiers Conference communique that seemed to put him at odds with the Prime Minister. The headline was `NT needs full rights`, and the article brought out very seriously the fact that Senator Collins had walked away from a commitment to pushing the cause of full rights for the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the editorial writers have had a lot to pick up and they have certainly got a lot to catch. I will cover more of those northern Australia issues tomorrow. It is important to recognise that the Northern Territory needs to fall very carefully into many of these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The communique draws particularly on the controversial issue in the community at the moment-the environment. I was pleased to note a particular statement hidden right down in the fine print. Of course, there is a lot of commitment to necessary changes in the environment, but let me read one particular statement:</PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>the participants in the Premiers Conference-</PARA>
<PARA>further agreed that this meeting would provide a good opportunity to identify the scope for establishing a clearer division of responsibilities between the two levels of government in implementing policies and programs for ecologically sustainable development in Australia's resource industries. It would also assist governments in clarifying the practical measures through which they could be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>That commitment to resource development and resource security is one of the most important announcements from that particular conference. The fact that five Labor Premiers, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have acknowledged that in the resource area they have gone off the tracks and that there is a need to reverse and bring things back is going to provide a very clear situation of change-and that, of course, will also highlight the area where the national conference of the Labor Party will probably have the most problems next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that that statement will give a lot of power to the Prime Minister and the Labor Premiers for dramatic changes which, I hope, will be met in a commonsense way at next year's national conference of the Labor Party. If not, the economy of this country cannot meet up to its necessary challenges and change. We need to have that underpinning of resource security and resource development that is so essential to so many areas that are so terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be a test of this Government to come to grips with the challenges-the 101 and more changes-that have been proposed in the Premiers Conference. If the Government does not seek to implement these through its policies and its budgeting, then there will be no change or reversal of the dire straits that the country is currently in. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to acknowledge that things have been very wrong; that the Labor Party administrations at the Federal level and the State government level have been unduly restrictive and constraining on our economy. The duplication of services has been allowed to blow out and develop into something far worse than anything that we saw in the years of the Whitlam Administration. There has been this emphasis on the environmental assessment with a blinkered view, rather than also recognising and tailoring the resources area that needs to be addressed. The Premiers Conference statement is a most important guideline and an important change. In view of the time and the other constraints on the Senate, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to fix the amounts of the charges payable under the Act for the 1991 academic year. The amounts are shown in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The charges are payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Act relates. While the charge remains at the same proportion of the cost of a place as in 1989/90, the total revenue for 1990/91, estimated at $42.5 million, will be some $2 million less than the 1989/90 revenue due to the phasing out of the program. There have been no new enrolments since the end of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS (REFUNDS) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is two fold. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it will facilitate the payment by the Commonwealth of the refund of advance payments paid before 30 June 1990 by overseas students unable to undertake or complete courses of study in Australia. This may be by way of direct payments to the students or through loans to institutions. In cases where institutions close as a result of the tighter entry and stay criteria, the Commonwealth will refund outstanding living allowance payments to eligible overseas students already in Australia and provide limited financial assistance to institutions who offer places to displaced students. The Commonwealth's liability in these circumstances is limited to those students who had enrolled and paid fees on or before 24 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill will secure the Commonwealth's position in relation to recovery of monies paid out in refunds on behalf of institutions in difficulty by clarifying matters to do with, for example, evidentiary issues and access to documents relevant to assessment and recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has no direct financial impact but there is an allocation of up to $50 million which will be included in appropriation Acts for the purposes of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The export of education services has grown considerably since 1986 when the policy of encouraging institutions in Australia to accept full-fee paying overseas students came into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Those policy changes have mainly focused on overseas students in our public sector institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is satisfied that with respect to public sector institutions, standards are consistently high, current entry and monitoring policies are working soundly, and there has been a significant contribution to export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> However, many of our overseas students are undertaking short courses, mainly in English language, at private sector institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that our chief markets for higher education courses are in Asia, prior English language study is necessary for most overseas students enrolling in our tertiary institutions and the ELICOS institutions provide a valuable bridge to tertiary study. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 there were fewer than 1400 English language students in Australia, and about 500 students in other non-formal, short courses. At 1 June this year, by contrast, there were 23,500 full fee overseas students studying in Australia in short courses provided by private institutions; 19,569 of these were enrolled in English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS). </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1986 and 1990, the number of ELICOS institutions had mushroomed from 19 to 105, of which about two thirds are privately owned, some apparently by overseas interests. </PARA>
<PARA> To fill this rapidly expanding capacity, it is clear that a number of these institutions marketed their courses vigorously, in ways which sometimes threatened the integrity of Australia's immigration program. In short, they concentrated their marketing efforts in certain countries whose nationals represented a high risk with regard to over-staying their visas. </PARA>
<PARA> You may be assured that the Government has taken all necessary steps to protect the integrity of Australia's immigration program. Since December 1986, when streamlined processing for student visa applications were introduced, entry arrangements have been under constant review and have been tightened as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> From July 1988, institutions were required to screen students for suitability to undertake their courses, and prospective students were required to pre-pay course fees and in some cases living expenses. Both institutions and students also needed to make declarations that they would meet their respective obligations under the overseas student program. Regrettably, not all institutions, as subsequently became apparent, behaved with probity in relation to monies paid in advance. It is this misconduct that has led to the need for this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> By the middle of 1989, it became clear that further government intervention in the program would be needed, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs had already identified China as a high risk country in terms of students overstaying with visas. Institutions were, nevertheless, recruiting heavily there and by June 1989 there was a backlog of some 26,000 student visa applications in Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA> In August, following the events of 4 June in Tiananmen Square, the Australian Government decided to temporarily suspend further recruitment of Chinese students. It also required those who had already applied to meet stricter entry criteria relating to age, previous level of educational attainment, and the relevance of intended course of study to future employment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, a further 12,000 student applications had been received in China, adding to the backlog. In large part, this was due to some institutions simply ignoring directions by the Australian Government to suspend recruitment temporarily. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1990, recruitment in China was allowed to recommence. However, rigorous new visa requirements were instituted, which were designed to establish that any applicant was indeed a bona fide student coming to Australia principally for the purpose of study. </PARA>
<PARA> Pre-visa assessment now ensures that only those students who have a high probability of approval are asked to commit themselves financially. Institutions are now not permitted to collect fees in advance from individual students until pre-visa assessment has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The accumulation of requests from rejected applicants for refunds of pre-paid monies, coming at the same time as a reduction of the number of new students enrolling in short courses due to the introduction of tightened visa processes, has led to cash flow problems in a number of colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, some of these institutions also failed to protect the funds advanced by students. By August this year, the Department of Employment, Education and Training estimated, on figures provided to it by institutions, that of the 17,500 rejected students, mainly Chinese nationals, some 12,000 refunds had been made. This left almost 6,000 students still waiting for the refund of their pre paid fees. The failure of a number of institutions to meet their refund obligation has had severe financial consequences for the rejected applicants. It has obviously damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole, and it has adversely reflected on Australia's commercial reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these considerations-particularly Australia's standing as a reliable trading partner-the Government has undertaken to pay the outstanding refunds to rejected students and pursue recovery action against those institutions who have not repaid the amounts owing. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the problems of the industry reveal a case of deregulation gone wrong. This represents an essential lack of understanding of the situation. Export of education services is, after all, a new area of economic activity for Australia and has been allowed to establish in an environment of very limited regulation; early on it was thought too much regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In a new industry such as this it is not surprising that there have been problems associated with its establishment. In the light of experience, however, we can now see that the growth has been too fast and that a greater degree of regulation is required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to ensure that all institutions providing education services to overseas students meet minimum national standards in terms of the service they provide, their facilities and their financial management. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government will be introducing legislation to establish a firm basis for the regulation of the private sector of the industry, in co-operation with the relevant State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the problems, provision of education services to overseas consumers must be recognised as a potentially significant source of foreign exchange earnings for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is well placed to develop as a centre of international education. Our advantages include:</PARA>
<PARA>* Congenial environmental amenity</PARA>
<PARA>* English language</PARA>
<PARA>* Similar time zone to east Asia</PARA>
<PARA>* Relative geographic proximity to Asia</PARA>
<PARA>* Facilities for pursuing cultural and religious activities</PARA>
<PARA>* Cost competitiveness, in terms of fees and living expenses</PARA>
<PARA> We need to be aware, as Ross Garnaut has pointed out, that education of foreign students in Australia does much more than merely provide the economic benefits of an export industry</PARA>
<PARA>* It increases the range of courses available to Australians</PARA>
<PARA>* It builds interpersonal links that are important to our economic, political and cultural links with the region</PARA>
<PARA>* It familiarises young Australians with the regional environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation we cannot afford to squander long term opportunities by xenophobic reactions to initial, short term problems. The export of education services is, and will remain, of great importance, both to our economic performance and to our framework of foreign relations, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that on some interpretations my position was misrepresented by Senator Tate during Question Time, and rather than leave any doubt I wish at the moment to clarify the position. Senator Tate, I think in the spirit of good fun, was referring to my contribution at the Liberal Party Federal Council meeting recently held in Brisbane, and in particular a speech I gave in support of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Liberal Party supports that Convention in principle but has several reservations. I want to take this opportunity simply to put the position correctly on the record so that anyone who may have misinterpreted what Senator Tate said can be put right. As I said, the Opposition parties recognise the work of the international community over the past 10 years in drafting a convention to set minimum standards of protection which should be afforded to children. We recognise that in particular there has been abuse of children in wars, in employment and in prostitution. These matters, together with others, have been dealt with in the Convention. We believe that steps taken to end these abuses should be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other provisions of the Convention which are clearly worthy of support; for example, those that declare the rights of children to protection from physical or mental violence, exploitation and abuse; exploitation in child labour; drug abuse; sexual exploitation and abuse; and abduction and exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> These and many other provisions of the Convention would be supported by all responsible people. Concern has, however, been expressed that some of the articles of the Convention as they are presently drafted do not recognise the rights and responsibilities of parents towards their children and may diminish the parent-child relationship. First, the Convention declares that children have the right to freedom of expression, a right described as including:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition parties are of the view that the expression of this right does not acknowledge the right and duty of parents to provide guidance to children on information they should receive in their formative years. That right and duty should be expressly stated in the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Convention declares the right of freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly. Again, this right is expressed in the Convention in such a way that it does not acknowledge the right and duty of parents to supervise the associations that their children keep. That responsibility should be expressly stated in the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Convention does not give adequate recognition to the rights and duties of parents with respect to the education as well as the physical, social and moral development of their children. Of course, earlier United Nations documents contain very clear statements of parents' rights and responsibilities with respect to the children's education and upbringing. Those rights and responsibilities were expressly stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and they should be contained in the present Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention provides that the parties may make reservations on the Covenant at the time of ratification. The Opposition believes that on ratification reservations should be made expressing the concerns I have outlined. Appropriate reservations should reinforce the spirit behind Article 5 and the preamble to the Convention, which recognise the importance of parental responsibilities. In the application of the Convention to Australia, the attitude of State governments will be vital, as most of the relevant laws are State laws. We understand that the Australian Government, although it has signed the Convention, has not yet made a decision on ratification. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our view that the Australian Government in ratifying the Convention should make the reservations of the nature I have mentioned in my short contribution. Certainly, if it is not ratified by the time the Opposition returns to government, it would be our intention to issue such reservations upon completion of consultations with State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note that Senator Tate in answer to a subsequent question seemed to indicate that the Australian Government was now coming around to the position that the Opposition has been advocating. It seemed from his answer that upon ratification the Australia Government is now likely to express reservations of the kind I have mentioned this evening. If that is the case, we are pleased that the Government has recognised the importance of the rights and responsibilities of parents in this issue and will make it clear to the international community in the form of reservations. If we come to government and the Government has in fact ratified the Convention without reservations, we will seek to take action by what means are available to us to amend the Convention consistent with the sentiment that we would have included in reservations had that option been open to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to hear that because it is a fairly non-political matter that I would have hoped Senator Collins might be interested in as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia. It is something that I was going to mention to Senator Collins quite often during this speech in seeking his support for it. It is something that I hope Senator Collins, as Minister responsible for northern Australia, would have a deep interest in. Senator Collins has an office in Townsville; he swans around in Townsville telling people how concerned he is and now he is saying he is glad he is going to leave here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wanted to talk about the extension of the Townsville Airport. It is very important for northern Australia in both a commercial way and a defence way. In terms of defence it is important in both a direct and an indirect way; that is, by expanding the infrastructure, the population and development in northern Australia, because that is really the best form of defence one could have for regions such as northern Australia, which are the front line of our defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia (Senator Collins) to take up with Cabinet this proposal to extend the runway at the Townsville Airport. Townsville Airport is a joint facility controlled by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Department of Defence. The Air Force owns the airport while the FAC administers landing charges and property rentals associated with the non-military activity at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Townsville Airport does not have the operational capacity and capability, either in length or strength, to allow unrestricted operational use of the most common aircraft used by international carriers. Almost every international commercial aircraft operating is presently unable to use the Townsville runway to land and take off with a full payload. That is an astonishing situation when one considers that the international airport at Townsville has been operational for almost a decade now. </PARA>
<PARA> The inadequate runway has been one of the greatest hindrances to the development not just of tourism but of the commercial aspects of the City of Townsville and the region it serves. While Cairns has prospered with the benefits of a pro-development city council and a privately owned airport, Townsville has gone nowhere with the exact opposite-that is, an anti-development and short-sighted city council, complemented by a publicly owned airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The city has lost countless tourism and development opportunities due to the lack of international flights, whilst local export industries find themselves having to send international cargoes by road either to Cairns or to Brisbane to air freight them out of the north. In addition to the commercial disadvantages now faced by the Townsville community because of the runway, the operations of the Air Force headquarters at Townsville are presently significantly limited by the runway. It is of some concern that many of the larger aircraft used for military transport in times of emergency would be unable to take off from the Townsville Airport with full loads. I am advised that the operations of FA18s would also be restricted by the inability of refuelling aircraft to take off from the Townsville Airport with full payloads and refuel mid-air. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the larger military aircraft used by the Americans, which in the event of an emergency should be using bases in Townsville if the threat came from the north, would be restricted in the use they could make of one of the northern operational defence bases to support our defence operations. It is a fact that some of our own aircraft would be incapable of operating to a full capacity from Townsville. Townsville is the headquarters of Australia's operational deployment force, and that is the force which is supposed to be ready to move in the event of an emergency. It combines different elements of the defence forces and it must be restricted by the fact that it cannot use the Townsville Air Force base in a fully loaded way because the airport runway is too short and not strong enough. Many honourable senators will be aware that the Department of Defence has allocated $100m to build a bare base 26 kilometres east of Weipa on Cape York to be known as Scherger base. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for the Scherger base is very strong on both sides of this chamber and although the coalition has raised some concerns about whether the base would be better situated on the east coast of Cape York, combining the operations with the runway operations for the Cape York space base, nevertheless, I am completely in favour of the construction of Scherger base and so is the Liberal Party. But I recognise that Cape York is an area of vulnerability in our defence capability until Scherger is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Cape York area is the only region not serviced by an adequate runway to permit continuous operations by high performance military aircraft. I understand that, as far as the Department of Defence is concerned, this is one of the most important bases yet to be completed because it gives that cover over the top of Australia. It seems extraordinary that the Government is about to spend $100m on a 3,050 metre runway in Cape York which will be used for only a couple of weeks a year except in an emergency when the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force in Townsville has a runway of only 2,600 metres which could have major shortcomings in the event of a serious threat to northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Townsville Thuringowa Development Board was considering asking the Government to postpone the construction of Scherger base by a year or so, in the hope that some of the money allocated to Scherger could be reallocated in the first year to the extension of the Townsville runway. Maybe the Department of Defence would not accept any reallocation of funds that have not already been allocated for Scherger considering that the ADF headquarters at Townsville is considered as fulfilling all present requirements with the existing runway. But the Air Force has told the Townsville Thuringowa Development Board that it would support any proposal to lengthen the runway short of providing its own funds to do so and that it would, in reality, welcome the upgrading of the runway. The Air Force, of course, is reluctant to spend its own money on the extension of the Townsville Airport because it, like all of the other defence forces in Australia at the present time, has been severely restricted by this Government's penny-pinching and mean attitude to adequate defence allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> My intention tonight is not to ask Cabinet to fund the Townsville runway extension for defence reasons alone, although defence is a very compelling reason. There are a number of other reasons that it should look at for the funding of the extensions. I want to touch upon a few of the commercial imperatives which would justify an extension of the Townsville Airport. The weight restrictions imposed on the airport make it difficult for the 12 or so overseas carriers with landing rights in Townsville to use it. It has become so difficult that many of them have given up trying. The weight restrictions imposed mean that carriers are in a position where they cannot bring in and take out a full load of paying passengers. Consequently, the profitability of bringing aircraft into Townsville falls into some doubt. It is also my understanding that the bilateral airline agreement and regulations between Australia and other countries are strict regulations which deny newcomers the flexibility of flying into one Australian port and out of another. I am advised that carriers would need to forgo some of the incoming seats they provide on established routes in order to take up services to places such as Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation seems ridiculous to me, given that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has made a commitment to a more liberal aviation environment, referring in particular to overseas airlines. Extending the runway would overcome one obstacle for incoming carriers, but the true opening up of the Australian skies, which my colleague Mr Jull has advocated for some time, needs to happen as well to develop the airline industry and the tourist industry in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is without doubt a tremendous tourist attraction through the Townsville region. Townsville is the sunshine capital of Australia. It has more days of sunshine than any other centre in Australia. It provides international tourists with a unique opportunity to enjoy the Barrier Reef, rainforests, historical outback towns like Charters Towers and Ravenswood, along with the highlights of Townsville itself, including the casino. I mention Magnetic Island in particular which is the only coastal tropical island in Australia that is developed as a suburb of a major city. It is an island where people can live, at a very reasonable cost, in a delightful setting. It is where tourists can go at a reasonable cost and enjoy all the facilities of a tropical resort. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent Qantas delegations to South East Asia have met with great response. There is an upsurge of interest in tourism into that area and the new service which Qantas has initiated between Townsville and Singapore direct has been booked out until well after Christmas and this shows an enormous interest in tourism to this part of the world. Unfortunately, the aircraft that Qantas can use on the Townsville-Singapore direct route are smaller aircraft-they are 767 Boeings-and even these cannot be fully laden because the runway at Townsville Airport is too short and not strong enough to allow fully loaded aircraft to take off. Apart from these tourist reasons, there are other commercial reasons for extending the runway and I have mentioned that the city is disadvantaged because of the limitations on air freight services out of Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the produce produced in northern Australia and north Queensland is in great demand overseas but a lot of it is of a very perishable nature, which means it has to be got out of northern Australia very quickly and into its point of destination. There is a great demand for prawns which are gathered in north Queensland and northern Australian waters. These go to Japan, but they have to be alive when they arrive in Japan. They cannot be frozen. They are the best prawns because the Japanese are prepared to pay for them, but they have to get there quickly and in a live state. That means that cargo freight from north Australia has to be upgraded. Certainly in the Townsville region, where a lot of these prawns would be exported from, the capacity is needed for additional air freight. </PARA>
<PARA> The mango industry, which is of particular significance in the north and an export trade which is flourishing, needs a regular and viable cargo service out of the Townsville region because Townsville would be the port for Bowen, and the Burdekin and Ingham areas, which produce a great majority of the mangoes for export. But unfortunately because of the runway strength, these exports cannot be loaded as often as should be, or in the capacity that is necessary on existing commercial international flights because of the runway limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third commercial reason for extending the runway is something which I know Senator Collins is very familiar with, that is, the likelihood that Townsville may be used as a maintenance base for international aircraft. It is well known that worldwide there is a shortage of maintenance facilities and maintenance staff. Airlines all over the world are increasing their fleets. They are keeping older aircraft flying longer and all of this has meant a very great increase in the maintenance facilities and maintenance staff needed. I am told that there is such a shortage that Qantas is having to maintain some of its aircraft overseas, even in Ireland, which would at times make one wonder. </PARA>
<PARA> Townsville is ideally situated for the location of a maintenance facility and maintenance staff. It is on the Pacific Rim. There is an enormous number of aircraft flying across the Pacific, into South East Asia and through New Guinea and Indonesia, and Townsville would be an ideal location for that facility. It has the international aircraft, it has large areas of land close to the runway and it has plenty of nearby real estate which is owned by the Federal Airports Corporation and the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Townsville Thuringowa Development Board first promoted this idea and, together with the regional projects investments program, is now working to attract a maintenance facility to Townsville. Already it has received positive expressions of interest from a number of companies, including a Hong Kong air freight operator, which is interested in coming to Townsville to establish a maintenance base, but it is reluctant to do it unless it can be sure that the Townsville base will be used by all manner of international airlines, and that it will be sufficient and capable of bringing in the aircraft it wants to service. </PARA>
<PARA> Now Minister Collins has given this pledge to the people of Townsville-and I am sure he will remember this and will support it again and again-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Townsville's airport runway would be extended if proposed aircraft maintenance facilities are established here. </PARA>
<PARA>This was an absolute commitment, and I know it is one that Senator Collins will abide by and will push. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know he will. I make that comment without any reservations. I am somewhat sad that the proposal that would have allowed a maintenance base there earlier this year was sent by the Government to New Zealand, and I think it has fallen flat over there at this particular time. Nevertheless, if a maintenance base can come, Senator Collins will certainly be to the fore in getting that airport extended and strengthened. I ask that Senator Collins might even take that action now and try to get the Cabinet to do it because it is really the chicken and egg approach-should it be extended first or should the maintenance base be established there first? The maintenance base people who are looking at it are a bit reluctant to come in until they can be sure the airport runway will be extended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I trust Senator Collins and I know that he is a man of his word and that he will do what he says. But maybe the people who are looking at establishing a facility there do not know Senator Collins as well as I do, and maybe they do not trust his word as much as I do. So maybe the runway should be extended first and then these maintenance people would have no doubt of the viability of Townsville as a base for that operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this is a great opportunity for the Government to show some real commitment to northern Australia with bipartisan support at all levels of government. The Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss, has signalled his intention to develop Townsville as a commercial and industrial capital, and I have no doubt that he would support the extension of this runway. The Queensland Tourism Minister is also strongly supportive of the Townsville tourist potential and has expressed the desire to have more international flights into the city. </PARA>
<PARA> The federal member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, is strongly in favour of upgrading for the reasons that I have just canvassed. The Labor Party State members, Mr Davies and Mr Smith, have expressed their support publicly, and even the ALP Mayor of Townsville, Alderman Mooney, has recognised that the extension of the runway would put in place one of the key elements for the city's development. I know that the Liberal and National parties do support that, and I guess that even the Australian Democrats would be in favour of something that would develop Townsville as a major regional centre in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Collins will take on board the things that I have been saying. A lot of it is not new to him and he has heard it from people before, but it is something that constantly needs pushing. It is something that has to be kept to the fore, and it is something that I hope Senator Collins would take before Cabinet. It may give him and his Cabinet colleagues something positive to think about rather than the distress I am sure they suffer every time they go to a meeting and see the dreadful state that the economy is in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But this will give him something to look forward to. It will give the Cabinet a bit of an uplift, something a bit positive and something it can do that can be assured of advancing Australia and not taking it along with as many of the other decisions that the Government has taken. But here is one where, with bipartisan support, maybe we can get that facility organised and operating. I know that Senator Collins, as I do, would very much like to see Townsville prosper, and this is certainly one way of doing it. I could suggest to Senator Collins-and this may be important to him and his colleagues because they probably need it-that he would get far more political points by succeeding with this airport than I ever will by raising it here this evening. But I do not mind about that, because if there is anything I can do to have even a minor part in removing perhaps Townsville's weightiest handicap, then that is satisfying enough for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do hope that Senator Collins and the Government may give some consideration to this matter and keep it firmly to the fore of the projects that they are considering so that the Townsville airport can be expanded. It has enormous commercial relevance, and it also has a very significant defence relevance as well. For all of those reasons, I would certainly hope that some work can be commenced and some positive statements made in the not too distant future on the extension of the runway for Townsville airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I say at the outset that it was not my intention originally to speak in the adjournment debate tonight, and as I understand the custom of the Senate on a Wednesday evening I will confine myself to a few brief remarks on some issues raised earlier this afternoon. Unfortunately, when matters related to the National Crime Authority (NCA) were raised in the Senate earlier this afternoon I was at a meeting on the Middle East, and there was insufficient time for me to respond and join the debate at the time. I must say also that the politics of the Middle East are perhaps more refined than some of the tactics of certain members of the Opposition on the NCA Committee. However there is little time and only a brief opportunity tonight to make a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has now been established in the Senate, there has been a wilful misrepresentation of the Government's position on the National Crime Authority Committee by some honourable senators opposite. In particular, there has been a concerted attempt to destroy the effectiveness of a committee of this Parliament. That is especially and peculiarly destructive where the committee concerned involves the oversight of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be of interest to the Senate to know that on Monday the NCA Committee went to Melbourne for public hearings on evaluation, and one or two extraordinary things occurred. These things occurred as a direct consequence of the malice demonstrated by some in the Opposition as to the Committee's workings. Unfortunately, that malice appears to be born of a frustration and obvious incapacity to grasp the real issues of law enforcement. It also appears to be born of a political perspective that chases tangents rather than endeavouring to concentrate on primary issues of substance, and it is born of a provincialism that is staggering in a national parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee on the NCA is chaired by Mr Ted Lindsay, MHR. He is a fine and dedicated individual. From time to time he incurs the ire of some in the Opposition because he simply refuses to be diverted from the responsibilities of the NCA Committee. He refuses to preside over a committee that rushes to judgment and behaves like a circuit court, seeking only to execute people or to annihilate reputations. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not resile from anything I said during the adjournment debate a week or so ago on the National Crime Authority and related matters. Nor should I. What I said was the simple truth. There is a clear Opposition strategy to ruin this Committee on the NCA as a functioning body. As far as some in the Opposition are concerned, if that damages the National Crime Authority as an organisation, so be it-that is the price the Opposition is prepared to pay. That is obviously something that the Government rejects out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall make a couple of brief observations about Monday's meeting in Melbourne of the NCA Committee. It is appalling to relate this but I think the Senate is entitled to know. It was not possible to have on the record a briefing for the Committee from Justice Phillips and his colleagues in the NCA. Hansard was excluded from the Committee meeting. It was excluded because Government Committee members believed-I think rightly-that the security of the briefing could not be guaranteed. That is certainly not a reflection on Hansard. Government members did not want to read the briefing in the Adelaide suburban newspapers the next day, and some of the Opposition members on the Committee believe that a headline in a suburban throwaway is of more importance and more significance than the integrity of the Committee, the objectives of the NCA or the obligations of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, the Chairman warned all the witnesses-including Mr Frank Costigan, QC-that no guarantee of confidentiality could be given. That is hardly surprising given what happened in the Senate the other night with the tabling of in camera evidence that had been given to the Committee. That action is probably the most irresponsible and most derelict behaviour that I have seen in 20 years of politics, State and Federal. I might add that in endeavouring to do his job as Chairman, Mr Lindsay confronts a difficult task. Some in the Opposition have set out to make that impossible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always the case with the Tory party. Some in the Opposition have clearly set out to make Mr Lindsay's job impossible. It is staggering that witnesses before the Committee on the National Crime Authority cannot be given any assurance of privacy, let alone confidentiality. When Mr Lindsay makes the valid political point that this is intolerable, he is abused for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee on the NCA now acts on the premise and on the basis well founded in fact that anything taken in camera will probably end up being the property of the Senate and the public property of all who care to listen, observe or read. For the Committee on the NCA to be obliged to work in that way is intolerable. I wonder how long it will be before commonsense, indeed sanity, prevails in the Opposition's ranks. On most other parliamentary committees that may not matter; it would simply make its deliberations very difficult. But on the NCA Committee it makes life intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reaffirm what I said the other night for the benefit of those honourable senators who may not be aware of the situation we face on the Committee on the National Crime Authority. Senator Collins also made reference to this point at the close of the debate. Members and senators who serve on the National Crime Authority are not supposed to leave material with their staff. We are obliged to handle this material personally-the material is that sensitive. Moreover, special safes are provided in our offices for security. The extraordinary thing is that that begs the question: If some in the Opposition have no respect for the processes which afford confidentiality and table in camera evidence, why on earth should anyone be provided with these special safes?</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that material which comes before the Committee on the NCA is of extraordinary confidentiality and sensitivity. Although I am relatively new to the Committee, that is a conclusion which I drew at a very early time. It is not overstating the case before the Senate tonight to say that if people breach the confidentiality of the Committee on the NCA, they could put people's lives at risk. Unfortunately, that does not seem to have struck everyone in the Opposition; the contrary seems to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Opportunities are now sought to engage in public wrangling over what should be matters of calm deliberation. That form of politics is negative. It is a form of political myopia which ought not to intrude into this chamber. That form of politics achieves absolutely nothing. It is representative of an incapacity to approach important matters rationally, with some degree of reason and commonsense. No-one in the Government wants to see the NCA Committee behave in a partisan way; the opposite happens to be true. There has been such unrelenting antagonism and aggression on the Committee, apparent in the behaviour of the Opposition, that there is no choice for it but to be left to the Government, hopefully with the support and contribution of Senator Spindler, to ensure that the Committee works effectively and well. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today someone asked how does someone reach a conclusion. Unless someone behaves in the manner of some in the Opposition-best described as feckless-the short answer is that we arrive at a conclusion based on a reasoned assessment of the evidence. That is what the NCA Committee report, which was debated earlier today, sought to do. No amount of obfuscation from some opposite can get away from that. As I said earlier, the behaviour of some in the Opposition on the Committee on the NCA has left no-one in the Government in any doubt whatsoever that the attitude is: wreck the Committee and erode the value of its recommendations. That is not behaviour that lends any dignity to the Senate, and it is not behaviour that should be tolerated by any parties represented in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying this: as long as I have been alive I have detested bullies, and have detested them passionately. This is a classic case where the tactics of intimidation have to be met with utter resolution. The tactics of the political threat should always be resisted. If there are one or two members of the Opposition who hope that these tactics will succeed, I can tell them on behalf of the Government members of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority that they will fail. Every time those tactics are tried, they will meet with an uncompromising response. This is one situation where, for the Opposition, ignorance will not prove to be bliss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I did not hear the vast majority of that which was said by Senator Loosley. It used to be the case, in the tranquillity of this chamber, that when a senator intended to make observations about another senator or to reflect adversely on another senator the senator concerned would be advised accordingly. It is not in the Standing Orders. It is just intrinsic good manners that one either is born with or one learns or one just never attracts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two or three matters that I did hear Senator Loosley raise I found somewhat unsettling. At the meeting in Melbourne, to the extent that the procedures and proceedings of a private meeting are to be canvassed in this chamber, part of the agenda was what I understood to be a formal meeting-an agenda presumably agreed to by all members of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority. It was to be a formal meeting with the National Crime Authority (NCA). Members of the NCA came along to address us. I had to leave the meeting for a moment or two to make a phone call in respect of my travel arrangements, which had been changed. When I returned I was surprised to almost see the process taking place of Hansard being invited to leave the room. We were all informed that the meeting was and had always intended to be not a formal meeting but an informal meeting with the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the understanding of the Chairman is, but the status of the meeting does not change simply because Hansard is not present. However, be that as it may, we had what I thought was a rather futile meeting. On two occasions when questions were put to the Chairman of the NCA, Justice Phillips, he replied-and I thought on the second occasion in a rather sharp way-in response to questions by Government members that he was not interested in becoming involved in or in commenting on matters of difference between members of the Committee. He was not interested in becoming involved in political considerations, which was a very sensible and logical response to what, quite frankly, was an unnecessary and embarrassing question. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conclusion of the meeting, before we rose, I asked the Chairman whether I had misunderstood the agenda, whether it was always intended to be of an informal nature or whether it had changed. I was assured by the Chairman that I did have it wrong, that it was always to be an informal meeting, and that that was the understanding of all present. I apologised for not being aware of that, except to say, as I did then, that, had I known that the meeting was to be of that nature, I would have caught an aeroplane to Canberra in the afternoon because I had a public hearing of the Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade dealing with Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it absolutely disgraceful now to be informed that in an arbitrary way, by a private resolution of the Government members without the knowledge of the rest of the Committee-I understood that committees were made up of members of all political parties but were a committee in the whole, so to speak-they had decided for their own reasons that the meeting would not proceed. I would add that Senator Spindler did not know about it; he was surprised; he was not informed. Therefore, the Government members were aborting a meeting without resolution or determination by the Committee. We are now told that the reason is that the Labor members decided what could be on the Hansard record. That was decided not by the Committee, not by resolution, not by determination of the Committee, but because three members of the Australian Labor Party caucused together to decide what the Committee's tactics would be. Perhaps that more than anything else sums up the Government's attitude towards these committees-and, most of all, this Committee. They see it as part of the Executive Government and an organ of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> As I listened to Senator Loosley when I came into the chamber, it reminded me of all those terrible things that I had heard about the thugs in the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party, where threats are made and carried out. If my memory of events in New South Wales is correct, people are threatened and told what will be the consequences if their decision is different from the view of the thugs from the Right. If that is where committees are to be for the future, one has to contemplate whether the committee system has any place. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know, because it has been no secret, that people such as Senator Robert Ray have given their views very frankly and openly on this matter. Senator Ray has said that he is no great supporter of the committee system, and many others curse the day that Lionel Murphy had the enterprise to set them up, develop them and breathe life into them in the way they now exist. Perhaps this is just another step. </PARA>
<PARA> The objection to having the Labor Party on this Committee is that some of the members stick to the Standing Orders, and when we find that a matter before the Committee, such as an inquiry into Operation Ark, is going to be aborted by a short, sharp meeting without proper resolution or determination, and when we conclude that substantial evidence is being denied the Parliament, contrary to section 55 of the National Crime Authority, and we write a report, setting the wrongs right-that includes in camera evidence, which by a normal, reasonable measure by any intelligent and informed person does not include one single paragraph that could not be reasonably put on the public record-that makes us the sinners in our determinations. Labor Party members resented the fact that we exposed what they were trying to cover up. It seems to me that that is how the Labor Party members are proposing to fashion this Committee. In spite of the brutality of their numbers they were unsuccessful and they seek revenge and vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that Senator Loosley ought to start to learn his Standing Orders. Perhaps he ought to start to learn the provisions that are available to members of the Committee as individuals or as a minority-not only their rights, but their absolute responsibilities. Being the minority on a committee does not absolve a person from doing that which is right, that which is proper and responsible. The sheer tyranny of numbers is no excuse for those of us who know it is wrong to do nothing on the grounds that we have been rolled. If we believe that the report that has been proposed to be put down by the majority on the Committee is not adequate, satisfactory, responsible, or fulfilling the obligations in the charter under which the Committee was set up in the legislation, then we have a responsibility to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it interesting that Senator Loosley sets himself up. The new boy who cannot get a thing right, and has not thus far in this place, has some sort of authority on what in camera evidence can be included in minority reports and majority reports and what cannot. What offends his morality? What offends his sensitivity? More importantly, what offends him because he never wanted it exposed in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA> I have sat for a short time with Senator Loosley on this Committee and, in my view, on the occasion when we were hearing the most crucial evidence that any committee could reasonably be hearing, Senator Loosley spent most of his time at an Estimates committee. The only time we could ever be certain he would be with us was when it was time to put his hand up to vote with the majority. His prime consideration seems to be to make sure that the numbers are right. Perhaps there is something exquisite about the argument that if we have the numbers we do not have to worry about the logic. Perhaps it is the final arbitrator in politics, perhaps it is the winning point, but that does not make it right or proper and does not make the substance of the resolutions necessarily correct. </PARA>
<PARA> As long as I am on the Committee I will do what I believe is proper, as distinct from Senator Loosley. There is no man more dangerous than he who knows he is right and never questions it. Senator Loosley talked about headlines appearing in provincial newspapers and he referred, particularly, to the Adelaide newspaper. There was nothing subtle or clever about that, it was just crude, common politics. If Senator Loosley has something on his mind, rather than crafting some words in his office by the hour so as to be able to say what he intends to say without saying it, but leaving the inference there, he ought to have the courage to come in and say what he intends to say and see whether he can be challenged on his integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude for the moment, until I read the Hansard, by saying that it is my judgment as events unfold that the Government may well maintain the majority on this Committee by relying on the Chairman on every occasion for his casting vote. I suspect that as events unfold and this conduct is revealed that Senator Spindler, for one-I do not know him very well, but in the short time I have seen him on that Committee he has conducted himself with absolute propriety and integrity and, most of all, absolute responsibility-will not succumb to the impost of the Labor Party in seeking to have its way on matters and issues that he knows are not right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add only a few comments to the record in reference to the debate that we have just witnessed. I do not, in any way, want to join in the debate because I am not confident that I know enough about the subject matter that is being debated. I have not partaken in any of the previous debates in this chamber and elsewhere on this subject matter, so for that reason I will not enter the formalised part of the debate on the question of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. However, I want to follow through on the point of order taken by my colleague Senator Reid on a convention that is said to be existing in this chamber. That was also alluded to by Senator Crichton-Browne. I have not been here as long as either of the two named senators and I certainly know of many instances where, if that convention does exist, it certainly has not been followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In making that comment I admit that the culprits are not only on the other side of the chamber, but also on this side of the chamber. If the convention has existed in the past it is perhaps a good convention that ought to be, if possible, reinstituted in this place. It certainly was not reinstituted this afternoon when Senator Vanstone openly and publicly challenged Senator Loosley and said some unkind words about him. </PARA>

We will tap the table, cast that in concrete and have it here, and every honourable senator, irrespective of which side of the Parliament he comes from, will sit in and listen to all the debates on all the committee reports that happen in this place. It just does not happen like that. I know that Senator Tambling has been in this Parliament as long as I have, so he is learning on the way through, as I am. I am trying to be productive in this process. If such a convention has existed in the past, I put it to the chamber that it would probably be worth while looking at it again in the future. Despite the fact that I am on the Government side of the chamber, I know what it is like to be in a minority on a committee. It can sometimes be uncomfortable. If there is a will on behalf of all committee members we can do the best thing for Australia and the people of Australia which, after all, is the reason we are here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the way through we can play political games, but there are times when we get a bit carried away with ourselves and denigrate each other personally and that does not reflect well on the person on the receiving end of that reflection. I noticed a very nasty reflection on Senator Collins in the earlier part of Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution. I was tempted to take a point of order, but Senator Collins is big enough to defend himself. He may not have seen the need to defend himself; he knows that he can dish it out. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying-I had not intended to speak for so long on the matter-that perhaps the convention ought be looked at. I am more than willing on this side of the chamber to use whatever powers are in the temporary office that I hold to try to bring about a reinstitution of the convention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in responding to the contributions that have been made to the adjournment debate tonight. In respect of Senator Macdonald's comments about Townsville Airport and the extensions, I acknowledge as correct the statements he made about the confirmation that I gave publicly to commitments that have been given by the Federal Airports Corporation that it will consider extending the runway at Townsville Airport if it can be demonstrated that it is commercially viable for it to do so; that is, contingent upon the facilities that are being speculated upon-I place it no stronger than that-in respect of Townsville aircraft maintenance facilities proving to provide the Federal Airports Corporation with a return on the considerable investment that would be required for the extension of the runway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of Senator Crichton-Browne's contribution, I say this: in the many years that I have been a member of parliament, it has never been my practice to make personal reflections upon other members of parliament in the manner referred to by Senator McKiernan a few moments ago. I take considerable exception to being accused publicly, and therefore having it recorded in Hansard, that I have done so, when I took considerable pains at the time not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> To my total astonishment, this evening Senator Crichton-Browne accused me of accusing him of being drunk when he participated in the adjournment debate when the Senate last considered the matter. And what a long evening it was. As the Senate Hansard clearly shows-I certainly recall the debate only too clearly-it was Senator Nick Bolkus who made that accusation. Perhaps I should not be too hard on Senator Crichton-Browne because there is probably very good reason why his memory is confused as to what happened that evening during the adjournment debate. I would not have accused Senator Crichton-Browne of being as drunk as a skunk during that adjournment debate despite perhaps the intense provocation that 30 minutes of mindless gibberish that he delivered during that debate might have occasioned. Despite the intense provocation that that may have given me to make such an accusation, the reality is that I did not do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond to Senator Tambling's mindless interjection by saying that I certainly did, for the simple reason that I was angry enough at being accused of indulging in a piece of parliamentary practice which, as Senator Tambling knows full well, it is not my style to indulge in. I thought that if that is what is going to happen I may as well be guilty of the offence of which to that point in time I had been innocent-the offence that I am being accused of by Senator Crichton-Browne. I did so because it was a very long, tedious and mindless contribution that Senator Crichton-Browne made to the debate. I have no hesitation in saying that. Of course, none of that is unparliamentary. Despite the intense provocation it may have given me, because it was not a particularly edifying performance, I chose deliberately not to do so, because it is not my style. I want to put that on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might add that not just the Hansards of this chamber but a set of Hansards that would fill several of these desks from 10 years of parliamentary contributions prior to becoming a member of this Parliament will demonstrate that to be the case. Senator Tambling knows full well that that is so. It is not my style. So I do not particularly like being accused publicly of doing it. I want to correct the record in that sense, with some degree of irritation. Even though, as I say, Senator Crichton-Browne could be forgiven for being confused about the events of that evening, he should consider the Hansard record before he accuses me of making such personal reflections which I did not make at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. Other hormonal therapies used to treat cancer of the prostate continue to be available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) but should not be seen as replacements to stilboestrol. The other drugs are fosfesterol sodium, leuprorelin acetate and goserelin.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is understood that some members of the medical profession have expressed the opinion that stilboestrol is more effective than the other drug which is available in oral form, fosfesterol sodium (fosfesterol is stilboestrol diphosphate).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Stilboestrol products were removed from the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits at the request of the manufacturer. The decision by the company to withdraw stilboestrol was based on concerns about the commercial risk associated with its continued manufacture and the consequential inability to obtain liability insurance. An application for a price increase was rejected by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority in January 1988. Part of the increase sought was to cover liability insurance. The manufacturer was not, however, asked to accept a price decrease.</PARA>
<PARA> The price was further reviewed in May 1989 by the Pricing Authority with the company being offered a price substantially above its previous list price and the price sought in 1988. Price negotiations were deferred pending a PBS listing application. At that time, the Australian manufacturer proposed to market a 1mg tablet imported from New Zealand. A letter detailing the data needed to support such a proposal was sent by the Department of Community Services and Health to the Australian manufacturer in May 1989. So far, no response has been received.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There is no sure way of ensuring that cancer of the prostate does not recur. However, surgical castration or stilboestrol are regarded by experts as equally effective treatments in the control of prostatic cancer.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) A form of stilboestrol tablet is currently available in New Zealand but it remains a matter of company policy whether or not the drug is available in Australia. If a company chooses not to market a drug, there is no way that it can be forced to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There are no legislative restrictions on a person leaving Australia and seeking medical treatment in New Zealand. Alternatively, it is permissible to import for personal use a quantity of stilboestrol to provide three months' treatment at the manufacturer's recommended dose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) Terms of Reference, specified by the Hon. P J Keating, for the Industry Commission Inquiry into Rail Transport are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(in pursuance of Section 7 of the Industry Commission Act 1988)</PARA>
<PARA>1. refer railway systems (including carriage of urban and non-urban passengers and freight) for inquiry and report within fifteen months of the date of receipt of this reference;</PARA>
<PARA>2. specify that the Industry Commission report on institutional, regulatory or other arrangements subject to influence of governments in Australia which lead to inefficient resource use, and advise on courses of action to reduce or remove such inefficiencies;</PARA>
<PARA>3. without limiting the scope of the reference, request that the Commission give priority to areas where greatest efficiency gains are in prospect, and areas where early action is practicable, having regard to:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the scope for improving the efficiency of rail transport systems including through changed management and work practices, pricing, the removal of structural impediments and the use of, and investment in, new technology;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) alternative efficient sources for infrastructure and other capital investments and any efficiencies arising from the adoption of alternative mechanisms for raising loan and/or equity funding;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) the potential for joint development as a means of reducing operating expenses and capital costs, including the opportunities to standardise equipment to benefit from the lower costs of mass production;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) the identification of efficiencies in the use of energy and land of rail transport compared with road transport;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) the benefits and costs of possible changes in regulation of rail transport including its likely effects on industry, roads, road safety, the environment, regional areas and funding requirements of the three levels of Government;</PARA>
<PARA>(f) the appropriateness of rates charged by relevant rail authorities for transport of commodities, including the structure of royalties and taxes, and the effect of rail freight charges on industry;</PARA>
<PARA>(g) implications for rail transport services and the economy generally of regulations, charges and arrangements affecting competing and complementary modes of transport; and</PARA>
<PARA>(h) the effects on users and non-users of improved efficiency of passenger rail systems (particularly in cities) and of freight rail systems;</PARA>
<PARA>4. specify that the Commission is to have regard to the established economic, social and environmental objectives of governments; and</PARA>
<PARA>5. specify that the Commission is to avoid duplication of recent substantive studies undertaken elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is to report by 21 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program was established to provide financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for expenditure on upgrading Australian roads for the celebration of the Bicentenary in 1988 and included provision for urban public transport projects. It was a six year program funded by a surcharge on motor spirit (petrol) and diesel fuel, over and above excise paid by motorists and other users not eligible for rebates. A one cent per litre surcharge applied from 17 August 1982 until 30 June 1983 and a two cents per litre charge applied from 1 July 1983 to 31 December 1988. ABRD Program surcharge receipts, net of rebates, refunds and remissions are set out in Table 1, below.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Land Transport (ALT) Program commenced on 1 July 1985. It provided financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for expenditure on construction and maintenance of roads, funding of land transport research, road safety activities and for capital improvements to interstate mainline railways. It was funded by a portion of excise on petrol and diesel. Initially 3.66 cents per litre the rate was indexed to movements in the Consumer Price Index. The excise rate was also adjusted downwards on three occasions. ALT Program receipts net of transfers to the Consolidated Revenue Fund are set out at Table 1.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The Australian Centennial Roads Development (ACRD) Program is a five year program which commenced on 1 January 1989 replacing both the ABRD and ALT Programs. It provides assistance to the States and Territories for road upgrading and maintenance including funding for urban public transport and mainland rail projects and land transport research. The ACRD Program is funded by a portion of product excise, designated as a road user charge. Initially 4.95 cents per litre the road user charge is currently 5.931 cents per litre. It is indexed six-monthly to movements in the implicit price deflator for gross non-farm product, with adjustments taking effect from 1 April and 1 October. Receipts to 30 June 1990 are set in Table 1.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Railway excise payments are not separately identified by Australian Customs Service records. However, the InterState Commission has estimated that the rail systems paid $123 million in excise in 1986/87 (``Road Use Charges and Vehicle Registration: A National Scheme-Volume 1'', AGPS, Canberra, 1990 at page 135). It should be noted that prior to 1982 the rail systems were exempt from excise.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) There is no hypothecation of excise receipts to railways. However, $231 million was provided directly to the States and to Australian National by the Commonwealth for railways capital expenditure and rail-related urban public transport projects over the period 1980/81-1989/90.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, my Department and the Australian War Memorial have engaged consultants since July 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> The information to parts (a) and (c) of Senator Newman's question concerning who has been employed, for what purpose and at what cost, for 1986-87, 1987-88 and 1989-90 (and 1988-89 in respect of the Australian War Memorial) copies have been sent to Senator Newman and additional copies are available from the Senate Table Office. The relevant information for 1988-89 is contained in the Department's 1988-89 Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA> In reference to part (b) of the question, the Department's Guidelines and Procedures for the Engagement of Consultants stipulate that the following minimum information be provided to potential consultants:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) precise statement of the results required;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) sufficient background detail to explain the task to be done, this should identify key `users' (who will own the final product etc.) and may address rationale for approaching the task in a particular way;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the expected tasks for the consultant including requirement for any specific product eg interim/final reports, consultant's role in implementation if any;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a timetable for completing the project, including commencement, milestone and finish dates-any external constraints (eg budgeting timetable) should be highlighted;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the facilities the Department will provide, eg further background information; access to departmental staff; if the project is to be completed on site what sort of accommodation; what supervision will be provided;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the skills and/or knowledge being sought from the consultant; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) a set of criteria upon which the selection of the consultant will be made, including specific skills the consultant must have and reference to any potential or actual conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that one of the key factors distinguishing consultants from employees is that consultants are not directed in the way they carry out their work. It is the consultants' responsibility to develop a `work plan'.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to part (d) of the question, the information requested is not maintained in any consolidated form. It would be time consuming and resource intensive to collate the information and I am not prepared to provide this information for the periods requested.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning part (e) of the question, most consultancies commissioned by the department are for a stipulated duration and cost. Fees payable would therefore be those initially quoted.</PARA>
<PARA> Cost increases may occur in longer consultancy projects. In these instances cost variations may only be justified in cases where the consultant is requested to undertake different or additional work; an extension of time; or where cost increases beyond the consultant's control can be demonstrated. Under no circumstances would additional fees be paid to consultants who fail to cost the proposal accurately or for additional work undertaken without prior approval.</PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, fees in excess of the accepted quote are unlikely to have been paid. To verify this with every consultancy commissioned during the periods nominated would again entail considerable time and resources and therefore, I am not prepared to supply this information.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Government Response to the Report on Environmental Impact of Development Assistance by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the Government announced that there would be an annual environmental audit of development cooperation activities. This audit will provide detailed answers to the questions raised by Senator Vallentine. In the interim, the following information is provided.</PARA>
<PARA>How many proposed aid projects have been reviewed under the AIDAB environmental assessment guidelines since the guidelines were adopted in 1989?</PARA>
<PARA> The environmental assessment guidelines became operational in July 1989. Since then, 200 projects have been proposed. Of those, 164 have been reviewed and 115 have been approved. The remainder are still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>How many projects have been categorised as Lists 1, 2 and 3?</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 164 projects reviewed, 90 are List One (activities for which environmental screening is required), 18 are List Two (environmentally related activities) and the remaining 56 are List Three (activities for which screening is not normally required)</PARA>
<PARA>How many ``List 2'' projects have been approved, or are still under consideration?</PARA>
<PARA> Thirteen ``List 2'' projects have been approved, and 5 are still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>How many reviews of environmental factors (REFs) have been undertaken in accordance with the above guidelines?</PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the environment assessment guidelines, all 164 projects have been subjected to procedures in which environmental factors are considered as an integral element, the remaining 36 are still being processed. Terms of reference for feasibility studies, and design and appraisal missions have emphasised environmental factors. The development of logical frameworks within project design documents, and detailed project implementation documents have incorporated environmental considerations. Current and future sectoral analyses have been tasked to make recommendations on the integration of sustainable development objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>In how many cases did the review of environmental factors recommend that the proposed project be rejected or substantially altered?</PARA>
<PARA> No project has been rejected due to REF recommendations; however in many cases, individual components of projects or approaches have been altered to accommodate environmental concerns or considerations. A major task of appraisal teams has been to ensure that environmental factors as well as other important cross-cutting issues have been considered fully in project design.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the projects which were the subject of REFs, how many, if any, have been approved or are still under consideration?</PARA>
<PARA> The screening guidelines contain information relating both to the project conception phase and to subsequent phases in the project cycle. The term ``review of environmental factors'' incorporates both the initial screening and the subsequent environmental management plan and costings.</PARA>
<PARA> In all cases where environmental concerns have been identified in project formulation, these concerns have been addressed through alterations of the project's logical framework and design; in no case has a project been rejected on environmental grounds. Those still under consideration are currently at various stages in the project cycle, in which environmental aspects are considered at each stage.</PARA>
<PARA>How many proposed projects have been referred to the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) in accordance with the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act or otherwise?</PARA>
<PARA> AIDAB is discussing the content of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DASETT which will define the requirements for consultation under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Since the Government Response to the Senate Committee tabled in Parliament on 16 May 1990, DASETT and AIDAB have engaged in active dialogue on international environmental issues and bilateral development cooperation. Until now, DASETT's input has related mainly to programs, during the routine monthly meetings that have been instituted. Some projects have been referred to DASETT. The more direct input has resulted from the attachment of a DASETT officer to the technical Environment Group of AIDAB. This attachment has enhanced the ability of the two agencies to communicate effectively on development cooperation design and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>In how many cases did DASETT recommend against funding the project?</PARA>
<PARA> In no case has DASETT recommended against funding of a project.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the projects which DASETT recommended not to be funded or be substantially altered, how many have been approved or are still under consideration?</PARA>
<PARA> DASETT has not recommended that any projects be abandoned or substantially altered.</PARA>
<PARA>In total, how many projects have been rejected, abandoned or substantially altered, which, but for the new AIDAB environmental assessment guidelines, would have been approved?</PARA>
<PARA> AIDAB's environmental assessment guidelines have targeted the next generation of development cooperation activities. By placing the concept of sustainable development at the core of AIDAB's program, significant changes are being introduced. In negotiating with bilateral partners Australia has recorded its wish to engage in environmentally sound activities, and to develop strong relations with the environmental ministries of these countries. AIDAB's overseas posts have been instructed to identify requests which do not conform with the environmental standards that have been laid down. The aim is to ensure that unsuitable activities are rejected at the earliest opportunity. The combination of the guidelines and this new approach is having a significant effect on the choice and content of new projects, particularly on environmental grounds.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1986, the Government accepted Australian National Railways Commission (AN) advice that it would continue to incur large losses on its passenger operations. While requiring AN to continue to operate these services at that time, the Government was not prepared to write AN a `blank cheque', and set AN a cost recovery target of 60 per cent for these operations. AN was advised that the Government would take its success in meeting this target into account when determining continued financial support for these services.</PARA>
<PARA> AN constantly monitors the performance of its passenger operations against this target and advises the Government of progress. In a recent review of passenger operations, AN addressed the implications of continuing particular poorly performing services such as the SA country passenger services. It is AN's assessment that it cannot meet the established cost recovery target while these services continue.</PARA>
<PARA> Answers to the specific questions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Hon Bob Brown, MP, Minister for Land Transport, has received three letters or submissions from the Chairman of the Australian National Railways Commission on this matter. These were received in the Minister's office on 19 September, 21 December 1989 and 2 January 1990. I do not propose to table these documents.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister has consulted local authorities representing the communities affected over the future of these services. On 9 October 1990, he convened a meeting in Canberra which was attended by the Mayors of Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Broken Hill, and the Deputy Mayor of Port Pirie. Officials of the Australian Railways Union and the Barrier Industrial Council also attended.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the Government decide to proceed with closure, the Minister would consult the South Australian Minister of Transport.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Minister will take into account all relevant factors. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has completed a study of AN Passenger Services, which will be released shortly. This study forms part of the basis for consideration of this matter and the Terms of Reference for the study included consideration of `the financial, economic and social benefits of closure or continued operation of AN's passenger services'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of recent media reports indicating that prospects in the Japanese beef market may not be as bright as previously indicated, including the article referred to in the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> A high level of stocks of beef and low wholesale prices, coupled with high retail prices, is creating a general uncertainty in the Japanese beef market. However structural change in the Japanese beef market in this period prior to liberalisation is to be expected and no doubt further uncertainty will be present in the market until things settle down after liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA> A consultant's report recently released by the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation noted the prospect of an initial decline in Japanese imports of beef after liberalisation and that the current high level of beef stocks would need to be disposed of before market forces would determine the level of appropriate imports. The level of Japanese beef stocks is expected to run down considerably during 1991, and consequently decrease its influence upon Japanese beef import demand. Despite this initial uncertainty liberalisation of the Japanese beef market does offer considerable benefits for the Australian beef industry in the longer term. I remain confident that Japan will continue to meet its commitment under bilateral agreements, to import a total of 394,000 tonnes of beef in JFY 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian feedlot industry currently supplies approximately 16 per cent of all cattle slaughtered in Australia. The current annual turnoff from feedlots is approximately 800,000 head of cattle.

<PARA> (3) On current trade patterns, it is estimated that Australia will export 200,000 tonnes of beef to Japan in 1990. Exports of beef to Japan for the eight months to end of August totalled 124,031 tonnes.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The review being conducted by Janet Strickland and Associates is part of an independent review into the message content and advertising standards of the 0055 telephone information service.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian wheat farmers are currently experiencing very difficult marketing conditions. The world wheat price has been declining during 1990 in response to a number of factors including; a forecast record world wheat crop in 1990/91, a decrease in import demand by the major importing countries (China and USSR) and the Middle East crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> Although Tunisia and other West African countries are not markets for Australian wheat the intensification of the export subsidy war between the US and EC is of concern to the Government. Not only will it place further downward pressure on the world wheat price but it may also encourage other importing countries to request subsidised sales, which could make it difficult for Australia to compete in these markets.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not consider entering the subsidy war (it would only represent throwing good money after bad and take the price down further) but will continue to lobby the US and EC over their domestic support and export subsidy policies. These policies encourage production even when world demand is declining which in turn leads to the use of export subsidies to dispose of the surplus production.</PARA>
<PARA> In the current GATT Round, Australia as a member of the Cairns Group, is pressing for fundamental reform of agriculture to bring it fully into the GATT and for the substantial reduction of all trade distorting policies (including export subsidies).</PARA>
<PARA> On the domestic side the introduction last year of new marketing arrangements under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, will help growers to cope better with the depressed marketing outlook.</PARA>
<PARA> They now have a greater choice of marketing options that not only allow them to seek the best return for their wheat but also to minimise off-farm costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) has also been given greater commercial flexibility and is already offering a number of options such as cash purchases and on-farm storage of pool wheat to assist growers.</PARA>
<PARA> The AWB is also able to provide greater flexibility in the timing of payments to growers and the provision of alternative payment arrangements to help growers with their cash-flow situation.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, under the legislation an Aggregate Estimated Net Pool Return (AENPR), determined each season by the Minister, enables the AWB to access guaranteed borrowings up to a set limit of the AENPR to make advance payments to growers. The level of advance payments is determined by the AWB as a percentage of the estimated net pool returns.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1, 2 &amp;3) The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has approved a contract between Queensland Mines Limited (QML) and Nukem Inc for the sale of QML's stockpile of 6.4 million lbs of uranium oxide concentrate (yellowcake). The contract also involved the assumption by Nukem Inc of some contractual obligations with QML's customers. The pricing terms were in accord with the Government's uranium contract pricing policy. That policy was set out in a press release by the Minister on 4 September 1989. It requires that prices be fair and reasonable and at least comparable to what others are getting in the market. The pricing terms of the contract met these criteria. Details of the terms, however, are regarded as commercial in confidence information.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The QML contract does not alter the Government's uranium contract pricing policy. The policy allows producers to sell at fair market prices. The spot market accounts for only ten to twenty per cent of world sales of uranium. For sound commercial reasons, most transactions continue to take place by way of long term supply contracts.</PARA>
