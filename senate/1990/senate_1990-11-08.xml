<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA> The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469,274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> Your Petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> Urge the Federal Government to formally request the South African Government to immediately cease the practice of apartheid, by repealing all laws and regulations relating thereto, and by the release of any political prisoners detained by virtue of such laws, and by any other means consistent with the human rights and civil liberties of all its people.</PARA>

<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens shows:</PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA>gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association;</PARA>
<PARA>gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that on 9 October the then Chairman of the Committee, Senator Colston, reported to the Senate on the Committee's concerns with these instruments. These concerns related to an unfettered discretion granted to a public official to waive fees, to procedures authorising the expenditure of Commonwealth money, and to the incorporation of documents in delegated legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following correspondence with Ministers, the Committee obtained undertakings to amend the instruments to meet its concerns or received advice which satisfied it that withdrawal of these notices was appropriate. The Committee is grateful to these Ministers for their helpful cooperation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of the Committee's correspondence with Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The correspondence read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Chemicals (Notifications and Assessment) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 231. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator the Hon. Peter Cook</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Industrial Relations</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 231, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 23 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Regulations 14 and 15 provide for the Director to waive or remit certain fees, as he or she``thinks fit''. Although the range of circumstances in which fees may be waived or remitted is restricted, there appears to be no criteria at all to guide the exercise of this discretion. In addition, there appears to be no provision for review of the merits of an adverse exercise of the discretion. Some of the fees in respect of which the discretion is exercisable are $25,000 and $28,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that in circumstances at the present it should be possible to redraft the Regulations to provide for mandatory waiver or remission, thus removing the discretionary element altogether. Alternatively, a right of review to the AAT should be provided for an adverse decision. The Committee notes that the parent Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 provides AAT review for a number of important discretions. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mal,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 24 August l99O about the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 231. </PARA>
<PARA>I am reluctant to impose a mandatory system for remission of fees because the complexity of the issues involved makes it difficult if not impossible to specify in a legislative framework the precise circumstances in which fees will be waived. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I agree that criteria to guide the exercise of the discretion and a right of review to the AAT in the event of an adverse decision are desirable and I will take steps to ensure that the legislation is amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Determinations 7/90 and 8/90 under s.13 of the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 23 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Several of the sums of money approved for specified institutions in Determination 8/90 are apparently identical with sums approved for the same institutions in Determination 7/90. For example, the sums approved for Frankston College of TAFE, Logan College of TAFE and Rockhampton College of TAFE are the same in both Determinations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would appreciate your advice on the relationship between the two Determinations, if any. In particular, perhaps you could advise whether the sums are intended to be cumulative. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 24 August 1990 concerning determinations TAFE 7/90 and TAFE 8/90 made under Section 13 of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 in respect of capital expenditure for child care projects. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that you have sought advice on the relationship between these determinations and have asked whether or not the approved amounts shown are cumulative. </PARA>
<PARA>Determinations TAFE 7/90 and 8/90 each include all of the proposals and related amounts authorised for payment in relation to child care as at the time of their making. The inclusion in revised determinations of all the approved proposals and amounts of a similar type, and not just those involving changes, has been adopted from the point of view of providing to Senators a full picture of Commonwealth expenditure in a particular area. </PARA>
<PARA>In this regard determination TAFE 7/90 provided for initial determinations for Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. Determination TAFE 8/90 provided for three new proposals-South West Metropolitan College of TAFE (WA), Kingston College of TAFE (SA), and Gordon College of TAFE (Vic) as well as higher total levels for three existing proposals in Victoria-Outer Eastern College of TAFE, Newport College of TAFE and the School of Mines and Industry Ballarat. </PARA>

<PARA>The Committee is grateful for your advice and will remove the notice of motion of disallowance placed on these instruments. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, the Committee believes that the power to authorise the spending of Commonwealth money is an important matter. In the present case the Committee is still concerned that the different projects have all been approved twice and payments authorised twice. It would be appreciated if your Department would contact the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Audit Office for confirmation that they have no difficulties with this practice, and supply the Committee with copies of this advice. </PARA>

<PARA>Livestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment), as contained in Livestock Export Orders No. 2 of 1990. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Livestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment), Livestock Export Orders No. 2 of 1990, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 20 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>In clause 1 the definition of `designated export auction' refers to-</PARA>
<PARA>`an export auction designated as such by the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders Ltd, as published prior to the coming into effect of the Livestock Export Orders No. 2 of 1990 (that is, the present Orders) in respect of the 1990 export ram selling season . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This incorporation appears valid, as the reference is to an already existing published set of auction dates. </PARA>
<PARA>There may, however, be a separate problem of incorporation. To come within the definition an auction is required to be-</PARA>
<PARA>`subject to such guidelines determined and published in the``Guidelines and Conditions for Export Sales'' by the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders Ltd.'</PARA>
<PARA>As long as the Guidelines and Conditions for Export Sales is an existing publication and it is only that publication as it exists as present that is being incorporated, there is no difficulty. But if it is intended that the Orders refer to Guidelines and Conditions for Export Sales as they exist from time to time, then without express provision for this in the parent Act, s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 would preclude such incorporation. If there is no such express provision, the Committee would welcome your assurance that it is not intended to amend the Guidelines and Conditions for Export Sales without making a fresh instrument to incorporate them. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, after referring to already published 1990 auctions, the definition goes on to refer to auctions-</PARA>
<PARA>`as published prior to the commencement of each subsequent export ram selling season . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>As the yearly auction list was not in existence at the time of the making of this present set of Orders then, unless expressly authorised by the parent Act, such reference may not be valid. </PARA>
<PARA>Your advice would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>I refer to your letter of 20 September 1990 concerning the Livestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment), Livestock Export Orders No. 2 of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I note the Committee's advice that if there are any changes to the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders (AASMB) Guidelines it will be necessary to make a fresh instrument to incorporate the amended Guidelines in the Livestock Export (Merino) Orders. </PARA>
<PARA>The AASMB will be seeking to amend the guidelines prior to the 1991 season. Officers of my Department will meet with the AASMB's Special Export Committee to discuss the proposed amendments in good time to incorporate them in amended Orders prior to the commencement of the season. </PARA>
<PARA>I have noted the Committee's advice concerning the reference in the orders to the yearly auction lists. My Department is seeking further advice from the Attorney General's Department on this matter and I will advise the Committee of any action proposed after that advice is received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! In accordance with the procedures laid down by standing order 81, Senator Hill has raised with me a matter of privilege. Under the standing order, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges should have precedence over other business on the day for which the notice is given. In making that determination, I am required to have regard only to the following criteria laid down by the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA>The criteria do not allow me to make any judgment as to whether the facts are as alleged by the senator, or the strength of the evidence. In a number of determinations made since March 1988, I have indicated how I apply the Senate's criteria. I have given precedence to a motion where the matter raised is such that it is capable of being regarded by the Senate as conforming with criterion (a), and if there is no other readily available remedy. I have given precedence to a number of matters since that time, and I have not given precedence to some other matters raised.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter raised by Senator Hill refers to material contained in the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority presented to the Senate on 17 October 1990, and it has two aspects. Senator Hill states, first, that that material reveals that a person was given directions, the effect of which was that the person was not to give evidence before the Joint Committee without the approval of the National Crime Authority. Having regard to relevant authorities and precedents, Senator Hill concludes that the directions may have constituted an improper interference with a witness and a contempt of Parliament. Senator Hill states, secondly, that the material discloses that, at a hearing of the Committee, officers of the Authority were asked whether the person concerned had been restricted in any way in the evidence the person should give to the Committee, and they answered in the negative. Again having regard to relevant authorities and precedents, Senator Hill concludes that this may have constituted the giving of false or misleading evidence to a committee and the contempt of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the relevant declarations of the Senate in its resolutions of 25 February 1988, other relevant authorities and relevant precedents, including recent reports by the Senate Committee of Privileges, it is clear that any allegations that witnesses have been interfered with or that false or misleading evidence has been given to a committee have been regarded as matters of great seriousness. The matter raised by Senator Hill therefore clearly satisfies criterion (a) of the Senate's criteria, and there is no readily available other remedy. I therefore determine that the motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges shall have precedence in accordance with standing order 81. I therefore call Senator Hill to give a notice of motion, and I present to the Senate the letter I received from Senator Hill.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to express the Parliament's repudiation of an interpretation of its powers, privileges and immunities, put forward by government lawyers, which, if uncorrected, has the potential to undermine the operations of both Houses and of their committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The interpretation in question arises in relation to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which is established under the National Crime Authority Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority has made a claim that the secrecy provisions of section 51 of the Act inhibit the Authority in providing information to the Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 51 is framed in substantially the same way as a great many other secrecy provisions in statutes establishing statutory authorities. Basically it provides that a person who discloses information gained under the Act, except in the course of the performance of duties under the Act, is guilty of an offence, and that a person shall not be required to produce in a court documents or information gained under the Act except for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act. The section is not expressed to apply to inquiries by the Joint Committee, and the terms of reference of the Committee, including specific restrictions on inquiries by the Committee, are set out in another section of the Act, section 55. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sought the advice of the Clerk of the Senate in relation to this matter. That advice is to the effect that the secrecy provisions of section 51 of the Act have no application to inquiries by the Joint Committee, because:</PARA>
<PARA>- the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 explicitly declares that the immunity of parliamentary proceedings from impeachment or question in a court applies to the giving of evidence and the submission of documents to a committee, including any joint committee and a committee established under a statute</PARA>
<PARA>- therefore a person cannot be prosecuted for an offence in respect of the submission of documents or the giving of evidence to the Joint Committee</PARA>
<PARA>- it is a long-established legal principle, hitherto upheld by the Government's legal advisers, that the powers, privileges and immunities of the Houses of the Parliament and their committees are not set aside by a statutory provision unless such a provision explicitly says so, and section 51 does not</PARA>
<PARA>- the restrictions on the Joint Committee's powers of inquiry contained in section 55 are quite distinct and have nothing to do with the secrecy provisions of section 51. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee received an opinion from the Solicitor-General, to which the Government has indicated it intends to adhere, to the effect that parliamentary privilege is irrelevant and the secrecy provisions of section 51 apply to inquiries by the Joint Committee. As the Clerk of the Senate has pointed out in a commentary on the Solicitor-General's opinion, the opinion cites no authority for these propositions, but simply asserts them, and appears to contemplate that section 51 in some way operates in relation to the Joint Committee as soon as it goes beyond its terms of reference, which the Solicitor-General interprets very restrictively. As the commentary points out, this confuses two separate issues. If the Joint Committee were to go beyond its terms of reference, the remedy is not that the criminal sanction of the secrecy provisions is invoked. That is the equivalent of saying that when the Houses of the Parliament pass a Bill which is later found to be unconstitutional, their proceedings on the Bill are retrospectively stripped of the protection of parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> As has also been pointed out, if the Solicitor-General's opinion is to be accepted, all the other similar secrecy provisions in statutes may be invoked as barriers to the provision of information to parliamentary committees. There are over 300 such secrecy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be clear from what has been said that the approach taken by the Solicitor-General has the capacity to undermine not only the ability of the Joint Committee to perform its task but the ability of the Houses and any of their committees to perform virtually any of their functions. Once it is accepted that a general secrecy provision prevents the provision of information to Parliament, and that a person may be prosecuted for giving information to Parliament in duly constituted parliamentary proceedings, the very basis of parliamentary operations is destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Solicitor-General's opinion is clearly contrary to the express provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, which were intended to remove all doubts about the absolute nature of the immunity attaching to proceedings in Parliament, including proceedings in all parliamentary committees. The opinion is clearly misconceived. It is apparent that the Government has not properly considered the opinion before giving support to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to repudiate decisively the destructive approach taken by the Solicitor-General, the Bill would declare that section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act has no application to inquiries by the Joint Committee. This declaration would be made without prejudice to the proper interpretation of other provisions in other statutes, including the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I table an explanatory memorandum for the Bill. The documents to which I have referred have been published by the Joint Committee, and are included in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CATTLE TRANSACTION LEVY BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is one of a package of Bills that will introduce new levy arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. The other Bills in the package are: the Beef Production Levy Bill; the Cattle Export Charge Bill; the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill; the Livestock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill; the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill and the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements have been developed by the industry through the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council (AMLIPC). </PARA>
<PARA> The AMLIPC is a statutory body established by the Government in 1984 to provide a forum for the industry wide consideration of industry issues and to inquire into areas of concern to a number of sectors. The Council brings together the leaders of industry, with producer, meat exporter, processor, wholesaling, retailing, union and domestic marketing interests being represented. </PARA>
<PARA> Levies are raised from the meat and livestock industry to fund the operations of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government matches dollar-for-dollar the industry's expenditure on research and development up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production, in line with primary industries research and development policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Levies are also collected to fund the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC), to which the Government contributes 20 per cent of funding, and to fund the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, to which the Government contributes 50 per cent of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The current levy arrangements for cattle, sheep, buffalo and goats consist of a flat rate per-head ``live-stock slaughter levy'' at the point of slaughter and a flat rate per-head ``live-stock export charge''. These levy raising mechanisms have been a bone of contention within the industry, and a cause of friction between livestock producers on the one hand and processors and exporters on the other. The major dissatisfaction arises from the question of who actually bears the cost of the levies and charge. Both the producer and the processing and exporting sectors believe they bear the full cost. </PARA>
<PARA> This dissatisfaction has increased as levies have risen substantially in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1987 annual general meeting of the industry requested the AMLIPC to undertake an investigation into levy raising mechanisms for the meat and livestock industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMLIPC recommended a new levy and charge raising mechanism for the cattle and beef industry, with the mechanisms for sheep, buffalo and goats to remain unchanged. The Council has resolved to review the new levy mechanisms during their third year of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic mechanisms recommended by the AMLIPC for cattle and beef are: a flat rate per head levy on all cattle sales and transfers of cattle from the production to the processing stage, payable by the vendor or the owner at the time of transfer; a beef production levy on a cents per kilogram basis on beef and veal produced, payable by the owner of the carcass; and a charge on live cattle exports on a cents per kilogram basis, payable by the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA> Dairy cattle traded for dairy purposes are to be exempt from the transaction levy and the export charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial rates of levy and charge have been set in the bills to yield an income equivalent to that yielded under existing arrangements. Future adjustments to the rates will need to be approved by the industry annual general meeting, as is the current requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial levy rates have been set so that the producer and the processor and exporter sectors share equally the cost of the AMLC and AMLRDC operations and this apportionment will apply during the first three years of the new arrangements. The producer sector has accepted the responsibility for the funding of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign, known as BTEC, and the National Residue Survey, or NRS. The NRS is currently collected as part of the inspection fee collected from export abattoirs. Rather than collect a very small separate levy designated for the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, funding for this organisation is to be collected in with the AMLC levy and paid to the Consultative Council by the AMLC. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the experimental nature of the collection mechanisms, provision has been made for a three year trial period of the new arrangements. The current levies and charge can be reinstated at the rate operative at 31 December 1990 up to 30 June 1994. This provision will only be exercised in consultation with the AMLIPC. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements are designed to achieve what the industry perceives as a more equitable and visible division of levy payments between producers and processors by clarifying their relative contributions to the AMLC and AMLRDC. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this package the AMLIPC has also recommended the restructuring of the register of livestock producers established and maintained by the AMLC. Producers entered on this register are entitled to vote at the industry annual general meeting, along with those persons entered on the register of processors and exporters. The producers' register is to be divided into two registers-one for cattle producers and one for producers of sheep, buffalo and goats. The Processors' register will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical difference resulting from this restructuring will be that only cattle producers and all meat processors will be able to vote on matters relating to rates of levy and charge on cattle, and only producers of livestock other than cattle and all processors will be able to vote on motions relating to levies and charge on those animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMLIPC has been able to demonstrate that there is a firm consensus within the Council on this issue, and that any objections to the new arrangements from outside bodies affected by the proposals have received detailed consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is aware of the increased costs of collection associated with the proposal, and has assured the Government it is willing to meet these costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1988 the Government has recovered from industry the costs incurred in the collection of levies and charges. To contain these costs to some extent, the AMLIPC has requested that there be a lesser degree of audit in some minor collection areas. Again, the Council has assured the Government that it is aware that this measure could result in leakage. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to impose the levy on cattle sales and transfers of ownership and transfers from production to processing where no sale has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> Separate rates of levy are struck for adult cattle and for bobby calves, and both rates contain separate components for the AMLC, AMLRDC, BTEC and the NRS. The Bill provides that the rates of levy may be altered by regulation, but specifies the maximum rates of levy that may be imposed in such a manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The operative rate of the transaction levy will be $5.83 for an adult beast. The maximum is set at $12.25. The equivalent rates for a bobby calf are $1 and $2.25. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations to adjust the rates of levy for AMLC and AMLRDC purposes must first be supported by an industry annual general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is imposed on the person owning the cattle immediately before the change of ownership or immediately before delivery for processing. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements will yield revenue approximately equal to that yielded under the present arrangements, and as the Commonwealth recovers all of its costs incurred in collection of levies and charges, there will be no net effect on consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned earlier, the proposal has been initiated by the industry through the AMLIPC. The Government is pleased the industry has been able to come to the government through the policy council mechanism to present a united view on such a complex policy issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>BEEF PRODUCTION LEVY BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is another of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to impose a levy on the production of beef at an operative level of 2.17 cents per kilogram of the gutted and trimmed carcass weighed within two hours of slaughter, or the hot carcass weight as it is termed in the trade. The levy is payable by the person owning the carcass immediately after its hot carcass weight is determined. This levy, in combination with the cattle transaction levy, will replace the current levy on the slaughter of cattle, calves and bobby calves imposed by the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy contains components for the funding of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already outlined, the initial rate of levy has been specified in the Bill. This rate may be altered by regulation up to the specified maximum, which is 5 cents. Recommendations to adjust the rates of levy must first be supported by an industry annual general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>CATTLE EXPORT CHARGE BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is another of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. The new arrangements have been developed by the industry through the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to impose a charge on the export of cattle from Australia. The charge will be on a cents per kilogram live weight basis, as opposed to the current per head charge imposed under the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977. The industry has recommended this change to bring the charge into line with the Beef Production Levy, which is on a cents per kilogram carcass weight basis. The rate of charge is set at half that of the beef production levy, or 1.09 cents per kilogram, to put it on a carcass weight equivalent basis, as about half the live weight is lost in gutting and trimming. </PARA>
<PARA> The charge contains components for the funding of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> While the initial rates of charge have been specified in the Bill, this rate may be altered by regulation up to the specified maximum of 2.5 cents per kilogram. Recommendations to adjust the rates of charge must first be supported by an industry annual general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The charge is payable by the owner of the cattle at the time of export. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>CATTLE AND BEEF LEVY COLLECTION BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides the collection mechanisms for the new levies and charge imposed under the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1990, the Beef Production Levy Bill 1990 and the Cattle Export Charge Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> To enable a more cost effective levy and charge collection procedure, the Bill provides for the collection of moneys from intermediaries such as selling agents, abattoir operators and feedlot operators. The Bill also provides for the reimbursement by persons primarily liable for levy and charge to these intermediaries. These arrangements will assist in keeping costs to a minimum by significantly reducing the number of collection points. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the due dates of levy or charge to be prescribed by regulation. This will allow flexibility in the collecting of moneys by permitting different collection periods depending on the amount of moneys to be collected and the sector of the industry it is to be collected from. This measure also has the potential to minimise the costs of collection. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>CATTLE INDUSTRY LEGISLATION (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS)</PARA>
<PARA>BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 and the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964 to allow payment of the moneys collected under the new levy and charge arrangements to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation and to the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the AMLC Act and the AMLRDC Act to allow the Corporations to make recommendations to the Minister on the rates of levy and charge under the new arrangements, and to restructure the register of livestock producers as outlined earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the AMLC Act and the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 to provide for the Corporation to make an annual payment into the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Trust Account of the cattle industry's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

Yesterday we received notice that the Senate will sit which not only is of great inconvenience to honourable senators but, more importantly, is an inconvenience to those with whom they had made appointments for that week. A number of my colleagues have important obligations that week covering all of Australia, and those commitments cannot now be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important point is that, if the Government had planned its program with any degree of reasonable competence, it would have known a long time ago whether that week had to be a sitting week. Of course, it did not do that. I have protested before that when this sitting of the Senate started there was next to no Government business to be transacted, as a result of which an enormous backlog has developed and the Government now requires these extra sitting weeks to overcome the result of its mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> As of a couple of days ago, apart from the Appropriation Bills, which have to be dealt with, the Government expected the Senate to process about 87 Bills before it rises at Christmas time. After discussions and negotiations yesterday, the Government has reduced that number of Bills to about 68, plus the Appropriation package. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious as we are now well into November that that workload cannot be dealt with in any reasonable way between now and Christmas. In an effort to find some further sitting days, the Government has sought to add this sitting week. It is a reasonable expectation that there will be another notice of motion before too long from the Government looking for the Senate to sit yet another week at the end of the program, which will take the Senate through to Christmas. As I said at the outset, I rise simply to protest that the Government cannot get its business in order. Any reasonable degree of competence would have meant that the Government knew the weeks it would require the Senate to sit. I only hope that it can lift its game in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to oppose the motion but I wish to raise a matter now which I referred to briefly yesterday-the question of time not being made available to discuss very important issues in this chamber. One of the very important issues that needs to be discussed in this chamber-indeed, we are obliged to discuss it-relates to treaties. Twice every year a bundle of treaties is brought into this chamber and dumped on the table and we have virtually no time to discuss them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important that time be made available to discuss these treaties. The reason for that, of course, is the existence of the constitutional provision, section 51.(xxix.), the external affairs power. The Government can use that power in order to implement the articles of conventions or the provisions of treaties to, for example, supersede State laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, the Government came in here and dumped another 31 treaties on the table. One of those treaties was the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Another was an International Labour Organisation convention relating to disability. The first, in particular, is contentious. A number of valid and reasoned criticisms have been made of articles of the Convention or, more particularly, of the possible interpretations of articles in the Convention by informed critics. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised this point yesterday and indicated that I was to move a motion at the appropriate time for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the discussion on these treaties to take place. I did not proceed with that because when it was discussed around the chamber it was felt that it was not appropriate to bring it on immediately but time should be made-I think that was the general view around the chamber-for discussions of these treaties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters interjects, `too late'. It possibly will be too late because, as I understand it from messages emanating from the office of the Attorney-General, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) intends to recommend the ratification of the treaty within the next six or eight weeks. If that takes place before the Parliament has had an opportunity of discussing it, that would be an action of the Government thumbing its nose at the elected representatives of the people about a very important matter. It would also be a clear dereliction of duty on the part of the Government to receive the considered views of elected members of the Parliament in the context of a formal debate about treaties in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of my rising is to say that if we are going to have another week of sittings, surely the Government should be able to put aside sufficient time in which these important matters are able to be discussed in this chamber. Mr President, I appreciate the tolerance that you have had in allowing me to make these remarks, but I think that they are pertinent to the question of an additional week. I hope that the Government will act honourably and properly in this matter and allow time for debate on these very important matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill made the point about diary problems because of the institution of the extra week's sitting. I am very conscious of that. I regret that this extra week was necessary and I regret the inconvenience caused to honourable senators. I think it was first flagged by Senator Richardson when he was Acting Manager of Government Business that we may have to sit that week, and I must say that from that point I resisted trying to put in the extra week for as long as I could. But having looked at the remaining essential program and the time that I thought the Senate would need to devote to it, I could not imagine our doing that in nearly three weeks of sittings rather than four. I think most of us assume that the Appropriation Bills will not be concluded until the end of next week. In spite of the reforms brought in by the Procedures Committee, I do not expect to save one minute in the Estimates Committee when it goes into Committee of the Whole. That should not surprise anyone here. Reforms here last about five seconds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Senator Hill went on to make the point that we should improve the situation. I agree that we should, but Bills come in too late as they did under Senator Hill's Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, but you never had the same obstructionism as we sometimes meet. Although I must say that if I had to make a choice between Senator Walters and Senator McLaren, I would probably prefer Senator Walters when it comes to obstructing business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To try to be a little more constructive and to try to tackle this particular problem, we have changed the cut-off points for drafting instructions for future Bills so as to force Bills to come in earlier. That will not be seen this session but hopefully it will be seen in the next session. Unless a Bill is absolutely urgent and unless departments and Ministers meet those drafting instructions, those Bills will not be listed on the timetable next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the point has been made in this chamber, and has been implied again today, that maybe we do not sit enough. Next autumn the House of Representatives will sit for 10 weeks and the Senate will sit for a minimum of 12 weeks. That will make far more time available to debate legislation and other matters. I am quite happy to sit for 14 weeks by the way, right through until the end of July; it does not bother me. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point in those reforms-I think it is essential and I think the message got through-is that once the House of Representatives finishes with the Bills that the Senate will look at this year, it should get on and start passing some Bills for us for next session-not ones we will consider this session, but Bills that are drafted and available. I am hoping that at least 10, 15 or 20 Bills will go through the House of Representatives later this year after the cut-off point and be available for the Senate early next year. That has two advantages. First, that we will start with a large stockpile and, secondly, everyone here gets a lot more notice of what is coming up and can do an analysis of it. As yet this is all hope rather than necessary realisation, but I will certainly be pushing the process along. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said that at one stage we ran out of business. I remind the Senate that we did have business. We could have taken the industrial relations Bill and other material, but because of necessary arrangements and as honourable senators were fulfilling duties elsewhere we could not bring on that Bill at that particular time. I do not put any blame on that, but I am saying that as much as possible on this side, when spokesmen are not available on this side or among the Australian Democrats or elsewhere, we try to fit that program around those spokesmen too. Sometimes that is the reason for not having sufficient information. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point is that the cut-off motion sounded a great thing in theory when former Senator Michael Macklin first moved it. At the time of the shift in the Liberal Party leadership just before the last election it was suggested that it was not such a great concept any more. I do not know whether that was because an election was about to come up and those opposite were confident that they would be in government. But at times it is forcing an unnecessary guillotine through the House of Representatives, and I do not think that it is as productive as it once was. I will not oppose it this time, but I ask honourable senators to think about the overall consequences of the cut-off and whether it is working as effectively and as originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we do not like to add this extra week. I know the diary problems it would have caused for honourable senators not only on the Opposition side but also right around the chamber. That is a matter for regret. I hope that by setting out a clear sitting pattern for the first half of next year we will be able to stick to that pattern. Basically it will be two weeks on and two weeks off, with one or two modifications. It will be a 12-week sitting aimed to end at the end of June if, having been given that amount of time, the Senate can put its mind to passing legislation in that timeframe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening when I was able to commence my comments on the Appropriation Bills I concentrated on the important relationship between this year's Budget and the outcomes of the recent Premiers Conference, particularly their effect on regional and northern Australia. This morning I would like to concentrate more specifically on the effects of the Budget on northern Australia across a number of portfolios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that in the last six months there has been a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia. Senator Collins is charged with that ministerial responsibility. Therefore, we would normally have expected that there would have been a great deal of coordination, cooperation and improvement in many of the areas that affect the northern Australian portfolio. Unfortunately, as we all know, Senator Collins is a Mr Fix It and a hatchet man. He is a man of great confusion and conflict, particularly when it comes to his portfolio. I seriously contend that in his exercising of ministerial responsibilities Senator Collins has been a pathetic and miserable failure. He demonstrates a real dichotomy of character that can probably be described as a very public and caring Dr Jekyll in the electorate but yet a savage Mr Hyde in his official ministerial roles. He has not contributed in any way to improving things in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking carefully at the issues that I raised last night arising from the Premiers Conference, a number do require major new reforms for northern Australia, particularly as they affect the administra- tion of areas such as Aboriginal land rights and the national parks in the Northern Territory, as well as taxation, especially sales tax and the goods and services tax which has been proposed by the Opposition. We have seen a contrary and opposing stance taken on these issues by Senator Collins rather than a cooperative one.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that concern me most is the fact that the Government is seeking to camouflage its capital works program. During the Estimates I ascertained from both the Department of Finance and the Department of Administrative Services that the Government no longer intends to produce the capital works program documentation that enables us to see the projects as they operate in the construction industries around Australia, particularly northern Australia. There is no longer confidence of planning in the construction industry of northern Australia. There is no longer an underpinning of the economics of that area. I know that groups such as the Master Builders Association and the Confederation of Australian Industry share my concern in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I wish to address is that important portfolio that impacts on northern Australia, Aboriginal affairs. Obviously Senator Collins has a coordination role in this area. We all know that in the last Parliament he was not able to achieve much of a relationship with the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. Things have not improved under the administration of the new Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner. We are again seeing a procrastination in producing both results and, more importantly, information to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 August this year I put a question on the Notice Paper-it is question No. 155, if honourable senators would like to refer to it-requesting information about Government expenditure on all Aboriginal programs affected by Commonwealth departments. Not one skerrick of that information has been provided. Yet, in past years, the Government crowed from the roof tops about its record and achievements in all of those areas. But because it has been subjected to Senate accountability and scrutiny and it is obviously now embarrassed, the Government is no longer game to produce that sort of statement, just like the capital works program, which would identify project slippage. We now see that the Government is not prepared to own up and show its total expenditure in the very important Aboriginal areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I have continually asked questions about issues such as the Arnhem Land plebiscite that was held for Aboriginal people months ago in the Northern Territory. The answer to my question on notice No. 190, which came back this week, can only be described as tomfoolery and humbuggery. I have had to put another question down to pursue that issue further. </PARA>
<PARA> The turnout in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission election in the last fortnight was pathetic. What do Ministers Tickner and Collins seek to do? They seek to hide behind the camouflage of comparing the election to local government. That is a totally inappropriate way to approach these Aboriginal issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Very important issues relating to Aboriginal people, such as the plebiscite, need to be addressed. The Barunga bark painting that was presented under controversial circumstances to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) several years ago is still locked up in Mr Hand's office. That matter has not been pursued; what should happen to it has not been settled with the Aboriginal leaders of northern Australia. The bark painting is a very important symbol to Aboriginal people. It is causing major problems. Aboriginal leaders are arguing that it is even causing death in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions asked at the Estimates this year about the Northern Land Council (NLC) have again been ducked and shoved. I put a question on notice about a possible libel and defamation claim against the NLC Chairman for $1m. The first time round I got a wrong answer and sent it back. I now have a second qualified answer. But, of course, it contains nothing to substantiate whether the Government will have to stand behind a possible $1m defamation. The cover-up is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The community development employment projects (CDEP) scheme, whereby communities elect to go off the various social security pensions and put in place appropriate community projects, is very important. The definitions of the entitlements on these projects obviously need a lot of cleaning up. They are very unclear. When there are groups such as creches and pensioners who undertake only home duties being identified as recipients for CDEP funds, it calls into serious question matters which the Government has not addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the other associated portfolios we see that Senator Collins is not having the effect that he should. There are continuing problems in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs, which is of crucial importance to northern Australia. A large number of migrants have come to, developed and settled well in northern Australia. Fishing incursions into our waters beg other priorities. We have had refugees and boat people. We still have all those continuing issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the animosity and the tension between Ministers Hand and Collins continue. I have received a copy of an administrative circular from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, dated 23 October 1990, which in effect sets down guidelines for section heads and regional officers in dealing with Senator Collins. It talks about certain arrangements and how information should be provided to Senator Collins. I quote from this document:</PARA>
<PARA>Consequent upon this arrangement officers must ensure that appropriate material is sent to Mr Hand's office. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Officers should be alert to identifying appropriate material and forwarding it in the usual way to the Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins has been invited to contact, in the first instance, Mr Hand's office for information on immigration and ethnic affairs matters and Ms Fatin's office for information on local government issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Any member of parliament should be able to approach the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on important matters that relate to either policy or administration and not be constrained. But obviously there is a great deal of tension and sensitivity between Mr Hand and Senator Collins, to the extent that Senator Collins is now being nobbled. This makes sure that the Department now ensures that this will be dealt with in a very different and suspicious manner. I find the particular administrative memo of serious concern to the constituents of northern Australia, who are vitally affected by such an area. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the important portfolio area that Senator Collins has to administer within the range of activities in transport and communications, again we see a number of confusions and conflicts. The Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, of course, has been making a number of initiatives with regard to telecommunications and some of them have met with support and development by the Opposition in this very important area. But I seem to recall that in early September Senator Collins came in to the Senate and tipped a bucket over the development of policies in that area by the Opposition, particularly with regard to the funding of telecommunications for remote and rural Australia. He went all out on that stance. However, a day or so later his senior Minister, Mr Beazley, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do give the Opposition credit for one thing ... there is only one way to meet Community Service obligations and that is to put them on budget. There is no other way of doing it, and at least the Opposition has had the honesty to acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA>What a different stance that is from that taken in this place, in public forums and in the media by Senator Collins. Obviously he has unsettling differences in that area with his own senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in relation to transport, in early September I put down a series of questions on notice in the Estimates committee hearings relating to airports, airport leasing and remote air services. I have received several of those answers in the last few days. They have dribbled in. They are inadequate and they will have to be pursued. Probably the most important one, with regard to the construction timetable for the Darwin and Alice Springs airports and with regard to the provision of information from the Federal Airports Corporation concerning funding programs for those projects, is still outstanding. Yet Senator Collins-who right through the recent Northern Territory election was out leading the charge on many of those issues-because I was absent from the country, was obviously keeping all of these questions and answers under wraps so that they would not surface as issues in the Northern Territory election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it totally inappropriate that a Minister should treat the electorate with such contempt on such important matters. It is some six or eight weeks since these questions were first put down and they have not yet been properly answered. When we get down to talking about the important needs relating to those airports at Darwin and Alice Springs, there has to be an early determination with the airlines to ensure that the travelling public will not be fleeced with additional costs and additional air fares as a result of the outstanding matters, but we have not yet seen those areas addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there are concerns with the Federal member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon, who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, the portfolio in which Senator Collins is involved. Given their factional differences, it must be a very hard task to reconcile properly a number of common issues in that area. For example, the Australian Labor Party currently has a special committee with regard to the review of the uranium mining policy in its Federal platform. That committee's work has somehow been kept under wraps-I presume by Mr Snowdon's factional groups in the Left-to prevent it from reporting in any way that would have contributed to the very proper debate at the recent Premiers Conference. That report has now been extended and dragged out and it does not look like it will surface at all. Senator Collins is an important member of that committee but we cannot yet get any obvious commitment with regard to the future of the important uranium projects in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Snowdon, from the socialist Left, obviously has the upper hand in thwarting Senator Collins in these important developments. It puts Senator Collins in a unique situation that certainly is not complimentary to his administration of the portfolio, and is certainly not in the interests of the people of northern Australia who need to see these important economic projects developed. We all know that there are adequate safeguards environmentally and economically in place, and the market will well and truly look after the sales that need to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also of concern that in the recent Northern Territory Government election Senator Collins was not able to provide any decent leadership to the Labor Party. It is very important to note that he took a high profile position in the election and in supporting particular candidates. I respect him for the role he played with regard to Stanley Tipiloura, who is ill, and I give credit to Senator Collins on the help he gave. However, with regard to promoting the Commonwealth record in the Northern Territory, he obviously failed to achieve any success, because the result speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Senator Collins ran most of the press campaign for the election from his office. The journalists constantly gathered like honeybees to the pot around Senator Collins's office for the duration of that campaign, yet the paid election advertising-particularly on television-featuring Senator Collins did not mention the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Mr Terry Smith. It was very cunning politics. Obviously Senator Collins knew that the slippery slide was well oiled and that Mr Smith was disappearing. There was no support forthcoming in that particular area and any political analysis of the Northern Territory election campaign will show that Senator Collins does not stand out with any credit. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues that was very transparent in that campaign was Mr Smith's proposals for a dramatic new Labor shipping policy for northern Australia encompassing relationships with Papua New Guinea. Coincidentally, one of my questions that did not get answered in the Estimates committee until last week related to that issue-and in that answer the Commonwealth Government walks away from any recognition or identification with such a policy. It just shows the very transparent nature of Senator Collins's two-faced failure in the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to comment on the issues relating to constituents of northern Australia who have to face the important problems created by isolation. There are a couple of issues that surface in this year's Budget that drastically affect people living in isolation. One is the servicing, through the Department of Transport and Communications, of the remote area services subsidy which provides finance to enable people living in remote areas to receive their mail in an appropriate way and, in particular, to receive the education material for children studying in isolated areas. I am well aware that the Isolated Children's Parents Association has made many representations on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates question which surfaced on this matter last week, again after the Northern Territory election had been finalised, and which had been put on notice six or eight weeks previous to that-is just a restatement of the facts. It is no commitment to any change, it is no commitment by the Government to recognise the needs that relate to people, particularly the children, living in isolated parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that came up, after being on notice since 19 September, related to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the provision of particular programs on children's educational radio. I invite honourable senators and any interested person to look carefully at the detailed answer that has been given by the ABC that, yes, these important children's educational programs are going to be cut because of the Government's adjustments to, and harsh Budget treatment of, the ABC and, similarly, that there is now an indication that Budget cuts will also flow over to children's television educational programs. I was given the following answer when I asked which programs would be involved:</PARA>
<PARA>All program purchasing will cease and there will be no new ABC Education production. Children's programs (`The Afternoon Show', `Play School' and `Mr Squiggle') will continue. Transmission of schools programs will be reduced from five hours a day this year to two hours per day of primary and secondary programs next year. Production of `Behind the News',` Asia Wise,' and `For the Juniors' will continue. School's television service for the remainder of 1990 will not be affected. In 1991 the service will be reduced to between one and two hours per day for 30 to 40 weeks of the year. In 1992 there will be no school's service. </PARA>
<PARA>So we see a very dramatic change that is going to affect many people who rely heavily on these programs. It is important to recognise that remote parts of Australia, including northern Australia, are in confusion. There are major conflicts being caused by the lack of attention by Ministers, and in particular by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, Senator Collins. I referred to him earlier as a public Dr Jekyll in the electorate and a savage Mr Hyde in his official role. Perhaps I am wrong in that definition, because Senator Collins does not even have to take a magic potion to fulfil his dichotomy of character. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is today discussing the Government's Appropriation Bills which are intended to implement the Government's Budget strategy, which in turn is intended to give direction to this nation in its economic and social advancement. Unfortunately, it does nothing of the sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I enter into the debate in substance, I wish to express my personal appreciation for the speech delivered here two days ago by Senator Peter Baume, who I think challenged both his own Party and the Government on the substance of the direction we are taking as a nation. The Government is abdicating responsibility to the market-that is what this Government's Budget does-egged on by the other old parties, the Liberal-National Party coalition. Senator Peter Baume called on the Senate to make judgments on values and priorities which take account of human values. Unfortunately, we have abdicated that responsibility to the markets and Senator Peter Baume's voice will be missed when he leaves. I note that his voice of conscience is now a little less muffled than it was before he had decided to leave this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the party system, which is not even in the Constitution, has shackled the intellect and consciences of many honourable senators and members in the other House so that they place more importance on secondary objectives, party politics and staying in power than on the direction that this nation should take and on the direction that we in this House should take in attempting to fulfil the aspirations of Australians. Fortunately, not all members of this House have been shackled in this way. I refer to the other speech in this debate which I think has been noteworthy, and that is the speech by Senator Barney Cooney, who similarly has expressed independent and humanitarian principles which I think the Senate as a whole should take note of. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of essential objectives that we as a nation should pursue. We should attempt to become economically productive yet fair, sustainable, and independent. Our society should be just, and culturally we should be creative and intellectually rigorous. We should be the clever as well as the just society. Unfortunately, the prevailing fashion-I should say dogma-is that this is not the responsibility of government; that it is not our responsibility as parliamentary representatives of the nation to work towards and realise the aspirations of Australians, and to work towards such a just society. Instead, we are prepared to abdicate that responsibility to financial markets and foreign financiers. This abdication of responsibility has not served us well as a nation. A society should be judged by the Rawlesian principle; that is, how it deals with those people who are most disadvantaged in society. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the position we have arrived at, it does us no credit at all. The Smith Family has reported that in the last four months there has been a 40 per cent increase in emergency relief requests. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has documented that currently we still have 310,000 children living in absolute poverty. The Australian Council of Social Service has documented that 10 per cent of Australians own 60 per cent of the nation's wealth and that 72 per cent of incomes are below average weekly earnings, and yet we are a low taxed country. We are eighteenth of 23 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries at the moment. We are also the meanest in terms of expenditure on income support, health, housing and employment. We spend 12.8 per cent of gross domestic product on these, while the international average is 18.8 per cent. For example, France spends 20 per cent in those areas and the Netherlands spends 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Three million Australians are entitled to health cards and are therefore officially classified by the Government as disadvantaged. We can see what this policy does to some members of our society who, I would say, are the least advantaged. Let us look at our Aboriginal community. Life expectancy for ordinary non-Aboriginal male Australians is 72 years; for Aborigines, depending on the region, it ranges from 48 to 61. For non-Aboriginal females life expectancy is 79 years, while for female Aborigines, again depending on the region, it ranges from 57 to 65 years. The infant mortality rate-a very good measure-for all Australians is 9.6 per thousand; for Aborigines it is 29 per thousand. In other words, it is three times as bad. Income per head for all Australians is $9,395, while for Aborigines it is $4,829, which is approximately half. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the other area of concern. If we are to develop a society which is indeed a sustainable society, we must consider the environment. For 200 years we have chopped down forests, polluted rivers, degraded farmland and wasted energy. The old parties have learnt nothing. A recent report found that Federal government funding for renewable energy sources has fallen 88 per cent in real terms in the 12 years since 1978. In December 1987, in response to pressure from the Australian Democrats, the Government undertook to spend $5m over five years through a renewable energy research trust account funded from oil tax revenue. This commitment has been broken in the Budget we are now discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Federal Government set a heavily qualified target of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2025, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that CO2 emissions would have to fall from the present global average of 1.45 tonnes per person to 0.35 tonnes, a drop of 76 per cent, in order to stabilise atmospheric concentrations. I should compare that with Australia, where emissions are approximately 4.5 tonnes per person. Thus, we would have to reduce our emissions to less than 8 per cent of current levels to meet the global average. Anything less implies an indefinite continuation of the existing global inequity in access to energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The third essential element is to build Australia as an economy which is independent and competitive in the international environment-an economy for Australians. Here the prospects and the current situation are getting worse by the day. On 5 November, the Age reported that the current net outflow of interest is $11.9 billion per annum-in other words, $700 per head of population for every woman, man and child. There is another measure for that. It is 20 per cent of export income, and at the level of 25 per cent international bankers start cutting off credit. Clearly, the high interest rate strategy that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has instigated to bring down our foreign debt has not worked, but it has had its costs. We have rising unemployment and a rising wave of bankruptcies in business, both small and big. The result of blind faith in dogma and the primacy of haphazard or, worse, manipulated market forces has not been successful. It has been demonstrated to be devoid of any consideration for human values. </PARA>
<PARA> This lack of consideration for human values and aspirations has been deplored by Senators Baume and Cooney, and the Australian Democrats would call on both old parties to take heed. It might, of course, suit them not to do so because it relieves them of the responsibility to tackle priorities on the basis of human needs and on the long term future of this country. Why is this so? Perhaps one of the sources for this trend can be found in the way in which we treat our education and the way in which our bureaucrats influence our decision makers. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Michael Pusey, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of New South Wales, has documented in a recent paper the dominance of New Right economists in Canberra. Seventy-one per cent of the Senior Executive Service consists of economists, and most of them in his view and on the basis of his research are right wing conservatives. They represent the technical view of economics; in other words, the value free characterisation of economics. Three quarters of them approve of total deregulation of the labour market and all of them, according to Dr Pusey, exhibit:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a residual view of society as some kind of stubbornly resisting sludge that inhibits and obstructs the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we exist for the economy rather than the economy for the people. It is therefore not surprising that this attitude is reflected in the parliamentary action of the old parties. In recent years both of them have combined to vote against some Democrat initiatives which are worth noting. There were the amendments to the social security legislation which opposed the deferral of indexation increases for pensioners and opposed the increase in the rent assistance threshold, which has deprived many needy people of rent assistance, and the postponement of poverty trap measures. Both old parties have voted against those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a Democrat amendment to disallow tax deductibility for tobacco advertising and other promotional activities which are a source of danger for the health of the nation, and yet both parties voted against it. Both of them also opposed our amendment trying to stop increased charges for freedom of information access. They opposed the amendment that sought to initiate greater use of environmental impact statements, as well as the private member's Bill and amendments to protect the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests in Tasmania. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with a great deal of satisfaction that some of the Independent members of Parliament, and in this place in particular-Senator Brian Harradine, Senator Jo Vallentine, former Senator Irina Dunn and former Senator Robert Woods-have in most cases supported initiatives of this type which advance the interests of the nation in attempting to get a country which is economically vigorous, socially just and environmentally responsible. I note with a great deal of pleasure that former Senator Robert Woods has now joined the Australian Democrats in New South Wales. His joining is a sign of things to come. In the long term it is inevitable that the independent spirits who care about human values combine to fight the old parties in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> This continuing trend was given a push at last weekend's National Executive meeting of the Australian Democrats which passed a resolution calling on all State divisions to establish committees and working groups to work with like-minded organisations and parties to bring about a common direction in perhaps the most important challenge facing us in politics in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> In my line-up of amendments and initiatives which both of the old parties have obstructed, I should have included some recent amendments that I moved in this place. I would have thought that they were obvious ones for both of the other parties to support. However, they were rejected. They were the amendments which sought to exempt from sales tax equipment used by disabled people, recycled paper products to the extent that they were not already exempted, and recycled plastic products. </PARA>
<PARA> These were rejected by the Government saying that at some stage it may well introduce similar amendments. They were rejected by the coalition parties with Senator Watson saying that the coalition parties basically did not think they should interfere with the Government's Budget strategy. Clearly, that has now been shot to bits-it is rather a joke-with the coalition's recent attempt, for the sake of $1m of postal charges, to stop the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for ordinary annual services and to run the risk, were that Bill to come back, of ultimately deferring or stopping Supply. </PARA>
<PARA> How can Senator Watson or anyone else on that side now say that he will not vote for an amendment that seeks to improve a Government Budget Bill-a money Bill that is not Supply-on the ground that the coalition should not interfere with the Budget strategy of the Government? Does the coalition really wish to become totally impotent and agree to everything the Government puts forward? Does not the coalition accept the role of this place as a House of review?</PARA>
<PARA> If the members of the coalition wanted to amend the Supply Bill why could they not have taken $43.5m from the defence budget item No. 230 and reallocate it to step up action on youth homelessness? That has been shown to have been neglected again by both State and Federal governments and by both major parties. Mr Burdekin, whose report entitled Our Homeless Children was published two years ago, recently released a summary and overview by the Victorian Council of Services which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Both Federal and Victorian governments have had a minimal response despite the evidence of Our Homeless Children and the continued advocacy from community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Opposition really wanted to mess around with the Supply Bill, why did it not pick up that issue?</PARA>
<PARA> In considering whether a Budget strategy is sacrosanct, one need not rely on this last little escapade of the coalition parties. A quick check of the business in this place over the past two years would reveal at least five occasions on which the Opposition parties were not loath to amend Budget or money Bills. That clearly shows the Opposition will only deal with amendments when it suits it. It is not prepared to judge them on the value they represent to the nation's economic and social well-being. I will name a few of the amendments. Senator Haines moved an amendment to alleviate potential and actual disadvantage to a particular group of people as a result of changes following the legislation on assets in the break-up of marriage. The Opposition supported that yet that was a money Bill. Senator Bishop moved an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) to excise the whole of the 15 per cent tax on investment income in the hands of complying superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not express any value judgment on the amendment. I am simply pointing to the fact that the Opposition parties have not resiled, when it has suited them, from amending money Bills. Therefore, I challenge them that if they really want to change the direction of the Government, if they really want to achieve some of the reforms they say that they are serious about, it is in their hands to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, it is possible to do that, as the Australian Democrats have indeed done, and as they have shown in their alternative Budget which was put forward before the Treasurer submitted his. We have shown in that Budget that it is possible to increase revenue by $7 billion to create room for those measures which we believe are important for this nation. We have provided increased child-care and support services for psychiatric and heavily disabled persons and a 20 per cent boost to the home and community care program for a total of $163m. We have doubled the funding for grant in aid workers for ethnic communities and provided for a 20 per cent boost in real terms for legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> We have increased the young homeless allowance and the disability allowances-a total of $32.5m. We have provided an incentive that the first $1,000 of interest earned will be free of tax through a tax rebate of 39 per cent, at a cost to revenue of $600m but with a potential to gear up the savings ratio of this nation so that we can accumulate our own funds instead of relying on foreign loans. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also shown in this alternative Budget that it is possible to achieve this by increasing the Government's revenue. That is the strategy that should have been followed instead of the strategy that has brought us to our knees with bankruptcies and unemployment. We have suggested a 39 per cent withholding tax on interest paid to overseas lenders to stop tax avoidance rorts which have been recently disclosed in this area. This would raise $600m-and that is a conservative estimate. We have suggested a one per cent Commonwealth land tax on the improved value of land held by absentee foreign landowners. A similar tax was applied between 1910 and 1953. That would yield $100m. A tightening of tax haven legislation would yield $250m. Taxing trusts as companies with imputation rights and exemptions for public charities and other genuine trusts would yield $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of negative gearing on properties would yield $100m and the phasing out of existing arrangements would yield another $200m. An individual's wealth tax of one per cent per annum on net wealth over $1m-the millionaire's tax-with an additional $500,000 exemption for genuine family farms would yield $500m, and so it goes on. This time we have documented where the money is coming from. It is now up to the other parties, the old parties, to deny that this can be done and shrink back from those measures that need to be taken to make us a nation that is independent, environmentally responsible, socially just and economically vigorous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bills, it is a sad and sorry tale that has to be told. Although there might be some feeling of respite this morning for the Government, the overall picture for Australia, despite the wish of the Government not to use the word `recession', is a most depressing one. On this morning's television it was easy to see interviews with people who have lost their jobs and people who are facing complete readjustments to their lives because the economy has plummeted, and there is no hope at all being offered by the strategies of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at our debt, our balance of trade, our interest rates and our unemployment numbers, we see that, although once they may have been beautiful figures to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to the ordinary Australian they are monuments to his policy failings. Unemployment is running at 7.4 per cent. Motor vehicle registrations have fallen on last year's figures by almost 3 per cent each month since August. The percentage annual change of dwelling approvals has been in negative figures for every month since June 1988. New capital expenditure and manufacturing production are in steep decline. We have a debt of $150 billion and still climbing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not allow the Government's jargon to mislead people. This is not just an economic downturn. It is a recession. High interest rates have led to record levels of personal bankruptcies and small business failures and collapse in investment. High interest rates have made the balance of trade worse, not better, and maintained our exchange rates at above long term competitive levels. </PARA>
<PARA> So to inflation-and the brief respite that came through this morning. No doubt the Government will attempt to grandstand on what appears to be a reasonable inflation figure of 6 per cent announced this morning, but a couple of points have to be made. First, the figure was achieved during the period of the price freeze on petrol prices. This means that to a certain extent the figure is illusory because actual fuel prices were being blown out of the water by Hussein during this period. Secondly, and in some ways more importantly, the figure is a direct consequence of the collapse in asset prices brought about by policies of this Government. In other words, the trend of corporate decline from the television industry to the likes of Elders and Adsteam and smaller business failures is now being reflected in the general price level. This provides no reason for gloating. It provides good reason for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> With the trend towards higher unemployment and a lower although unsustainable inflation rate, the Treasurer will find an even bigger problem on his hands with the Australian Labor Party. This is the two-edged sword for a Labor government. With Caucus members rolling the Treasurer on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank earlier this week, they will definitely be wanting to flex their muscles. The old style left wing will emerge; there will be pressure to control unemployment through fiscal expansion. During the entire period that stringent measures have been tightened in the economy, we have had the bleep from the Government that it came to office with high unemployment, that it has indeed succeeded in lowering that unemployment and that that has been its big success-whereas, of course, we are seeing the turnaround of that, and as a result of the Government's own policies. The left of the Party certainly will be moving to try to alleviate what it sees as a problem for its side of the faction debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Without appreciating the linkages of wages to fiscal policy under this Government, which I will deal with later, as I said, the left of the Labor Party and the union movement will aim to trade off lower unemployment for the higher inflation figure. Should this happen, then the Government's attempts to control the aggregate demand through monetary policy will have been for nought. Perhaps today will not be the joyous one that the Treasurer may have thought it would be for him personally, although the lower inflation rate certainly is pleasing for the Australian economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990-91 Budget itself tells a sorry story of lost opportunity for a government failing to inject incentive into our taxation system, failing to rein in government spending and failing to boost national savings. In the current financial year total public sector spending is set to grow at 2.75 per cent-faster than our national production-and the Budget cut only $350m from the forward projections in a total Budget of $93 billion. That represents a cut of only 0.4 of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the Government's expenditure cuts into perspective, the coalition outlined $3 billion worth of expenditure cuts in our Economic Action Plan prior to the last election. It was almost 10 times what the Government has achieved in its last Budget. It makes a lie of the Government claim that it was a tough Budget. It was not. What little restraint in fiscal policy that has occurred under Labor over the previous seven years has been achieved by cutting Commonwealth Government capital expenditure. But in the 1990-91 Budget, even capital expenditure has proved resistant to further cuts. It is of concern that the winding back of the public infrastructure spending has occurred without any clear vision of what will take its place. This is evidenced by the total lack of public debate on the privatisation of public infrastructure. Indeed, as long as we go on having a system of cash accounting to deal with public expenditure and as long as we do not start to provide for the maintenance in an on-going way for our infrastructure costs, we will continue to meet this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Recurrent expenditure has been left virtually untouched. There are no significant cuts in welfare spending, which is set to rise by 5.7 per cent in real terms. This amounts to the biggest increase in the last seven years. So much for tax reform in the latest Budget. The Treasurer handed back a meagre $1.2 billion in tax cuts. What he neglected to say was that he took double that amount in bracket creep from taxpayers in the last financial year alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget has already been totally discredited by the unrealistic Budget assumptions. Saddam Hussein may have blown the Treasurer's prediction on oil prices out of the water, but he can blame no-one when his own figures on growth, unemployment and inflation have been inaccurate. The Treasurer's failure on the assumption has torn apart the Government's strategy on wages, interest rates and foreign debt. We have heard, since the last election, a lot of focus on the micro-economy and I will say a few words about that a little later. But there is a need to look at the macro-economy also. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made a lot of his so-called unholy trinity-fiscal policy, monetary policy and wages policy-but there is nothing solemn about the way the Government has chosen to exercise these policies. Fiscal policy has been tied to wages policy through the wage-tax trade-off. This has reduced the flexibility of fiscal policy. It now seems obvious that this decision has led to the limit of fiscal restraint which has now been reached. What is needed is further fiscal restraint to enhance national savings as an anti-inflationary device to complement monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there was nothing in the Budget to boost national savings. There was no increase in total public sector savings as the Commonwealth surplus was broadly offset by deficits in the States. I would, however, single out, as Mr Whitlam seems to have done this morning, New South Wales and say that Mr Greiner has proved to be a man who is tackling the problems of the 1990s in a way that the Labor Premiers have neither the inclination nor the ability to do. Due to the exaggerated growth forecast in the Budget, there may actually be a drop in national savings. </PARA>
<PARA> With the interaction of the wage-tax trade-off, the effect of fastening together fiscal and wages policies has been to impose the bulk of the burden of aggregate demand restraint onto monetary policy. Monetary policy is of limited effectiveness in achieving the objectives of low inflation and a smaller current account deficit. What has happened is that a tight monetary policy has led to an unnaturally high exchange rate, despite some Reserve Bank intervention in the foreign exchange market, and crippling interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> High interest rates have strangled investment demand and caused considerable hardship for ordinary families struggling to meet their mortgage payments. There is a need for an expressed anti-inflationary policy. The Government is totally without any realistic strategy to fight inflation. The expression of unexpected surprise and delight on the Treasurer's face this morning simply shows that the result that we have had this morning was in no way planned nor anticipated from Government planned policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Treasurer has failed to appreciate is that inflation reduction has little to do with monetary policy. The centralised wage fixing system and the accord have institutionalised the expectation of inflation and therefore increased wages. That has ensured a maintenance of high inflation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has already indicated that, because the inflation rise was less than expected, it will be asking for a top up. On each hand, policy will have failed again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank of Australia has not helped. Besides low inflation, the Reserve Bank has stable employment as one of its objectives. This means that there has been no such thing as independent monetary policy in this country. The Reserve Bank is constantly looking over its shoulder to see the decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission and couching its policies partially around its employment objective. This does not allow the Reserve Bank to trade off higher unemployment with lower inflation. We need a genuinely independent Reserve Bank with a clear mandate to fight inflation as its primary objective. This should be the centrepiece of any anti-inflationary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the question of the Opposition's announced policy and the need in our economy for a goods and services tax, but only as part of genuine tax reform-and genuine tax reform that makes the law simpler for the ordinary citizen to understand and simpler to comply with. It is not without significance that, after the Australian Taxation Office published its book to try to explain taxation law to Australian citizens, the number of ordinary taxpayers who used the services of tax agents actually rose. I think the complicated system explained in the book simply frightened them to death. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax reform is long overdue. We have a taxation system which stifles incentive and actively discourages savings. Within the framework of an overall reduction in taxation and the introduction of a goods and services tax, we will see the restoration of incentives to save and invest. The current wholesale sales tax is a ramshackle affair, with five different rates covering a multitude of goods. It is absurd that caviar is not taxed while chocolates and biscuits attract a 10 per cent tax; that televisions are hit by a 30 per cent tax while books and newspapers are exempt; and that Coca Cola is taxed at 10 per cent while mineral water is exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the Treasurer's intellectual dishonesty on the goods and services tax question. Who could forget Mr Keating's proposal for his own consumption tax with his tax cart in 1985? If the tax was acceptable when Mr Keating advocated it in 1985, how have things changed? The reasons that he gives are not convincing. Indeed, they are spurious. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 the need for such a tax and tax reform to abolish the wholesale tax concept and replace it with a more just and equitable tax is certainly the sensible way to go. The Treasurer has shied away from his original commitment to tax reform by the use of a consumption tax simply because he has remained the captive of the trade union movement. We all remember that the demise of his proposition occurred when he was summoned in the dead of night to meet with the head of the ACTU in a motel room down the road from where the official meeting was taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> But, unlike the Treasurer, some of us who espoused a consumption tax in 1985 have not changed. In 1985 I made a submission to the Economic Planning Advisory Council in connection with the Tax Summit. At that stage, I recommended a broadly based consumption tax in the form of a retail sales tax levied at a flat rate which should include services and with only a narrow range of exemptions. Five years later my view remains exactly as it was then. It is now in line with coalition policy. A task force, of which I am a part, has now been established to sell the concept of tax reform, which includes the imposition of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that consumption taxes are accepted worldwide. Twenty-one out of the 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries have a goods and services tax. Such a tax is both fair and efficient. It is fair because the richer the person is the more that person spends and the more that person will be taxed, income earners will have more disposable income in their pockets and lower income earners will be fully compensated. The incentive to avoid punitive levels of income tax is reduced and it is levied at one uniform rate. A goods and services tax is efficient because it is cheaper to collect than other forms of taxation. It closes loopholes in the wholesale tax system, it encourages productive activity and it will encourage savings and investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The micro-economy, about which I said I would also say a few words, is, despite the announcement which the Government is to make later today concerning how strong it has been with regard to micro-economic reform, still sad and sorry within our economy. Perhaps the greatest failure of the Hawke Government has been to starve the economy of micro-economic reform and thereby starve our economy of incentive and opportunity for increased productivity. Our labour market is not really a market at all. Wages are determined by the ACTU leadership and the Treasurer and employers are excluded. The centralised process is anti-productive and anti-competitive as wage increases are applied across the board, irrespective of the condition or strength of particular firms and industries. In the rare cases where we have seen exceptions to this broad-based approach, we have seen that the union movement has moved in to penalise those areas. That is demonstrated by what is happening in Queensland where an advantage that was given to a particular firm, in that it was able to negotiate its own terms and conditions, is to have that advantage taken away from it by the new Goss Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of there being a solution from the accord, the accord is indeed part of the problem. The Government has failed completely to understand the micro-economic implications of the accord and its failure to generate any micro-economic incentives. The coalition alternative is an increased focus on the workplace negotiations to determine wages and conditions. Our industrial relations system features voluntary enterprise-based agreements, guaranteed voluntary unionism ensuring freedom of workers, and productivity improvements to be shared amongst employers and their employees. This is the only way in which we will arrive at internationally competitive wage outcomes which tie wages to performance and genuinely protect the interests of workers and their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, over the last seven years perhaps the saddest comment is that regarding industry policy-or the lack of it-the failure to have a successful industry policy. There has been a systematic failure to bring about the revitalisation of Australian industry. Whether this has been brought about by sectoral plans, the bounty and grants schemes, procurements and offsets policies, partnership for development, or the failed MIC scheme, Senator Button and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce have failed to establish sustainable benefits for manufacturers, exporters or consumers. The possible collapse of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has revealed that the Government is totally without an integrated and cohesive policy which would enable Australian manufacturing to confront the world, and a quick dash off in a plane by the Prime Minister to visit one of the latest meetings of GATT will not be the solution to that problem. We have a government boasting about its propensity to pick export winners when it is evident that it is truly merely subsidising wailing losers. Only yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, gave a vast plea for more government intervention, saying that Australia is somehow different from the rest of the world. It is different in that while the rest of the world was improving its performance during the 1980s, we were not improving our performance. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen is that, yes, we are different from the rest of the world and we should have taken advantage of the terms of trade with which we were presented during the 1980s, but to say that we are different and, therefore, we can apply different rules of trade to ourselves is a nonsense. We are part of the world trading pattern; we cannot say, `Stop the world, I want to get off'. </PARA>
<PARA> With unjustified subsidies to firms like Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd that have been made with scant regard to the main sufferers of the industry policy, ordinary Australians such as taxpayers and consumers have been the losers. I can see no social justice in punishing local car buyers to the tune of $4,000 a car, which is the cost of protection in that industry. How is it fair to tell consumers that we pay $1.6 billion worth of protection for an inefficient car industry? Or that we pay, on average, 67 per cent more for clothes, 63 per cent more for shoes and 25 per cent more for textiles than we would if the protectionist policies were not in place?</PARA>
<PARA> Protection is a problem, and Mr Dawkins's cry for more protection in his speech to the National Press Club yesterday will not solve this country's problems. The withdrawal of trade barriers to negligible levels-as is, indeed, our policy-together with micro-economic measures and reforms, will, indeed, give benefits to consumers, taxpayers and manufacturers alike. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor has frittered away Australia's chances through the 1980s and it does not have the guts to make the hard decisions in the 1990s. What we need is new vision and new courage, and a sensible mix of macro-economic reform and policies that complement each other and provide the necessary incentives to save and invest. When that is matched with micro-economic reform and the appropriate structures that invite competition and productivity, then we will start to see hope on the horizon for the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise during the Appropriation Bills debate to refer particularly to appropriation matters, but I feel I must say something about what Senator Bishop has just been referring to, because she referred to protection. In a very broad and sweeping statement she claimed that protection should be eliminated. It is typical of the statements of the Liberal Party of Australia on these matters: in the future it is going to do things. Of course, it has no real plan, other than the slogan of micro-economic reform, to solve the problems of industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very impractical policy that the Liberal Party refers to when it is contrasted with what two Labor governments-the Whitlam Government and this Government-have done to reduce tariffs in this country. In all the period of the Fraser Government there was no movement on tariffs at all. On the other hand, we have reduced those tariffs, but it has been done on the basis of trying to protect people and prepare them for change in industry. A series of industry plans has been developed to make sure that people in industry would not be thrown on the scrap heap, as theorists would have it, by simply the blunt instrument of the reduction of tariffs without adequate preparation for all the industries concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop talked about the car industry and a range of industries that she is concerned about. Of course, these industries would have dire consequences for Australia if tariffs were to be reduced dramatically without taking into consideration the consequences for the human beings concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope Senator Bishop is not leaving the chamber for any length of time, because I want to be critical of her and some of her colleagues in relation to the minority report that members of the Opposition have put out on Estimates Committee A. The report of Estimates Committee A has come in late to the Senate because of the inordinate time we have taken in preparing it. Indeed, I think Estimates Committee A can claim a record because we sat for 58 hours on eight sitting days, with one session starting at 10.08 in the morning and going through until 4.05 a.m. the next day. The Committee has worked very hard in terms of examining witnesses and has said that the Senate might need to examine the work load and review the distribution of portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is fairly unexceptional. I was, then, surprised to see in the minority report that Senator Bishop and other Opposition senators said:</PARA>
<PARA>The length of hearing was partly due to lack of preparation by some departmental officers, a reluctance by others to convey complete information and a deliberate attempt by Senator Button to prevent officers of his Department to answer questions of the Committee. This was particularly evident in relation to the Oztech exhibition and the Midford case. </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal briefly with those matters. I do think that I have to say in view of that attack on Senator Button that Senator Button-and I have chaired a number of Estimates committees with a number of Ministers-is very tolerant in the way he answers questions. He is a courteous Minister, but even his courtesy was put to the test by Senator Bishop's technique of asking questions and believing she could determine which person should answer them, rather than following the basic principle that the Minister decides whether he will answer a question or will seek the assistance of an officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately Senator Bishop, by virtue of this belief that she should be able to determine who will answer questions, has persuaded her colleagues to make that criticism of Senator Button. I believe it is unfounded and I believe there is a danger that if we do have unreasonable questions asked and hectoring of witnesses by senators, we will have a tendency for Ministers to answer more and more questions themselves and to be less cooperative than they have been. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, there was a greater effort by the departments that we examined to get answers quickly than ever before, and only a small percentage of questions has not been answered. When we consider the vast number of questions asked, particularly by Senator Bishop, it is insulting to say of Minister Button that he has been anything but superlative in the way he has had his departmental officers work through the night to give us the answers on time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like briefly to refer to the minority report of Opposition senators, and I shall mention those two matters to which Senator Bishop has referred. But there is also another matter which I think is cause for concern as it affects this chamber itself and the way our committee system works. Senator Bishop spent a great deal of time, not to put too fine a point on it, attacking officers of the Senate-that is the way it appeared to me-because of a decision to allow committee secretaries and other researchers to go to a Labor Lawyers Association conference. It is a yearly function, a very respected conference attended by a wide range of the legal fraternity who discuss in a proper academic atmosphere the many issues dealt with. The minority report reflects the cross-examination undertaken by Senator Bishop. Part of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition members of the Committee believe that if officers of the Parliamentary Departments wish to attend conferences which are associated with a particular political party, such as the Labor Lawyers Association, then they should do so in their own time and at their own expense. The actions of the Departments, in approving expenditure to send officers to such conferences, raise serious concerns about the perception of political neutrality. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not accept the proposition that because the Labor Lawyers Association is not formally affiliated with the Australian Labor Party that the conferences of the Association are not politically partisan. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me about this minority report is that it raises serious concerns about the perception of political neutrality. This is a thinly veiled attempt to imply that the people involved from the Senate would be partisan. The Clerk of the Senate in replying to the questions made it absolutely clear that officers go along to such conferences maintaining their complete neutrality, and that he would expect them to do that-and there is no suggestion that they have not-and that they use the information that comes from the debates of the conference to further the work of the Senate committees which they serve, particularly in the legal area. Indeed, the Clerk answered the questions about all the details because there was an inference that something was wrong in respect of the way in which those officers went to the conference. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the Clerk's reply, which is three pages long and is headed `Attendance of officers at conferences'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ATTENDANCE OF OFFICERS AT CONFERENCES</PARA>
<PARA>In response to the questions asked at the hearing of Estimates Committee A on 11 September 1990 by Senators Bishop, O'Chee and Short, the following information describes the position with respect to Senate officers whose attendance at conferences of the Australian Society of Labor Lawyers was, or is to be, funded by the Department of the Senate. This information responds to all of the questions asked. The facts in relation to particular conferences are first set out, and information applying to all attendances is then provided. </PARA>
<PARA>(1) Attendances at conferences</PARA>
<PARA>1989 conference</PARA>
<PARA>Attended by: Ms Bronwyn McNaughton, secretary to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and formerly secretary to the Joint Select Committee on the Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters relevant to committees' inquiries: privacy issues (Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had recently concluded an inquiry on the tax file numbers proposal and related privacy issues, and the speakers included the Federal Privacy Commissioner); judicial independence (relevant to the Joint Select Committee's inquiry; the secretary of the Joint Select Committee did not attend). </PARA>
<PARA>1990 conference</PARA>
<PARA>To be attended by: Mr Stephen Argument, secretary to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and until recently acting secretary to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters relevant to committees' inquiries: the rights of accused (relevant to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee); the cost of justice (current reference before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in which Mr Argument may again in the future be involved). </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Bronwyn McNaughton, secretary to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters relevant to Committee's inquiry: the cost of justice (current reference before the Committee). </PARA>
<PARA>Previous conferences</PARA>
<PARA>1988: Ms Bronwyn McNaughton, secretary to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>1986: Ms Susan Gibb, then secretary to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; Mr Peter O'Keeffe, then secretary to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, who presented a paper. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Applications</PARA>
<PARA> The applications to attend the conferences are attached. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Consultations with committees</PARA>
<PARA> The minutes of the committees do not record any formal consultations with the committees. The Chairman of the Committees has approved the attendances, in writing only in the case of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as shown in the attached note. Ms McNaughton recalls her attendance at the 1989 conference being discussed with at least some members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>(4) Reports</PARA>
<PARA> Officers are expected to provide written reports of their attendances at conferences. Oral briefings have been provided. Ms McNaughton has not yet provided a written report of her attendance at the 1989 conference. It has been indicated to staff that they need not provide comprehensive and detailed reports, but that brief summary reports suffice. </PARA>
<PARA>(5) Costs</PARA>
<PARA> The department pays for registration fees for the conference, the officers' travel and travel allowance. At the hearing, as recorded at pages 20, 21 and 24, reference was made to Mr Argument paying part of his costs of attendance. Mr Argument made this suggestion, but it has been decided that the full costs of his attendance will be met by the department. As indicated at the hearing, the costs are charged to the office to which the officer belongs; if they are regarded as attributable to a particular committee they are charged to that committee. </PARA>
<PARA>(6) Status of officers attending and participation in proceedings</PARA>
<PARA> Officers whose attendance at the conferences is funded by the department are attending in their official capacity. They attend on the same basis as all other persons who attend the conference. Apart from presenting a paper, as Mr O'Keeffe did in 1986, they receive copies of papers, listen to discussions and may ask questions and participate in discussions. Ms McNaughton does not recall whether she participated in discussions at the 1989 conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document sets out the financial circumstances which prevailed and the officers who attended those conferences. I should draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that there has been an attempt to say that officers of committees, secretaries of committees and senior research officers of Senate committees are insufficiently mature to be able to go to a conference, listen to the arguments, take notes, make appropriate reports and use the information to further their work. There is no question that any officer of this standing within the Senate could go to any such meeting and be able to conduct himself or herself with the honour and dignity we associate with Senate staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the same way I would point out that although the Labor Lawyers Conference has the word `Labor' in its title and deals with Labor issues, in the broadest sense it is not affiliated with the Australian Labor Party and has no direct links with the Labor Party in an organic way, but is simply a conference that deals with Labor issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to two other matters which Senator Bishop raised in giving her reasons for the Estimates Committee A hearings being such a lengthy process. She mentioned the Midford case. I have referred to Senator Button and I would like now to clarify a few points for the record because Senator Bishop asked a lengthy series of questions and made statements, some of which were quite inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop referred to an injunction being sought by and granted to the Malaysian Government to stop Australian Customs Service (ACS) investigation officers obtaining documents in Malaysia. The fact is that no injunction was sought by or granted to the Malaysian Government. An injunction was sought by solicitors acting on behalf of Midford Malaysia, and that was granted by the court. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop also alleged that documents were taken illegally by Customs officers in Malaysia. In fact, the position of the Australian Customs Service is that the documents in question were proffered voluntarily to the ACS by company officials. The officers had left Malaysia before the injunction was put into effect. A subsequent appeal by the Royal Malaysian Customs and the Australian Government against the injunction resulted in its being set aside. It was claimed that prosecution proceedings were contemplated against Australian Customs Service officers in Malaysia. There is no such contemplation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop purported firstly that the officers departed Malaysia under some subterfuge, such as being smuggled out in the back of a car, which is a very serious allegation; secondly, that they had sought refuge in the Australian High Commission in Malaysia; and, thirdly, that they left Malaysia unbeknown to the Malaysian Government. Those are three very serious allegations against the two officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with the first claim, which is that refuge was sought in the Australian High Commission. Of course, refuge was not sought and the denial in that respect is made emphatically. The passports of the two officers bear departure stamps indicating their official departure from Malaysia. It was indicated in the Estimates Committee that it was believed that the officers were transported to the airport by Royal Malaysian Customs officers, and this has since been confirmed. Senator Bishop tendered affidavits from employees of companies in Malaysia alleging coercion by Australian Customs Service officers in seeking documents. These allegations have been completely repudiated by the two officers involved. The question is at a certain point whether we believe officers of the Australian Government or whether we believe anything that is said in a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop, in raising the matter of public interest in a debate in which I also participated, said that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided to lay a prosecution in the Midford case after relying on information and evidence provided by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC). It was said that the provision of that information was subsequently found by the presiding magistrate to be unreliable and that the departmental witness was totally discredited. </PARA>
<PARA> A brief of evidence was provided to the DPP by the ACS, including statements by DITAC officers. The brief was obviously considered by the DPP and discussions took place with counsel prior to the decision to prosecute Midford. During the committal proceedings further evidence came to light under cross-examination which caused the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw charges. It is regrettable that the evidence was highlighted only at this stage, but after all that is the system of justice that we work under. The committal proceedings were intended to test whether the defendants should prima facie be committed to trial. The Director of Public Prosecutions had taken the decision to prosecute based on the brief presented to him and on his subsequent discussions with and advice from counsel, who supported the prosecution proceedings. Based on developments occurring during the committal proceedings, the DPP had little option other than to withdraw. Costs were awarded to the defendants. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop also raised the issue of the Australian Customs Service subsequently pursuing charges of valuation fraud against Midford. The answer is that settlement of this matter was effected following offers from the company in September 1990. I do not think anything further needs to be said on that matter, when clearly the company made the offer that resolved the issue. Senator Bishop relied upon extracts from the submission from the Law Council of Australia to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in order to allege improper practices by Customs investigation officers. Suffice to say at this stage that the Law Council has not backed its generalised complaints with any specific details. The Australian Customs Service denies the substance of the generalised complaints. It is to be noted that the Law Council appeared before the House of Representatives Committee in Sydney on 30 October to answer questions in relation to its submission. I have not had the opportunity to find out what happened at that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We have here a series of issues. Senator Bishop has raised numerous matters of minutiae, which the Department has responded to at great length. The significant thing about the Midford issue is that it is basically an embarrassment to members of the Opposition because of a secret deal negotiated by none other than Prime Minister Fraser during the time of the Fraser Government. It is incredible that the Opposition, through Senator Bishop, should raise this issue to prominence when the secret deal made in Malaysia was the reason why that case objectively failed. The officers concerned did not realise that the Fraser Government had made a secret and sordid deal so many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to refer briefly to the other matter to which Senator Bishop referred and that is the Oztech Trade Exhibition. This is an issue on which I think we spent a great deal of time. An organisation came forward that had a concept for an exhibition. It suggested it to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and Austrade also entered into contracts. The amount of money totalled $75,000. The Committee believes that there should be a process of evaluation before contracts of this type are entered into so that we drew attention to the Department that it needs to look more closely at the procedures to be followed. I am quite certain that it will take note of the Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing wrong, sordid and improper in what has happened in this particular case when one takes into consideration that the particular organisation was putting forward an idea and the Department liked the idea of an exhibition next year and decided to accept it. Although we have spent a good deal of hours on that matter, the reality is that there is nothing in it. This is so typical of many of the issues that have been pursued by Senator Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that any objective analysis of Estimates Committee A would indicate that Senator Bishop's method of asking questions at length, hoping that finally something might come up, has been unsuccessful and the lengthy minority report that has been presented by the Opposition senators has not any substance in it. I will not take the time of the Senate to go through all the other aspects, because I hope I have illustrated that this particular minority report is not worth any further consideration by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill and the implications of the Budget, there are certain matters that I want to bring to the attention of the chamber. The setting must be taken against a couple of things which, I believe, are of crucial importance for the future and well-being of Australia. The first part in that is our current national debt which is in excess of $124 billion. Our current account from last year was significantly above the estimated $18 billion by something like $2.5 billion or $2.7 billion. The projection for this year in terms of the current account has been put at $18 billion but under current circumstances I would suggest it will be much closer to $25 billion than the projected $18 billion. In terms of Budget settings, I believe Australia is now caught in a debt trap, and unless very drastic and quick action is taken, we will find ourselves in much more difficult circumstances through the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must also here make a comment on the current situation in the wool industry, because I believe the wool industry is heading down a very similar route to that taken by the Australian economy and unless we address the national debt problems it will be very difficult for effective Government policy in a number of areas which I will come to later. </PARA>
<PARA> I have something else to say about the debt trap. The National Debt Summit which was held some 12 months ago identified-and it has not been refuted-that Australia needed over the next decade a 4 per cent net growth in exports to stabilise its debt. I really think that Budget settings in the future should address this aspect, and the last one certainly fails in that context. One thing I know-as the Alan Bonds and others have found out in this world-is that a person cannot go into debt indefinitely because sooner or later the bank manager will tap him on his shoulder and say, `No more'. The economic newsletter of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia states:</PARA>
<PARA>Main Features</PARA>
<PARA>While the Budget surplus is projected to increase marginally to $8.1 billion, compared with $8.0 billion in the previous year as a proportion of gross domestic product it will fall to 2.0 per cent from 2.2 per cent in 1989-90. Continuing the recent trend, both aggregate revenues and outlays are expected to decline as a percentage of GDP. However, in each case the decline will be very slight. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the important part:</PARA>
<PARA>In real terms (ie after adjusting for inflation), total outlays are expected to rise marginally by 0.6 per cent compared with a real decline of 0.2 per cent in 1989-90. Budget data over recent years have been distorted by special factors (in particular asset sales and the transfer of State debt). After adjusting to take these in account, the real increase in outlays is 1.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The point that I want to make is that at a time such as this when it is essential that we have a policy direction or setting which in fact addresses our national debt situation and our current account problem, we should be reducing outlays not increasing them. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not address these things we will not be creating an environment where we can have profitable business and maintain or improve living standards, social justice or an effective environmental policy. If we are to look at achieving that 4 per cent net growth in exports, Australia must become internationally competitive. Right now we are not internationally competitive in terms of inflation, interest rates and in other aspects or measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote some figures on interest rates. While the recent reductions in interest rates are certainly welcome, the question has to be asked: where does it leave us? In a consideration of real interest rates in selected Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries it is worth looking at the figures for the United States of America (USA), Japan and Germany. In June 1990-the latest period for which figures are available-the retail interest rates were: Australia, 18.75 per cent; USA, 10 per cent; Japan, 7.2 per cent and Germany, 7.83 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If I analyse those percentages for those countries that are our competitors in the international market-and that is why I am talking about international competitiveness, I find that the Americans have an advantage of 8.75 per cent over us, Japan and Germany have an advantage of about 11 per cent over us. If I take into account what has occurred since then, I find that our retail interest rates-and these figures are from the Department of the Parliamentary Library-have fallen to 17.9 per cent which takes one per cent off those figures I have just quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally as important are the real interest rates and this is where inflation, which is a very important component of the total equation, comes into it. In June 1990, the real interest rates were: Australia, 10.34 per cent; USA, 5.39 per cent; Japan, 4.69 per cent; Germany, 5.4 per cent and the United Kingdom, 4.89 per cent. So we consistently see a difference of 5 per cent in interest rates. I understand the rationale or the reasoning behind the Government's monetary policy but I have to say that I believe it is wrong. What it has done is make us non-competitive on an international basis. Unless we are competitive there we cannot address those particular aspects that I raised earlier on. The real crunch is when we start looking at some of the reasons behind our problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I certainly welcome the drop in inflation figures which were announced yesterday, we must once again examine these against those of our competitors to see where it leaves us. In June 1990, our inflation rate was 7.6 per cent, that of the United States was 4.4 per cent, Japan's was 2.4 per cent and Germany's was 2.3 per cent. We have an enormous gap in that aspect of our policy setting and, in terms of the direction we have to take in Budget settings, that is the most crucial issue in front of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go through some of the other aspects of addressing this problem. One must come to two areas which, above all, are the most important. The first one is our taxation system combined with our industrial system. We currently have a taxation system and an industrial system which, in my view, totally militate against incentive. If we are to create a situation where we lift our productivity so that we can compete and reduce our inflation rate, our interest rates and other aspects which will allow us to address those two areas I will keep emphasising-the trap we are in with our national debt and our current account problems-we must have systems which reward people who are prepared to perform. We will not get people to perform when the major parts of the economy which either reward or penalise them are disincentives. That is precisely what both those areas do. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise my earlier comments about the Budget setting and the need to reduce total government outlays. It is worth noting that a cut of 4 per cent in total government expenditure would allow income tax levels to be reduced to two rates of the order of 30 per cent and 20 per cent. In itself, that would be very important in lifting productivity and allowing the Australian economy to address some of the very crucial matters. I am not trying to suggest that that will be easy. I do not think it is a case of things being easy. It is really a case of whether we have the courage to correct some of the difficulties that Australia has as an international competitor. It does not matter whether we are talking about agriculture or mining or about the development that is now occurring in some of the manufacturing industries. Unless Australia can compete internationally, it is all done in vain. </PARA>
<PARA> I have long been an advocate for major changes in our taxation system, particularly in the levels of personal income tax rates and the wholesale sales tax regime. One reason I have for a number of years supported very strongly the introduction of a goods and services type tax is because of the anomalies in our wholesale sales tax and the way in which it penalises our exporters when compared with our major competitors in international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me cite a number of inequities in our current wholesale sales tax. Under current arrangements, there is no sales tax on antique clocks, oysters, pornographic magazines, caviar, and mineral water. A sales tax of 10 per cent applies to refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, toys-for goodness sake-chocolate biscuits, Coke, bicycles and radios. The sales tax on tool boxes is 20 per cent and on televisions it is 30 per cent. We can go down the list. Anybody who tells me that that is equitable within a community in terms of the taxation system has his assessments totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the necessity in the current situation in Australia of having in place systems which encourage increases in productivity by giving people reward in their hip pockets. One of the most important things for us to do is to use the hip pocket nerve to encourage people to perform better. I have every confidence in the Australian community. If they are given that incentive, the vast majority-in excess of 95 per cent of people-will perform; whereas in our current situation there is no incentive. In fact, we have seen the accord-this is its down side-lower people's living standards without any reward for that extra effort. Effectively, it has handed control to Kelty for the setting of wages when much more emphasis should be put on that being set at the enterprise level between the participants involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The next equation which I see as being very important in our current situation is micro-economic reform. I am absolutely sick and tired, firstly, of talking about it and, secondly, of hearing other people talk about it. It has been going on for as long as I can remember. Since the Second World War there have been about 30 inquiries either directly or indirectly into the waterfront and numerous inquiries into the transport industry-I think four have been held since this Government has been in power. But no government, neither this one nor previous governments, has effectively tackled the issue of micro-economic reform-and there are enormous rewards in it for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While one must say that what we see happening now is welcome, why has it taken so long to have a Premiers Conference to talk about micro-economic reform when it has been on the public agenda for so long and when the benefits are so obvious? In a moment I will put some figures on the record. Why do we not just get on with the job and do it, because it will be beneficial for all Australians and particularly the Australian economy? Let me just quote from the National Farmers Federation policy overview:</PARA>
<PARA>The appropriate policy response is to accelerate the pace of micro-economic reform. The benefits of micro-economic reform vastly outweigh the selected intervention. For example, protection elsewhere in the economy costs each Australian farm about $6,000 per year. Waterfront inefficiencies add another $3,000 per export farm per year. </PARA>
<PARA>In a wider context, the IAC estimated the long term gains from microeconomic reform would be an annual gain in real GDP of almost 5 per cent, equivalent to $16 billion per year in 1988/89 dollars, or $1,600 per household. An additional 35,000 jobs would be created. </PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the current unemployment figures that are unfolding and the projections for the next three, six, nine and twelve months, we see that if ever we needed those 35,000 jobs, we need them now. It is about time we got on with the job. Unfortunately, in the current Budget settings that aspect is not effectively addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now provide a couple of examples of things which I have observed in the short time I have been here and which I think focus on a much broader problem. One thing in the Estimates committee meetings which caused me great concern was the expenditure for advertising detailed in the budget in the draft annual report of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In this last year there was an increase from $54m to $69m for advertising promotion. In anyone's language that is an enormous amount of money. Firstly, why do we need to spend that sort of money in that particular area when, I believe, it could be spent much more effectively elsewhere? Secondly, why must there be an increase of $15m in that expenditure? Has any analysis been done on the effectiveness of some of these programs and the resultant expenditure? As we run through the list of expenditure, we find $15m here, $20m there, $30m somewhere else, and suddenly we start to ask ourselves some questions when we suggest the necessity to look at total government outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that in fact there is an enormous wastage in some of these programs which achieve very little. They certainly do not go to the core or to the heart of the Australian problem now which, as I said earlier, is our national debt and current account problem. We need to place some priorities in our expenditure on the benefits of making sure that we are creating an environment which will allow us to address some of the issues that I have mentioned. I am also rather appalled by the pattern of this expenditure. In the July-September quarter it was $14,806,000; in the October-December quarter it was $11,512,000; and we find in the January-March quarter that it was $23,925,000, almost $24m. I just ask the question: Is it coincidental that that was the quarter in which the election was held?</PARA>
<PARA> The next point I raise is the 100 per cent write-off for fencing for farm plans. While I welcome this and it is something that the industry has been seeking for some time, I just pose the question, because it is linked to an approved farm plan: When are we going to have the mechanism put in place that is required so that the people who are prepared to put a farm plan together can get that farm plan approved and can benefit from this particular initiative?</PARA>
<PARA> When mechanisms are in place which will allow individual land-holders to avail themselves of initiatives in the challenges that we face in Australia in relation to land degradation and conservation in our farming and pastoral areas some of these measures will be effective. I have two properties 12 miles apart. One has had the farm plan approved but I am told by the Department of Agriculture that it could take another four or five years before I can get the other farm plan approved. So there is the inequitable situation in one business enterprise where part of the property qualifies; the other part does not. I happen to be one of the lucky ones because I have at least part of my farm plan approved. There are many farmers throughout Australia who have no hope, under the current situation, of having a farm plan approved before it is well into the future-possibly, as I have suggested, up to four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I make relates to protection. I will not go through the figures on protection because they have been quoted by other speakers. I am pleased to see that the coalition has adopted the Garnaut reform report in relation to protection. Why, when it was welcomed with open arms by the Prime Minister, has the Government failed to act on it? Maybe I should pose the question in the positive and ask: When will it act on that report? It was commissioned by the Government and welcomed by the Prime Minister and yet it seems to be another one of those reports that will be put on the shelf and no action will be taken on it. The challenge that I am throwing down in this debate is that many of these things we have talked about for many years but we have seen no action. We have had inquiries, reports--</PARA>

That involves taking action in terms of our current account.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Trends of thinking within the Government, I believe, have produced a Budget strategy which reflects the views of powerful interests and elite groups within Australia and some overseas. The burdens of the Budget, of the tight economic problems in Australia, are being unjustly born domestically by families and by the increasing number of unemployed, particularly youth unemployed. Those powerful elites are projecting policies which cut across the rights of many people in our community who are not fully equipped to protect their rights and whose rights we in this Parliament should stand up for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my intention, on some other occasion in this chamber, to develop those arguments for the benefit or otherwise of my parliamentary colleagues. But in speaking to the Appropriation Bills today it is my intention to direct my remarks specifically to the appropriations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and within that budget specifically to the appropriations for the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). It is my view that the Budget, as it relates to those areas, is also driven by policies which are certainly not appropriate to a caring and creative society.</PARA>
<PARA> The $96m cut in the overseas development assistance aid budget is the action of a self-centred government more interested in what the polls say than in responding to the cries of poverty stricken people in the Third World. Some of the poorest areas have been most savagely targeted by the 1990-91 Budget of the Commonwealth Government. Emergency humanitarian assistance, food aid, aid to some of the poorest regions of Africa and village level assistance provided by non-government organisations are amongst the hardest hit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has attempted to put a gloss on its inhumane treatment by stating that its level of expenditure in the 1990-91 Budget is estimated to yield an overseas development assistance (ODA) to gross national product (GNP) ratio of 0.33 per cent. That is the initial gloss that was put on the matter in Senator Evans's statement in Budget Related Paper No. 4. Reading on in his statement and the details contained in that paper and Budget Related Paper No. 1, one deduces that Australia's overseas development aid budget has been slashed by $96m. The reason for that is that there had been some longstanding commitments that the Government had to two international financial institutions-the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank-and these payments of $100m were rescheduled into last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see that in order to maintain the level of overseas development assistance we in Australia this year should have increased the budget by a similar monetary amount. There is no argument but that the overseas development assistance budget has been slashed by almost $100m. We must ask ourselves whether we can live with that. We must ask ourselves the reason why the Government has made what I believe is a heartless decision. Is it because of the results of a survey that was conducted by AIDAB in 1989? That survey indicated in essence that most Australians support foreign aid, but few would support more, and 26 per cent would provide less. There is a view that charity begins at home. There is also some concern about where our foreign aid money is going-such as the purchase for a project in Burma of motorcycles that were far too large for the requirements of the Burmese who were to use them. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have questioned why, for example, Australia should have announced a $35m aid package to India last year when the Indian Government could find this money itself by buying one fewer fighter plane. There have also been a number of published critiques of foreign aid, including the recent work by Graham Hancock entitled Lords of Poverty, which makes some very interesting observations about international aid bureaucracies. </PARA>
<PARA> As legislators we must face up to the ranges of opinion and to the reality that in the community at large there is a growing concern on the issues surrounding the provision of foreign aid. The challenge to our aid community and to AIDAB is to ensure that aid is well targeted and not abused by groups that do not have the true interests of people, especially poor people in developing countries, at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good saying that the ODA to GNP ratio is maintained at 0.33 per cent when that is not the case if account is taken of our rescheduled debts to the two financial institutions to which I have referred. The fact is that over the past few years the ODA to GNP ratio has been declining. We must ask ourselves whether that is the action of a caring and creative society such as ours. Certainly we are not in the lap of luxury; certainly there are concerns in Australia about the drop in our standards of living. But that does not entitle us to ignore the enormous poverty that is being suffered by poor people in the less developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> To give one example of the cut in the aid budget to organisations that assist at village level, I quote a press release by the Overseas Service Bureau in relation to Australian Volunteers Abroad of 10 September 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The Overseas Service Bureau announced today that it is cancelling its 1991 mid year departure group of Australian Volunteers Abroad. This means that approximately 50 Australian volunteers will not be able to participate in development assistance work in poor countries of the world. The cutback is directly due to cuts in Australia's overseas aid budget announced in August. As well as the cancellation of the mid year group, the size of the January group will be curtailed. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that an action of a caring, creative society or of a government that cares when there are volunteers ready to go?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me give another instance which has long term implications. I refer to a cut of 11 per cent to international agricultural research funding. The Australian Government through AIDAB contributes to international agricultural research through two major channels-the International Agricultural Research Centres and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. Funding is provided primarily to those agricultural research centres belonging to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. A recent Government document describes the work of those organisations as having made `a large contribution to increases in agricultural production in developing countries'. That statement is contained in Budget Related Paper No. 4 for the 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Important themes pursued by the IAR centres include agricultural sustainability and forest research. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement appears at page 37 of Budget Paper No. 4. A 1988 AIDAB publication notes that these centres `focus on increasing food production in developing countries so that the nutritional level and general economic well-being of low income people are improved'. The publication concludes that they have made considerable contributions to agricultural output in the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research was established in 1982 to promote research into the agricultural problems of developing countries and activities in which Australia has special competence. The research activities in which the ACIAR is involved include animal and crop sciences, fisheries, forestries, soil and water management and socio-economics. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Federal Government done to these groups in the 1990-91 Federal Budget? Following several years in which it appeared AIDAB was committed to increasing support for international agricultural research, the 1990-91 Budget has slashed funding. I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard tables on funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The tables read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>International Agricultural Research Centres:</PARA>
<PARA>1989/90-$6.6m 1990/91-$5.6m</PARA>
<PARA>A grant in 1990/91 of $7.0m would have been required to maintain the real value of the 1989/90 contribution. The 1990/91 grant, therefore, represents a decision by the Government to cut IARC funding by 20% in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research:</PARA>
<PARA>1989/90-$17.4m 1990/91-$17.0m</PARA>
<PARA>A grant in 1990/91 of $18.5m would have been required to maintain the real value of the 1989/90 contribution. The 1990/91 grant, therefore, represents a decision by the Government to cut ACIAR funding by 8.1% in real terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I now refer to my questions to AIDAB at a Senate Estimates committee hearing held in Canberra on 18 September. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Can I go to the international agricultural research organisations which are also mentioned on page 36, which appear to have had a drop from $6.6m to $5.6m. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dolan replied:</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. The heading `International Agricultural Research' covers quite a basket of organisations. They include, as an example, the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. There are over a dozen of these organisations, about half of which belong to the international grouping called CGIAR which is organised by the World Bank. As a result of budgetary stringencies this year a decision was made to reduce contributions to that basket of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Would not AIDAB consider that agricultural research is of crucial importance to alleviating malnutrition and poverty?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer by Mr Dolan was:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly. I think the same could be said of quite a few other activities within the aid budget. Within the constraints of overall budgetary policy it is necessary to pull in the belt somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a budgetary matter on the part of AIDAB. There is no question, is there, about the efficacy of the international agricultural research organisations?</PARA>
<PARA>The officer from AIDAB, Mr Dolan, answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No. There is no question about the efficacy of them. They are believed to be effective organisations that promote very useful research in developing countries. Perhaps the most prominent example of the success of these institutions is that institution that I referred to IRRI, the International Rice Research Institute, which gave us the green revolution in South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget cuts funds to those organisations. That is a disgraceful situation. Whilst, on the one hand, the Budget is cutting the amounts to those organisations, on the other hand it is substantially increasing the payment of taxpayers' money to international population control organisations which support population control programs which involve gross violations of human rights. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) has received an increase of 100 per cent this year from the Government. On the one hand, the Government cuts payments to those agricultural research organisations that are doing the fine work and alleviating poverty-it is admitted that their work is important in alleviating poverty-and, on the other, it increases its funding to population control bodies such as the IPPF and UNFPA-the United Nations Population Fund, which is up by 100 per cent in the first instance and 44 per cent in the second instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Government refuses to fund those organisations because of their support for programs involving coercion. On 7 June 1989, one of those organisations-namely, the United Nations Population Fund-three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre, with Australian support, contributed $US57m to assist the world's most inhumane population control program in China. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee of the Whole I will be pursuing questions that were raised initially by Senator Olsen about the supply by Australia, through the development import finance facilities, of ultrasound machines to the organisation in control of population control programs in China-namely, the State Family Planning Commission, which is involved in population control measures that are coercive in nature and involve a gross violation of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> We must hang our heads in shame if we in this country have, on the one hand, savagely cut worthwhile aid programs, including reafforestation programs, and, on the other, increased funding to those organisations which adopt the attitude that the fertility of poor women in poor countries is to blame for everything from war to famine to damage to the environment. That sort of philosophy that is being adopted by international bureaucracies has to be challenged. It has to be challenged because the thinking behind it now has been accepted by this Government, and particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, as its benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable senators to look at the extraordinary statements that Senator Evans made at an Estimates committee hearing about population control measures having a high priority in his thinking. When I mentioned the work of one well-known author in the field of development assistance, Senator Evans did not even know who that person was. Yet that person had previously advanced a theory in the World Bank that population measures were vastly important but was able to say in this article that there was no consensus that population growth was a significant negative factor in the development of developing countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill, which is designed to meet Commonwealth Government obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances so that Australia can ratify the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the convention is defined in Article 2.1 as being the promotion of cooperation among the parties so that they may address more effectively the various aspects of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances having an international dimension. Under the terms of the convention, member states are required to take certain steps to suppress drug trafficking. They are required, pursuant to Article 3, to make manufacturing, growing and dealing in drugs and money laundering of drug proceeds, criminal offences under domestic law. There is a requirement in Article 4 to give domestic courts jurisdiction over drug crimes. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 5 requires that member states must further provide for the tracing, freezing and confiscation of drug proceeds and for the extradition of drug criminals under Article 6. There is a requirement in Article 7 for member states to provide each other with mutual legal assistance in the investigation of prosecutions, and in Article 9 for them to cooperate with each other in the provision of channels of communication and in the training of law enforcement officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to Article 12, substances used for the manufacture of drugs are to be subject to strict control, and there is an obligation in Article 13 to eradicate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants. Article 15 stipulates that commercial carriers are not used for the commission of offences. Pursuant to Article 17, member states have an obligation to cooperate with each other in the prevention of illicit traffic by sea, in conformity with international law. </PARA>
<PARA> Articles 18 and 19 respectively set out requirements to suppress illicit traffic in free trade zones and free ports and to outlaw the use of the mails for illicit traffic. Finally, pursuant to Article 20 member states are obliged to furnish information to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the Economic and Social and Council of the United Nations regarding the workings of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these obligations are already covered by various Federal and State laws. Relevant Federal laws include the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> We note the statement in clause 5(1) that the Bill is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth or any law of a State or Territory. The Opposition welcomes the Government's recognition in this instance that all levels of government should work together to fight the drug problem in Australia. We believe that an important opportunity such as this should not be used by the Commonwealth to encroach upon areas of State jurisdiction. I understand that consultations have been taking place between the Commonwealth and the States and that ratification of the convention cannot take place until those consultations are concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill basically extends Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes relating to drugs. Clauses 10 and 11 establish an offence of dealing in drugs on board Australian aircraft and ships. Two new offences for dealing in drugs outside Australia are created by clause 12: firstly, where the crime is committed by an Australian national outside Australia and, secondly, where a foreigner commits the crime outside Australia, but is subsequently located in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to clause 13 of the Bill, it is also an offence to deal in drugs outside Australia with a view to committing a drug crime in Australia. Clause 14 creates a Commonwealth offence where a person outside Australia conspires, attempts, aids, abets, counsels, procures or is in any way involved in dealing in drugs which constitutes an offence against a State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA> This convention is focused upon the suppression of illicit trafficking. This is just one of the approaches recognised in the declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna of June 1987 as forming part of an effective strategy to combat the worldwide drug problem. We strongly support the strategy outlined in that declaration, which encompasses the prevention and reduction of demand, the control of supply, treatment and rehabilitation, as well as the suppression of illicit trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, although this convention is essentially based on the more traditional law and order approach, it in no way prevents the examination of these other options for dealing with the drug problem. This is in line with the coalition's policy which recognises that a range of approaches must be used in the fight against drugs. The Opposition is therefore supporting this Bill as we believe that it will be a useful measure in attacking the traffic in illicit drugs. </PARA>

Seeing Senator Hill interjects about this issue, let me say that when we came into government the steel industry was going out of business. It has now been re-established as Australia's largest exporter of manufactured products, and has seen enormous cultural change in both management and work force and I believe is operating successfully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly agree with the Treasurer that if Australia goes back to the interventionist policies of the past we will be in deep trouble. They were the policies we inherited. We inherited policies of made-to-measure tariffs for particular firms, depending on which electorate they were in. We inherited those policies. And they are the sorts of policies we will certainly not go back to.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins referred to taking a step away from the level playing field, and I agree with that too. There are two level playing fields-the playing field of a domestic economy and arriving at neutrality between industries in the domestic economy and also the playing field of an international economy, where the playing field is a vastly different thing indeed. If one asks whether the countries to the north of Australia, from South Korea to Singapore, operate on a level playing field in terms of export markets, one reaches the conclusion that they do not. They have enormous tax holidays provided to industries to establish there. They have a whole range of export incentives and so on. That is a different playing field from the level playing field of the domestic economy, on which a number of Australian economists are still fixated. They got locked into those views in the 1960s and the 1970s. I do not see any inconsistencies. It is an obvious question that can be put here today. I congratulate Senator Kemp on seizing the obvious, but I do not think there are inconsistencies, particularly if the Treasurer's answer is read in full.</PARA>

In light of this submission and submissions made to the Prime Minister by the National Farmers Federation and the Government's rural task force, can the Minister advise what decision, if any, has been made regarding the review on the assets test to be introduced on 1 January 1991 regarding family allowances and the family allowance supplement (FAS)?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hear, hear! I have to retain some credibility. I was a bit worried about Senator Tate. Even since the Cabinet was considering Budget measures a few months ago, even in the past three to four months, it is certainly true to say that the rural crisis has continued to worsen. In view of that, the Government has decided to look at how we might ease some of those Budget decisions. The first place to look would be the family allowance supplement, which of course affects those with the lowest incomes. Honourable senators may recall that in the Budget we introduced a $200,000 limit assets test. That decision has now been reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original FAS limit, which was $322,000, as indexed will now be a new figure of about $347,000. In so far as family allowances are concerned, in the Budget we had announced a $300,000 assets test for family allowance. That will now be a $500,000 assets test. It must be remembered that these assets figures are net figures-they are net of debt. I think that is something that many people have missed in the argument over the last few months, and it cannot be stressed often enough.</PARA>
<PARA> Having announced that, it would be difficult for the Government to proceed with an Austudy test which was radically different from the family allowance supplement, in particular. That being the case, Austudy and assistance for isolated children will also be indexed to increase to $347,500. That will be the new Austudy test figure, with, of course, the 50 per cent discount which applied before. Although Austudy is, of course, not within my portfolio, I throw that in because these three announcements are being made together.</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowance will go from $300,000 to $500,000, family allowance supplement from $200,000 to $347,500, and Austudy will be at $347,500, with a 50 per cent discount. This will mean that thousands of families who were to suffer some loss will no longer have to suffer that loss and it will certainly mean that extra payments will be made to children, particularly those of farmers who are being hardest hit. I hope that that will be of some comfort and some assistance to them during what will undoubtedly be a difficult year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the Minister seen the comments made by Mr Stewart West in today's Australian Financial Review that the Minister and the Prime Minister should take the views of the parliamentary Left regarding war in the Gulf more seriously and that, if they do not, `they have a nasty shock coming' and that the parliamentary Left could `wreck the stability of the Government'? How does the Minister reconcile this statement from a former senior ministerial colleague with his answer in the Senate yesterday that he, Senator Evans, need not take much notice of the views of the parliamentary Left? Will the Minister now agree that the views of the Left could undermine the capacity of the Government to make an effective contribution to the Gulf operation? What steps will the Government take to reassure our allies that this split within the Government will not compromise our Gulf policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Assuming that those comments to which Senator Durack refers were accurately reported, let me say this: I can understand the emotion and, indeed, the memories of situations in the past which led my colleague to make the remarks that he did. None of us want to see a war in the Gulf, and the decision that Australia will be faced with about the extent of our involvement, if it does come to that, will be a very difficult and sensitive decision indeed. All I can further say is that, if and when the time comes to make such a decision, we will do so on the basis of our perception as to what is in the interests of this country and not on the basis of threats of any kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear the radio broadcast, which was on radio station 5AA in Adelaide yesterday, although a number of complaints have been received from listeners who thought that law breaking was being advocated. I have obtained a transcript of the broadcast, which I must say is marked `E &amp;OE-proof only', and I acknowledge that now. I say at the beginning that award provisions carry the force of law and that anyone who breaks them breaks the law and then not only has to amend his behaviour but also would frequently face a fine in the Industrial Court. So it is a serious matter to advocate the breaching of those standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the interview Mr Howard was asked whether he expected that small companies over the Christmas period would approach either the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia or the metal trades unions to remove the annual leave loading. Mr Howard agreed to that proposition. He then went on-I quote from the transcript I have-and said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would also expect that some of the small outfits would do it, but not tell anybody, and hope that both the unions and the Arbitration Inspectorate would have the common sense to turn a blind eye to it. I'm not encouraging anyone to go that path. But bearing in mind that they're getting an award varied under the centralised system is an horrendously complicated task, in reality that will probably happen in some cases and if it does happen then people should be sensible about the technical award breach that would be involved.</PARA>
<PARA>There are several things that can be said about this. The first is that Mr Howard does expect award breaches to occur and says that, if they do, by an act of omission by the responsible authorities, nothing should be done about it. Secondly, he has been careful to distance himself from anyone breaking the law, and that should be acknowledged. Thirdly, on a fallacious premise that it is horrendously difficult in this centralised system to achieve change, he has then said that if law breaking does occur nothing should be done about it in those circumstances, which I think is a bit like someone saying, `Fair cop' if they get caught smuggling a watch into Australia after returning from a holiday in Bali but saying that nothing should be done about it. I think that is a cavalier approach in all of the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the law is breached, if it is breached-and Senator Hill is a lawyer, so he would know this-it is both technical and factual. If it is breached, it is breached-one cannot just breach it technically and assume that there is no other breach. If a person is in breach technically that person is gone and he or she should be dealt with according to the due processes of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three points I make about this. The first point is that the premise that it is horrendously difficult to vary agreements in the workplace, which Mr Howard has based his views on, is in fact wrong. The assumption by those who argue that the arbitration system is inflexible and that it should be decentralised to the enterprise depends on them believing that proposition. But it is wrong, because section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act enables certified agreements to be reached and then to be registered in the Industrial Relations Commission. It does mean that employers cannot do deals privately and it means that they cannot engage in the sort of negotiation which says, `If you don't agree with this you'll get the sack'. There ought to be some way in which those private negotiations are policed properly so that they occur without exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that, while not advocating law breaking in the true sense-because there was a disclaimer in that statement-it comes awfully close to it in advocating that people who do break the law should not be dealt with. I would have thought that Mr Howard, as a former Treasurer, a former Leader of the Opposition and an aspiring Minister, would have said something better and more sensitive with regard to the rights of law.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not prepared to draw the conclusion that he has in fact advocated law breaking. I want to be generous and say that he has engaged in a bad choice of language in these circumstances; and that he should now acknowledge that he has, correct his position, draw attention to section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act and acknowledge the flexibility that exists there. If he wants to advocate industry level deals, which is fair enough, he should also stipulate that they should be conducted out in the open where they can be seen, that they are fair and that the rights of all parties are protected.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission does have a role to play in seeing that they are within wage fixing guidelines and that there is proper dealing between the parties. I think that Mr Howard should be very careful to remove any doubt from the public mind that a person in a responsible position such as he holds is coming close to or blurring at the margins any inference that law breaking is somehow or other a proper course in any circumstance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to reports of Malaysia's withdrawal yesterday of its invitation to the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Richard Woolcott, to attend official talks in Kuala Lumpur. I ask the Minister: Is the report correct? If so, what are the reasons for the withdrawal of this invitation? Has Malaysia also suspended officials' visits to Australia, or other official contacts? Is this yet another incidence, along with Fiji and India, where Australia's bilateral relations with important regional neighbours are less robust than the Minister would otherwise have us believe?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some negative reaction at senior government level in Malaysia to what has been perceived as some offensive elements in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television series Embassy. It is a reasonable assumption-although it has not been communicated officially in these terms-that the deferment of high level officials' talks involving Mr Richard Woolcott, which was reported this morning, is part of that reaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to that, let me just say that it has been made clear-by the Prime Minister publicly, by me in discussions that I have had with my Malaysian foreign ministerial counterpart and by the ABC-that the series was not intended to portray Malaysia, that it could not be reasonably regarded as portraying any specific country, and that it was certainly not intended to cause any offence to Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no question of the Australian Government seeking to exercise control or direction over, or to otherwise interfere with, the ABC or any other section of the media, however much we might wish on occasion, I suppose-whether we are talking in a domestic or a foreign policy context-that there was a bit more evident understanding of various sensitivities that are involved.</PARA>
<PARA> I simply say as to the future that I am hopeful that any lingering misunderstanding on this issue will shortly be resolved. The relationship between our two countries economically, politically and multilaterally through such processes as the Asia Pacific economic cooperation arrangements, the Five Power Defence Agreement and so on, is much too important to us both and has been much too stable in the past to be diverted by something of this kind.

I ask the Minister whether I am correct in interpreting his answer to mean that in his assessment there is no reason, other than the program Embassy, for which Malaysia is taking this rather extreme action. Secondly, as he has raised the question of the program Embassy, I ask him whether it is the case that an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been providing specialist advice in the production of that program.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my belief that there is no other stimulus for the present situation than that particular program. It may well be that that program is regarded as the culmination of a series of references to Malaysia, either direct or indirect, in the media in the past which are thought to have given rise to similar concerns and may in that sense be part of a longer chain of things, but it certainly has absolutely nothing to do with any other aspect of Government policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the remaining part of the supplementary question, it is the case that a former Australian head of mission in a number of posts-Beijing and Rangoon as well as Kuala Lumpur-Mr Garry Woodard was among the consultants for the series, but his activities in that context were and are now those of a private citizen. It is the case that there was some marginal consultation, I understand, with the public affairs division of my own Department in ensuring that the series presented embassy life realistically. The division was consulted about some aspects of that, but not in any way as to the advice that went to the present matters in issue, as I understand them.</PARA>

The situation is that the public affairs branch of my Department is available helpfully to all sorts of organisations when assistance is sought. I repeat that the media is perfectly free to make its own decisions about these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope, from the tone and tenor of Senator Hill's question and, more particularly, Senator Walters's interjection, that there is no hint of a suggestion that we should be responding in some way to this situation which involves acknowledging the legitimacy of reactions of the kind we have had from the Malaysian Government when the media does something that a country does not like. I would be very surprised if that was the position of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very important indeed that we maintain our principles intact in these situations. The truth of the matter is that the Government has no responsibility, and can have no responsibility, for the media in this situation. We can hope that they exercise a little sensitivity and are educated to understand the implications of what they do, but beyond that there is simply no action that we can take.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney gave me notice of this question in anticipation that I would not have known the rate of duty on paints. I can inform the Senate that the paints referred to are dutiable at the rate of 10 per cent when imported from general source countries and 5 per cent when imported from developing countries. These rates were set after the wide ranging review of the chemicals and plastics industries in 1986. I think the Senate would agree that tariff rates at these moderate levels are unlikely to be limiting the range of paints that could be imported into Australia. It is also unlikely that the import duties of themselves would be inflating prices to unreasonable levels. I am also informed that tariff concessions apply to some of those artists' paints which would mean that those paints could be imported into Australia duty free. This would supplement the range of paints available to Australian artists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I add, on another note, as to whether or not the painting industry in Australia might be regarded as competitive, that last year Australian painters exported some $63m worth of paintings, which seems to suggest that there is not a hugely uncompetitive burden imposed on their raw materials by tariffs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer for Senator McLean, who was courteous enough to give the Minister for Veterans' Affairs prior notice of his question yesterday. However, the honourable senator having been courteous in that regard, I regret to say that last night he released an uncharitable and incorrect press release, making judgments on the issues he is raising today. That seems to be something of a contradiction when he is seeking information, one would have thought in a genuine way, from me in this chamber. I think it reflects rather poorly on the honourable senator, and his press release of yesterday will cause unnecessary anxiety among veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, let me start this answer with the assurance that the Commonwealth will always retain responsibility for veterans, war widows and their dependants. This Government has maintained a separate Ministry for Veterans' Affairs, a Department of Veterans' Affairs and a Repatriation Commission, and there will be no backing away from the compensation principles underlying the Government's and this Parliament's commitments to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced in 1988 the intention to integrate the repatriation hospitals into State health systems. It gave certain undertakings to veterans and staff. The Government stands by its promises to the veteran community and staff that their concerns will be addressed before integration of the repatriation hospitals takes place. The guarantees do not mean, however, that the Government will allow the negotiations to be frustrated by inflammatory remarks which distort the debate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean quotes the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Collins, as saying that New South Wales will not give any guarantee of priority for veterans. I remind the Senate that Mr Collins's comments came before the commencement of financial negotiations. The comments should not, therefore, come as any great surprise to informed political observers. More to the point, Mr Collins was also reported as saying that services for veterans in New South Wales public hospitals would be maintained. Senator McLean conveniently ignores this.</PARA>
<PARA> To put the integration debate into some context, might I inform the Senate that in New South Wales only about 33 per cent of all veterans admitted to hospital actually go to Repatriation General Hospital Concord-the rest are already treated in local public or private hospitals. Of those veterans and war widows living in the Sydney metropolitan area, surveys show that nearly 70 per cent say their preference is for public or private hospitals. The honourable senator makes no mention of the Commonwealth's proposal for a veterans' private patient scheme, which is being developed and refined through discussion and negotiation with affected parties.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not asking the public hospital system in New South Wales to admit veterans ahead of other patients with a greater medical need. Indeed, the phrase `priority of access' has never embraced the proposition that a veteran would get priority over anyone with a more critical medical need. It does not happen now, and it never will. Apart from anything else, that would constitute a breach of medical ethics. But the Commonwealth's private patient scheme would ensure that veterans and war widows in need of hospital treatment get the hospital access they need through a wider and better use of private hospitals, the public hospital system and the integrated repatriation hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> For those honourable senators who may not have the background, the private patient scheme being offered would ensure that veterans have direct access as private patients in public hospitals. This gives a wider choice of doctor than the current arrangements. Those in medical need can enter private hospitals designated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs as preferred private hospitals if no public hospital bed is available within a reasonable time at no cost to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> Where no public or preferred hospital can meet the medical needs, the Department will approve treatment at a non-Department of Veterans' Affairs preferred private hospital and pay all the costs. Treatment at an integrated repatriation general hospital will also continue to be available and be free of charge to the veteran.</PARA>
<PARA> I realise this answer is rather long, but I am afraid the question was rather long. I feel I should allay the fears and misgivings that have been aroused by Senator McLean in his press release of last night.</PARA>
<PARA> With integrated repatriation hospitals continuing to serve the ex-service community, the private patient scheme will mean that veterans will enjoy access to a range of hospitals and treatment which is unrivalled in this country and surely amongst the best in the world. Indeed, there have been expressions of support nationally from significant ex-service organisations, including the war widows, Legacy, totally and permanently incapacitated, and Korea and Vietnam veterans organisations. Naturally, these organisations expect the Government to satisfy them on the question of access and quality of care, and this care has been given.</PARA>
<PARA> An increasing number of veterans will prefer not to travel to a repatriation general hospital for their necessary medical treatment. As they age, most veterans will continue to want ready access to local hospital treatment, secure in the knowledge that the repatriation hospitals will be there if they need them. Hospital integration addresses all of these changing needs.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by observing that the option of increasing the numbers of community patients in the repatriation hospitals which has been advanced by some opponents of the scheme is not a viable one. The fears and misgivings aroused by Senator McLean can be well allayed by the answer I have just given.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the media reports today and the fact that the company is restructuring its Fibremakers Australia Pty Ltd operation. The company saw me last week regarding this matter; it also saw the Opposition spokesman and the unions. I would like to say at the outset that no-one certainly on this side of the Senate likes to see jobs disappear. In this case, I think the shedding of the 350 jobs announced today will ensure the continuation of the remaining 700-odd positions at Fibremakers. When Du Pont purchased Fibremakers, it was quite open about the fact that restructuring would need to take place in order to make that establishment into a world class fibre producer, especially in a non-tariff, non-bounty assisted environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say that at the time that Du Pont took over the Fibremakers factory, the turnover rate had been about 40 per cent. The company had hoped at that time that any loss of jobs would be able to be accounted for by natural attrition. It also gave the commitment that there would be no redundancies before the end of this year. Since taking over the company, the labour turnover rate has fallen to 10 per cent, so restructuring without redundancies has become impossible. However, the company is keen to ensure that the employees are given plenty of time to plan and consider their options, and extensive counselling and outplacement services will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> The recently released state of the industry report by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority made the point that the Australian textile in- dustries must restructure and invest to survive with lower assistance. The restructuring at Du Pont has already started, with the introduction of improved technology in production methods, and technology transfer is being achieved through an exchange program whereby United States technical employees are working short term in Australia and Australians are being trained in Du Pont plants overseas. In 1991 Du Pont will invest another $12m in equipment and processes in line with its commitment at the time of accepting the bounty capitalisation grant. That is entirely consistent with the objectives of the TCF plan. The phasing out of old processes and the new investment I believe will secure long term competitiveness for Fibremakers, which is what Du Pont has been all about. As I said before, while no-one likes to see job losses in industry, in the case of TCF industries it is a matter of restructure or be faced with the possibility of no jobs at all in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the company Du Pont has been totally frank with the Government about these issues right from the beginning. The company from which Du Pont bought this plant clearly had too many employees engaged there. It was a recipient of government assistance on a continuing basis. Older parts of the plant were not being restructured or brought up to date, and the decisions made by Du Pont are necessary in terms of improving the company's performance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should in the first instance say there is nothing alleged about what I have said about excessive senior executive remuneration. Everything I have said about that has been thoroughly documented and those documents have been tabled in this chamber. Those documents show a pattern in the private sector of massive increases for executives well above those going to ordinary wage and salary earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the part of the question dealing with government business enterprises, I reply that the Senate will be aware that, under guidelines for government business enterprises, the Government cut free of control from the government the regulation of internal affairs of those enterprises to a very large extent. Subject to their complying with the wage fixing guidelines and things of that nature, they are basically free to negotiate their own management conditions. It is a poor reflection, I think, that in order to attract executive talent to head up some of those government enterprises, they have had to trade in the private sector where high senior executive salaries have been the norm. As a consequence, the disease that afflicts the private sector has to some extent been introduced into the government business sector because the Government has wanted to put those business enterprises on a fully commercial footing. That is not the fault of the Government; it is the fault of high level executive salaries obtaining in the private sector. In order to put some restraint on those government business enterprises, the Government has required, in the case of the main ones, them to submit any executive packages to the Remuneration Tribunal to ensure that they are not excessive in the sense of what obtains in the elite market of senior executives. That is being done.</PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the conclusion that if the market were not distorted in the first place, this problem would not exist, and when we are dealing with calls for restraint on the work force-restraint that has been observed massively by ordinary wage and salary earners in this country-such as the one initiated more recently by the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations in the other place, Mr Howard, who called for further restraint, we should look at senior executive salaries, I resile not one whit from that position. If that includes government business enterprises, which I believe it should, so be it, and let government business enterprise executives suffer-if that be the right word-the same restraint that we expect their work forces to suffer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is it a fact that the Affirmative Action Agency in its report to Parliament named a number of companies which, despite the best efforts of the agency, have not complied with their obligations under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act? Is it not also a fact that one such company, Suttons Investments of Sydney, has now been named in such a way three times; that is, on each of the three successive occasions on which the Agency has reported? Has the Minister any information which he can give honourable senators which explains or excuses the behaviour of this company? Can the Minister advise honourable senators what action is possible or would be appropriate against the company for its refusal to comply with the law?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say that in the report tabled in the Senate yesterday 100 per cent of tertiary institutions in Australia complied with Affirmative Action Agency guidelines and 93.6 per cent of companies in the private sector complied as well. What we have here is a very high level of compliance, which means that the affirmative action legal structure gives legal force to the moral imperative for employers to more rapidly recognise the diversity of their work force and to apply affirmative action policies, in particular for women, migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, disabled persons and Aborigines. Only 75 companies have refused to comply after exhaustive follow-up to encourage compliance and, I would say, a quite indulgent approach to delay and late returns. As a consequence of the naming of those 75 companies yesterday, three have rung the Affirmative Action Agency and promised to rectify the situation and put their returns in. I think that speaks very well of the fact that we are now seeing emerge in Australia a more tolerant workplace where human resource management recognises the diversity of labour, the need to run positive programs to promote that diversity and the fact that, where that is done, there are efficiency and productivity gains as well. That is a very welcome change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles has referred to the company, Suttons Investments, which has not once, not twice, but three times refused to comply with the rules of the game. It is the only company in Australia that has done so. In the face of getting the two finger salute from Suttons three times in a row, we have to conclude that it is dinkum about being a militant non-complier. It seems to think that its act of non-compliance is some form of political statement. The only sanction we have in the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act is the sanction that the company shall be named and exposed, and so it should be.</PARA>
<PARA> Suttons is a major trading company in New South Wales. It could be compared with other companies in the service industry which are praised as models of affirmative action. Let me acknowledge with praise and pleasure, Westpac, Lend Lease, Esso, Hewlett Packard and the National Roads and Motorists Association, all of which have won best practice awards from the Affirmative Action Agency as model examples of what can be done. Suttons, however, stands out against that trend. Suttons has some small Commonwealth contracts in New South Wales, and it has been put to the Government that in this case we should sanction the non-compliance of Suttons by terminating those contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I repeat: the only sanction we can take under the Act is to name the company. However, in the face of its militant, non-compliance the Affirmative Action Agency will now consult with major industry bodies and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to see, in the face of such a consistent determination not to join the civilised community in Australia but to stand out against the tide, what should be done. When those consultations have been completed, a decision in this case will be taken.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to the disastrous locust situation in Western Australia where practically the whole agricultural area is in danger of being eaten clean, spelling disaster not only to farmers but also to the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not advised by my colleague and the Minister whom I represent in this place, John Kerin, as to whether or not there has been an approach from the Western Australian Government for assistance to those farmers suffering the devastating effects of the locust plague in Western Australia. Since that question has now been explicitly asked, I will refer it to the Minister and obtain an answer on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether we are monitoring the situation: yes, of course we are. I think one of the reasons why John Kerin is widely regarded as the best Minister responsible for primary industry that this country has had is that the groups in the primary sector recognise him as being an able representative in Parliament of their industry and acknowledge his expertise in keeping a check on situations such as this. I am absolutely certain that we are monitoring the effects, and I will get a reply directly on that point later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to an article in the Melbourne Age newspaper last Monday which states that the interest payable on Australia's foreign debt now represents 20 per cent of Australia's export income and equals $700 per year for each woman, man and child in Australia. Does the Minister agree with the recent comments of the Minister for Finance, who predicted that the Budget estimate of 7.5 per cent unemployment by June next year will be exceeded? Does he agree that the high interest strategy has failed, despite the high cost of job losses, small business and farm failures and increased poverty? Will the Minister indicate whether the Government is now prepared to pursue more equitable policy measures to reduce Australia's foreign debt, including: higher withholding taxes on interest paid to foreign lenders; controls on large scale overseas borrowing by private corporations; accelerated depreciation allowances for export oriented projects, as recommended by the Australian Manufacturing Council; and protection for Australian primary producers equal to the subsidies foreign farmers receive from their governments?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that this question was asked towards the end of Question Time because the question was long and the answer could be longer. Let me say by way of summary that I recall the article to which the honourable senator referred. I have not checked the figures contained in that article, but it was an article by a reputable journalist and I have no reason to disbelieve the figures which are incorporated in that Age piece of 5 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first question that Senator Spindler asked me was whether I thought the Budget predictions in respect of unemployment, the estimate of 7.5 per cent by June next year, will be exceeded. The current figure, as I understand it, is 7.6 per cent on an annualised basis. It would be wrong to say at this time that the projection in the Budget is discredited, although I concede that there are difficult times in respect of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a substantial fall in full time jobs which has been partly offset by growth in part time jobs. There has been no change in the participation rate when one might have expected a change in the participation rate, given the current labour market pressure. As to whether the high interest rate strategy has failed: yesterday the inflation figure, the consumer price index (CPI) figure, was published, and I think it is safe to say that the pressure which is exerted on inflation by a high interest rate regime has probably had an effect of dampening the inflation figure for the September quarter.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne knows, there are always extraneous factors in the CPI in Australia. The figure in the previous quarter was enhanced by the effects of floods on fruit and vegetable prices. This did not happen in the September quarter. I think that can be seen to be a beneficial result of tight monetary policy and higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Powell had her head together, she would recognise that both consequences flow from tightened demand, which results from high interest rates. She really has to work out what is the cause and what is the effect before she starts interjecting on the basis of the interjection she has just made. Let me say, however, that the cost of high interest rates for a substantial period of time has imposed very big difficulties on businesses. It has, as the Budget forecast, reflected itself in higher unemployment. It has had something to do with farm failures, but I think that one of the great underlying problems in relation to farm failures is market access for products such as wool, wheat and grains and that it is wrong to say that interest rates have been the most significant cause of farm failures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Spindler then goes on to ask me whether the Government is now prepared to pursue more equitable fiscal policy to reduce Australia's foreign debt. I do not know what he means by `more equitable fiscal policy measures' when he specifies them as being higher withholding tax on interest paid to foreign lenders and controls on large scale overseas borrowings by private corporations. These two things I will direct to the Treasurer and ask for a more detailed reply. At least one of those things, the control on overseas borrowings, is something which the Australian corporate sector may have learnt something about from the patterns of the 1980s. Whether controls ought to be necessary or not is a totally different matter.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the question of accelerated depreciation allowances for export oriented projects as recommended by the Australian Manufacturing Council, I do not think the Government will accept that recommendation in the form in which it is made. However, that does not mean that the issue does not require examination.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Crichton-Browne's Government always used to explain the resources boom of 1981-82 as being greatly supported by the investment allowance in place at the time. Whether that is empiric evidence or whether that is just political rubbish, I do not know. But certainly that Government used to claim that at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final question I am asked is whether Australia will match subsidies paid to overseas farmers. If we had all been in Venezuela or in the Parliament in Paraguay instead of in Canberra, we would have known, even in the dark, that that question had come from the Australian Democrats. Nobody else would ask a question like that. The answer to that question is no, we are not in a competitive world race to out-subsidise each other.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know where Senator Spindler has been hiding in those Democrats offices all these years but, if he knew anything about the history of this country, the policy stances of various governments and so on, he would know that that was a silly question, because Australia cannot compete in the business of out-subsidising Europe and the United States. If he just has a quick perusal of the earlier part of his question, he will know precisely why we would not want to be in that business. So while I congratulate him on the comprehensive nature of his question, I cannot congratulate him on its total rationality. The rational parts will be examined and a further answer given in due course.</PARA>

In light of the Minister's humiliating admission that the Government made a monumental mistake in the Budget by not recognising the extent of the rural crisis, which he now describes as a disaster, and by setting what the Government now regards as clearly unrealistic assets test limits on the family allowance and the family allowance supplement, can the Minister please explain on what facts or consultations the original Budget decision was based? Will he also concede that the cavalier decision to send out forms to all family allowance recipients, based on the now altered figure, before the legislation had gone through the Parliament has resulted in another $400,000 going down the drain? What will be the cost of sending out new family allowance and family allowance supplement forms to additional recipients?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I do not recall any humiliating backdown- far from it. The Government has properly analysed a change in circumstances. Estimates coming from the rural community when we were discussing these things in May and June are at wide variance with estimates that come now. The rural crisis was descending faster than anyone predicted last May and June. That is just a fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do governments do? Do they simply ignore the facts? The reality is that if the Government examines the facts and reacts to them, the Opposition says that we are humiliatingly backing down; if on the other hand we ignore them, the Opposition says that we are too hard. The Government has done exactly what governments are supposed to do. We have analysed the facts as they have been brought to us. We have shown something that is simply unknown and foreign to Senator Alston: it is called compassion. Once again we have done that.</PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that Senator Alston has now referred me to the `cavalier decision' to send out other forms. Senator Alston has been very active of late in coming out with estimates about what the Department of Social Security has been spending. We have been told how terrible it is that we have pot-plants in our offices-a shocking thing it is; we should have no pot-plants, according to Senator Alston. We have also been told that we use telephones in the Department of Social Security. We actually ring up clients! Senator Alston says, `This is terrible; no more phone calls'. One wonders what Senator Alston would have us do. Now we cannot send out forms either. That comes back to the privatisation idea. Do honourable senators remember the privatisation idea? It lasted two weeks. Now all that Dr Hewson's office will say is, `We have no comment; we have referred it to our policy making body'.

It is the only way the Department will be able to get information to clients in time to give them plenty of warning. A change will now have to be made to a number of those forms. It is a change that the recipients of the notifying letters will welcome.

The first question was: Was the then Attorney-General briefed on the content of the file? I answer: The AFP briefed me as the Minister for Justice on six occasions during 1988 concerning the AFP attention to the matter and their investigation into the commission of possible Commonwealth offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I was asked: Did not the material indicate that in his work Mr Smith was investigating Liberal politician Mr Ross Lightfoot and was paid for this work at the expense of the then Labor Government headed by Brian Burke? Thirdly, I was asked: Does not the material suggest that instructions were given by Mr Burke and his services officer and driver, Vince Sherington? I am advised that there are ongoing inquiries being conducted by the Western Australian police concerning this matter, and it would therefore not be appropriate for me to provide a detailed response concerning matters that may subsequently be determined by a court.</PARA>

The hours of duty are 0630 hours to 2200 hours daily. There is currently a minimum number of regular public transport flights arriving in the Darwin Airport outside those hours.

In such an event, the airport safety officer is but one of a number of FAC personnel who are required to respond.

<PARA>PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE</PARA>
<PARA>LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SENATE</PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM</PARA>
<PARA>8 NOVEMBER 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to announce today a series of decisions affecting telecommunications and aviation-decisions which will help turn these industries into world-class performers. </PARA>
<PARA> These decisions are yet another instalment of the Government's drive for micro-economic reform-a process that is creating a more dynamic and efficient Australian economy, an economy that can take on and compete with the world's best. </PARA>
<PARA> These decisions are also just one part-albeit a critical part-of this Government's agenda of reform. They fit closely with the progress made at the Special Premiers' Conference on improving the efficiency of the processes of Government throughout Australia, such as in the important area of rail freight. They fit closely, too, with our real and steady progress in making our waterfront more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this activity has one central goal-a vital goal for every Australian: to equip our economy to deliver to its citizens the quality of life to which they justifiably aspire. For too long Australia was content to live with inefficiencies and low productivity in too many of our domestic industries. It is this Government's task vigorously and rapidly to sweep away those old arrangements and reshape our economy as a genuinely modern and competitive one. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the simple and unarguable logic that has driven this Government's commitment to, and achievements in, micro-economic reform. The sometimes arcane jargon of the micro-economic reform debate must not be allowed to obscure the urgency and importance of that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as I have indicated this is not the first time this Government has been able to report to Parliament on micro-economic reform-and it will most certainly not be the last. </PARA>
<PARA> However the decisions I will detail today represent perhaps our most significant achievement to date in this field. We have in the seven months since the election identified the issues in telecommunications and domestic aviation reform, consulted widely with those most directly affected by the changes, and formulated imaginative and bold policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention in passing, Mr President, that we also managed to fit into this tight timeframe an historic Special National Conference of the Australian Labor Party which altered our Party's platform to accommodate these changes. By any standard the speed of the Government's action in this area and our persistence in pursuing change is proof of our commitment to reform of telecommunications and domestic aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, Mr President, these reforms are marked by one special characteristic-they are real-world solutions to real-world problems. In this respect they are the antithesis of the half-baked ideas floated almost daily by the Opposition Leader and his front bench colleagues. Our reforms Can be implemented and they Will be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my important duty today to outline these reforms to the Senate in the context of a broader progress report on the micro-economic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, for most Australian households, the telephone provides an essential lifeline to society; it is perhaps the most important instrument of modern life. For Australian business, it is literally an indispensable tool. It is no surprise that providing telephones and related equipment to Australians is a multi-billion dollar industry-in fact, it is one of our largest industries providing 143,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecommunications pose a number of unique challenges. The pace of technological change regularly sees the major advances of a few years earlier superseded by new discoveries. This can easily render regulatory structures out of date; it can also mean new export markets and employment opportunities can swiftly emerge for an efficient industry equipped to take them up. </PARA>
<PARA> So for Australia, we need to improve the efficiency with which we deliver telecommunications services within our country. It is equally clear that we must ready ourselves to take advantage of new export and job opportunities that will be created around the world, particularly with rapidly rising living standards in the Asia-Pacific region. The nations of the Asia-Pacific region have half the world's population but only 17 per cent of its 500 million telephones. Meeting the region's demand for new telecommunications services, servicing these vast new markets, poses an enormous opportunity for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is entirely right that this industry should be-as it has been-the subject of intense scrutiny and decisive action by this Government. Indeed we are taking one of Australia's biggest industries and reshaping it into a new, vastly more dynamic structure. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 and 1988, amid claims that sound familiar today about threats to Telecom jobs, we initiated a series of reforms allowing competition in the provision of customer equipment and value added services, and we established three far-reaching reviews which have resulted in today's major reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms may be divided into four parts:</PARA>
<PARA> establishing a new competitor;</PARA>
<PARA> developing new services;</PARA>
<PARA> strengthening the regulator; and</PARA>
<PARA> ensuring a strong publicly owned telecommunications company. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of these elements contributes to the same outcome: benefits for Australia that are potentially limitless. We will see massive new private investment in the Australian economy; an expansion-not a contraction-of total jobs; a fall in STD prices on major trunk routes by as much as 40 per cent; and the creation of substantial and enduring export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying conviction of these reforms is that introducing a new competitor into Australia will stimulate Telecom into lifting its performance for the customer-whether that customer is business or an ordinary household. But to ensure early benefits are obtained, it will be important to manage the first phase of competition carefully. In this first period with only one competitor to Telecom, AUSTEL and the Trade Practices Commission will be able to ensure Telecom is not able unduly to exploit its entrenched position of great strength. If this duopoly is to serve its purpose and if the possibility of collusion is to be avoided, it must have a finite term. We have decided that after 30 June 1997 the duopoly will terminate, paving the way for there to be no limit on network competition. </PARA>
<PARA> AUSSAT will form the base for the new competitor and it will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. Legislation to this effect will be introduced to Parliament this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> AUSSAT will be sold and the new competitor will be up and running before the end of 1991. The sale will be carried out by a Task Force responsible to the Minister for Transport and Communications, based in his Department, and reporting both to him and to the Minister for Finance. All restrictions preventing AUSSAT from providing the full range of services will be removed by the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's representatives on the AUSSAT Board have been directed to resign forthwith and the Government will purchase Telecom's shareholding at its commercial value as at 24 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The new carrier will interconnect to the existing network at a price that will allow Telecom/OTC to recover the additional costs it incurs in providing facilities and services to the new carrier, and to underpin community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulatory safeguards will be put in place to ensure effective competition:</PARA>
<PARA> We will require Telecom and OTC-separately, and after their merger into a new entity-to provide interconnection on an equal access basis to the second carrier for both domestic and international services;</PARA>
<PARA> We will subject Telecom/OTC to separate price caps for local, trunk, and international services;</PARA>
<PARA> We will ensure that Telecom carries and completes calls without diminution of quality on behalf of the second carrier, and provides it with all ancillary and supplementary services such as billing, operator and directory services, and full access to information about customers and traffic flows;</PARA>
<PARA> and we will insist on transparency in the financial transactions of both the new OTC/Telecom entity and the new carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Our intention is to see new services develop both during the period of duopoly on the basic network and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period of the duopoly, up to 1997, a broad range of competitors to Telecom and the new entrant will be encouraged in markets other than the basic network. </PARA>
<PARA> First, we will licence a third mobile phone operator. The area of mobile telephony is booming; further technological and service improvements can be expected. It is, effectively, an alternative to local exchanges and, while expensive at present, it may, with further technological change, be the way of the future in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional mobile licences may be made available in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, and in support of the decision on mobile telephones, the Government has adopted the AUSTEL report on Cordless Telephone services, allowing unrestricted competition in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, we will remove all restrictions on resale, including on domestic and international telecommunications capacity. There will be no diminution of the rights of existing operators in this area. Furthermore, AUSTEL will review the terms of resale, including the extent to which resellers can establish their own switching equipment. These changes will provide a major boost to value added service operators, their business clientele and to research and development efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, as the first phone monopoly held by Telecom ends on 30 June 1991, the Department of Transport and Communications, in conjunction with AUSTEL, will bring forward a Cabinet Memorandum on the appropriate network termination point for both licensed carriers prior to any new carrier arrangements coming into place. Telecom will, in any event, continue to offer a first telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the role of the regulator in conjunction with the Trade Practices Commission, in promoting early and effective competition will be pivotal. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to strengthen AUSTEL for this role, the Government has decided that AUSTEL's decisions on issues under its control will be absolute and final. </PARA>
<PARA> AUSTEL will be given the power and the resources to:</PARA>
<PARA> arbitrate on all interconnection charges between the two network carriers;</PARA>
<PARA> control numbering;</PARA>
<PARA> manage Australia's input to international standards</PARA>
<PARA> prevent the misuse of market power; and</PARA>
<PARA> report annually to the Government on safeguards and their effectiveness, and, importantly, on customer satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> AUSTEL will also have a role in ensuring that Australian industry benefits from these changes without compromising the overall objective of improved services for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, throughout our deliberations we have been determined to maintain a strong public-sector presence in Australian telecommunications, particularly because of its important role in discharging community service obligations. We will not place in the hands of future Treasurers or Ministers for Finance the responsibility for delivering services in areas where competition does not eventuate, nor do we expect a new philanthropic owner for Telecom could be found who would provide them. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not attempt to deceive the people of Australia into believing that such an option is practical. </PARA>
<PARA> We will ensure that the community's expectations are met: that prices fall in real terms across a range of services; that untimed calls continue to be offered to households; and that rural and remote services do not vanish. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom operates, for principally domestic purposes, a well-balanced telecommunications network but it does not have a major export focus. In part, this is due to an artificial barrier between Telecom and OTC. This barrier will be removed by the Government, and a new corporate focus provided by merging the organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> That focus will have three basic purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> first, under the challenge posed by a new, privately-owned and fully-resourced competitor, to pass on to customers in the form of lower prices and better service, the huge productivity gains that are inherent in this industry's technological explosion;</PARA>
<PARA> second, to provide the basic opportunity for the new entrant to compete, encouraged both by the decisions of a newly-strengthened AUSTEL and the incentive created by the terms of the merger process itself; and</PARA>
<PARA> third, to market its combined strengths overseas aggressively and to pursue with much greater vigour than previously its undoubted abilities in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> A fee will be paid to the Government as a result of the merger of Telecom/OTC. The level of that fee will be set by the Government in consultation with the new entity. It will also pay a fee for its mobile phone licence. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that interconnect and equal access arrangements between the carriers are not unnecessarily delayed, AUSTEL will have to certify that these are in place in all capital cities and will soon be available in provincial cities before the merger is finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> Until that time, OTC and Telecom will operate independently but with the benefit of an interim group board to oversee their collective operations in the transition to competition. </PARA>
<PARA>Aviation</PARA>
<PARA> This month marks the beginning of deregulation, with the abolition of the Two Airlines Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> By terminating this infamous relic of Coalition inertia, we have opened the door to dramatic growth in this vital sector of modern transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The latter-day converts to micro-reform who sit opposite displayed their true colours when they were in Government with their consistent failure over decades to remove this Agreement. They were responsible for slowly strangling domestic aviation and pushing high costs onto the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of our decision to terminate the Agreement, we see new services, lower prices, a new airline-hard evidence of the value of the decision to Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to strengthen the hand of current and future entrants into domestic aviation, and in order to provide an appropriate environment for the sale of Australian Airlines and part of Qantas, the Government has decided to:</PARA>
<PARA> lift the foreign investment limits relating to investment in Australian domestic airlines by foreign airlines servicing Australia from 15% to 25% for an individual holding, and to 40% in aggregate;</PARA>
<PARA> maintain a stable policy environment for aviation for the remainder of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision to put further major policy change in this area on hold is sensible. It would be madness to introduce a major change such as deregulation and not give it a chance to work. It would similarly be stupid to attempt to sell the airlines while shifting the goal posts for potential purchasers. Our decision preserves future policy options. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign investment changes offer clear opportunities for the New Zealand carrier to enter the Australian market. In addition, we have opened up the freight route across the Tasman and are now nominating two additional carriers to serve that market. In the light of these decisions, we will also discuss with New Zealand the question of closer aviation relations in the context of next month's review of the Closer Economic Relations arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the sale of 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas will strengthen them and enable them to provide much improved services to Australians and Australian businesses. They will be recapitalised. They are likely to form strategic partnerships. In all, they will be more competitive, and this nation will be better off as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of both airlines will be handled by the Minister for Finance in close consultation with the Minister for Transport and Communications. The Government will take its own decisions on the issues related to sale, but it recognises that the airline boards have a right to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> Special arrangements will apply to the part-sale of Qantas. In order to accord with our bilateral air service agreement, the foreign investment limit in Qantas will be set at the generally accepted international benchmark of 35%. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, although Qantas will remain as our single designated international passenger carrier for the foreseeable future, the Government recognises that-with the success of our reforms of international charter programs for air freight-there is a potential role for a second designated freight carrier. A process is currently under way to assess expressions of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, Qantas and our tourism industry will continue to benefit from our intention to continue to sign new bilateral Air Service Agreements and to welcome charter programs. There are gains still to be made, both from traditional markets and from a more intense focus on regional opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>Land Transport</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a well-recognised fact that of all the areas of micro-economic reform, land transport offers the greatest potential gains. The Industry Commission has estimated these to be worth over $4 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> At the recent Special Premiers' Conference, the Premiers, Chief Ministers and the Prime Minister cut through the remaining disagreements to set in place fundamental reforms in both road and rail operations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister made clear earlier this year in calling the Special Premiers' Conference, our rail systems in this country cannot operate efficiently with their present structure. Inter-state freight alone loses $300 million a year, excluding efficiency losses from traffic now on the roads which might more appropriately be handled by rail. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitment to improving competitiveness required us to redress these imbalances through seeking State agreement to form a National Rail Freight Corporation: this will involve new investment, new industrial relations standards and new rail management. A Heads of Agreement has been signed by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, committing all Governments to work towards a start-up date of July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Premiers' Conference, the hard bargaining on asset values, equity considerations, reform of labour practices and other issues will commence. The Commonwealth's role is clear. We are prepared to contribute significantly to the success of the venture. We expect the States and the unions to do so as well, including particularly in respect of manning levels and work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Rail Freight Corporation will not justify the effort necessary from unions and governments if the heaviest road transport vehicles do not themselves bear a proper share of the costs of using roads. Current efforts by some States to recover costs through registration fees have been frustrated because transport operators have simply been able to register their vehicles interstate. But the damage to the nation's roads continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, States and Territories have agreed to the following objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> first, introduction of nationally uniform technical and operating regulations and driver licensing arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> second, the progressive introduction of nationally consistent road user charges having regard to principles established by the Interstate Commission, with a view ultimately to achieving full recovery of the cost of road use; and</PARA>
<PARA> third, clearer definition of responsibilities between different levels of Government for funding and managing elements of the road system, aimed at eliminating duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to take a continuing interest in the implementation of these changes. We expect that the Premiers will do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> We all recognise that the road transport industry is vital to our future. It is the lifeblood of many of our industries. As we introduce the changes I have detailed today, we will keep the industry informed and respect its views. In turn, we expect that the industry will acknowledge the common sense underlying these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Waterfront</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, more has been said about the waterfront than perhaps any other industry issue in this country. This Government has not, however, joined the queue of people who complain but do not act. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront reform plan which we adopted last year has already yielded significant results:</PARA>
<PARA> new stevedoring arrangements for bulk grain ships, reducing manning levels by 70%</PARA>
<PARA> retirement of 280 gangway watchmen</PARA>
<PARA> recruitment and training of 200 new waterside workers</PARA>
<PARA> development of an interim award agreement to facilitate award restructuring and the negotiation of enterprise agreements; and</PARA>
<PARA> most importantly, enterprise agreements currently being concluded at two of the largest terminal operations in Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> These agreements are expected to be forwarded shortly to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority for its independent assessment. National Terminals (Australia), the company negotiating these agreements, has publicly stated that it expects productivity gains of up to 60%. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing process of waterfront reform also includes involvement by the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority to enhance the competitive environment on the waterfront and ensure that users receive the benefits of reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements in the efficiency of the Australian shipping fleet continue to be made under our Shipping Reform Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, in excess of 350 seafarers have accepted voluntary early retirement packages. At the end of June 1990, the average crew size for the Australian fleet was 25 compared with 33 six years ago. By June 1992 it is expected that the average crew will be 21. All this continues to be achieved with no industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, at the outset of my comments today I described this Statement as a progress report. I emphasise the word `progress'; Australia is now making progress, achieving fundamental and lasting reform, in industries that for decades had seen no progress, no reform. </PARA>
<PARA> So I repeat the Government's challenge to the Opposition. Let them point to a period of Australian history that has seen faster or more profound micro-economic reform. That challenge remains unanswered of course because, as the Prime Minister has said in the past, there is no earlier period that comes within a bull's roar of the progress we have made and are continuing to make. </PARA>
<PARA> For 31 of the 34 years before we came to office, Australia was ruled by the dead hand of conservative inertia in which notions of reform to achieve productivity and efficiency were totally alien. That legacy of neglect and of abrogated leadership is a heavy burden still borne by the Coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by discussing the method of progress: its pace and process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should note that the progress we have made has been with little industrial disputation and with the emphasis on patient negotiation with all the parties involved. The Government has not failed to be firm where firmness is needed, but we have refused to indulge in the confrontationist tactics that are so often urged on us. That is why it has been swift reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this, some professional commentators outside the Parliament, and most of the amateur ones opposite, often call for a faster pace of reform. The secret of faster reform, we are told, lies in the amount of hair on the chest of Government: solutions should be imposed unilaterally by Government and let the devil take the hindmost. </PARA>
<PARA> One can tell these commentators are not living in the real world by the way they float new proposals. When they are presented with irrefutable evidence of Government progress in micro-reform, their sole response is to play catch-up: `Oh, we'd do that-and more'-as if the mere wish could be the father to the deed. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately for the nation, those in this Parliament who indulge in these stupidities do so from the safe impotence of Opposition. It is fortunate, because their whole approach is a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Lacking any sort of detailed strategy of how they would actually achieve reform, they are forced to peddle the pleasant deception that easy reform and painless change can be won through confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course real progress is not made by bringing the nation to a stand-still in some pointless industrial confrontation; real progress can only be made by harnessing businesses, trade unions, and governments in a cooperative pursuit of their common interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, there are no easy reforms or painless changes to be made. Reforming entrenched community attitudes and institutions is hard work-but it is hard work this Government is determined to undertake and to bring to effective conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> That way, Mr President, there will be many more progress reports from this Government describing our continued, effective and rapid progress in micro-economic reform, creating an increasingly efficient, productive and competitive nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I listened to the radio this morning and read the press reports about what was likely to be contained in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today on micro-economic reform I was surprised and almost excited because it sounded as though at long last, after seven and a half wasted, barren and destructive years, the Government was going to produce something meaningful in the crucial area of micro-economic reform. I should not have been surprised nor should I have been excited because that was very quickly shown on the briefest of glances at the Prime Minister's statement not to be the case -and I thank the Government for the advance notice of the statement which I received a couple of hours ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement is long on rhetoric as is customary with the Prime Minister and the Government, but it is short of any new proposals. There is virtually nothing in this statement today that is new, with one important exception in the telecommunications area where the Government has announced a policy change which is an important concession and acceptance of a point that we have been making on this side of the chamber about competition in the area of telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> But one must ask, having looked at the Prime Minister's statement, just how fair dinkum the Prime Minister and the Government are on the question of micro-economic reform. It is patently obvious that they are not. Back in August 1987, just after the 1987 election, one of the leading commentators in Canberra reported:</PARA>
<PARA>For the last three years the PM and several of his Cabinet colleagues have, on each State election, wrung every ounce of fear out of the cost of privatising various State government instrumentalities . . . Now, only weeks after the Federal election, Mr Hawke has undergone a St Paul like conversion . . . called on his party and the community to debate the virtues of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, privatisation is a major plank of the coalition's policy-a very cohesive, constructive and comprehensive set of policies-to promote micro-economic reform. The Prime Minister had a conversion. It is only now that he is beginning to act on it. Many of his colleagues have not yet been converted. One of the great battles to be fought within the Australian Labor Party over the period ahead, just as it has been in the last year or so, is the fight between the Left and Right over what should happen by way of ownership in Australia's public business undertakings. That fight is by no means concluded. Indeed, to date the fight has been won by the Left and not by the Right because the measures that the Prime Minister and his Government have taken in relation to the privatisation of public enterprises has been minimal at best. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has made much of micro-economic reform as a major instrument and area for policy. That is a statement with which the coalition would fully agree. Indeed, it is the coalition that has been making that very point and heading the debate on this issue for many years. Surprisingly-perhaps it is not surprising-the Treasurer (Mr Keating) once again disagrees with his Prime Minister. It is only a few months ago, in fact a year ago almost to the day, I think, that the Treasurer was reported in the Canberra Times as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Compared to macropolicy it's relatively small beer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is about time that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, ostensibly the two chief architects of economic policy in this country, got their act together and decided what is important and what is not important in the interests of this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Urgency and speed of reform has been a constant theme today of the Prime Minister's speech. This is surprising since this has been the major failing of the Government. The Government has failed to act on reform, particularly micro-economic reform despite the rhetoric that it was the prime objective of his Government's third term. I remind the Senate that it was micro-economic reform that the Hawke Government said, on coming into office in 1987 for its third term, would be the prime requisite of government consideration during that term. The Prime Minister was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 27 August 1987 as saying that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, yesterday committed Labor to sweeping economic efficiency reforms involving reduced protection, transportation deregulation, work practices reform and asset sales; establishing microeconomic adjustment as his third term priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Who could forget the salutary, positive and accurate comments after the last election by the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, lamenting the fact that the Hawke Government had lacked the guts to take the hard decisions in terms of policy reforms in the micro area. Now into the fourth term of government we still have only, to use the Prime Minister's own words today, `a progress report'. Opportunities in this fourth term continue to pass the Government by and, if today's statement is any indication, they will continue to pass the Government by throughout this fourth term in office. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other problems of a major nature looming on the Government's own front, and within the Government. It is only six months ago that Mr Dawkins called for an announcement of major reform measures pre-Budget, possibly in the form of a separate micro-economic statement or, he said, `face annihilation at the next election'. There was a deafening silence from the Government at that time. Just last month the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Fraser, said, `It's disappointing that we didn't find more references to micro-economic reform in the Budget'. They are very perceptive statements because they accurately reflect the situation so far as this Government's actual performance in the micro-reform area is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro reform is in many ways a very arcane word. Very few people actually understand what the term means, and it probably means different things to different people. My understanding of micro reform is that it is really about removing impediments to efficient and effective operation of the economy. It is essentially about making markets work better. </PARA>
<PARA> The improvements that the Government is proposing to make with one hand will be more than offset by putting greater impediments in new areas. I interpose to say that there are aspects of the Prime Minister's statement today, and there are aspects of other Government activities in recent times in this area, which the Opposition welcomes and applauds. Many are actions that we have been advocating for some time. The problem is that they go only a minuscule way down the necessary road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague said, they are half-baked; they are Mickey Mouse advances. Yesterday-and here comes the problem for the Government-Mr Dawkins, one of the senior Government Ministers, said that we need to take a step `beyond adherence to the market and the level playing field', and that we need to be `supporting those of our best performers who have prospects of doing better'. If support means getting the economy back on the right track, that is fine, but not if it means selective subsidies and support measures, as I think the Minister meant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button was reported in the Australian Financial Review yesterday as having `signalled to his Cabinet colleagues that he would be proposing selective measures aimed at boosting the export and import replacement capacity of Australian manufacturing industry'. It has also been reported to the effect that specific forms of assistance across a wide range of areas were being considered not only by Mr Dawkins and Senator Button, but also by Ministers Kerin, Beazley and Howe. Those statements coming out of Cabinet and out of the Government spell very grave danger for the Government in keeping anything like a coherent economic policy. It has not been able to adopt such a policy to date. It has been all over the ship in terms of its economic policy. Obviously that will be a more difficult task in the months ahead, given the restlessness and divisiveness between Ministers and senior Ministers of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would make one other comment before getting into the detail of the Prime Minister's statement-the statement is more notable for what it does not mention as for what it does mention. There is no mention at all in the statement about the critical linkage between micro-economic policy and macro policy. There is no mention of the crippling damage that the Government's failure in macro-economic policy has done not only to the economy but also to the very process of micro-economic reform itself. There are several other critical areas requiring reform that are not mentioned in the statement at all. I note in particular that there is not one word in the Prime Minister's statement today on the question of the reform of wages and industrial relations policies-reform which is almost the sine qua non of creating a productive, competitive and efficient economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Prime Minister's statement. My colleagues, Senator Kemp and Senator Alston, will be commenting on several specific items in the statement so, given the arrangement with the Government concerning time, I shall attempt to be selective. I welcome the Prime Minister's statement that the need for micro-economic reform and the need to make progress in terms of the creation of a competitive and efficient economy are essential above all. What I criticise greatly is that one would have to doubt, given the Government's record, the commitment and the achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says that the Government has been driven to a commitment to and achievements in micro-economic reform. What is the commitment of this Government in terms of micro-economic reform? If there were a commitment, we would have seen achievements. What are the achievements? The achievements in terms of micro-economic reform in the 7 1/2 years that this Government has been in office are virtually nil. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the decisions I will detail today represent perhaps our most significant achievement to date in this field. We have in the seven months since the election identified the issues in telecommunications and domestic aviation reform, consulted widely with those most directly affected by the changes and formulated imaginative and bold policies. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Prime Minister is really saying there is that it is really only in the last seven months that the Government even started looking at these matters. That is as great an indictment as anyone could make, certainly from one's own mouth, of a sterile, barren failure in the preceding seven years that the Labor Party has been in government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost as if the Prime Minister in his statement today has been in a time warp. What has happened to the seven years between 1983 and 1990? I will tell the Senate. What has happened is that the Government has produced a set of macro-economic policies which has led this country down the path to lower living standards, lower productivity, lower efficiency and a lack of competitiveness in an increasingly internationally competitive world. That is the reason why we have foreign debt in excess of $125 billion. That is why we have inflation, despite yesterday's figures, still running at twice the average of our trading partners. It is why we still have the highest interest rates and almost the lowest productivity in the Western World. </PARA>
<PARA> The standards that have been achieved in Australia in all those areas-the pace of economic reform of which the Prime Minister has been boasting in terms of micro-economic reform and the speed of the Government's actions-are certainly not the standards of the rest of the world. Anyone who has been to Europe recently will know that Europe is leaving us for dead in terms of its improvements in the areas of productivity, competitiveness, efficiency, opening up of markets internally, and the like. We are lagging badly behind many of our Asian neighbours. One has only to look at the four dragons-Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea-and increasingly at more and more countries in our region, notably Thailand in the last couple of years. We are getting further and further behind the eight ball and, if statements of the nature produced by the Government today are indicative of the Government's serious intent in this area, it is obvious that we will fall further and further behind. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Alston will deal at some length with the Government's statement today in relation to telecommunications decisions. For that reason, I will not touch on that in the time available. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of aviation, the Prime Minister has confirmed the 100 per cent sale of Australian Airlines Ltd by the Government and 49 per cent of the equity of Qantas Airways Ltd. He has also mentioned that the Government has decided to lift the foreign investment limits relating to investment in Australian domestic airlines by foreign airlines servicing Australia from 15 to 25 per cent for an individual holding and to 40 per cent in aggregate. That is a welcome decision. In the case of Qantas, the Government has raised the figure for foreign participation to 35 per cent. That figure is the generally accepted international benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the sale of both airlines is going to be handled by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in close consultation with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). Presumably that means that the sales are going to be handled by the Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales, which is established within the Department of Finance and which I would have to say has a quite appalling record to date in terms of its handling of such matters as the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. I note that Mr John Langmore, the Labor member for Fraser, in a letter today to the Minister for Finance, has said that the Federal Government has not got a cracker out of the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. Indeed, it has probably cost the Commonwealth a net $8m to give it away. </PARA>
<PARA> The handling of that Housing Loans Insurance Corporation sale is appalling as is the absolute botch-up taking place at the moment in terms of the attempted sale of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline. Everything is shaping up for a similar botch-up to occur in the case of the sale of the 30 per cent equity in the Commonwealth Bank. Setting that aside, although one wonders what that means for the sale of Australian Airlines and Qantas, the question that the Opposition would ask is why the Government is selling only 49 per cent of Qantas. Why is it not taking the proper route that it knows it should take and selling 100 per cent of Qantas?</PARA>
<PARA> It is only a few months ago that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) were trying to talk up that path within the Australian Labor Party. They were rolled by the left wing of their Party and hence they have had to settle for second best by selling 49 per cent of the equity. That does not do anything to increase the efficiency or the competitiveness of Qantas. There is no change as a result of that in the management, the operations and the functions of Qantas. They should have bitten the bullet, defied their left wing and gone ahead and done something in the interests of the nation. They should have sold the whole of Qantas, just as they have proposed to do-and welcomingly so-in the case of Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Prime Minister has said in relation to the reform of the waterfront in his speech today was, at best, highly misleading. For example, he said that the waterfront reform plan which the Government adopted last year had already yielded significant results. He said that the new stevedoring arrangements for bulk grain ships had reduced manning levels by 70 per cent. That is right, although it is an upper estimate. What he did not say was that none of the manning that has been freed up from that has left the industry; it has just been put into different parts of the industry. Excessive manning remains a net cost to the waterfront industry because those people have gone back into general labour pools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says in his statement that the reform plan has led to the retirement of 280 gangway watchmen. But that is not true in the sense that it followed from the reform plan because that was set in train long before the reform plan was introduced. So that result is quite independent of the Government's reform actions. He talks about the development of an interim award agreement to facilitate award restructuring and the negotiation of enterprise agreements and says that enterprise agreements are currently being concluded at two of the largest terminal operations in Melbourne and Sydney. Again, that is misleading in the extreme. There have been no agreements signed as yet, either in Melbourne or in Sydney. Given the history of the waterfront and the negotiations of the waterfront, one would not be wanting to hold one's breath until the agreements have been signed and the ink has dried. </PARA>
<PARA> One could make similar comments about the final area he mentioned, namely, land transport. We would agree with the Prime Minister that land transport does hold the potential to be the most important of all the micro-economic reforms and that it is not a well-recognised fact. We would point out to the Senate that the reason it is not a well-recognised fact is that the Labor Government has not cared about roads and land transport at all. Road funding has fallen by over 25 per cent in real terms since the Government came to office and rail has not had any funding from this Government until this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Time does not permit me to proceed any further. Let me conclude by saying that micro-economic reform is vitally important-it is something that we on this side of politics have pursued for a long time-and it should be treated as such. It should be comprehensive and cohesive. The Government's approach is none of those things. That is confirmed today by the very disappointing statement by the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This prime ministerial statement formalises the greatest sell-out by this Australian Labor Party Government of its responsibility to govern in the interests of all Australians. It demonstrates the agenda of this Government: a bias towards big business and a selling off of the family silver, masquerading under the description of micro-economic reform. That is why I believe it was incorporated in this chamber and not delivered by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This prime ministerial statement is full of copybook propaganda and unsupported assertions and it reeks of past claims made in the name of deregulation and competition-claims which have been shown not to have been delivered. Micro-economic reform, macro-economic reform, competition, deregulation, and free trade are the buzz words of this decade. I agree that we do need increased productivity and changes in work practices in some areas, and this will yield significant benefits. But we need to agree upon where such reform is really needed. It is probably most vital on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently heard a Business Council of Australia spokesman saying that micro-economic reform in telecommunications is not urgent. So who is the Government seeking to please in this? Is it the econocrats in Canberra or is it this simple tactic of wanting to usurp the Opposition? After asking us to accept in blind faith all the details, the Government is now going to tell us how it proposes to allow private interests to profit from publicly owned $10 billion per year businesses. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says in this statement that these reforms will help turn these industries into world-class performers. He refuses to acknowledge that the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (OTC) Ltd is already widely recognised as one and that Telecom Australia is already widely recognised as a leader in the provision of new services to business and fibre optic technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talks about equipping our economy to deliver to its citizens the quality of life to which they justifiably aspire. Perhaps he is talking about a quality such as in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, where 20 per cent of citizens cannot afford to own a telephone. He knocks Telecom's inefficiency. Last year Telecom reported a $1,291 billion profit. Its return on assets was 12.3 per cent. It invested $3 billion in new capital works, which will reduce costs. It showed a productivity improvement of 9 per cent-three times that of Australian industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister also talks about not letting the arcane jargon of micro-economic reform obscure the urgency and the importance of that goal. In fact, I believe that the Government deliberately uses this jargon to obscure the reality of the ramifications of these proposed reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixty-three per cent of respondents to a recent Newspoll survey described the Government's handling of the telecommunications debate as confusing; 27 per cent thought it was just a revenue raiser; only one in 20 thought it was designed to help the economy-a rather astute observation, I think-and 79 per cent said that they would stay with the merged Telecom-OTC Ltd in the form of Auscom. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this Government reform is really motivated by micro-economic reform. It is simply an attempt to cover up bad decisions made in the past, such as the decision made on Aussat Pty Ltd. Mr Keating and the econocrats have been amazingly successful in achieving their backdoor privatisation through starving our government business enterprises (GBEs) of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, in this statement, claims that wide consultation helped the Government formulate imaginative and bold policies. The contact I have had with consumer groups and with people from within the affected industries themselves indicates that this consultation was rather restricted and probably with the Prime Minister's mates in big business. This Government suffers a cultural cringe and it is simply attempting to implement failed models of overseas telecommunications. This is not imaginative and it is not bold; it is just plain stupid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister calls these reforms `real world solutions to real world problems'. The reality is that Australia, as Mr Dawkins said yesterday, is a country with a Third World economy. The Prime Minister's solution to this is to sell off the family silver, as well as the farm, which he has been successfully selling off for the past few years, in a short term garage sale. This is no substitute for micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister claims that this will be a major boost for Australian industry, particularly for telephone manufacturers. The United States example shows that, because of cheap equipment from South East Asia, the majority of telephone manufacturing companies in the United States no longer exist. The foreign competitor allowed into Australia will have existing supply arrangements and I believe these will continue for its Australian operation. Workers in this industry have every reason to be concerned for their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talks of cheaper subscriber trunk dialling rates. Yes, this will be to the benefit of big business users, but it will make little difference to ordinary consumers. Their small benefits will be eaten up by higher rates for other services. The Prime Minister talks of no timed local calls but says nothing about alterations to the boundaries which define `local'. He says that rural and remote services will not vanish but says nothing of the cost of obtaining these services-a clever exercise in semantics. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we get official notification sneaked in the middle of the document that the much vaunted duopoly arrangement is to finish on 30 June 1997. This is the date the Labor Government has decided to finally implement the policies of the Opposition. The Prime Minister's vitriolic attack in this document on the Opposition now seems decidedly hollow. I am sure that he will get the same reward from traditional Labor voters as that received by the New Zealand Labour Party just recently, and deservedly so. </PARA>
<PARA> This new competitor is to interconnect to the publicly owned Telecom network at a price which takes no account of the huge investment that each and every Australian family has already made to that basic network. That investment is about $3,500 for every ordinary household. Ordinary Australians have paid to establish a network from which big business will gain an enormous profit at their expense. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this bargain basement interconnect price, the new merged Telecom-OTC will be prevented from competing effectively and on open terms or on the so-called `level playing field' by government imposed price caps. The terms of the competition are to be overseen by Austel, which is to be beefed up somewhat. While it is all very well to give the regulator more power-and is it not ironic that the more we deregulate, the more we have to set up these stronger regulatory bodies?-we must ensure that it will indeed represent the interests of all consumers and not just those of big business. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement, the Prime Minister addressed reform in aviation. He again resorted to abusing the Opposition and talked about the infamous relic of coalition inertia. Once again, we see that he has set the stage for implementing the Opposition's favourite policies. It is rather hypocritical of him to keep pointing to the past in this way. He claims that the Government's deregulation of this industry has given us new services, lower prices and a new airline. I can count the number of new services, those which fly after curfew hours, on my right hand. The claim of lower fares rings hollow to all those people who are trying to make bookings to fly over the Christmas period. There are all sorts of restrictive conditions on these so-called lower fares. And to hold up an airline company which operates only two leased aircraft as a shining example of deregulation is a joke. No offence is intended to Mr Gray of Compass Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to land transport. I agree that perhaps the greatest test of the Government's micro-economic reform process will be land transport. For years the public has subsidised road transport. It is true that rail offers huge benefits in terms of reducing environmental impact and lowering the number of road fatalities. We need to ensure that these modes of transport are-to quote another current buzzword-on the level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the establishment of the National Rail Freight Corporation. But it seems somewhat ironic that we are setting up a rail freight GBE at the same time as we are flogging off others to private enterprise. It causes me to wonder whether the same thing will happen to this new one a few years down the track. I ask the question that I always ask: Why is it seen as wrong for the Government to own profitable and valuable enterprises which bring returns to all Australians?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government starved Aussat of the funds it needed to compete aggressively in the areas of data services, private networks and the carriage of television services. In a market worth around $800m a year, Aussat captured only 2 per cent of the market when it could have attracted around 9 or 10 per cent. The Government also denied Aussat access to the potentially lucrative South East Asian market. So now the inevitable has occurred-Aussat is to be privatised, and the carrot for the buyer is a licence to compete on the basic network. And that is what this so-called micro-economic reform debate is really about-a failed decision, a bad decision, on Aussat and a failure to admit it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Airlines is clearly outperforming Ansett Airlines of Australia. Yet the Government has chosen to deny Australian access to the capital it desperately needed. Now its need for funding is used as the justification for privatising it. Similarly with Qantas Airways Ltd and its large capital requirements. Removal of the requirement for Loan Council approval would allow Qantas to borrow in the same way as any other private enterprise. In another classic pincer movement, the Government has effectively strangled Qantas and now sees the only solution to be partial privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I share the concern that Mr Barry Jones recently expressed in the other place that the privatisation of our GBEs will only exacerbate the unequal distribution of wealth in this country. When speaking about privatisation recently, Mr Jones said:</PARA>
<PARA>When ownership of strategic resources lies in a few hands, there is a danger that governments can be forced into action which confers further benefits on the wealthy to the cost of the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA>It gives me absolutely no pleasure to receive this prime ministerial statement-a statement from a Labor Party Prime Minister which implements Liberal-National Party policy. I think this is a shameful day for the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few brief comments on the previous speech, by Senator Kernot. I agree with her that the prime ministerial statement is a sell-out to the Australian people-the Government has brought down a very poor statement-but it is not a sell-out to big business; it is a sell-out to the trade union bosses. All Opposition senators listen very closely when the Australian Democrats get up to speak. We listen to their attacks on big business and to their occasional attacks on the public sector, but we never hear any attacks on the trade union movement. The major blockage to reform in this country and to tackling the productivity problems which Senator Kernot mentioned in her speech is not management-indeed, in some cases, we cannot even blame the Government-it is the trade union movement and the reactionaries and troglodytes in that movement. When will we see one proposal from the Australian Democrats to actually tackle those rorts?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to turn now to the major subject of the debate, the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which has been brought before us today. It would take a high degree of optimism, given the Government's record on industrial reform, to believe that at last Mr Hawke and his divided Cabinet have got it right. When we survey the wreckage of our communications industry, the failure of the Button car plan, the disarray and uncertainties in our forest and mining industries, the huge and mounting problems in the finance sector and the now-acknowledged disasters that Mr Dawkins has inflicted on the tertiary education sector, we have to ask ourselves this question: Is it possible that the Government has been able to put together successfully a program of micro reform in the telecommunications and transport sectors?</PARA>
<PARA> As expected, the Prime Minister has laid out a mishmash of policy changes. Let me assure Senator Kernot that these policy proposals are, by and large, not the Liberal Party's policy proposals. It has to be said that some of these proposals will be detrimental to the efficiency of the telecommunications and transport sectors and the capacity of these sectors to deliver better services to the Australian economy and Australian consumers. In fact, where these reforms have the potential to achieve some micro-economic gains, as Senator Short pointed out, they will also have the effect of limiting the potential benefits that could have been obtained by consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement before us has had a tortuous and painful birth. We have been subjected to months of Cabinet leaks, brawls between Cabinet Ministers, public fights between government departments and agencies, and the inevitable unhelpful and unseemly brawls between Australian Labor Party (ALP) faction bosses. Today we have before us a statement from the Prime Minister which is not so much a statement of reform, but something which resembles more of a treaty-a treaty setting out the best terms that the Government could extract from its divided Cabinet, warring factions and union bosses. The program that we have before us today has not been governed by the national interest but by the overriding desire to protect the factional interests of the Labor Party and the interests of Labor's paymasters-the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Business Council of Australia (BCA) has argued that an essential part of micro reform and the process by which that can be achieved is commitment and leadership, not politics and accommodation. Mr Hawke is clearly sensitive about the slow pace of micro-reform under his Government, and rightly so. He argues in the early part of his statement that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . for too long Australia was content to live with inefficiencies and low productivity in too many of our domestic industries. </PARA>
<PARA>One might ask: Who has been in government for the last seven years? Mr Hawke, time and time again in this statement, seeks to excuse his Government's lethargy in the area of micro-reform. Let us read the last section of the statement before us. Instead of leadership, which the BCA, as I have said, has emphasised, Mr Hawke excuses himself by pleading the old line of consultation and the need to avoid confrontation. We are all in favour of consultation and, indeed, we are all in favour of avoiding confrontation; but we reject the politics of capitulation-capitulation to union bosses which is writ large in this ministerial statement, and which Senator Kernot did not mention once. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, Mr Hawke indulges in gratuitous insults and gross overstatements. This is my favourite: he argues that these reforms are the antithesis of the `half-baked ideas floated almost daily by the Leader of the Opposition'. Mr Hawke clearly chooses to ignore, on the issue of micro-reform, as in so many other areas of policy making, that it is the coalition that is setting the directions for change. I do not recall that the need to privatise comes from the Labor Party as, indeed, the Labor Party has been dragged screaming into this whole area. I do not recall that it was the Australian Telecommunications Employees Union that was calling out for increased competition in the telecommunications area. I do not recall Labor Party documents that stressed the need to open up the whole area of telecommunications to competition. I do recall, however, that the coalition has long set out comprehensive policies in this area. The shadow Minister for communications, Mr Neil Brown, has shown the way with a telecommunications policy which is effective and which will deliver cheaper services. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and, I suspect, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook)-if anyone ever listened-saying in election campaign after election campaign that the ALP Government would never be prepared to privatise Australian Airlines Ltd or Qantas Airways Ltd. Does the Government remember that promise that it made? Yet today the Prime Minister announces what he calls the most significant achievement to date in the area of domestic aviation. What is that most significant achievement? It is the 100 per cent privatisation of Australian Airlines and the 49 per cent part privatisation of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> If the term `half-baked' has to apply, let us apply it to the policy prescriptions which are before us today. The partial privatisation of Qantas means that our international airline is still shackled to government control and all of the inflexibility that that entails. The Government has largely ignored the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations concerning the need to tackle the web of regulations which bind the aviation industry and prevent it from becoming a properly functioning competitive market. In doing so, the Government has damaged the prospects of our vital tourism industry. With these confusing attitudes, is it any wonder that the pace of micro reform has been desperately slow under this Government? We support the full privatisation of Australian Airlines and we would move Qantas to full privatisation as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms that have been read out in the area of telecommunications are not only inadequate but also the third best option that the Government had before it. One does not have to go to this side of the chamber to find out what is wrong about Mr Beazley's efforts on telecommunication reform. The senior Ministers in Mr Hawke's Cabinet opposed these megacom reforms. Senator Cook probably opposed them, for all we know. </PARA>
<PARA> But even Mr Beazley, as Senator Short said, has now changed his mind. Do senators remember how Mr Beazley argued vigorously and ferociously that it was essential to maintain a duopoly in the area of telecommunications? Do they remember how he attacked our proposals to increase competition in Telecom? How pleasing it is to read today that after 30 June 1997 the duopoly will terminate, paving the way for there to be no limit to network communication. It is no wonder no-one ever believes anything the Government says; it cannot hold the line on anything. </PARA>
<PARA> How ironic it is that the very day that Mr Hawke makes a statement boasting about waterfront reform we read in the Australian that negotiations with waterfront unions have broken down after reaching an impasse on several core issues of reform. I ask Mr Hawke and, indeed, probably Senator Cook, why, if these reforms in the waterfront are so far reaching, as Mr Hawke told us today in this statement, it still takes two men to drive one fork-lift on our wharves. Why does it take one supervisor for every five workers? Why are the minimum gang sizes effectively set down in law for each dock regardless of its size and the amount of work? Do we have to have months-indeed, years-of negotiations or further inquiries before we rid ourselves of the gross inefficiencies which are harming our export sector and reducing the living standards of all Australians?</PARA>

<PARA> We are very pleased to read in today's statement that the average crew size on Australian ships has been reduced. But a noticeable omission from today's statement is how many working days per crew member compare with other countries. It appears that not one watersider has left the industry as yet under the redundancy provisions of the Waterfront Industries Reform Authority agreement, but today we learn that 213 extra employees have commenced work. Mr Hawke calls all this progress. </PARA>
<PARA> We might ask ourselves why has the Government not done better? The answer is simple. The trade union bosses and the Labor Left have vetoed a comprehensive reform package. The Government's refusal to consider privatisation of Telecom reflects its fear of taking on the power brokers of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. It has been asserted that there are 30,000 excess employees in Telecom. If full and open competition in telecommunications had been part of this statement it would have ended a few cosy lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did we not see a comprehensive policy on waterfront reform? The answer to that question lies with the Waterside Workers Federation and Mr Bull. Mr Keating is reported, during the telecommunications debate, as walking out of the Cabinet meeting, casting his eye over his colleagues and describing them as useless. Senator Walsh said, on resigning from the fourth Hawke Ministry, that he did not believe the fourth Hawke Government had the will to tackle micro-economic reform. It has to be said, regrettably, that Mr Keating and Senator Walsh were right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly will endeavour to do that, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is abundantly clear from this document that it is only a matter of time before we will see timed local calls imposed on the business sector. Mr Hawke makes that very clear by not mentioning business in saying that untimed calls will continue to be offered to households. That is very much a confirmation of what Senator Collins said, and he went out of his way to say that if we had been paying attention to what Mr Beazley said in the House we would know that there was certainly no commitment to maintain untimed calls in relation to business. I say it is a matter of time, and I would have thought sooner rather than later with the way the economy is going downhill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not have to copy the worst of the rest of the world. I would hope that the lessons from the rest of the world are that this can really be a very exciting and dynamic industry with enormous growth. But one thing that one does notice around the world is that every other Telco had a reduction in employment last year. That is a natural outcome of the rate of technological progress. But not Telecom. Telecom managed to jack up employment even in this year. I can understand that there might have been great demand for lobbyists and, no doubt, the queues at the Hyatt are largely explained by the fact that Telecom has had hordes of them up here. Truckloads have been coming up here mercilessly ensuring that it has got its way. But surely that cannot explain why there has been an increase in employment in the last financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is still very disappointing that the Government is not prepared to rebuke Telecom when it continues to pretend that somehow it is suffering from massive community service obligations (CSOs). The fact is that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics long ago blew this pretence out of the water. The figure is between $120m and $240m a year, depending on what rate of return one expects. Yet Telecom says in its annual report, `If you take the bureau's methodology, the CSO figure has, in fact, fallen but if you take ours, it has gone up 10 per cent'. Telecom says it has gone up to almost $900m. Really, this is pathetic and spurious. It is a tragedy that the Government is so captive of the telecommunications union and Telecom itself that it is prepared to perpetuate this monstrous distortion of reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that I note with some satisfaction is that at long last a massive conflict of interest has at least been partly resolved with the Government's order that Messrs Ward and Liggett should resign from the board of Aussat forthwith. That is a long overdue decision. I cannot understand how the conflict of interest has not been recognised long before now. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that not only will there be that resignation forthwith but also that in some way or other the Government will endeavour to ensure that Telecom does not take advantage of information gained when two of its most senior people were sitting on the board of Aussat. It is worse than having the coach of Essendon sitting in the Collingwood football change rooms just before the teams run out on to the ground. I can assure the Senate that Collingwood would still have won the Grand Final. Nonetheless, it is not a situation that is any way healthy. </PARA>
<PARA> We also are very pleased with the decision that there will be extensive resale and that the regime will be very much liberalised. But I am not at all satisfied, from what I see here-I will wait to see the legislation-that indeed we will have the sort of transparent accounting and structural separation that will be necessary to ensure that there are not any hidden cross-subsidies and that liberalised resale does in fact take place. It will be very much dependent upon Austel having the power to determine just what rates there ought to be for resale, and what protection ought to be accorded to resellers. I think there is a very real prospect that what we might see is that Telecom and any new resale entrant might come in and negotiate a deal behind closed doors, and Austel will then be effectively disempowered from overriding that decision. That is certainly not in the best interests of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is a basic recognition of the inevitability of competition and yet it is extraordinary, as my colleague Senator Kemp points out, that not one Labor Party wimp has been prepared to come in here and even defend the Prime Minister's statement, let alone face up to the facts of life and acknowledge that, belatedly, Australia is going to be prepared to give the rest of the world only an eight-to nine-year start. It is an extraordinary state of affairs. Senator Cook can be amused about this, but he must know in his heart of hearts, as does everyone around the Cabinet table, that Keating got it right; that Keating was absolutely right when he talked about the need for full and frank competition, and that the Beazley approach was simply there to accommodate the Left and all those who were somehow frightened of getting out into the real world. That is a tragedy for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is a recognition of the fact that it is simply impossible to justify that position in the public arena, but it still falls short of what is desirable. I for one will very much continue to reserve my judgment. I think the sheltered workshop is alive and well. There is not much prospect that we are going to see efficiencies if we are still prepared to adhere to the July 1991 date for the dismantling of the first phone monopoly, and I am sure there will be a number of other egregious work practices that will be as easy to eliminate as those on the waterfront have proved to be. So there is certainly a great deal more that needs to be done in this area. It ought to be clear to any intelligent observer that Telecom has already taken advantage of the Government's extraordinary dilatoriness in finally recognising reality--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am outraged too, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would have thought blind Freddy knows that Australian consumers have had a very raw deal for a very long time. I hope Senator Kernot does not get sucked in by things like Telcats. Do honourable senators know how Telcats operates? This is a consumer assessment exercise. For example, they might ask Senator Kemp, `Do you have any complaints about the way we come and tend your phone?'. He might not have had Telecom around for a few years, so he says, `No'. So, they write him down as having had no complaints. Everyone who has called Telecom over the last financial year has complained, but because they are only 2 per cent of the population Telecom says there is a 98 per cent satisfaction rate. That is the sort of nonsense we have to weave our way through, and I hope Senator Kernot is able to do that in due course. I assure the Senate that the rest of the world has conclusively demonstrated that there is no risk to consumer services, there is no risk to community service obligations, but there are enormous opportunities to introduce very real benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This statement belatedly recognises that; nonetheless it has not stopped Telecom from signing up people on long term deals, no doubt with heavy discounts, and because of the lack of transparency we will probably never be able to determine the extent to which Telecom is cross-subsidising these contracts. There is no doubt, either, that it has been hoarding some of its microwave frequencies, and in all sorts of ways playing the games that we have come to expect. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke's statement does recognise the enormous opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. The Prime Minister is absolutely right. But I have much less confidence that Telecom, with its very unimpressive external track record, will be well placed to take advantage of those opportunities. It may well be that the competitor will come in and start to clean up in this area. Unless there was some chance of that happening, we would not have had any prospects at all. It is deplorable that OTC Ltd has not been allowed to get out and compete on its own. It has a very good record; it could have handled the game very satisfactorily. This sordid deal which saw OTC folded into Telecom will simply mean that the worst of both worlds will be achieved in the dominant player. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is a welcome but belated recognition of the need to do away with the duopoly, the need to introduce resale, and the need for a third mobile phone operator. Of course Mr Beazley got rolled on that, too. The facts are overwhelming. Unfortunately, Cabinet does not base its decisions on fact; they are all based on how we can pander to interest groups-what will the unions say, can we somehow hoodwink the Australian Democrats into thinking that life, religion and CSOs are all at risk in the one go, and what sort of a deal can we sell to the media. This is another attempt at least to catch up with the rest of the world, and to that extent it is very welcome. Unless and until Austel is given the power to ensure that there is structural separation, adequate accounting arrangements and the ability to monitor activities at all levels, I for one have little confidence that in terms of a level playing field, the big bulky Telecom, already in the goal square, will not continue to receive massive free kicks from this Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This annual report of the Australian National Gallery is an interesting document because it outlines some significant achievements and some problems facing the Australian National Gallery. It is also significant because in this year's annual report the Chairman, Mr Gough Whitlam, has not bagged the Government. I presume that after last year he thought that maybe he had had enough of a go. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are some areas where perhaps a bit of bagging might have been appropriate. Nonetheless, as the shadow Minister for the arts, I have every confidence in the new management of the Australian National Gallery, particularly under its Director, Mrs Betty Churcher. The Gallery has set out on a direction of consolidation and is concentrating less on acquisition this year. In particular, it is extending its exhibitions and its travelling exhibitions to rural areas, which I think is a good and proper course to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a couple of things bother me about the annual report and maybe there are some simple explanations for them. For example, in Mr Whitlam's foreword he says that the outstanding and excellent Ancient Treasures from the British Museum exhibition drew over 190,000 visitors to the Gallery. However, on page 78 the attendance figures show that something like only 100,000 people attended the Gallery during the months when that exhibition was on. We may get an explanation about why the figures at the back of the report do not tally with the figures at the front. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to see that Mr Whitlam reports that benefactors, particularly American benefactors, will require the Government to contribute to the core funding of the Gallery and that benefactors such as the Americans do not intend to take over the Government's responsibilities in this regard. That is one reason I was disappointed to see that no mention is made of a major disagreement which is going on at the moment in the National Gallery about the nature of the arrangements with the National Gallery Foundation. A report into the running of the National Gallery by Mr Early recommended that the National Gallery Foundation take over all the fundraising activities of the Gallery. Mr Whitlam rejected that out of hand, as I outlined to the Senate some time ago. There is no mention of that in this annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also disappointing to note that the $3.5m required to fix the roof of the building will mean that there will be no blockbuster events in the Gallery, no huge and successful displays such as the Ancient Treasures of the British Museum exhibition, over the next couple of years. Mr Whitlam's report does not note the disruption that will take place in the Gallery because of this re-roofing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting, in respect of this disagreement about the Australian National Gallery Foundation, that the back pages of the report reveal that the Foundation raised a surplus of $2.3m. It is vital that the National Gallery Foundation be strengthened to provide a greater opportunity for providing non-governmental funds to this organisation. The Gallery is certainly something of which Australia can be proud, but I hope that the problems it is clearly having with the Foundation, where the Foundation says it should have an integral role to fulfil in the Gallery's activities and a vital part to play in the development of the National Gallery and the national collection of art, will be overcome. We want to know what that role is to be. This report is short on detail on that matter; in fact, it is so short on detail that the disagreement is not even mentioned by the Chairman of the Gallery, Mr Whitlam, in his otherwise adequate, but in this case inadequate, introduction. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region has once again produced a thorough report which raises some interesting issues. Concerns about the implementation of environmental requirements were raised in the annual report last year and again by Professor Geoffrey Taylor in his review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS). </PARA>
<PARA> Environmental requirements were prepared as an outcome of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry. They were intended to ensure strict environmental standards, as promised by the Government in the face of considerable opposition to uranium mining in what was to become Australia's most well-known World Heritage area. It is apparent from this report and from the review of the OSS that the situation in which the Northern Territory Government can disregard the advice of the Supervising Scientist in respect of adherence to the environmental requirements is unacceptable. The review of the OSS was tabled in Parliament in December last year. As yet there appear to have been no responses to the recommendations to ensure that environmental standards are rigorously maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the report tabled today indicates that most of the environmental protection goals appear to have been met, there are grounds for concern that ground and surface water quality is deteriorating near both the Ranger and Nabarlek operations. There is also some concern over the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the Nabarlek mine site. I fully support the suggestion that Queensland Mines Ltd be required to lodge an appropriate financial security to ensure that it does not walk away from the problem, and that work begins immediately to halt any leakage of salts or radionuclides into the ground water system. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I want to look at the situation of the Coronation Hill joint venture (CHJV) in the very much misnamed conservation zone. The report states many times over in pages 60 to 64 that the CHJV is inadequate and unsatisfactory. These words crop up again and again: for example, in the transport of materials to and from the site, extra hazards will be associated with transporting toxic material such as cyanide, caustic soda, and hydrochloric acid, the assessment of those hazards is not adequate, and the increase in vehicular access could also cause some environmental damage, at least in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> The OSS has some reservations about the strategy for water management, as no provision has been made to determine the toxicity of the water so as to estimate a safe dilution before it is allowed to enter the aquatic ecosystem. The OSS believes that aspects of the proposed residue management system are unsatisfactory. Management and disposal of tailings is such an important element of mine site operations that a detailed assessment needs to be carried out before approval for the project is given, not an ad hoc, on the job assessment as it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the waste rock dump, the original plan was to have two huge rock dump areas; this plan has now been contracted down to one, and the OSS is very concerned that a large run-off from the waste rock will enter the river, giving rise to possible harm to the aquatic ecosystems. The OSS is concerned about rehabilitation in the matter of the waste rock dump, the residue dam, the mine pit and revegetation. All of these areas are of concern to the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that when the Resource Assessment Commission finally brings down its report next April these concerns about the inadequacy of the planning will be reflected in whatever advice it gives to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I believe that the integrity of the South Alligator River system can be maintained only if Coronation Hill is left intact, not subject to mining. As this report clearly shows, there are many unanswered questions; therefore, there are too many potential risks on environmental grounds alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect is that of Aboriginal heritage. The Jawoyn people know this as sickness country and they do not want mining to go ahead there. On that ground, too, it should be left alone. The most pressing need is for the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to act on recommendation 14 of the review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. This requires amending the existing arrangements to require the Northern Territory Government to give effect to the advice of the Supervising Scientist and so ensure that adherence to the environmental requirements is both unavoidable and enforceable. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>When discussing the Department of Community Services and Health annual report for 1989-90, I would like to focus on an issue which has had some coverage in the media in recent days. That issue is the proposed charter of rights for nursing home and hostel residents. I note that in the section of the report which deals with residential care it says under the heading `Quality of Residential Care':</PARA>
<PARA>This sub-program aims to ensure that aged people in residential care receive quality care and quality of life outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the ways in which the Government intends to provide those quality of life outcomes is enshrined in this proposed charter of rights. However, it is obvious from recent actions and comments by the Minister responsible for this area, the Hon. Peter Staples, that these quality of life outcomes are those to be determined by him and not by the caregivers or the residents who may choose to enter a particular nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> He may have backed down in his fight with the Catholic bishops over some of the objections to the charter, namely those of a sexual nature, but he refuses to do so about doctors who may advocate practices contrary to Catholic belief and teaching. This backdown does not negate the fact that, if the Minister had not been taken on, he would have forced his moral and social views on every resident of nursing homes and hostels throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to keep in mind in this issue is that the residents of these homes are already vulnerable. We are not talking about married couples who live together in retirement villages. Rather, we are talking about residents of nursing homes and hostels. In many cases these residents are in the homes because they cannot totally and completely care for themselves, and that includes others in our society such as those who are physically or mentally handicapped as well as the aged. These people do not need to be made more vulnerable. To have followed the Minister's way of thinking is to add yet another burden to the shoulders of these residents. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is our community responsibility to lessen those burdens, not to increase them. Whether one is a parent with a handicapped child or a child who has to place his parent with professional care in a home, one has the right to expect the same social and moral standards as one sets in one's own home. So too do these residents have the right to the same social and moral standards they would have experienced at home. If one does not agree with the standards of the church, why then become a resident of a church-run institution? That is where, I believe, the freedom of choice comes into the issue. Parents who choose to send their children to a church-run school have the right to expect that the church's teachings on social and moral issues would be practised in those schools. </PARA>
<PARA> An editorial in the Australian newspaper put this disagreement with the Minister very simply:</PARA>
<PARA>Church groups have a right to their moral standards. Indeed, they have a duty to uphold them. They are entitled to expect that as their nursing home residents enter their care voluntarily, they will agree to the standards laid down. If not, the solution is simple-they are free to seek care elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>As the editorial pointed out, the church's basic point and objection is that its members have a right not to have their consciences offended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, Mr Staples, while claiming that his charter extends rights to behavioural choices evenly to all nursing home inmates, was in fact denying aged people with Christian principles the right to choose a morally acceptable environment. Worse still, he insists that an environment in which moral deviance is welcome should be imposed on all, whether they like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is not the first time Mr Staples has wanted to ride roughshod over the nursing home industry. When he first proposed this charter the original legislation had provided for the Minister and his department to set up the charter at whim. It was then that amendments had to be forced onto the Minister so that anybody concerned with the operations of nursing homes and aged peoples' homes had the opportunity to consult with the Minister about the form and the wording of the proposed charter. The changes also meant that the charter is subject to the approval of the Parliament, which means that members can debate the charter and make amendments to the final wording if necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish also to speak to the annual report of the Department of Community Services and Health and to compare and contrast two issues. The first one I wish to mention is dealt with on page 23 of the report, where there is a section dealing with drug abuse reduction and adverse reactions. I would like to mention the particular use of a drug called Depo-Medrol. The drug is not recommended by the manufacturer for epidural use, and it has come into quite widespread use in this country precisely for that purpose. The National Health and Medical Research Council, moreover, does not recommend the drug for that particular purpose, yet, as I say, it has come into quite widespread use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There appears to be no requirement that adverse drug reactions be reported. Large numbers of patients are suffering adverse reactions from the use of the drug in this way, which, as I say, is not recommended by the manufacturer or by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Moreover, this Government provides government benefits for this particular treatment despite the fact that it is not a treatment recommended by the body which is authorised to make recommendations as to the adequacy and appropriateness of medical treatment. I personally have attended a meeting in Perth, Western Australia, attended by some hundreds of patients who have suffered adversely from the particular application of this drug. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to contrast that with the desperate situation of another patient in Western Australia who is suffering from advanced cancer and who is attempting to obtain a drug with which this patient has been treated in Germany, but which at this stage is not a recommended treatment in Australia. On the one hand, we have a drug being used very widely causing a large number of adverse reactions and being used in a way which is not recommended, and that treatment attracting medical benefits; yet on the other hand we have a patient who seeks treatment with a drug which is not in widespread use in this country, and that patient in this particular case cannot get that drug released through the Customs office. </PARA>
<PARA> That drug is being held up in Perth by Mr Staples's office. In just the last 24 hours or so I have been attempting to persuade Minister Staples to release this drug, because there is a doctor in Perth who is prepared to treat this patient, and both the doctor and the patient are being given the runaround. Mr Counihan of Mr Staples's office has indicated that a form needed to be signed for the importation and use of this particular drug. That was also indicated by Dr Ashley Brewster of the relevant department. We are now told that no form is required; that simply a letter which satisfies certain criteria addressed to the Department will satisfy. The doctor is prepared to use this particular drug. Although he says that the drug is not his preferred form of treatment, he recognises the right of the treatment to be used because that is the patient's wish. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I contrast the very unsatisfactory way in which this Department is dealing with two drugs-one which is not recommended for use and which is being used for a purpose not recommended and yet is attracting medical benefits; another drug which a patient wishes to use and has been exposed to and which is being withheld from this patient. This is a very unsatisfactory situation, and I hope that in both cases the Minister will address himself to these matters urgently and find some satisfactory resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, I present a letter from the Chairman of the Committee to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, dated 7 November 1990 outlining the Committee's recommendations on the issue of change of status on the basis of marriage. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage I would like to make quite clear that what I am presenting on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations is but an interim report. In this letter to the Minister the Committee stressed the point that it is an interim report. The Committee is mindful, as we state in the letter, of the time frame and time constraints under which the Committee is operating and under which the Minister and the Government are also operating in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment a concession in the regulations allows visitors to Australia who join with a partner for marriage or de facto purposes to make application to remain in Australia whilst they are in Australia. That existing concession is due to expire on 30 November-just over three weeks time. Earlier this year the Minister asked the Committee to investigate and report back to him on the report of the National Population Council. The Committee received this report but at that time it was very heavily engaged in the earlier inquiry into illegal entrants to Australia and let this matter slip. Upon presentation of that first report Illegal Entrants in Australia-Balancing Control and Compassion, the Committee then directed its attention to this particular question. </PARA>
<PARA> On a personal basis I have some difficulties with this interim report. I do not accept that we have given this issue the consideration it deserves. It is a very complex issue. Whilst we have deliberated upon it in public hearings, I do not believe that we have got wide enough advice to make determinations and recommendations. Indeed, at the Committee's meeting on Thursday afternoon last week, I moved a motion to the effect that the Committee would not be making any recommendations to the Minister on this matter because I did not believe that we had examined the issue thoroughly enough. Unfortunately for me my motion was not seconded and therefore lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not sought to put in a minority report or to present reservations to the report of the Committee. I do so because on the last occasion on which the Committee's report reached this and the other place, it had five minority reports attached to it. I am of the view that a committee that can attract that amount of divergence of opinion can have some doubt cast upon its ability to do its job. For the sake of consensus-that consensus pervaded through all of the Committee members who were present for discussion-we accepted majority decisions on the report. For the purposes of the record, I put my personal opinions at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, in summary, in this interim letter to the Minister, the Committee is recommending that the current system of concessions for visitors who seek to change status on the basis of marriage be continued. We call for more extensive interviewing of applicants who seek to change status on the ground of marriage. One of the more controversial aspects of our letter is that we ask that more stringent requirements be placed upon visitors who apply on the basis of a de facto relationship. In the first instance, we recommend to the Minister and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that there be a proven 12-month period of cohabitation between the individuals before the matter is considered. Further, we ask that an additional provision that a 2-year temporary entry permit be granted prior to the granting of permanent residency. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those points we have mentioned are perhaps somewhat unclear and further reinforce the point and my misgivings about putting in a report at this time. Clearly, the Committee is making a distinction between entry on the basis of marriage and on the basis of de facto relationships. I agree that a distinction ought to be made. At the moment there are distinctions and those people who enter into a marriage contract arrangement are disadvantaged by the present recognition of de facto relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a marriage, before the individual can be properly married in Australia, a period of notice must be given to the authorities or to the officials of the respective creeds who are to conduct the ceremony whereas no such restriction is placed on a de facto arrangement. In some instances no notice is given. I personally favour some distinction. But I felt that the Committee needed much more advice and should have taken a much more detailed examination of how other Australian laws that govern marriage situations would be applicable to this situation before we made the suggestions that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> There was unanimity in the Committee concerning spouses or partners who may be blackmailed into a marital or de facto situation through domestic or other forms of violence that may occur between partners in marital or de facto situations. Anecdotal evidence was given to the Committee by people who said they could support with documentation evidence of cases where individuals have been blackmailed by their spouse or partner to remain in a violent situation and that, if they did not, they were told they would be dobbed in to the authorities and deported to their original countries or their applications for permanent residency in Australia would be stopped and they would be asked to remove themselves from this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was certainly sympathetic to any victims who might find themselves in that situation and we have made a recommendation to the Minister that some concessionary arrangements ought to be put in place to look after people who find themselves in that situation. We were also mindful of the fact that in some cases if a woman has come to Australia to enter into a marriage situation or if she enters into a marital situation upon arrival here, should that marriage break down before the permanent residency is granted and she has to return to her country of origin, she could find herself, because of cultural differences, an outcast in her own community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is something that the Minister, the Department and the Government have to be aware of. We have to make those hard decisions about asking people to return to their home countries. The Committee indicates in its conclusions-there are other matters contained in the report which I will not dwell on in the time available to me-to the Chairman of the Committee, Dr Theophanous, that we intend to put a full report before the Parliament and the Minister early in the Autumn session of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally have some misgivings as to whether we will be able to do so because for the next six out of seven weeks the Senate will be sitting and a committee of this nature is not allowed to sit whilst the Senate is sitting. So we will have very little time available to us to examine matters within that time frame. We will then move into the Christmas holiday break and I do not know many members of the Committee who will be all that keen to get together in the early part of the New Year. On the projected program for the sittings of the Parliament next year, it looks as though we will be returning to this place and the other place on 12 February for a two-week session. So the Committee will not have a great deal of time to sit down and fully and deeply examine the questions involved in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> With that misgiving about the time available to the Committee to undertake a full, deep and thorough investigation of the matter, I also allude to the fact that when I presented and spoke to the earlier report from the Committee on illegal migrants in this country, I drew attention to the fact that the resources available to the Committee by way of the secretariat were somewhat limited. I am given to believe that those resources will be increased. But at this point in time, today, the Committee does not have any additional personnel available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I paid tribute on the last occasion to the work of the secretariat and how well it has served the Committee. Robina and Heidi have done an admirable job and still continue to do that valiant job but I believe we are asking too much of those individuals. The matter must be seriously addressed in the early stages. The delays I referred to in the Committee examining this report are in no way attributed to the people I named before but it is a very serious matter that I hope will be addressed before the Committee deliberates much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a very worthwhile Committee that needs to be continued and supported. It has a lot of work to do. The area of migration is a very complex area which was dramatically changed with the Act of Parliament that we put through this place last year. Not only did we dramatically change the system, but we also introduced a very complex series of regulations that govern permanent and temporary entry to Australia. The Committee has a responsibility to examine each of those matters and each of the changes that continue to occur. The Committee can be in a position to offer valuable advice to the Minister. We have had some problems to date on this matter and not the least has been the resources available to the Committee. Also included is the problem that I alluded to in passing, the fact that the Committee cannot meet when the Senate is sitting which, as I said, is to meet for six out of seven weeks. Mr Deputy President, with those words, I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a sentence at the end of the letter which I shall paraphrase. It says that there are some aspects of the report which I do not agree with. May I say in fairness to the Committee that I was not there when the matter was being discussed and I want to make that clear. The letter said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is my intention to table this letter in Parliament as soon as possible. I must also advise you that there are aspects of this report with which Senator Cooney disagrees. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have liked to have agreed with it, but there are some aspects of it which I find I am unable to agree with. I want to point out what they are. I do not think, when it is all analysed, that the differences will be all that great and, as Senator McKiernan has properly said, there has been too short a time in which to analyse this problem and to write about it. On the first page, the letter said:</PARA>
<PARA>2) it is recognised that because of immediate resource implications it would be impractical for all applicants for change of status and their spouses to be interviewed and that therefore:</PARA>
<PARA> a) all applicants where it is suspected that a principal purpose is immigration be interviewed; and</PARA>
<PARA> b) all other applicants be interviewed on a random or risk analysis basis;</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, the motive for which a person marries is not a good test to apply to decide whether she or he should remain in Australia. The test should, in my view, be whether there has been an attempt to obtain permanent residency by fraud. This may involve consideration of whether two people have gone through a form of marriage that is in fact a sham. But what should draw the penalty of having to leave Australia is corrupt conduct and not marriage. It concerns me a bit. No doubt, being an old Christian Brothers boy, those early lessons--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or a Marist boy as Senator Richardson was. It comes back to us that we should not use marriage as a test as to whether we should put people out of the country. What we should look at is whether a fraud has been committed, which may manifest itself in a sham marriage. But if the marriage itself is all right, it seems to me to be not a good basis for throwing people out of Australia because people marry for a variety of reasons. They marry for money, for glory, for power and indeed for love, which, of course, is the reason we most want to protect. But if we marry for other motives as well, as long as the marriage is stable and holds together, why should it not be allowed to exist? It seems to extrapolate one motive out of a variety of motives which many people might consider as being fairly poor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To extrapolate one motive and put a penalty on that seems to me to be looking at it in the wrong way. We should be saying that if there is fraud and if a relationship has been entered into for the sole purpose of keeping a person in Australia, of course a penalty should follow. But a penalty should not simply attach to a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not simply a question of migration law but the sort of society we are and the sort of approach we want to take to things. It seems to me to be a bit unhappy if people are to be cross-examined about why they married or did not marry. It is not the sort of thing that in a free and liberal society we would want to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> That test covers the de facto relationship as well. What should be looked at is whether or not the de facto relationship is a fraud or a sham. If it is, then people who have entered into that relationship simply and solely to defeat the purposes of the Immigration Act and who do not intend to live together once that has been achieved, of course, are committing a fraud. That should be the test. It is, in my view, as Senator McKiernan said, much easier to obtain evidence that a relationship is permanent if there has been a marriage ceremony. Then at least prima facie there is evidence of a relationship of an enduring nature intended. However, with a de facto relationship the evidence is not so readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue about which I had some trouble in regard to the letter related to the situation of a person who comes here as a spouse fully intending to make a go of the marriage but the other partner, for whatever reason, severs that relationship, in which case that person no longer has occasion to stay here under the law and the question arises as to whether he or she should be sent home. The threshold test suggested in the letter is that such a person will be allowed to stay here if he or she is a proven victim of domestic violence or of cruel and unconscionable conduct, is a party to non-ex parte proceedings in a court of law, and can demonstrate the various tests that are set out. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice present in the chamber Senator Giles, who has done some magnificent work on behalf of battered women and victims of domestic violence over the years. I would appeal to Senator Giles to agree that it is a terrible burden to ask a woman-or a man, if a man is placed in such a situation-to be required to go through a contested court case, contested because ex parte proceedings are excluded by this test. It would be asking such a person to go through a court case and to have to face, in the formal surroundings of a court, the perpetrator of the violence upon her, or him, and to be successful in that case before it is even considered whether or not he or she should be allowed to remain in Australia. One would have hoped that there are other tests where we as a fair and reasonable society could say that, where a person has been placed in such a situation, it would be quite unjust to ask him or her to return to his or her homeland. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the test should be whether it would be unconscionable to a fair and reasonably-minded person to send such victims back. Indeed, they may be a victim not of violence but of economic fraud or whatever. That seems to me to be the more appropriate test, rather than asking whether or not people can satisfy a court of law that they are victims of domestic violence or cruel and unconscionable conduct. I would like to see that modified. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with this whole area is that, unless things are expressed in the most stringent legal terms and unless people explain what they are about, all sorts of criticisms are heaped upon them. I think that one of the most difficult portfolios to carry out must be that of Mr Hand, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. As an illustration of that before I close, I would refer to a letter from Mr Ron Merkel, who is a silk, and a very good one, in Melbourne and who is also President of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties. He has taken the Government to task for reintroducing the `White Australia' policy on the basis that there are certain criteria, about which I do not know except through this letter. Certainly I understand that no criteria have been adopted by the Government yet. The letter is based on criteria which Mr Merkel says the Government has adopted in respect of visitors from Lebanon, Tonga, the Philippines, Fiji, Pakistan and Poland. He has obviously got those criteria from somewhere, and on that basis he says that there has been a reintroduction of the `White Australia' policy. I would have hoped that Mr Merkel, for whom I have much admiration, would have checked his facts before he went into his dissertation in the Age newspaper. I would have hoped that he had established exactly what was the Government's position before he made his criticisms. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Well, one of the fundamentals of civil liberties should be that when people rage about a particular subject they should establish that what they are saying is correct. Mr Merkel then goes on in his letter to talk about de facto relationships and says that the Government is about to make a move in that direction in a way that will greatly disadvantage de facto relationships. Again, the only thing I know about the Government in that respect is that, in looking for proof, it is easier to accept marriage as proof of a stable relationship than to accept a de facto relationship. At least with a marriage there is a ceremony that people have gone through, there are witnesses and there are the trappings of a permanent relationship, whereas with a de facto relationship the evidence can be quite equivocal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Government may be thinking along those lines, but certainly is not going along the lines that Mr Merkel is suggesting. I hope that when I next see him we can have a reasonable discussion about these issues. I hope that he will have a reasonable discussion with members of the Government rather than rushing off to the press and making statements which, I understand, are quite misconceived. </PARA>

<PARA>Perhaps I should explain the purpose in moving this motion. I do not intend the motion to cut across any further time.

<PARA> I think it would be highly inappropriate to restrict senators to five minutes on treaties when 31 treaties have been tabled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government at this stage is not inclined to support the proposition advanced by Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine approached me yesterday to see whether an allocation of time could be made available so we could discuss this matter in the chamber. I undertook to check the matter with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) and other appropriate Ministers. This I did and reported back to Senator Harradine just at the time he rose in the chamber yesterday afternoon to speak on the matter. I said that we would accommodate his wishes and allocate an appropriate time when debate could ensue on treaties, particularly one treaty in which he has an interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter was also discussed, as was said earlier in the chamber this day, at the Whips meeting this morning. I think the consensus at that meeting was that an allocation of time would be made available at some appropriate time when the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was going to ratified by the Government. The information we have been able to get back from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is that we do not expect a ratification of this Convention certainly this year and perhaps not in the early part of next year. At this stage we are not able to give a definitive date. One of the matters raised at the Whips meeting this morning was that we ensure that a debate takes place on this matter before the ratification of this treaty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Ltd is, in a sense, a sad document because OTC, which has been an efficient and effective organisation, is to be wiped out as a result of a deal this Government has done with the trade union movement, or one section of the trade union movement-the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear that the deal that is involved in the merger-the totally inappropriate merger of Telecom Australia and OTC-is not on the basis of what is best for Australian users of telecommunications. It is not what is in the best interests of the nation. It is not what is in the best interests even of a large group of unionists. It is simply what is in the best interests of the tough guys from the trade union movement in the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. The union has 26,000 members and has played a crucial role in determining this inappropriate, ludicrous, and I believe inefficient, merger of these two bodies-Telecom and OTC. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that OTC has proved itself to have been a most effective, competent and efficient organisation. The annual report reveals the continual reductions in prices and costs of OTC. It reveals how it has the lowest call charges for both residential and business international calls of 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. To establish this the call charges to each country are standardised for differences in the general level of prices. OTC has a proud and effective record as being a lean and efficient organisation. It is now to be swallowed up in a large, overfat, inefficient and union dominated organisation for no good reason other than resolving problems of union power and rivalry. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me immensely is that in a statement earlier by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-I think it was today-we saw that the organisations are to be totally integrated. I had hoped that at least the Government would have been sensible enough to realise that it was vital to leave the efficient operations of OTC separate, even if it was within the umbrella of the large, bloated bureaucracy that makes up Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> OTC has shown a great deal of enterprise and it has shown what can be done when we get a good external manager in to run the place as if it were a private enterprise. It is tragic that the Government is making no effort to preserve OTC's core business, as it now appears it is going to be swallowed up by the Telecom bureaucracy. OTC has run its organisation with something like 2,000 people. There are 86,000 people in Telecom. If this merger had meant that the tail was going to wag the dog, that would be great, but I fear that the dog is going to continually sit on the tail of OTC. I regret what is going to happen as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA> This merger makes a mockery of micro-economic reform. OTC should have provided the basis, in particular with its much more rational and, I should say, right wing union which is involved, on which competition could have been created in the telecommunications area. The Government's decision to merge Telecom with OTC has prevented OTC, with a reasonable union, ending up as a strong competitor. Instead, we are going to have a bloated Telecom, success for ATEA and union dominance in an area where we must have effective microeconomic reform. It is a tragedy for the entire telecommunications industry that OTC is to be thrown into this pot with Telecom and it is shameful that it has occurred as a result of Government capitulation to the most powerful public sector union in Australia. </PARA>

At this point we still do not have the details of next year's funding for medical researchers. Millions of dollars are involved in this. This is not to say that there is not some very fine work being done; indeed, some very fine work is being done in the medical research area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the researchers who have been knocked back, not because of the quality of their proposals but because the funds have not been available, will be very concerned about the fact that the National Health and Medical Research Council in the last three or four years has paid an amount of $450,000 from scarce medical research funds to utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer and his Monash group for a project entitled `Bioethical Issues and the Use of Human Foetal Tissue, Embryos and Gametes'. Of course, Professor Singer has published views that the human embryo and the human foetus, and indeed a newborn child, have no inherent right to exist and, specifically, that a human embryo is of no more inherent worth than a lettuce. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not ludicrous for the Federal Government, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, to pay $450,000 of scarce medical research funds to an organisation such as that? Incidentally, that organisation has used our funds to mount criticism of a select committee of this chamber, namely the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation. I do not mind organisations or groups criticising the work of this Senate at all-that is democracy-but I ask every member of the Senate: is it an appropriate use or a misuse of medical research funds for this enormous amount of money to go to this group of utilitarian philosophers for the purpose of developing an ethic, as it were, for human embryo experimentation and to use part of that for the purposes of mounting a campaign against the work of a Senate select committee?</PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious question indeed. I am concerned that a system of gene screening is being designed and developed in Australia, not for the purpose of curing disorders but for the purpose of eliminating the bearers. Involved in this is taxpayers' money, about which we should be most concerned. Sooner or later it will blow up, and blow up in the face of the Government and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), unless a serious look is taken at what moneys are going to where and for what purpose. If ever we get to the stage of developing such a system and that system depends on a concept of some lives being unworthy while others are entitled to exist, then we are going down the track of Nazi doctors such as Lebensunwertes Leben. </PARA>

<PARA>The Affirmative Action Agency Annual Report 1989-90 deals essentially with two groups of employers. Although the report was tabled only yesterday, there has already been quite a bit of attention given to the private sector and the degree to which employers generally have or have not complied with the requirements of the Affirmative Action Act. Rather than go into detail, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard three pages from the report which, in effect, describe the reporting procedure and list the defaulters. </PARA>

<PARA> Employers may report on a subsidiary or business unit basis, or with a report covering some or all subsidiaries in the group. That is why the number of reporting units is lower than the total number of companies covered by the Act, as shown in Table 2.1. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 2334 reports received in 1990 only 49 per cent were lodged within the statutory period, between 1 February and 30 April. This is slightly up on last year, when only 46 per cent of employers reported on time. While Band 1 and 2 employers were, generally, more timely, only 44 per cent of Band 3 employers lodged reports within the statutory period. This causes the Agency difficulties in managing the workload associated with monitoring reporting compliance and meeting its requirements to report to Parliament by 30 November each year. Means of improving employers' compliance with dates for final lodgement will be explored in 1990-91. (Details of the reports are in Section 2.3: Compliance with the Eight Steps, pages 20-42). </PARA>
<PARA>APPLICATION OF THE SANCTION</PARA>
<PARA>Employers who fail to comply with the legislation face being named in a report to the Minister for Industrial Relations for tabling in Parliament (section 19 (1) of the Act). The decision to name an employer is not taken lightly and every effort was made to ensure employers were aware of their obligations under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agency sent reminder cards in early May 1990, to those private sector companies which had not reported. Between early June and mid August, the Director of Affirmative Action sent a letter to 808 employers, 55 from Band 1, 47 from Band 2 and 706 from Band 3, who had still not lodged a report. This letter informed companies of the Director's intention to name them if their report was not forthcoming. This letter was sent in accordance with section 19 (2) of the Act, which requires the Director to give a relevant employer at least 28 days notice in writing of an intention to name. A significant number of these Band 1 and 2 companies had received a similar letter last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In September and October, Agency staff personally contacted each company which had not yet lodged a report. This included 249 companies and of these:</PARA>
<PARA> 87 subsequently provided a report which was accepted by the Director as meeting the requirements of the Act</PARA>
<PARA> 70 demonstrated that their employee numbers were not in excess of 100, and were therefore not required to report in 1990</PARA>
<PARA> 5 subsequently provided sufficient information as to cause the Director to exercise her discretion not to name</PARA>
<PARA> in the case of 12 companies, the Director was not satisfied that the correct relevant employer had been identified, and she exercised her discretion not to name these companies, pending further investigation of their corporate relationships, and</PARA>
<PARA> 75 have not met the Act's requirements and have not indicated to the Director a reasonable excuse under section 19 of the Act. These companies are:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The companies which have not reported are given every opportunity of doing so. That is why I thought it only fair that this information should be included in the record. Of course, the Agency has considerable difficulty in managing the workload when, as happened in 1990, only 49 per cent of the reports were lodged within the statutory period between 1 February and 30 April. The perseverance of the Agency resulted in a considerable number more actually reporting, but reporting late. As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) observed in his answer at Question Time today, the higher education sector, which is the other large sector covered by the Act and which consists of 70 tertiary institutions, reported-in fact, every one of the institutions reported-but only one-third of those reports were lodged within the statutory reporting period. Since this was the third year in which these institutions have been covered by the Act, the Agency expected a higher standard than that of previous years and the criteria for assessing compliance reflected this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The analysis in the report from which I will quote briefly reports compliance with the requirements of the legislation in the third year of coverage. It is very obvious, in talking to those who have close association with the higher education sector, that far too many administrations are failing to give a thorough commitment to affirmative action and not providing either social justice to women employees, or a proper example to the private sector. There are eight steps described in the report which are detailed as those which constitute the implementation of affirmative action. </PARA>
<PARA> The first one goes to the issue of a policy statement. Only 33 of the higher education institutions have issued policy statements, having been given three years, I remind the Senate, in which to do so; 27 partly complied with that requirement; and 10 complied not at all. The second step requires the `Appointment of an Affirmative Action Coordinator' and is also a process by which the head of an institution is informed, and a proper representative structure is in place. All of the institutions managed to comply with that step, the only one with which they all complied. `Consultation with Trade Unions', the third step, did not get a particularly good score because only 53 of the institutions complied, three partly complied and 14 did not comply at all. It goes on. In step 4, `Consultation with Employees', 48 complied, 17 partly complied and five did not comply at all. The fifth step, `Establishment and Analysis of an Employment Profile', had only 52 institutions complying, 7 partly complying and 11 not complying at all. Sixty-five of the institutions complied with step 6, which requires a review of personnel policies and practices; four partly complied and one did not comply at all. Step 7, which deals with setting objectives, has only half of the institutions complying and step 8, `Monitoring and Evaluating the Program', once again, sees only half of the institutions complying. </PARA>
<PARA> This certainly is not good enough. We look to our higher education institutions to provide a far better example to private enterprise and to the community as a whole. They should be taking the lead in order to not merely score well in a report of this nature but, as I said before, to ensure that the employees of these institutions are getting the benefit of the policies of this Government which are designed to achieve equal opportunity through affirmative action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think possibly both, and that is one of the significant points to which I wish to refer. Can I say, firstly, that I am not in any way criticising the manner in which Senator Watson has sought to resolve this problem, but it raises one of the several interesting dilemmas which he and I have debated in this chamber before relating to issues concerned with certainty, simplicity and discretions. Sometimes honourable senators opposite and sometimes groups interested in tax law-professional bodies like accountants, lawyers and companies-come pressing the Government and saying, `There are too many Commissioner's discretions in the legislation. We want the number of discretions reduced-we want to take these out'. One of the principal reasons for that is that we may have greater certainty so that people may have-</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson has to wait until I finish the argument. If he misunderstands it so far, I shall make it clearer. We also find people coming to us saying that one of the principal reasons for wanting to take these discretions out of the legislation is so that there may be greater certainty. Particularly in this environment, where we are moving towards self-assessment, people have to know what is going to apply to them. They have to know the law as it is going to apply to them and, therefore, discretions where the Commissioner `may' interpret this way and `may' interpret that way make it harder for an individual taxpayer to be certain of his or her responsibilities in this matter. Therefore, it undermines the certainty and the ease with which one can comply with one's tax obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also find people coming to talk about complexity. They say, `We want a simpler tax law'. But then we find, as each problem comes along, that they want another amendment to the Act. However worthwhile each of them may be, the net effect of those several amendments is to make the Act increasingly more complex. </PARA>
<PARA> I preface my comments by saying this is not a criticism of the attempt to resolve this matter by way of discretion, by way of this extra complexity, by way of this reduction of certainty, because, as Senator Watson tried to imply by interjection, obviously there are many discretions already in the Act that deal with questions of uncertainty, et cetera. The point I was trying to make is that it highlights the dilemmas we face. It is very easy to wave one's arms generally and say that there are too many discretions and that we need certainty and simplicity, but when it comes to dealing with individual problems in the taxation legislation it is not so easy to meet each of those requirements. When the other requirements of equity and neutrality are added, suddenly we find that trade-offs are involved. Sometimes, to achieve equity there needs to be a trade-off for certainty; sometimes complexity is required; and sometimes a discretion is required to be the balancing item in that equation. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to put on the record on this occasion, when the Opposition has raised a proposal to deal with a problem which could be criticised on the grounds of adding a discretion, on the grounds that it adds complexity-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say that in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. The proposal could be criticised on the grounds that it reduces certainty, but the Opposition found, when it came to dealing with the particular problem with which it was concerned, that that was the only mechanism open to it. I make that point to indicate that it is not surprising that in other circumstances, as they arise, that is the solution that governments have turned to over the years to deal with the question concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we turn to this particular matter as it relates to substantiation and to the Evangelist case, in particular, with which Senator Watson's Bill is concerned, we need to deal, firstly, with some of the background to the introduction of the substantiation provisions, because we cannot deal with a proposal to amend the way the substantiation provisions operate and the strict manner in which the substantiation requirements need to be complied with without giving consideration to why they have developed in the way they have, why they were initiated, and why they were initiated in the form in which we now find them. </PARA>
<PARA> In the lead-up to the 1985 White Paper and the legislative amendments which followed from it, amongst the many and varied forms of tax avoidance-and, in this instance, very often tax evasion-problems arose from the claims for expenses which could not be properly substantiated, in the contemporary jargon. We found that people were chancing their arms significantly in submitting their returns. We found that there was a lack of what would now be called proper substantiation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was broadly agreed that, if we were to go into the process of broadening the income tax base and not only introducing fairness but making that fairness more apparent, what we needed to do, amongst a whole range of other changes, was to introduce strict substantiation requirements so that each Australian would know that every other Australian had to substantiate such claims as they might be able to make or as they might seek to make, or that they would not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that I want to respond to this particular attempt. I understand that Senator Watson is trying to put in the discretion in a manner which says that, in the main, there will continue to be strict requirements, but the Commissioner has the capacity to vary. I understand the attempt but, in our view, the attempt is not going to achieve-or has the danger of failing to achieve-the purpose of striking that right balance between the rigorous application of the substantiation requirements and the flexibility that he seeks to bring into the legislation through this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, until now, given some consideration to the possible harshness of the measures in the Act as it relates to substantiation and as thrown up by this example, and there are already some reasonableness elements built into the legislation, as Senator Watson would know, but the exceptions to the rules are very deliberately limited so as not to open up avenues for abuse. The Government has, as I said, been looking at possible measures to try to deal with any harshness that might arise and strike the balance between the proper application--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Government is looking to strike the balance between the proper application of some lessening of potential problems without jeopardising the fairness and the revenue. It is not an unusual balance for us to have to strike. Generally, though, we have created the situation where taxpayers in Australia are aware that the rules are strict. I believe that it is important that they know that the rules will continue to be strict, or they will lose their effectiveness. As we continue to move towards self-assessment, it is going to be more important that individuals are aware of what the criteria are and how they will be applied. The Tax Office cannot, will not and should not be in a position to check each return to see whether the discretion proposed ought to be exercised, so we start to issue an invitation: `Here is an opportunity. You might get away with it'.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it might be close enough, so I will have a go. I think the Commissioner may exercise his or her discretion on my behalf in this matter'. That option is not open to people at the moment, and we do not want to encourage that sort of recklessness and overenthusiasm in taking the punt on what might be close enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I say that, as Senator Watson and some other members of the Opposition would know, the Government has been trying very hard to proceed with its consideration of possible changes to the tax legislation-even some administrative matters, but in this instance they are legislative changes-with as broad a consensus as possible among the general community and interested participants in the tax community. There was broad consensus at the National Taxation Liaison Group, at which this matter was discussed with the representatives of, for example, tax, accounting and legal bodies, that it was not appropriate to amend the law. When we had that discussion with them, their view was that it was not appropriate to amend the law, and that is a view that at this stage the Government shares -particularly with the knowledge that the Evangelist case is the only one of its type which has until now reached the tribunals or the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The law is strict, and it is our view that at least at the moment it needs to remain strict-though, like all laws, it needs to be applied with commonsense, and in the main it is. Obviously record keeping imposes a burden on taxpayers. That is part of the whole discussion about compliance costs. But we have to strike the balance between reasonableness of burden and the requirement that the taxation system be and be perceived to be fair for all. The whole thrust of modern tax administration, not just in Australia, is encouraging voluntary compliance, encouraging people voluntarily to meet their proper obligations. And, overwhelmingly, Australians do. </PARA>
<PARA> But one of the several factors that research indicates are the most influential in increasing the percentage by which taxpayers in any community will comply voluntarily with their requirements is the perception that the tax burden is fairly distributed. There are other factors, and I have discussed them on other occasions here in the Senate and in other places. But the one that is and must logically be important, and the one which is very sensitive in Australia because of the history of the 1960s and particularly the 1970s and early 1980s, is the perception that the tax system is fair for all, that if you are paying your fair share the person standing next to you is likely to be paying his or her fair share and that there are not loopholes through which buses can be driven. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, having said that we are concerned about loosening the strictness of the substantiation rules and requirements because it might encourage people to take a punt, to go back to the near enough is good enough system, and might, as the anecdotal evidence spreads, as it always does, undermine that confidence that is the underpinning of voluntary compliance, I do have to say that the Government is not unaware that we need to look at substantiation, not just because of this particular case but broadly because this case has brought to a head not a shortcoming that we were not aware of-we have all known that these sorts of situations existed-but the fact that there may be some burdens on taxpayers in substantiation that are broader than can reasonably be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other possibilities under consideration. The current view of the Government-and I think it is the absolutely correct one, on the balance of evidence-is that the Opposition's discretion measure is not the appropriate answer, certainly not as a one-off exercise like this. It may address the immediate Evangelist case, but it does not go to all the questions that may arise as to the appropriate role of substantiation in the overall scheme of the legislation, the broader issues relating to substantiation rules, and it may be that when we look at those this discretion is entirely inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an easy matter. It is not a question of simply rejecting this proposal because the Opposition thought of it. It is not the first time that this idea has been considered by the Government. Not this particular proposal but proposals to respond to this issue have been considered by the National Taxation Liaison Group. Of course, each individual would see this as one obvious mechanism that might be used, because the insertion of discretion into the Act is always a mechanism open to one to deal with circumstances such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's view is and will continue to be that this amendment is not the appropriate mechanism to deal with the problem that we have; that amending the law by way of a general application to deal with one case that has arisen is likely to create more problems than it resolves. Accordingly, it is the view of the Government that the Bill should not be passed, and therefore we will not be supporting it. I believe that the tax Act ought not be so amended at this stage, and for those reasons, as I say, the Government will not be supporting the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Watson for reading so diligently the Australian Democrats' alternative Budget document, because the last paragraph in that document sets out almost word for word the terms of his private member's Bill. I am glad that we have found an audience in so erudite and knowledgable a person in tax matters. I am therefore happy to say that as a matter of principle the Australian Democrats will support this private member's Bill put forward by Senator Watson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have some concerns about the specific conditions that he has set down. We feel that the discretion he has specified is too wide and too general, and we believe that taxpayers who have proved that they have a justified tax deduction should not be hindered by a technical breach in their procedure from getting the benefit of that deduction. I believe that is the intent of Senator Watson's private member's Bill; however, it is a little wide of the mark in its execution. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms that we would like to include in such a provision-and I will be moving an amendment to the tax legislation later in this session to that effect-are that the taxpayer must have proved and the Commissioner of Taxation must have satisfied himself that the taxpayer has in fact incurred that expense, and secondly that the expense would, apart from the operation of the particular subdivision, constitute an allowable deduction and the fault in the taxpayer's case is simply a technical one. These qualifications and requirements, I believe, are not set out in sufficient detail and with sufficient precision in Senator Watson's Bill, but we accept the principle that he is enunciating through his Bill and it is for that reason that we believe it should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the points raised by Senator McMullan, there certainly is a trade-off between equity and simplicity. We feel that rigorous simplicity and bureaucratic provisions can be taken too far when they do not take account of simple human errors which can be proved to be of a technical nature. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that ultimately the tax law to be respected by the community must contain an amount of flexibility which is given to the Commissioner at his or her discretion. As I said, that discretion should not be general and all-embracing. The terms I have outlined, which will be part of our amendment, protect revenue by specifying that the expense must have been incurred and it must also have been proven that deductibility is legally justified. In this situation the Commissioner would issue an income tax ruling specifying the circumstances under which he would be prepared to exercise the discretion to give the taxpayer some guidance. The spectre of floodgates being opened that Senator McMullan has raised is therefore not to be expected. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that little more needs to be said except that on these principles the Opposition supports the Bill and that I will submit our amendments to the Government in the next few days to negotiate an appropriate amendment to the taxation legislation before the Senate, which will meet the same objectives that Senator Watson attempts to meet but, I believe, more adequately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support the private member's Bill introduced into the Senate by Senator Watson. In doing so I would like publicly to commend him on the work he has put into this Bill and its background, as, I believe, does the coalition, which is fully supportive of the Bill. It has been through the shadow Cabinet and through the party room, and it has the full endorsement of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson has introduced a Bill that will not lessen the controls that are necessary-and that we on this side of the chamber fully accept are necessary-to the application and administration of the income tax law. However, at the same time, whilst preserving those disciplines, it introduces into the law a fairness and a basic commonsense in the administration of the law that it lacks at the moment in this area; namely, the enforcement of the substantiation requirements of the Act regarding the provision of written evidence of claims for expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend Senator Watson on his Income Tax Assessment (Substantiation Requirement) Amendment Bill. I also point out to the Senate that in the preparation of this private member's Bill Senator Watson consulted very widely indeed with interested parties and expert organisations in the wider community. He consulted with the Australian Society of Certified Practicing Accountants, the Australian Taxpayers Association, some of the major chartered accounting firms, the Taxation Institute of Australia and other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand from Senator Watson that he found agreement amongst all of those with whom he consulted that the existing arrangements are unfair and do require change, and that he had general support for the proposals he has introduced as interim measures pending a full and comprehensive review of the relevant areas of the taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has come into the Parliament with probably more consultation than much legislation introduced into this place by the Government of the day, whichever party be in government. For that reason, I believe that the Senate, and I hope the Parliament and in particular the Government, will have another look at this matter and treat it with the seriousness it obviously deserves. The new subsection to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 proposed by this Bill has the purpose of providing the Commissioner of Taxation with discretion to apply the substantiation provisions with, as I said earlier, fairness and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, as Senator McMullan has said, that the Bill introduces another discretion into the tax law. The Opposition certainly has difficulties as a general rule with giving the Taxation Commissioner discretions which are too wide. But there are occasions when equity, fairness and commonsense dictate that by far the lesser of the two evils is to give discretion. The Government of the day, regardless of which party is in power, has always seen the need on occasions to give certain discretion to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been very critical of this Government-I believe correctly-for extending the areas of discretion far too widely. However, here we have the situation where the Government, which has done that over the years, is opposing a proposal to give a modest increase in discretion to the Commissioner where it is quite patently obvious that this will add to the fairness in the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have talked about the Evangelist's case. Senator McMullan said this was not necessarily irrelevant to the present situation, but I do not understand that argument because the Evangelist's case really pointed out the absurdity of the present law without the discretion. When he handed down a decision in the Evangelist's case in favour of the Australian Taxation Office, Mr Peter Roach clearly demonstrated the absurdity of the position. I will not read all the decision, but what he said in that decision, among other things, was:</PARA>
<PARA> The substantiation provisions have been enacted in terms which emphasise form above substance and which tend to concentrate the attention of those required to enforce the rules on questions of form and to distract attention from the more basic question as to whether what is represented on the forms is true, in the sense of being both honestly stated and accurate. Under such circumstances it is likely that the only persons at risk of being disadvantaged by the `substantiation provisions' will be the honest. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Roach said when handing down his decision in the Evangelist's case. He went on to explain that in the context of the particular case he was dealing with as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the substantiation provisions may be to deny them deductions . . . </PARA>
<PARA> that is, the honest people -</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to which they would otherwise be entitled pursuant to sec. 51(1) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That, according to the Commissioner, is the result for this applicant. The reason, it is said, is simply that, despite having recorded all relevant details of travel in a logbook and despite having done so in his own handwriting and having been the only person to record information in that logbook, the applicant failed to sign each entry. As a result of that technicality, despite the fact that it was totally accepted that the entries were in his own handwriting and that his recording was honest and accurate, he was denied the legitimate taxation deduction to which he was entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often said that the law is an ass. The law is an ass if it is drafted and administered in such a nature that this sort of situation can arise. Senator Watson's proposed amendment in his private member's Bill would remove that problem. It would introduce a minor discretion on behalf of the Taxation Commissioner which would enable such a patently honest and accurate substantiation recording to be legitimately permitted. I think that Senator McMullan quite frankly overstated the position, and in fact I would say that he was wrong in saying that the discretion proposed in this Bill would provide a loophole. I do not think that is the case. The Act would be no less strictly administered than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, the bottom of line of which is fairness, equity and commonsense in the taxation system, I have the pleasure in strongly supporting Senator Watson's private member's Bill. I again commend him for bringing it to the Parliament. I am very pleased indeed to hear that the Australian Democrats will support the Bill. That does not help us much. It will get it through the Senate, and that is good, and it will get it into the House of Representatives but unless the Government is prepared to support it there, of course the Bill will not go through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope very much that the Government may have another look at this before it is debated in the House of Representatives. I would be interested to know, and perhaps Senator McMullan or one of the speakers from the Government might answer us before this debate is concluded as to whether the Caucus has considered this matter. If it has been taken to the Labor Party Caucus, I would be very surprised if it would have gone against this proposition because it is patently a fair and sensible one. I do hope that the Government will look at this again before it gets to the House of Representatives. I join Senator Watson in commending the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support my colleague Senator Watson in the presentation of his private member's Bill and, as my colleague Senator Short did, commend him on the extent of the work that he has put into it. Interestingly enough, when the amendments were first argued in 1985, Senator Watson forecast that the sort of problems which have now arisen would in fact arise. I think therefore he is to be commended on following through on his objection to the way the legislation was phrased in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was disappointing to hear Senator McMullan's contribution and reasons as to why the Government would not be supporting the Income Tax Assessment (Substantiation Requirements) Amendment Bill. It was disappointing from this point of view: that he was arguing that this solution to a problem would not be satisfactory, that it would be inappropriate. Yet the reality is that the present position is inappropriate. The present position has been outlined and adequately described by Mr Peter Roach in the Evangelists' case when he said that certainly there was need for change to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Taxation Commissioner has simply been to say that he will give assurances that such a situation will not arise again; it will not be repeated. He said that he will apply the substantiation provisions with commonsense. Surely that option was open to him previously, but that is not the point. If he is to do that, he could technically be himself in breach of what the law requires of him, and that is totally inappropriate and not to be condoned. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Watson has done is to bring before this chamber a simple and interim solution to what is an immediate problem. The immediate problem, as I have said, is that the law is presently inadequate to provide a just administration of the substantiation provisions. For the Commissioner to say that he will simply bend them a bit simply will not do. I think it was Senator McMullan who said that near enough is good enough to provide a solution will not do. I suggest that his refusing to accept Senator Watson's Bill is leaving it in a near enough is good enough situation. This is a solution for an immediate problem which can be an interim solution and can be perhaps better dealt with in a most detailed way which can only be done by those with the resources of Government and not those with the resources of Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly I would agree with Senator McMullan when he said that there was a need to have certainty and simplicity of the laws so that they may be adhered to, and that the use of discretions is to be avoided where possible. But he is not consistent in his argument because new legislation in the tax area brought before this Parliament continues to introduce new discretions. To say that he cannot accept this Bill because it is introducing a discretion is simply not adhering to his own argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is this: the present situation is unfair, unjust and inappropriate and it cannot be allowed to continue. His solution to allow the Commissioner to say that he will simply apply the law in a way which is not in the strict interpretation of the law will not do either. It is very pleasing to hear that the Australian Democrats will support this Bill of Senator Watson's which would allow an interim solution and which will give immediate relief to what is a very pressing problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some remarks about this Income Tax Assessment (Substantiation Requirements) Amendment Bill introduced by my colleague Senator Watson. The Bill does seek to make the substantiation requirements of the Income Tax Assessment Act fairer. Clearly since 30 June 1986 when the current substantiation provisions came into effect, there have been an enormous number of anomalies and cases where people have thought they were acting within the substantiation provisions and after audits were seen to be outside. There is the example of the Evangelists' case, which must have been mentioned a couple of dozen times here already this evening. That is a classic case where there is an honest young volunteer working for a church, filling in his logbook assiduously but because he forgot to sign or did not know he had to sign his pages or each entry in his logbook he was caught. This was clearly a very good case of where there is someone thinking he was acting within the law, but who was indeed acting outside of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McMullan suggested in his discussion that these substantiation provisions need to be maintained as strict and as tight, and that there needs to be no indication from the Parliament or in the legislation that there are loopholes being created. Indeed, in a memo that Senator McMullan sent around to members and senators back on 9 October 1990 he puts it quite succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a necessity that substantiation rules are fairly strict. They would not serve their purpose if taxpayers thought they could ignore them or treat them in a cavalier manner. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan is quite right, and it is important for the Senate to understand that Senator Watson's Bill before us today in no way waters down the substantiation requirements. He does not affect them at all. All he does is allow a little bit of fairness to be injected into them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, as Senator McMullan said, that people are aware of the substantiation requirements. I put it to Senator McMullan-and I ask other senators and indeed members of the Australian Labor Party to think about this when they come to consider this further before it goes to the House of Representatives-that if members of parliament and senators do not know what the substantiation requirements are, then how can we possibly expect people out in the broader community to understand? One of the things that brought this issue to a head was a seminar held by Senator Watson a few weeks ago to inform members of parliament of the substantiation requirements. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were all quite terrorised. Senator McMullan's memorandum of 9 October highlights the fact that neither members of parliament nor senators, who should know the law better than anyone else, understand those requirements. How do poor people such as Mr Evangelist have any chance? We are seeking not to weaken the substantiation requirements but to ensure that, in cases where people are trying to abide by the law, to fill in their tax returns properly and to claim what is a deductible item, they can do so in the full knowledge that if they comply with the requirements they will be within the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we have self-assessment, as we have at the moment, people are required to keep receipts and substantiation documents for five years. The point I have highlighted is that, if many people in the community do not know what the substantiation requirements are-and we have already proved that many members of parliament do not know what they are-and there is an audit at any time in people's taxpaying lives and they do not have the correct substantiation documents, they will be required to repay the tax and to pay penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where it hurts. This is where some discretion needs to be given to the Commissioner of Taxation to look after those cases. Otherwise, as the years go by, as selfassessment rolls along and as substantiation stays as it is now, there will be thousands and thousands of cases like Mr Evangelist's, and the Taxation Commissioner's job and the cost of collecting tax will get more expensive. The efficiency of collecting tax and the efficiency of the revenue will get smaller and smaller. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the principles of taxation must be that it needs to be fair, but it also needs to be efficiently collected and inexpensively collected. It will not be inexpensive if we have all these cases and all these people such as Mr Evangelist and thousands of others like him-including senators and members of parliament-who need to appeal to the Tax Commissioner. I plead with honourable senators opposite and their colleagues in the other place to have a closer look at the solution to the problem that Senator Watson has proposed with this Bill. I repeat that I am glad to see that the Australian Democrats are supporting us in this proposal. Clearly, its success lies with the Australian Labor Party opposite and their colleagues in the other place. I have pleasure in supporting this move by Senator Watson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stop to acknowledge that interjection from the Minister, once again to dramatise the cheap and tawdry nature of his contributions to this chamber. This Bankcard statement, which has been paid, is not acceptable by this incompetent Government and this extraordinarily reactionary Tax Commissioner as an appropriate receipt for tax purposes. Let me read what is written on it. The statement has a date. It also has a date relating to the transaction. One particular transaction on this statement reads: 031090 RTA Queanbeyan-that is, Roads and Traffic Authority at Queanbeyan. It shows the amount for that transaction is $546.45. It meets all the requirements of the taxation Act with the exception that it does not outline the nature of the goods or services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask: what sorts of goods and services will I buy at the Roads and Traffic Authority if it is not my registration? I am driving a car that is registered. If the Commissioner has any doubts, he can check. It is incredible that under the law this receipt fails only on the basis that it does not say that at the New South Wales State Government Roads and Traffic Authority Office I got a registration certificate which I can produce if the Taxation Commissioner wants to see it. It is not a receipt, though, for tax purposes but it was used to pay for a registration certificate. The Bankcard statement is the receipt for my registration expenses but, were I to present this as evidence of an expenditure for tax purposes, it would be rejected and, even more serious, I face the potential of a penalty for having not provided adequate substantiation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the appalling element, the disgraceful feature, of what is happening at the moment. This Government is doing nothing about it. It will not allow Senator Watson's amendment, which would resolve a situation to give the Commissioner discretion to acknowledge and accept that this clearly is the sort of proper and relevant substantiation that surely is all that is needed. Let us recognise this: stamped on the bottom of the Bankcard statement, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Many local authorities accept credit cards for payment of rates, electricity, telephone and water. No need to write a cheque or pay cash. Payment by credit card is safe and easy. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be safe and easy but it is not evidence of a tax deduction. If a proportion of people's telephone bills is to go towards the earning of income, paying by credit card in this form is unacceptable; not only that, but people run the risk of being fined for claiming that expenditure. This is the ludicrous situation that we discovered when we went to the seminar that Senator Watson organised. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I want to see a discretion there formally-although I generally oppose discretions-for one specific reason: I want to make certain that the discretion is there so that a failure by the Commissioner to exercise it would entitle people who were refused that discretion to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Unless that discretion is there, that right is not available to taxpayers. This is a terribly serious situation. It appals me that this Government simply does not recognise it. </PARA>

I was pointing out that even when it is clear and unequivocal what the bill is for, and it is evident that it is a receipt and the account has been paid, this is not allowable as substantiation. This is absurd. The problem we have is this: as I understand it, the Commissioner of Taxation has indicated that he will apply commonsense. This is the point that Senator McMullan made generally when he said that it is not appropriate to correct what is clearly unacceptable in the way that Senator Watson wants to correct it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McMullan, as I understand what he said, did not, however, present any coherent or proper alternative to provide a resolution to this problem. It is totally inadequate for the Commissioner to say that he will exercise commonsense in applying the law. In other words he will ignore, where it is relevant in his mind, what the law says. The reason it is improper and intolerable to accept that comment from the Commissioner is that if he fails to exercise commonsense, if he refuses to act like a reasonable being, there is no recourse by the person being taxed, the person being unfairly treated, the person even being fined. This is intolerable. If, however, there were a discretion and the Commissioner, as Senator Watson seeks to introduce, refused to exercise his discretion in favour of the taxpayer, and it was unreasonable of the Commissioner not to exercise his discretion, the taxpayer would have recourse. That is the essential difference that I am certain Senator McMullan did not realise when he said that Senator Watson's procedure was not the appropriate procedure to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> Until Senator McMullan can demonstrate to this chamber that there is to be some requirement on the Commissioner to behave according to commonsense-which the Commissioner says he intends to do-in all cases, not simply those that might suit him, with the constraint imposed upon him that a failure to do so could lead to the taxpayer seeking redress, Senator McMullan is not only in a weak position, he is also defending the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that my past experience with constituents-both when I was in the House of Representatives and now in the Senate-is laced with examples where those constituents feel they have been effectively blackmailed by the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.

The Government's preparedness to accept that response gives every indication of a government that is tired and, frankly, lacking in direction and competence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not going to draw too many parallels between my experience in 1982 and Senator McMullan's in 1990 but I too used to receive lots of advice as to why our lack of preparedness to accept what the Commissioner was putting up would, in the Commissioner's view, lead to disaster, the end of the world as we know it and a collapse of all things true and beautiful. Mostly, that advice tended to be bunkum. I can remember, for example, not finding much merit in a proposition coming from this quarter that there should be a reverse onus of proof on a criminal matter. In this society, one is innocent until proven guilty. I must admit that it left quite an impact on me that any section of the bureaucracy in Australia should have recommended that people, on a criminal matter, should in fact have to prove their innocence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not telling tales out of school; it is well known that that was the sort of advice that was coming to the previous Government. It has increased my concerns about much of the advice that tends to come from people in the bureaucracy who are, quite properly, deeply committed to their task in life-in this case to collect the revenue and prevent crooks from cheating on the revenue. Apparently, it can often lead one to a view that is inappropriate and to giving advice which is just plain wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, the advice is wrong, the Government's response is wrong and it is appalling that the rights of taxpayers to require the Commissioner to apply commonsense-that is basically what we are asking for-to have a discretion and to exercise it unless there is good reason not to are being denied. That requirement of ours is the difference between our position and the position that Senator McMullan is endeavouring-in logical terms unsuccessfully so far and I doubt that he will be successful in numerical terms either, at least in this chamber-to defend. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall briefly deal with what the Act actually requires in the form of a receipt. As Senator McMullan has said in a letter to all members and senators, Income Tax Ruling IT2482:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . makes it clear that a documentary evidence is defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act as `a receipt, invoice, or similar document-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the phrase `similar document' because that has a significant relevance which I shall come back to-</PARA>
<PARA>obtained by or on behalf of the taxpayer at the time the expense was incurred or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter-that contains the following information:</PARA>
<PARA>The date the expense was incurred:</PARA>
<PARA>The name of the person who supplied the relevant goods or services, or if supplied by a person conducting a business, the name of that person or the business name of that business;</PARA>
<PARA>The amount of the expense;</PARA>
<PARA>The nature of goods or services; and</PARA>
<PARA>The date of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In the good old days when one went round and exchanged mountains of paper instead of paying things by Bankcard, that had a relevance. It no longer has relevance today. Every one of those requirements is met by my Bankcard bill, except as to the nature of goods or services-which in most cases is self-evident. If it is not self-evident, surely then the Commissioner could require the provision of some additional information. But it is a nonsense now that it breaches the law for the Commissioner to accept a Bankcard statement as evidence of substantiation when, for example, it is clear, self-evident and uncomplicated as to what it was about. I use the example of my New South Wales State government registration form, which appears on my Bankcard statement as `RTA'. It says everything; it meets all these requirements, except as to the nature of the goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to resolve this problem simply. We want to say that a Bankcard statement, for example, is, using commonsense, in most instances a similar document. But we want to say that that application of commonsense must not result in a situation where the Commissioner can use his `commonsense' in instance A and not use it in instance B, yet in instance B that taxpayer will have no recourse whatever. It gives Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners a totally unreasonable power over taxpayers in that, if the Commissioner wishes to use that capacity to exercise his discretion as a weapon or a lever over some other taxpayer, I believe that there is a risk that that will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson's proposal is fair, proper, reasonable and deserving of support. It deserves support because it will ensure that there is a uniform approach across Australia, because it requires the exercise of a discretion, and because it gives the taxpayer redress if for some non-commonsense reason that discretion is not exercised. I support Senator Watson's proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to thank all those honourable senators who have participated in this debate tonight, in particular the Liberal and Australian Democrats senators who have supported the Income Tax Assessment (Substantiation Requirements) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my second reading speech I acknowledged that the concept of discretions did not fit easily with this new era of self-assessment. Senator McMullan picked up this theme and used it as his prime reason for the Government's rejection of the substantiation amendment. There must have been perhaps not a lack of charity but a tongue in cheek approach, since Senator McMullan then proceeded with a great deal of enthusiasm with his argument. As he did so he reminded me of a great Tasmanian Senator in this place, Sir Reginald Wright, a man who would have no tolerance whatsoever of the idea of any discretions. I remind the Senate that with the evolution of income tax history such an approach was lost many years ago. Let me quote a sentence from Peter Roach, who presided over the churchworker Evangelist's case on this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This issue is no longer open for review. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the argument for discretions or no discretions was no longer open for review in a practical sense. Given the hundreds of discretions that this Government has introduced, I find that the Government's argument is one of convenience rather than a genuine attempt to rectify the situation. I believe that the enthusiasm of the draftsmen has imposed such strict obligations as to be completely unreasonable given the developments in technology for document presentation and annotation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to pick up a comment by Peter Roach, a senior former member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in the important case to which I referred. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can only conclude by expressing my regret as a result of my disappointment that the Parliament has not found it possible to provide a more appropriate set of requirements as to substantiation of claims honestly made and a more just procedure for mounting a reasonable challenge to a decision of the Commissioner on a matter of substantial importance to a very large number of citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>We have given this opportunity to the Parliament. I regret that this Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government has not responded in any way to the window of opportunity that it has been given on this occasion. I am not telling tales out of school when I say that a great number of members of the ALP are wishing me good luck and godspeed with this amendment. I only regret that this matter was not placed before the Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the hundreds of discretions and given the discretions that will be debated next week in that voluminous set of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill, I must say that there is a lack of genuineness in the line of argument that was used tonight. It was an argument of convenience rather than an argument leading to the heart of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always difficult at times to justify stands that others take, and I acknowledge the role that Senator McMullan has played. This is not a personal criticism. He has to put the point of view of the Government of the day, and on this occasion the Government has failed to respond to the opportunity given. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the argument about a rush of appeals in relation to this matter if this Bill passes, let me say that there will certainly be no rush to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because of the substantial amount of money that a taxpayer now must put up front when lodging appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Spindler for his thoughtful contribution in helping to pass the amendment before the Senate tonight. He has suggested that he will be proceeding with a future amendment in relation to another Act, but I submit that, with this substantiation amendment in place, I do not believe that it will be necessary for him to proceed with that amendment. The Commissioner of Taxation now has the opportunity to put in place a set of income tax rulings to provide the framework under which he will exercise that discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> Without my amendment he was unable to proceed. We have now given that opportunity and I trust that the Tax Commissioner will move speedily in this area to provide a new income tax ruling to provide some flesh to the approach that I have used. </PARA>
<PARA> May I use this occasion to signal a further private member's Bill which will be called a technical corrections Bill. This will be a device to overcome a further problem that taxpayers find with income tax law-the problem of unintended consequences. This is a device that is used with great success in the United States parliament whereby annually a technical corrections Bill picks up the unintended consequences in situations where there is acknowledged complex legislation and, as a result of the interactions of one section with another, unfortunately unintended consequences are created because of the enthusiasm of the draftsman or the Taxation Office and the inability of parliament, through a lack of resources, to foresee those particular problems.</PARA>
<PARA> I will summarise the problems that this Bill intends to overcome. The Bill overcomes situations so the Taxation Office can be satisfied with the genuineness and accuracy of the claim and so that deductions will not be disallowed in a purely technical and unreasonable manner. I believe that my Bill will provide the Commissioner with a discretion where he-not the taxpayer-is satisfied that the expenses have been incurred legitimately and that the compliance requirements have, for all intents and purposes, been met. We do not intend to diminish the thrust of the substantiation requirements. We intend to give the taxpayers and the Commissioner a better life, because I believe that this sort of legislation does not put the integrity of tax laws on a particularly high plane. I believe this is an attempt to overcome that dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. </PARA>

<PARA>In addressing this motion before the chamber, sadly I find myself having to read it because I do not believe the summary-if I can call it that-in the Notice Paper reflects the motion on two counts. The notice of motion that I sought to move, on the matter of soil conservation funding, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) acknowledges the contribution of the Fraser Government in funding to the States through the Commonwealth Extension Services Grants for soil conservation initiatives was in 1975-76, $616,120; 1976-77, $711,016; 1977-78, $652,676; 1978-79, $396,613; 1979-80, $198,096; 1980-81, $159,412; and in 1981-82 $3m for soil conservation initiatives was included in the funds allocated to the States under general revenue assistance grants following a review of Commonwealth functions;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that, but I wish to point out to the Senate that it misrepresented the position both in terms of my motion and what I had said with regard to Senator Cook's statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with some regret that I have to bring this matter before the chamber. The issue of soil conservation funding is of great importance. One of the most crucial challenges facing us in the period ahead is the adoption of an accurate bipartisan position on soil conservation funding. I acknowledge what Senator Cook said when he made that point. Both at the State and Federal levels-prior to becoming a senator-I have enjoyed a very good working relationship with both Liberal-National Party governments and the Australian Labor Party in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> When considering this motion tonight we are not talking about who did what or what happened; we are talking about whether or not the propositions that were put before us in a speech and in an answer to a question were accurate. I submit that they were not. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the Senate through a number of aspects relating to that. To emphasise the points I want to make tonight I also acknowledge the funding contributions to soil conservation made by the Fraser Government, the Whitlam Government and the Hawke Government and some of the initiatives that have been put into effect. That is very important if we are to have a bipartisan approach to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84 the Hawke Government contributed $1m to soil conservation funding; in 1984-85, $4m; in 1985-86, $4.652m; in 1986-87, $5.5m; in 1987-88, $6m; in 1988-89, $10.634m; and in 1989-90, $23.227m. I will not give details of the following year but there are certain projections. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out-and I think I have made this point about soil conservation and the land care program in this chamber before-that the first soil conservation district was in the Kimberley area of Western Australia. The next one was in the Rocky Valley area-again in Western Australia. The next one was in the Yilgarn area, which happens to be where Senator Panizza lives. These came about as a result of amendments to the Soil Conservation Act which were put in place in 1982 by the Court Government. The Minister responsible for that was Mr Dick Old. That was followed through by the Burke Government, under the auspices of Julian Grill. Out of that came our conservation district committee structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already talked about the contributions made by the Fraser Government but I would like to make a couple of points about them. The source of the figures contained in my motion is an answer to a question from the now Governor-General, Mr Bill Hayden by Mr Peter Nixon. The $3m, which was contributed to soil conservation funding and which today equates to $5,597,283, was granted to the States under the allocation of general revenue assistance grants. This was earmarked for soil conservation measures following a review of Commonwealth functions. But much to my regret, the only States that spent that money on what it was intended for, were South Australia, which had a Liberal government, Western Australia, which had a Liberal-Country Party government, and Queensland, which had a National-Liberal Party government. Victoria, which had a Liberal Party government, did not meet its obligations, nor did New South Wales and Tasmania, which both had Labor governments at that time. I do not agree with the decision made at that time, but the fact is that in 1981-82 $3m was put aside for soil conservation funding. These facts absolutely disprove Senator Maguire's comments and the follow-up statement of Senator Cook. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be useful if I were to relate other aspects about soil conservation funding. I find surprising the comments of those opposite who chose to denigrate the previous Labor Government because, on 27 November 1974, in its last years, the Whitlam Government provided, as grants to the States, some $500,000 to June 1975 and another $2 1/2m to June 1976 under the Soil Conservation Act. That is further proof that the statements made by Senator Maguire and Senator Cook are inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a book written by J. R. Bradsen, from the Faculty of Law, University of Adelaide, which was compiled in 1988. That is a very good summary of soil conservation and how it has developed since Federation with particular reference to the period since the 1930s. It draws on some interesting facts and data, which I will go into. The other book I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate and which is important is a report prepared by the Research Directorate of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. It is a basis for soil conservation policy in Australia. Once again, that book contains a very good record of what has occurred. I certainly recommend both those publications to anybody who is interested in the history of soil conservation and land care in this country, particularly those people who wish to make factual comments on this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I will highlight some aspects of this book by Mr Bradsen. The first part-I will not read it because time is short and the hour is late-spells out very clearly the problems the Commonwealth has with the Commonwealth and State powers involved in soil conservation and land care. The States' attitude to land care and soil conservation is much more finely tuned and much more cooperative now than what it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago. In fact, States' rights is fast ceasing to be an issue when it comes to the land care program. In 1988 Mr Bradsen, in his book, said:</PARA>
<PARA>At times the history reads like a monumental exercise in delay. Indeed, there can be no single issue recognised for so long as of such national importance about which the Commonwealth has done so little. </PARA>
<PARA>The challenge that has been put before the Government highlights that point. Despite the increased funding during the last years of the Whitlam Government through to the Fraser Government and the increased funding under the Hawke Government, the land care program, in terms of the assessments that have been made, is still grossly under funded. </PARA>
<PARA> The first real interest in soil degradation and the problems of land care shown at the Commonwealth level was taken in the 1930s. I draw the attention of the Senate to page 109 of this book. It states that the first meeting held between the Commonwealth and the States was in 1936. A report from that agricultural subcommittee development was presented to this Senate, following a meeting between the Ministers and the Government at that time, by Senator A. J. McLachlan, who was the great uncle of Ian McLachlan, who is now the honourable member for Barker and who sits in the other place. That is the evidence of the earliest meeting that I can find. I am not saying that it is absolute. It is rather difficult to track these things down. There are some other interesting remarks in this book made by members on both sides of the chamber. In 1937 Mr Scullin stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It will be nothing short of a crime if we continue to permit the destruction of forests and the erosion of the soil. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, in 1945 Mr Lemmon, who was an Australian Labor Party member for the Western Australian electorate of Forrest said:</PARA>
<PARA>Soil erosion is much more dangerous to the future of Australia than are the bombs falling on Berlin to the future of Germany. . . We should set up a Commonwealth Commission . . . to tackle soil erosion on a national basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I recommend that Senator Maguire go through the history of this matter as it would help him understand the issue far better than he obviously did the other day. It points out a number of things said by a number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other aspects that I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate tonight. Unfortunately, the hour is late, so I will not go through all of the things that I had outlined to speak about. In terms of the national soil conservation program that is in place now, what has occurred in the past and whether Federal governments of all colours have done enough is not the point of what we are talking about. I can see little benefit in point scoring as far as this particular exercise is concerned. The issue is too important. It is important in a number of ways. I believe one of the most important pieces of heritage that we have to hand on to future generations is the soil, preservation of it and other aspects of conservation that go along with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most dismayed when I heard the comments that were made the other day in the Senate, because they were not consistent with what has been occurring in soil conservation in the recent past and even beyond the recent past. Despite the claims that are made in a political context, for a long time an effort has been made to have a bipartisan approach to this aspect of policy development. It is worth noting-and one could go on quoting from this little book-that gradually over the last 15, 16 or 17 years there has been more emphasis placed on this and it has become more important in the political agenda. I would hope that into the future, regardless of who occupies the government benches in the House of Representatives or in this place, increased emphasis continues to be placed on its importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to summarise what I have had to say-and I have cut my speech short, because I know that other senators here tonight wish to speak on this issue. My motion concerns the fact that what Senator Maguire had to say was not correct. I regret that he had not done the research required to be factual but I think it is equally important or more important that Senator Cook, as a Minister, when asked a question that was obviously given to him with some notice-he read a prepared answer-should have been able to do better in putting the matter into its true perspective. I can only be particularly critical of Senator Cook because I think that one of the responsibilities of Ministers in this place when they are asked dorothy dix questions is to get it right. In this particular case I think the evidence is overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA> The first evidence of support by the Commonwealth for the States in the terms of assistance for soil conservation funding occurred around 1946 or 1947, when the first subcommittees on soil conservation expenditure were put together and the Commonwealth provided the secretariat service. In the years from 1948 to 1960 grants were made to the States from the Commonwealth in terms of putting soil conservation issues and measurements in place. I am not making a judgment as to whether those were adequate. In fact, I have already made that judgment; I do not believe they were adequate. But that is not what we are talking about in this place tonight. We are talking about whether the statement by Senator Maguire was accurate, and I submit that it was not because there was significant Federal funding provided for soil conservation. I also submit that during the term of the Fraser Government and in subsequent years there was in fact something in excess of $10m in dollar values at that time spent on soil conservation. If we transmit that figure into today's dollars, it is a figure of $20m or more. I would suggest that that is conclusive proof of the fact that these particular statements were not accurate, and I call upon those gentlemen to correct the record. </PARA>

<PARA> In fact, he has selectively quoted me in his motion, and he in fact ignores my first statement on the question of soil conservation, which is reported on page 296 of the Hansard of 11 October. He chose a quote which suited his argument. I said that the first ever program at the national level for soil conservation had been brought in under this Government. The key word is `program', and Senator Crane ignored the fact that we were talking about the first national soil conservation program. I am factually correct in saying that. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Crane had to move this motion: he had no option but to do it. We flushed out honourable senators opposite on their record on soil conservation by that speech and by the question to the Minister.

Then we exposed their lack of knowledge about the fact that the first national structured soil conservation program was brought in by the Hawke Labor Government. It is abundantly clear if one reads all of the Budget Papers. No doubt, after hearing of this exchange in the Parliament, the constituents of the rural members will be demanding answers from them. They will ask why they did not know the history of soil conservation and why they did not take some action when they were in government. That is what has been going on. Opposition senators have been getting the raspberry from their own members out in the electorate because, clearly, they do not know the facts about the history of soil conservation in this country. They do not have a monopoly on knowledge of rural matters and should have known better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the substantive issues. After my speech on 11 October-and I knew I was right-I then asked the Minister a question because of these fanciful interjections from Senator Short and Senator O'Chee. In fact, honourable senators opposite were so worried about my question without notice to the Minister that Senator Teague and Senator Alston called points of order. They were so worried about the impact that their own lack of action on soil conservation was going to have on their credibility in the rural areas that they did everything they could to stop the question being asked. I remember it very clearly. I knew that I had a good question when I had two points of order called on me. It was clear from the interjections from Senator Short and Senator O'Chee that they knew as much about the history of soil conservation as Burke and Wills knew about orienteering. That was the reality of it. They did not have a clue what they were talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Before 1983 there was no structured national soil conservation program. That is absolutely true; it is factual. There was no national program to address soil and land degradation. Senator Crane has very carefully ignored that. I turn to the 1983 Budget Paper No. 1. This was not written by members of the House of Representatives or senators-this was written by neutral public servants in the Department of the Treasury. I read these things regularly; I knew where to look and I looked at page 191. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Soil Conservation</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has provided $1m for the implementation of a national soil conservation program. </PARA>

It is headed `Six States Total Commonwealth and Loan Council Borrowings 1979-80'-Fraser years-`to 1983-84'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do I see in that program? The title is `Soil Conservation'. For 1979-80 the figure is zero; 1980-81, zero. Senator Crane has been quoting figures for these years but they are not here. In 1981-82, another Fraser year, it was zero. In 1982-83, substantially a Fraser year, not a cent was allocated for soil conservation. However, in 1983-84, the first item appears-the $600,000 element of the $1m that is being paid to the States under this structured national program for soil conservation. We spent the other $400,000 of the $1m directly ourselves on soil conservation and awareness campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> There we go. In this table on page 168 of Budget Paper No. 7 from the 1983 Budget set, written by the Public Service-the neutral public servants in the Department of the Treasury-not a bean, not a single cent, was allocated under a soil conservation heading for 1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82 and 1982-83. Do I need to say any more? I think I will. I will keep going because there is more to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality was that in the Fraser years there was a Minister called Kevin Newman. At that time he was the Minister for the environment-I think 1976-1977 was the period. He tried valiantly to get Commonwealth funds for a national soil conservation program. He tried everything he could to get some remedial action taken on land degradation in Australia. He got discussions going on soil conservation. But, unfortunately for him, he was thwarted by the razor gang-the so-called inner sanctum of Ministers who went round axing and taxing and slashing, who said there would be no soil conservation program. That is the record. Kevin Newman did try to get a scheme up, and I would be the first to acknowledge that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has judged Senator Campbell pretty severely. Senator Crane tries to make the centrepiece of his motion the sum of $3m which he said was paid for soil conservation under the Liberals in 1981-82. I am a pretty thorough researcher and I thought, `You cannot take anything the Liberals say at face value; you have got to analyse it very carefully because, generally speaking, it is at odds with the reality', so I had a look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I discovered that, in fact, those funds have been bunged in with untied grants to the States through the general revenue assistance arrangements. I am fairly familiar with those things. I had a look at those, and that was the situation. They were just thrown in the general pool of funds. The sum of $3m was added to the revenue base for onpayments to the States as part of that general base. Not one cent of that $3m was earmarked specifically for soil conservation. I hope that Senator Campbell is listening to this. I used to work in a Premier's office. I know what goes on with funds, and these funds were available to be used as the States wished. They could be used on any State responsibility. There is another damning indictment of the sort of case that Senator Crane has been trying to mount. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the Bradsen report. It is a very interesting report. I happen to have met the author; he was at the University of Adelaide. This report, published in 1988, is titled Soil Conservation Legislation in Australia. One of the things it looked at-although I do not think Senator Crane actually referred to it tonight-is the $3m that I have just been talking about. The report actually examines that amount, added to the general base of revenue for the States, and tries to analyse what happened to it-what wonderful soil conservation program or whatever came out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Bradsen found when he analysed this $3m-again I point out that it is the centrepiece of the case that has been so carefully mounted here by Senator Crane-was that only three of the six States, and I admit Western Australia was one of them and that my State was another, actually passed on any of that $3m to anything at all resembling soil conservation. Three States, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania-I hope Senator Campbell is still listening-just totally bunged it into the general revenue pool. </PARA>

This is a subject I know something about, even though I do not go around with a hayseed in my teeth and wearing moleskins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Bradsen discovered-and Senator Crane waved that report around tonight but did not use this particular section from it-that only three of the States had actually done anything with the money. The rest of them just threw it into the general revenue pool and did not use it for any such purpose. That is one thing that has to be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Crane actually quoted one of the conclusions from Mr Bradsen's report on page 119, but I found it a very interesting and wonderful conclusion. After he had analysed the fact that this money had not been passed on for the so-called purpose that the Fraser Government had decided it should be spent on, after his analysis of the three States out of six that did something with it and the three that did not, he concluded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In these circumstances one would have to conclude that at this point any serious national commitment to soil conservation . . . had been abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Bradsen quoting the record of the Fraser years-the record of the Liberals, talking about soil conservation, perhaps, but not acting on it. He was quoting them and saying that, even if they had been talking about it and saying that there had been some sort of commitment to it, any serious national commitment to soil conservation had been abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the $3m. So much for one of the centrepieces of Senator Crane's motion as it related to 1981-82. So much for the motion, because that is one of the building bricks that he based it on. He should not come in here and think we are going to have our legs pulled. Some of us know what we are talking about and I hope he will learn that in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> He also refers to Commonwealth extension service grants in bolstering his case. The facts about these extension service grants are that they were never established for the specific purpose of promoting soil conservation. I assume Senator Crane knows that as well as I do. In fact, extension service grants paid for a range of things in the rural sector but they were never established with the specific purpose of promoting soil conservation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is hurting. I can tell it is really hurting, but I am going to keep it going. Honourable senators opposite have attacked my integrity, and I am going to keep going. We are now going to analyse the Commonwealth extension service grants, which again are one of the pillars on which this very flimsy motion moved by Senator Crane is based, and which somehow suggests that I have been making misleading statements to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, as I have pointed out, these grants were not established for any specific purpose relating to soil conservation; rather, they were established to promote general agricultural advisory services. They were grants of a general nature to fund general advisory services. Senator Crane claims, for example, in his motion attacking me and Senator Cook that in 1979-80, $198,000 was provided for soil conservation. When I analysed this, I found that in 1979-80-one of the years of the Fraser Administration-general agricultural extension service grants totalled $4.7m. So even if-and I do not necessarily accept this-Senator Crane is right in saying that $198,000 was somehow spent on soil conservation in 1979-80, that was only a minuscule 4 per cent of the Commonwealth extension service grants. What I am really saying is that while Senator Crane is attacking me and is attacking Senator Cook by saying that the Fraser Government provided more money for soil conservation under the Commonwealth extension service grants, in fact in the one financial year I checked, 1979-80, a mere $198,000 out of $4.73m was actually allocated to anything resembling soil conservation. I guess we can say, then, that 96 per cent of the money was not spent on anything resembling soil conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we can draw the conclusion from looking at the Liberal's track record in government that soil conservation was hardly a priority. I have been through all of the strands of this motion and have demolished them one after the other. In the very last part of the motion, the Opposition is saying that it boosted soil conservation and that it did something for soil conservation through the Commonwealth extension service grants, but I have been able to show just by analysis of one financial year that 96 per cent of the money was not spent on soil conservation; 4 per cent may have been. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that it was the Hawke Labour Government which was elected in March 1983 which brought in the first structured national program to lead with land degradation and soil conservation. I would like now to look at our record under that program. Let us not have any more silly motions alleging that people have made misleading statements. The whole of the motion is rather misleading when we analyse it paragraph by paragraph, subparagraph by subparagraph, line by line. There is no factual basis of any substance for giving any credibility at all to this motion. I reject it out of hand and I hope that when Senator Crane comes in here in the future he will not suggest that people on this side of the Chamber make misleading statements. I reject his comments out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the national soil conservation program, introduced by the Hawke Labor Government in 1983, we have allocated some $55m-a vast amount of money compared with the mere hundreds of thousands of dollars talked about by Senator Crane-and the Government has promised to provide some $260m to the program over the next ten years, which of course will be known as the Decade of Land Care. About 80 per cent of the funds provided under the national soil conservation program, which I have pointed out here tonight was the first structured national program to deal with land degradation and soil conservation in Australia, has been directed to State government agencies. The funding under the program has stimulated increased funding for soil conservation by the various State agencies and according to the information now available to the Federal Labor Government the total expenditure by the States on soil conservation, on our best estimate, was $78m in 1987-88. So very substantial amounts of money are being spent-$55m under the Hawke Labor Government since the program was implemented in 1983 and $78m by the States in 1987-88 alone. </PARA>
<PARA> We have found that since we introduced this particular scheme, landholder and general public interest in land degradation has increased markedly. That is a welcome development, because land degradation has certainly been one of the major, if not the major, environmental problems in this country. The change in attitude has been profound as have been the adoption rates of conservation farming practices. They are welcome developments, as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that this Government supported the establishment of the Australian Soil Conservation Council and its subsidiary committees in 1986, so that body was set up three years after the big program came into operation. A ministerial task force comprising members of the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation was established in 1988 to consider soil conservation policy initiatives that can be taken by the Commonwealth. Membership of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee has been increased, from seven members to twelve, in order to provide a greater range of expertise to formulate policy advice for the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> A non-profit company, Landcare Australia, has been established to increase awareness and to help develop the land care ethic within the Australian community-a very commendable activity. I am sure there is a lot of bipartisan support for these measures in the community. Under that non-profit company, Landcare Australia, corporate and private sponsorship of activities will be sought, and I am pleased to say that a public awareness campaign is planned for 1990 which will target urban as well as rural Australia. It is important that urban Australia be targeted. Much of the focus on land degradation and soil conservation has been on rural areas, the country and regional areas of Australia. It is important that these matters be brought into the large metropolitan areas of the Australian community to ensure that awareness is raised, to ensure that people in our capital cities are aware of the pressing need to look after our land and ensure that it is not degraded any further. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject this motion moved tonight. I have in no way made misleading statements to the Senate. I believe I have, brick by brick, piece by piece, demolished this rather flimsy case that somehow Senator Cook and I misled the Parliament in this matter. The reality is that under the Hawke Labor Government and under Minister Kerin, the first ever structured national soil conservation program to deal with land degradation in Australia was introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are eager to participate in the debate on this motion, not particularly because we are concerned about the trivialities of who wants to claim the credit for being the first to wake up to the fact that the well-being of Australia as a whole is inextricably linked to the well-being of its soil. In fact, we think it is absolutely crucial that this debate occur but not necessarily on the ground on which it is being fought at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear Senator Crane say during his contribution that he could see little benefit in point scoring because the substance was too important. It seems to me that from the perspective of the Government benches the whole issue began with an attempt at point scoring, which perhaps backfired, although I am not sure of that. Lest it be seen as point scoring, I want to make the point in passing that the only occasion on which a matter of urgency has ever been debated in the Senate on the issue of soil conservation was in 1987, when it was introduced by Senator Janet Powell and it received all-party support. However, I would not want to try to claim any point scoring on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed to hear Senator Maguire base his case on the semantics of the qualifiers that he used, such as `structured', `national' and `program' to defend the position he had chosen to take. It seemed to me to open up a situation where the debate could only be about who cares the most about the soil in Australia. Regrettably this motion is not about the substance of the issues relating to soil conservation. The Democrats are in this place, we believe, to debate substantive issues to ensure that Government and the Opposition take decisive action on matters of concern to all Australians and we would rather not have these never ending debates on who did what to whom and when and who was right then or now. I feel that is fairly pointless. </PARA>

I would have preferred that debate ensued on the substance of actions that could and should be taken in the whole context of what is the value of soil conservation and, in fact, what are the actions other than funding that should take place. That is what is wrong with this debate; it is tied too closely to the question of funding. Simply to throw money at soil conservation is not to show commitment. The Democrats today would like to place on record as we have on other occasions that we are happy to acknowledge the contributions of all governments-local, State and Federal-as well as community groups, conservation groups such as Greening Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation, Girl Guide groups, Rotary groups, local land care groups, schools and individuals like the late Ernest `Watershed' Jackson from Victoria. They have made a commitment and a contribution to soil conservation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us not argue about which government is responsible for what level of funding but rather which government has led the nation in a commitment to soil conservation. That is sadly lacking in this debate, and that is what is wrong with this debate. As a matter of fact I would have preferred to hear Senator Maguire talk about his colleague Senator John Devereux who, during the weekend, spent most of the flight from Tasmania happily telling about some of the initiatives he has had taken on his property in developing the soil profile of that property. I would have been happier had I received a more charitable reception from honourable senators yesterday when I spoke about research into worms instead of some degree of ridicule from all sides of the chamber for having raised such a matter. In fact, I pointed out yesterday when looking at the report that worms are capable of contributing some 20 per cent to the productivity of pastures in Australia. To be ridiculed for raising that as a matter of importance indicates to me the lack of commitment from both sides of this chamber. I have a lot to say on this matter and I regret that time for this discussion is rapidly drawing to a conclusion. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in Hansard. </PARA>

Our members themselves, as members of communities, as farmers, and as members of conservation and land care groups making their contribution towards trying to arrest Australia's severe land degradation problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1983 a now retired Democrat Senator and a former Democrat deputy leader, Colin Mason, introduced into this chamber an Income Tax Amendment Bill, which was designed to remove tax deductibility for the clearing of trees. When the Hawke Government brought in its own legislation later, the Democrats were happy to support it. These initiatives included:</PARA>
<PARA> Soil Conservation-In 1987 Senator Powell initiated an urgency debate on soil conservation, called for the development of national soil conservation legislative framework for adoption by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable Agriculture-consistently urged the Government to provide support, incentives, information and advice to farmers within to make the transition to ecologically and economically sustainable agriculture. Called for the establishment of a school of sustainable agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Agricultural Chemicals-initiated establishment of a Senate select committee to inquire into the social, environmental and economic impact of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable Development-successfully amended primary industry legislation to ensure that the concepts of sustainability and conservation must be consistent. </PARA>
<PARA>Just referring to our call for the establishment of a school of sustainable agriculture, one should note the plans of the University of New England, which is engaged in assessing the level of demand for courses in alternative agriculture in order to find out the views of those intending to enrol in agricultural courses in respect of the skills they would like to develop and their preferences for the way such courses are offered. Other measures the Democrats have been calling for include greater Commonwealth responsibility, especially greater legislative responsibility. The Democrats support the views of environmental lawyer, John Bradsen, who has called on the Federal Government to enact effective land conservation legislation where it has exclusive power and to examine all legislation and policies to assess their land conservation significance. Mr Bradsen has said, `For example, taxation deductions should not apply to clearance without a full conservation assessment of the land.' On this point of Mr Bradsen's, my colleague, Senator John Coulter, the environment spokesman for the Democrats has a notice of motion on the Notice Paper immediately under the one we are now debating. Senator Coulter's motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate requires that every explanatory memorandum presented to the Senate with a Bill contain a statement explaining the environmental impact, if any, which would result from the implementation of the proposals contained in the Bill, that the statement be headed Statement of Environmental Impact of this Bill, and be in the same form as the financial impact statements currently included in explanatory memoranda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an urgent need to promote true justice for the people in less developed countries, particularly the poor people for whom we provide development assistance through our foreign aid budget. The prime task in seeking justice and empowerment for these people is the need to focus attention on what makes them poor. The tendency has been to blame the poor for their poverty and to prescribe for them and impose upon them so-called `solutions' including at times the final solution of getting rid of their unborn. These so-called solutions end up empowering, not the poor, but the governments and international bureaucracies which proceed to further threaten their already fragile rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recent focus in our aid program on the environment has the potential to be a welcome and overdue initiative. In the context that I have just referred to-that is, the promotion through our aid allocations of justice for the poor-the new environmental initiatives must not be used as a back door means of using ecological excuses for population control. It is of great concern that of the $5.21m of aid money redirected this financial year for development cooperation on global environment issues, 30 per cent has been allocated for what the Australian International Development Aid Bureau has termed `population stabilisation' and most of the money is going to international population control groups such as International Planned Parenthood Federation the (IPPF) and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to address briefly the issue of development education. There has been a call to spend up to $5m on development education in Australia to explain to Australians the rationale for foreign aid. I must express qualified support for a program in development education. Two recent instances of the use of the aid budget for development education to foreclose, not promote, debate on development issues points to the need for vigilance. In last year's aid budget, the Family Planning Federation of Australia-an organisation affiliated with the IPPF-is the population control lobby group which received a grant to produce for parliamentarians a briefing kit on population and development. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) has used aid money to fund an Australian organisation which supports population control to produce a propaganda briefing kit for parliamentarians which will tell us why we should give more money to organisations like it and the IPPF to support such programs from our aid budget. That is a gross misuse, I believe, of development education funds and an insult to our intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA> The second abuse arose when AIDAB announced an essay competition for students of years 10, 11 and 12 on the subject `The Challenge of World Population Growth'. The competition was arranged, so we are told, to increase the awareness amongst young people of the impact of population growth on developing countries. But, without exception, all the material provided to the schools by AIDAB promotes the view that people in developing countries are the problem and population control the solution. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no mention of the contrary view-a very valid view-that population growth is a symptom, not the cause, of poverty. There was no mention of the implications for poor families of the imposition of population control imperialism. Indeed, there was no in-depth analysis of the basic cause of poverty. There was no mention of the oft forgotten fact that children in developing countries are not the burden that some people in Western countries believe them to be. </PARA>
<PARA> This promotion of a population control mentality amongst our youth sets the scene for the future implementation of programs involving massive violations of human rights, as are currently occurring in China and some other countries, and further denials of the true needs of families in the developing countries. Is this what we mean by true development education-promoting the views of international population control organisations?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, at the Estimates Committee hearings, I had asked for some of the material that was being presented and AIDAB gave me the material, which included an editorial critical of an article which in turn was critical of the population control mentality. But AIDAB did not include that article and so was sending a one-sided piece of information out to the students. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this 1990-91 aid budget has highlighted the age-old adage that the noisy wheel gets the oil, and these are the lobby groups essentially. It is a great shame that many worthwhile aid activities have had to suffer as a consequence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the areas which was not covered in the Budget was the cost to the economy of sending Royal Australian Navy (RAN) warships to the Persian Gulf-a cost of $60m over six months, according to a Department of Defence estimate, or much higher if war breaks out and missiles are fired. Presumably these costs will be added on to the defence budget, which already stands at almost $9 billion or 9.3 per cent of total Budget expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already stated my objections to the decision to send RAN warships to the Gulf and join in the United States initiated blockade there. I particularly object to the unseemly haste with which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) decided to send these warships without consulting more than a few of his Cabinet colleagues, and certainly not his Party, the Parliament, or the people of Australia. If we are to build a new international order, then it must be new, not just a rehash of the old order when the strong gang up on the weak and impose their will through military might. Furthermore, it would have to take into account a just distribution of resources, fair payment for commodities instead of wheeling and dealing on the futures market and commodity prices, and a genuine attempt to tackle global problems like the greenhouse effect and the ozone depletion on a global basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, I was impressed with some of the ideas expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, in the address he gave to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York on 2 October this year. He referred to a new era when the UN would be able to carry out a more effective role in conflict resolution and peacekeeping, and mentioned the five such operations that have been carried out over the past two years. </PARA>
<PARA> He also referred to Cambodia when he spoke about a foreshadowing of several others in the years ahead. At the practical level-and I quote his words he said because I think they are worth repeating:</PARA>
<PARA>The peacekeeping function is still handled by political, legal, financial and administrative problems. Australia advocates the need for greater efficiency and economy in peacekeeping and for the whole peacekeeping area of UN activity to be put on a firmer financial and administrative footing. I welcome the steps the Secretary-General has recently taken to improve coordination and financing of peacekeeping, but note that still more needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>I would, however, qualify my remarks about Senator Evans's speech because, while his words may have been designed to go down well with the UN community, we do not hear the same words spoken as strongly for domestic consumption. I refer also to the following comments in the same speech:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the arrogance of military power remaining a scourge with which the world will still have to deal. </PARA>
<PARA>And his further comments:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the upward spiral of arms procurement and the proliferation of increasingly more destructive weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>His words on the subject of arms transfers are again, I feel, worth quoting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The acquisition of conventional weapons continues at an alarming rate in many parts of the globe. Often scarce resources are diverted from social and economic development to military expenditure. Australia supports measures by all States to reduce military budgets and to the implementation of confidence building measures which will reduce the risk of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>How then, may I ask, does he reconcile such praiseworthy thoughts with his membership of a government which is seeking to double our arms sales from $250m a year to $500m a year, which talks about increasing military expenditure when the economy improves and has certainly not reduced military expenditure, and which continues in membership of an offensive military alliance with a nation that has systematically ignored all Australia's proposals for confidence building measures in the Pacific, as anyone in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will privately inform us? Fine words from the Minister, but meaningless, when Cabinet slashes government spending on health, education and welfare, as well as foreign affairs, but gives the military the positive nod as usual. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans worries about the world community finding up to $5 billion to fund the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, but it is his Government which is spending $5.6 billion on six new submarines to combat threats that everyone knows do not exist and which may well favourably consider a request from the Navy to acquire a helicopter carrier for intervention somewhere in the region. As Andrew Mack from the Peace Research Centre at the Australian National University has pointed out, if the Government cut one per cent from the military budget, that would mean a 5 per cent increase for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The kinds of measures that Senator Evans proposes would mean precisely that-strengthening his Department and slashing that of Defence by taking advantage of the peace dividend. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of our role in the Gulf that I feel strongly about concerns the double standards applied. If the issue was about self-determination and protecting sovereignty, why has the United States not acted to get Israel out of Gaza and the West Bank since 1967? Why, for that matter, has Australia not taken the same line? What about the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, which must be mentioned over and over again in this respect? The same double standards apply over the US invasion of Grenada and Panama, as well as Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980. Again, we have our Prime Minister ordering Australia's delegation at the United Nations to reverse our vote on the US resolution to condemn the US for its invasion of Panama and to support that United States invasion instead-outrageous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> As for Iraq, Australia was on the point of selling $850,000 worth of aircraft spare parts to Saddam Hussein when the invasion of Kuwait caused the abrupt cancellation of the deal. But surely it was these same planes that dropped chemical weapons on Iraq's own population only a couple of years ago, and we did condemn that. The new international order that millions of people-global citizens or planetarians, if you like-are hoping for is centred on the strengthening of the United Nations: the use of diplomacy and negotiation to resolve conflicts instead of armed force; the sharing of world resources; tackling global problems at the global level-problems like greenhouse and ozone depletion and deforestation; and the transfer of money spent on the military to real security needs for ecologically sustainable development, particularly development programs regarding women and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, what we have is the talk of a nuclear first strike against Iraq; the vilification of Saddam Hussein as another Hitler, as if he was the only bad guy in town and the logical successor to General Noriega and Colonel Gaddafi; and an uncomfortable silence about other abuses by military dictators or quasi-military regimes in places like Myanmar, China in Tibet, the Philippines, Indonesia in East Timor, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Guatemala and so on. It seems from the rhetoric we are hearing now from the Pentagon and Britain that the West feels that it must kill the monster it created; that it is not interested in a negotiated settlement; that it must smash Iraq's military capability even if Saddam Hussein were to agree to a withdrawal from Kuwait; and that that military capability must be completely smashed. Even if the United States is successful in doing that, it will not have solved the problem of the Middle East. Far from it; it will have created another monster which in another few years will require another military solution. It is no answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who defend the Government's interventionist position need to respond to at least three very crucial questions. One I have already raised and that concerns the selective nature of our protest and the double standards applied, particularly as far as the Arab nations are concerned. If such supporters of the Government's position believe that our role is to protest the invasion of Kuwait, can they explain why we have acquiesced in other situations that I have referred to such as Indonesia's invasion of Timor in 1975, Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 and US interventionism in Granada and Panama?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I ask: Who armed Iraq? Most of the weapons Iraq acquired between 1980 and 1988 came from the Soviet Union, France and China. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 26 countries supplied arms to both Iran and Iraq and four countries sold only to Iraq. That is a total of 30 countries which helped to create this monster. Another alarming example of arms cooperation was when Argentina, Brazil and Egypt worked with Iraq on development of the Condor missile-a team effort that was terminated last year. The logic of most of these countries exporting arms is that they need the sales to offset their balance of payments deficit and to help pay for their expensive arms imports-precisely the argument used by the Australian Government since 1988. This was when controls on our exports were slackened in order to try to double our arms exports along the lines recommended by the 1986 Cooksey report which, incidentally, was never discussed in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will deny that its controls have been slackened; but anyone in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will tell honourable senators that they have been slackened, especially since the Mirage sale to Pakistan and the controversial sale of 76 millimetre shells to Sri Lanka, which also had to be stopped at the last moment. It was a very sloppy Department of Defence sales mechanism, I would say. If there is a disagreement between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence on a particular deal, the Defence Department has the last word through the Minister or through Cabinet. That is where the balance of payments argument counts. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was scrupulous enough not to peddle arms in the Iran-Iraq war but as soon as it ended, the controls were lifted and we were on the point of selling $850,000 worth of aircraft spare parts to Iraq when it blotted its copybook by invading Kuwait. I presume these parts were for planes that may well have been used for dropping chemical weapons and could be used again for that purpose. Apparently that does not matter as long as we are seen to be condemning Iraq after the crime has been committed and then, it is back to business as usual. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, it is no good just abusing Saddam Hussein as another Hitler because we have to ask an uncomfortable question: Who sold him the arms? Basically, it has been our mates. Nor are we exempt from that critique. Australia was quite happy to sell military equipment along with virtually everyone else. However, mention should be made of one exemption. That is the recent decision of the new Government of Czechoslovakia to stop exporting military equipment. Czechoslovakia used to be one of the world's major dealers but it has now decided not to pursue that path despite the perilous state of its economy. I only wish that Australia had the courage to follow Czechoslovakia's example and that the Prime Minister of Australia could take a leaf out of the book of Vaclav Havel, the ex-dissident who is now the president of Czechoslovakia. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the role of the United Nations must be clarified. In the Gulf region at the moment it is a United States lead initiative despite resolution No. 665. I am grateful to the comments of Dr Kevin Clements from the Department of Sociology, University of Canterbury for the following analysis of the United Nations position. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the current crisis there is agreement in the Security Council that Iraq has committed an act of aggression and that this requires an unconditional withdrawal on the part of Iraq and mandatory economic measures on all member states. (Article 41 has, therefore, been implemented)</PARA>
<PARA> Even though the second resolution of the Security Council has resulted in the application of ``appropriate measures'' to help enforce the sanctions (Article 42) we are still largely at the level of non-military enforcement procedures, economic sanctions, an embargo on trade and an accompanying blockade. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no UN resolution permitting the massive military build up in the Gulf nor is there any Security Council legitimation for the multinational force or for a pre-emptive or even defensive unilateral or multilateral military assault on Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The multi-national (largely US) forces on the ground in Saudi Arabia are not under the UN Military Staff Committee. It is illegitimate, therefore, to claim that they are carrying out the will of the Security Council. In fact both China and the Soviet Union while willing to agree to non-military sanctions are currently very wary of military action. It is true that informal relations between the 5 permanent members have been expanded, and the US, UK and French military staff commands are combining their resources into something approximating a de facto UN staff command or at the very least an informal ``crisis'' committee but, at the moment, they have no UN legitimation for anything other than enforcing the blockade and the Security Council would have some difficulty preventing a unilateral strike by the US if Washington wanted to proceed in this direction. (If a unilateral action occurred the Security Council could withdraw the UN legitimation that currently exists and China for example has indicated a reluctance to proceed to military action and would either abstain or exercise the veto. The Soviet Union would probably abstain, although it is not impossible that they would join the other three permanent states in a limited military action)</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, therefore, all that member states have been asked to do by the Security Council is impose economic sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> For military compliance procedures to come into play the following steps have to be followed:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The Security Council would have to resolve to use armed force against Iraq, invoking Article 43. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) The current multi-national forces would have to be placed under the existing UN Military Staff Committee and a line of command agreed to between the five permanent members. (This is not terribly complex but it would have to be done for the Charter provisions to be fulfilled) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Member states would then be asked by the Staff Committee--</PARA>
<PARA>which does exist on paper but which has not been activated-</PARA>
<PARA>for specific kinds of military assistance and agreements would have to be negotiated. It is at this point that each state can exercise its sovereign rights to determine how and what sorts of contribution it wishes to make. The UN would not impose military requirements on a member . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Clements also suggests that alternatives such as medical assistance would be options. It is very clear that if the United States goes ahead with a strike against Iraq, under whatever pretext, it does not have the sanction of the United Nations to do that and the military command that exists in the Gulf at the moment is largely a Unites States military command. In no way can it be construed as a United Nations command. That is why Australia should have no part in it whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that security in a post-cold war world must now be seen to be beyond military terms. For most of the people in our region-it is worth remembering that more than half of the world's population lives in an arc stretching between Japan and Afghanistan-security can best be measured in economic terms; that is, sheer human survival. </PARA>
<PARA> To this I add another concern: the concern for the environment. Environmental security is far more crucial to our survival in the long term than buying submarines, helicopter carriers and frigates. I compare the tiny amount we are spending on the environment on combating soil erosion, on reafforestation, on improving public transport and, in particular, improving a national railway system, on developing alternative energy sources and so on with the amount that we spend on the military. </PARA>
<PARA> I would see the new international order as giving us the ability to work together with our Pacific and Indian Ocean neighbours on their concerns about greenhouse, particularly if they might even cease to exist if the industrialised countries do not get their act together on cleaning up at home first. I would be far more impressed with this cooperation rather than the 22.4 per cent increase in the defence cooperation program that I note in the defence estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> The only slightly positive aspect of that program is the provision of patrol boats to some South Pacific island nations which need these vessels to promote their primary resource-the fish swimming in their national waters. The patrol boats are needed to monitor the recent ban on driftnet fishing and to stop poaching of the natural resources of these small island nations. However, I am not impressed by the hidden agenda, which is the role of naval intelligence in the Pacific. It would be far more appropriate were the program to be administered under civilian aid rather than the military; that is, we should provide patrol boats but not out of the defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the way in which patrol boats have been used in Papua New Guinea in its campaign against the Bougainville independence movement. There are countless opportunities for Australia to take decisive action here and overseas which would be far more likely to add to global stability than would the purchase and deployment of military equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned greenhouse. The Government has taken considerable credit for its decision on greenhouse gas emission targets for Australia in the lead up to the current meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We still have not, however, actually committed ourselves to anything and have left wide open the possibility that if it costs this generation too much and interferes with business as usual too much, we will leave future generations to pick up an even larger problem. I do not think that is responsible at all. Why should any of the developing countries, and our closer neighbours in particular, be expected to make any sort of commitment to controlling greenhouse gas emissions from within their boundaries when a comparatively wealthy and grossly energy and resource inefficient country like Australia will not commit itself? At least in regard to limiting greenhouse gas emissions we made some sort of statement without a lead from the United States, and that was a welcome change. What a pity we did not display a similar independence rather than become involved in a military capacity in the Gulf. Any move of independence and Australia taking a separate and single minded line is a welcome one. </PARA>
<PARA> Another clear example of Australia failing to take the opportunity to demonstrate real concern for and solidarity with Pacific nations came recently with the entreaty of the Prime Minister to those nations to accept a continuation of the use of the Pacific as a dumping site. I refer to Australia's stance on the chemical weapons destruction facility on Johnston Atoll. </PARA>
<PARA> While welcoming the move towards a global strategy to end the production and use of such weapons, I understand the anger and frustration of the South Pacific people who, through lack of political power, will bear the cost of any mishap or technical failure during the four-year disposal program. Neither is there any guarantee that JACAD's life will be terminated on schedule as promised. It is another case of everybody in the region having to trust the American Government, and it has not got a very good record of keeping to its word on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The overseas development assistance program has been improved by the inclusion this year of environmental assessment measures aimed at encouraging sustainable development in recipient countries. The concept is admirable, but the level of expenditure is paltry compared with the Defence estimates to which I have already referred. Similarly, although increased in some areas, the level of expenditure on environmental programs within Australia is overshadowed by the enormous defence budget. Evidence of the Government's commitment to the protection of our natural resources is, at best, sporadic. Sustainable development has become a popular phrase but several recent decisions have left serious doubts as to how well the concept of ecological sustainability is understood. Thus we have the situation in which a major decision on the commitment of the south-eastern forests to logging was made before the Government's own tribunal-the Resource Assessment Commission-completed its task and before the Government's working group on sustainable development for the forest industry could even be convened. Talk about putting the cart before the horse!</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, pressure is being applied to erode significantly the power of the Australian Heritage Commission and reduce the protection of our National Estate in the name of resource security. It seems that there are those who still refuse to recognise that sustainable development and, indeed, resource security rely on our having the foresight and intelligence to conserve our natural capital in all its diversity. The importance of conservation of our natural capital cannot be overestimated. Resources which have become increasingly less secure over the past 200 years are soil and water. The entire community has gradually accepted its responsibility for this situation and a willingness to work towards solutions. The allocation of $22.3m for soil conservation, however, also pales into insignificance when compared to Defence estimates. It is interesting that in the previous debate on soil matters the Opposition was keen to get more money out of the Government for soil conservation, with which I would agree, but it probably would not agree with me that it could come from the Defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia would not be in the Gulf right now if it were not for the vulnerability of Western nations to Middle Eastern oil reserves. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change would not be meeting right now if it were not for the dependence on those same oil reserves and other fossil fuels. Australia seemed at one time to be capable of providing the lead to other countries in the development of a solar power industry. Projects at Rottnest Island and Esperance in Western Australia have indicated the scope for the generation of wind power. The technology is there, all set and ready to go, but it needs some encouragement from the Government and the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and various organisations and individuals funded under, for example, the national energy research, development and demonstration program have shown the enormous possibilities for improving energy efficiency and developing alternative sources. The $17.7m allocated for energy research and conservation does not reflect the importance of these developments in improving both our environmental and economic performance. Nor does it indicate that as yet the Government is seriously considering any major move away from reliance on the burning of fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week saw an indication that the States and the Commonwealth may finally look at improving Australia's rail freight system by making it a national system. The reallocation of funds from submarines to land transport and, in particular, the improvement of rail freight and urban public transport systems would help considerably to reduce the transport contribution to greenhouse emissions. If the Government wishes its environmental credentials to be taken seriously, there must be an indication that we are willing to look at all our institutions and question their place in an ecologically sustainable future. Spending a large percentage of the country's budget on hugely expensive weapons with questionable defence value should be challenged in the light of the global move towards an ecologically sustainable future. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="3820" SPEAKER="Macdonald Sen I.D." NAMEID="YW4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.46)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every Budget time, ordinary Australians agonise over the tax they have to pay and they marvel at how so much money could be spent, in their view so unwisely, by politicians and bureaucrats in far away Canberra. I acknowledge that it is very easy for those of us who live so far away from the national capital not to understand the real expenditure that takes place and to overlook the many essential things that flow from the tax gathering and appropriation of moneys for expenditure by the various government departments. But when one's average take home pay after tax is in the range of $15,000 to $20,000, which for a vast majority of Australians it is, and when one is struggling to pay off a mortgage, some car payments, and school fees, it is difficult to understand all of the expenditures and the billions of dollars that are spent. There is a suspicion in many parts of Australia that moneys are spent unwisely. Unemployment benefit is one expenditure which attracts suspicion from those who toil for very long hours at low pay simply to maintain the dignity of employment, to pay off homes and mortgages and pay for the basic requisites for their kids attending schools and clubs and sporting fixtures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In country towns in particular, the rorts of the unemployment system are well known as the knowledge seems to get around much easier. In many cases, people do not work when they are able to and when jobs are available because they find it financially more beneficial to stay on the unemployment benefit than to get a job. There are many instances that I am aware of when people have started work and found that what they are receiving from a regular job is not what they were receiving from the unemployment benefit with all the supplements that go on to it-they have a few kids-and so they have given up work and gone back on the dole. They receive more cash from the dole than they would if they were working for a living. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government has to put some incentive back into working and it is this incentive that will be provided by the Liberal and National parties' program for a complete reform of the taxation system and the other micro-economic reforms that are proposed. The Opposition's radical new proposal for a goods and services tax will give incentive for people to work because personal income tax rates will be lessened. This will mean that those who want to work extra hours at weekends or at night to get ahead, to get a bit more money to pay for a holiday or to pay off a mortgage quicker will be encouraged to do so. They will not be discouraged by the regressive tax scales that we have at the present time. A goods and services tax will tax spending and not earnings. Under the present system, earnings are penalised. If one wants to go out and earn a few more bob, one is penalised and taxed enormously for it. Under the new system what one spends is taxed, giving one, to a certain degree, a choice of how much tax one pays. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment allocations for this year have increased by 31.7 per cent over the actuals for 1989-90 to a staggering figure of $4 billion. I suggest that the amount allocated by the Government for unemployment benefit will prove to be totally inadequate as more and more businesses go to the wall, as job vacancies continue to fall and as unemployment queues grow longer and longer each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Against a background of severe economic recession, which at last the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is able to try to enunciate, and also at a time of severe rural crisis' which Senator Richardson and other senators acknowledged in the Senate today-an acknowledgment that the Chairman of the Prime Minister's Country Task Force, Mr Courtice, can still not bring himself to admit-we have the situation where ordinary, average Australians feel some real depression at the rorts that go on in the expenditure of their hard won money. They are horrified that for them almost a year's salary is spent in a three- or four-hour plane trip for a Government member to open a dog show that had closed down by the time he arrived. People who earn a take-home pay of about $15,000 in a year simply cannot comprehend how a Government member could spend this much on a four-hour trip in what can only be seen as an attempt to gather a few-I might say a very few-votes out of the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> People on average incomes read every day of the continuing Inquiry into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and cannot believe that $11m has been paid to lawyers and bureaucrats in funding just one part of the inquiry-and that is not the total cost. Again, people cannot comprehend how this Government could spend some $16m on war crimes prosecutions to prosecute one 80-year-old man. The whole system seems to be wrong in their minds and they find it incredible and almost impossible to understand that people could waste this sort of money with so little result. They also wonder when $68,000 is spent to rent indoor plants for offices of the Department of Social Security each year-offices which generally in rural Australia hand out the dole cheques and attempt to get jobs for people. These pleasantries for the workers are all very good, but in these tough economic times that we have at the moment many people who frequent those offices may well think that better use could be made of that $68,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Also we heard the other day that in the social security area $1.7m was overpaid to a supplier of computer software. Still in the social security area, $3,953,000 was spent on four issues of a self-promoting magazine by the Department called Aged Pension News, which I know from my own experience and from direct experience of others close to me very few pensioners read. </PARA>
<PARA> I receive many calls in my electorate office from people who read in the papers that the Government has provided $30,000 to send a delegation of Aboriginals overseas to recover the bones of Aboriginals from European museums. Those people recoil when the suggestion is made that in the next three to four years another $4m will be required to recover those remains. When it is reported that one of those groups that visited London to recover bones on subsidised money provided by the taxpayer-which group included Michael Mansel-then hired another hotel room in London simply to store the bones in, people cannot accept that this is a wise use of taxpayers' money. For heaven's sake, we spend millions of dollars to fund embassies and high commissions in foreign lands and if there is merit in recovering the bones-and I do not enter into that argument-then surely our very well paid and well funded foreign affairs officers could do the work without sending people from Australia on junkets overseas at taxpayers' expense to do what our officials and clerks in the high commissions and embassies could well do, and I suggest do much better. </PARA>
<PARA> The rudest example of all which fills hard-working taxpayers with anguish occurs when they read articles such as one that was given to me by a constituent. This constituent said to me, `Why am I paying taxes for this sort of rort?'. This is the article that the constituent gave me:</PARA>
<PARA> A plastic toy penis has taken centre stage in a compensation row involving two Federal public servants in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr X has been paid full sickness benefits worth more than $45,000 after winning compensation from the Commonwealth's compensation body . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been told that the couple were working in Adelaide when a colleague placed a toy on her desk next to Mr X. He then complained to the sexual harassment officer and said his wife, who worked close by, was also offended by the toy. </PARA>
<PARA> The tribunal was told Mrs X had received $14,500 worth of rehabilitation benefits over the past 19 months, including almost $1,000 for gym membership. Comcare had also paid her fees for TAFE courses in house decoration, psychological counselling and travel expenses. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly it, Minister. What an absolute rort. People are paying money for that sort of thing. In fact, an elector wrote to the Townsville Bulletin and said in relation to that article-and I use just a few excerpts:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I feel I must express my views on the flagrant misuse of taxpayers' hard-earned money in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> What right has a bunch of obvious incompetents to pay out $59,500 of this money in such a cavalier fashion to a pair of opportunists? . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, it was a vulgar prank and one may well have been offended but the immediate reaction would have been to hurl the toy and the prankster or to treat him with disdain-but 19 months of the vapours at the taxpayers expense? Come on!</PARA>
<PARA> If these people are so unable to handle everyday situations that they need psychological counselling and coddling by footing the bill for TAFE courses and gym lessons, they were clearly unfit to be holding down the position which they occupied. </PARA>
<PARA> They are sickened-what a laugh. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, I am sickened too by the thought that the money we work hard for can be handed over with so little reason to a pair of wimps with an eye to the main chance. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, may I quote another letter on the same subject to a South Australian paper about the incident:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole exercise could cost the taxpayers $500,000 before it is finished what with legal fees, judges, court rooms and wages. I feel stressed after reading the article but I am now thinking of suing someone myself. And if you were to show me a photo of Bob Hawke or Paul Keating, then I'm sure I really would go around the bend with stress and trauma. I have become so confused with the values of our society when the Federal Government so willingly gives our money away over such issues, while former servicemen are dying while still fighting for compensation for war-caused injuries. How much longer can we, the public, put up with these actions from our public servants?</PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the reaction that the taxpayers out in ordinary Australia have when they see those sorts of rorts. </PARA>
<PARA> A sum of $1.1m has been provided from taxpayers' funds to 51 conservation groups to assist them-and they are supposedly voluntary conservation groups but still get $1.1m-in the task of raising public awareness of environmental issues, as part of an education process supposedly. What about the education for those who are currently unable to get Austudy because although they are asset rich they are income poor? Of course it is the income that pays the school bills. A sum of $256,000 has been given to conservation groups making submissions into forestry and Kakadu. These are just a few of the monies that are allocated and appropriated from tax collection-and the list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the expenditure that is paid out through governments is of a sensible and necessary nature, but much of it appears to be incomprehensible, particularly when one considers the expenditures I have just been talking about and then considers the town of Ravenshoe. In the small town of Ravenshoe the world is about to collapse for many families. They are about to lose their livelihoods, their homes, their lifestyles, their savings and their life's work. Their children are about to have to leave their school and school friends because they have to shift to foreign towns as their parents become bankrupt, bolstering the bankruptcy statistics and increasing the unemployment pile. The unemployment allocation this year will have to increase for the people in Ravenshoe who are about to become a statistic in the dole queue. They are in this position not because they spent their money on psychiatric help because someone harassed them or said something rude to them. They are not in this position because they did not want to work. They are not in this position because they have taken trips to recover ancestral remains, because they have wasted their money on visiting dog shows in far away places, because they have spent large amounts of money on expensive lawyers and consultants to prepare submissions into an inquiry on their timber mill closure or because they have spent too much money on pot plants in their workshops and homes. They are in this position simply because they trusted the Government. They believed Senator Richardson when he said that no person would be adversely affected by World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA> In Ravenshoe, 22 family businesses are owed almost $300,000 by Associated Plywoods Sales Pty Ltd and another $56,000 by an associated company also in receivership. In other parts of north Queensland other small businessmen are owed about the same amount by the same companies. Of the 22 family businesses owed money in Ravenshoe, 12 are owed over $10,000 and two of those are owed over $50,000. These are small businesses with cash flows often not exceeding $100,000 and they simply cannot sustain losses to this extent. If those 12 businesses fail, it means 12 fewer families in the district along with the families of the people they used to employ. A flow-on effect cripples other businesses in the town. It causes reductions in school numbers, which leads to fewer teachers and public servants in the town and less government money going to the town. There is a roller-coaster effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask what this has to do with the Government. The Government says that these businesses which lent money to this mill which has gone bankrupt did so unwisely. It says they gave credit to a trading company, that it was a bad business decision and that is just bad luck. You might ask why, in those circumstances, the Government should bail out these people. If it does bail out these people, why should it not bail out every other bankrupt small business in Australia as well? Of course, in view of the current number of bankruptcies, if the Government bailed out every bankrupt business it would break the country, even more than is the case now. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators and Ministers to put themselves in this position: you are running a small business in a small country town where trust and simple honesty are the normal business ethics. It is a town which owes its existence to a major factory-in this instance a timber mill-which gives employment to labourers, contractors, office workers, farmers, loggers, highwaymen and gardeners. In fact, the whole community revolves around this business enterprise. And remember, you are in small business; you are running a business in this town. Your business has only a small turnover-less than $100,000-with a net profit of less than $30,000 a year. That is what many small businessmen in Australia work for. They work all hours, all year, for less than $30,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then takes an action which has the effect of ruining the major enterprise in your town. But, after a spontaneous and quite unexpected outcry, which received worldwide publicity, the Government sends up a junior Minister who, because feelings are running so high, is set upon. The Government then realises it has made a mistake and does something to put things right. With all the media it and its highly paid consultants can muster, the Government then announces with a fanfare that no-one will be adversely affected as a result of World Heritage listing. On the front page of every newspaper and on the screen of every television set in the nation the Government promises $75m of compensation and, in particular, $13m for a major enterprise to save this mill and to save this town. </PARA>
<PARA> You are in this town. Your town is assured, under the glare of the television lights, that it has been saved; the mill will continue; the Government will provide $13m over 10 years. In your small business, knowing that the Government is propping up the mill over the next 10 years, would you not feel commercially secure in giving credit in relatively small amounts on normal 30-day trading terms? Why would you hesitate? Your business relies on the mill. The mill has been guaranteed for the next 10 years. Of course you would extend credit on normal terms. On the front page of every newspaper the Government has told you and everybody else in Australia that your town has been saved and that $13m of assistance will be provided over the next 10 years. You would not hesitate to offer normal trading credits. After all, if the Government is giving grants and loans of taxpayers' hard earned money, it would surely monitor the grants. It would check them regularly and thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA> However, this was not done. But how could a small businessman, used to dealing with trust and in trust, and with honesty and in honesty, possibly have any inkling that anything was amiss with this company? And so in trust and honesty, they gave credit. Now, for doing that, they suffer incredibly. I ask the Government to make a once-off ex gratia payment to those who innocently and in good faith advanced money to a company they quite reasonably believed was being financially supervised by the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the Appropriation Bills I ask the Government again to allocate a minuscule amount of $500,000 out of the Appropriations of some $38 billion. All I ask for is $500,000 out of the Appropriations of $38 billion or more. If the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says that this has not been provided for in the Budget Papers, that there is nowhere he can get that money from to assist these 12 families whose livelihood depends on this, I suggest to him that there is a simple way to obtain that money. Some of the $4 billion that is allocated for unemployment could be used. If $500,000 of that $4 billion allocated in the Appropriations for unemployment was used, it would represent about only 0.001 per cent. It is a realistic allocation because, if it is not paid to these people, their businesses will close, they will go on the dole queue and they will probably get the money from the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way that the Treasurer could find the money to save these 12 families would be to ask Mr Snowdon to take just 20 fewer trips. Twenty fewer VIP flights would save the livelihood of those 12 families. Another suggestion would be to take just a fraction off the $16m that is going to be spent prosecuting one person and allocate that to saving 12 families. Nobody ever wants to justify or take away from the horror of the holocaust some 40 or 50 years ago, but in this day and age could not some of that money spent prosecuting just one person be reallocated to save 12 families?</PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion might be for the Department of Social Security and a few other government departments to give up putting pot plants in their offices. If they could do that, enough money could be collected to save these 12 small families. If the Government cut out just one edition of the Aged Pension News, it would save more than twice the amount needed to save these people. If we got the Australian Embassy and their staffs overseas to collect the bones of the Aboriginal ancestors, plenty of money would be saved to look after these 12 families. If we could get off the payroll people such as those in Adelaide, who I suggest are rorting the system-and there are many others like them-the savings from that little step alone would be sufficient. I hope the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) passes on the message to the Government to give these people in Ravenshoe the money that they have lost through trusting the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak after my colleague Senator Macdonald from Queensland. He has indeed focused the Senate's attention upon the impact that the Commonwealth Government has had upon the lives of individuals. He has focused upon the lives of 12 families. The debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91 and cognate Bills is a good place to start talking about the impact of government spending as a whole on the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I will briefly talk about the broader issues of the intrusiveness of government spending and the way it has increased so dramatically since Federation only 90 years ago. I will then concentrate on a more micro-economic matter; that is, the Australian Securities Commission and the haste with which this Government and particularly the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) seem to want to get this new body off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Australia's Federation the size of government has increased to a level where it has become all-pervading, intrusive and too powerful. Having said all that, by its very size it has become the most obvious, indeed odious, millstone hanging so heavily around the neck of this great nation. I took the liberty of getting some figures from the research service of the Parliamentary Library on what has happened to Commonwealth government outlays since about 1909-10. The figures have been adjusted for inflation, which, as we all know, has raced very rapidly over those years. In the early years of this century, the Commonwealth outlays, adjusted for inflation, amounted to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The per capita amount-that is, per head of Australia-was $159.98. It would not surprise honourable senators in this chamber that by 1989-90 those figures had leapt up alarmingly into the high 20s as far as the percentage of GDP is concerned and up to $5,127.70 per capita. That is only Commonwealth outlays; it does not take into account States and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> If one focuses upon the growth of government expenditure as a proportion of Australia's national production in just the past 20 years one sees that in 1968-69 Commonwealth only government expenditure was 29.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Here we are today, 20 years on, and the figure is about 37.2 per cent-a rise of some $13.7 billion in the past 20 years. When some poor fellow reads about those sorts of macro-economic figures in the newspapers or hears about them on the evening news they mean very little. What Senator Macdonald was referring to earlier-the impact on individual Australians-is far more important. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the figures of the macro-economy, the percentages, the multi-billion dollar Budget gross domestic product figures and the figures on Commonwealth outlays are of interest to students, economists and academics, but I want to look at the impact on individual Australians. Clearly, the more the Australian Government spends the more it affects each Australian. It is fair to say that over the 20 years we have seen that massive increase in government expenditure, 10 of those years were under the control of Liberal governments and 10 were under Labor. So it is not something we can blame on the Labor socialists; it has happened over a period of time under both conservative and socialist governments controlling this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on individuals is important. As I have said, the more the Australian Government spends, the more it affects each Australian. How does it affect them? The more the spending levels increase at a greater rate than Australia's national production, the larger the impact on the lives of individuals. The more the Government spends, the more discretion that bureaucrats, politicians, members of boards and members of quasi-government national bodies have over people spending and the less freedom individuals have to choose how to spend, save and invest their money for their future and collectively as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a quotation that I wanted to refer to which talks about the impact of greater and greater government control and greater and greater government spending upon the lives of individuals. It is by Professor Robert A. Nisbet, who was the Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities Fellow at Columbia University. In a 1975 essay entitled `The New Despotism' he states:</PARA>
<PARA>What has in fact happened during the past half century is that the bulk of power in our society, as it affects our intellectual, economic, social and cultural existences, has become largely invisible. And the reason this power is so commonly invisible to the eye is that it lies concealed under the humane purposes that have brought it into existence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Congresses and legislatures pass laws, executives enforce them and the courts interpret them. These . . . are the visible organs of government to this day, the objects of constant reporting in the media. And I would not question the capacity of each of them to interfere substantially with individual freedom. But of far greater importance in the realm of freedom is that invisible government created in the first instance by legislature and executive but rendered in due time largely autonomous [and] often nearly impervious to the will of elected constitutional bodies. In ways too numerous even to try to list, the invisible government-composed of commissions, bureaus and regulatory agencies of every imaginable kind-enters daily into . . . the minor details of life. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that indicates a phenomenon which became quite clear to me as a member of Estimates Committees for the very first time, being very aware of the size of this national government but in the Estimates Committee process being exposed to the minute detail of how government runs itself and seeing the enormous number of programs, boards, government departments and bodies that seem to interfere with the lives of so many. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that the Estimates Committee process is one way in which this Parliament, and we as a Senate, can try to make this expenditure more accountable to the people of Australia. I attended a seminar last week which was organised by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We looked at how effective our Committee processes were at making this expenditure more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask all of those government departments and all of the individual programs how effective they are; do they achieve their objectives; what performance criteria do they have; what sort of return on capital do they have? Of course, as a parliament, as Estimates Committees and as senators, we have a lot of trouble doing that because it is very hard, when dealing with government bodies, to have any way of comparing their performance with the performance of like bodies in the private sector. The vagueness of the answers which I received to many of my questions when asking public servants and members of the Government how they assess their performance was of great concern to me. I guess that it is very hard for those hard-working public servants to find the right performance criteria. Sometimes one would ask a public servant, `You spent $10m last year. What did you achieve with that $10m?', and the answer would be vague and non-specific. Then one would ask, `Why do you spend another 5 per cent, 8, 10, 15 or 100 per cent more next year if you don't know whether you have achieved anything last year?', and the answer would be equally vague. That is a matter of great concern to me as a senator and I think the Senate needs to work to make the Public Service and the Government more accountable for the way in which they spend the hard-earned dollars of the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to move to a micro-economic issue. This matter was brought to my attention during the Estimates process, and it relates to the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission. I asked a series of questions, along similar lines to those I have mentioned, about the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission. This is a body that has been established to better the corporate regulatory environment in Australia and to achieve a change, I guess as the Attorney-General would say, in the problems that Australia has had with its reputation, as far as corporate affairs is concerned, in the decade of the 1980s. This Government is centralising all control over corporate affairs under the control of the Attorney-General's Department and under the specific auspices of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the ability of the Attorney-General and the Australian Securities Commission to be up and running by 1 January 1991 start-up date which the Attorney-General and the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Hartnell, have indicated that they will have. I asked a series of questions about the number of staff they had recruited, how they had trained those staff to take up their duties on 1 January, whether the legislation which needs to go through the State parliaments to refer power to the Commonwealth had been introduced and whether that legislation had been seen. I received vague answers once again, and I will be pursuing that matter further in the Committee stages of these Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I was assured at these Estimates Committee meetings that, `We will all be ready on January first' and that `We've got no problems and we'll have a good corporate affairs regulatory environment. The Australian Securities Commission will take it all over-so don't you worry about that.'. The facts of the matter are that in my home city of Perth in Western Australia the Australian Securities Commission has leased 4 1/2 thousand square metres of office space, or thereabouts, and that is about all that has happened. The legislation has not been seen in State Parliament and it has only about 12 days left to sit. So this complicated legislation-the referral of powers legislation-needs to be passed through a State Parliament and none of the State parliamentarians has yet seen the legislation; I doubt that it has even been drafted. In fact, I believe this very evening in the other place a wad of legislation about the size of a telephone book is being introduced and I guess that we will be asked to rush that through this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Perth now, when we are told by the Attorney-General that we will have this new corporate affairs structure set up by 1 January, is that an acre of space is set aside in the middle of Perth and, basically, there is a requirement to fit that office space out and to have the Commission up and running before 1 January. The best estimates that one could possibly get from an interior design fit-out consultant or a builder is that it would take until at least March, April or May next year to fit out that sort of space. I am not sure where these people will be put because the Australian Securities Commission, at this stage, has not yet approached one single person in the Corporate Affairs Commission in Perth with an offer of work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One January is the date that it is to start. This will all be done in the 35 working days between now and Christmas. It has no staff and it has recruited no external staff to staff these offices; so I do not know who will fill up this acre of plush office accommodation in the middle of Perth. Obviously, the staff have not been trained to use the new powerful computer systems which will provide this great service to the people of Western Australia under the new Australian Securities Commission. It is relying on a new eight digit companies' number for the identification of 800,000 companies around Australia. In Western Australia very few people know about this companies' number and very few people know where they are required to print it. They are required to print it on letterheads, stationery, invoices, statements and cheque butts, but no-one knows about it. So we have this great new Australian Securities Commission which is being set up on 1 January; it has an office but it has no partitions and no staff who know how to use the computers and so I doubt sincerely whether we will have this great new companies and corporate affairs regulatory environment in place by 1 January. I call on the Attorney-General to reconsider his headlong rush to set up this body by 1 January.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this is only one example of the inefficiency that I exposed during the Estimates Committee hearings and obviously during the Committee stages of the Appropriations legislation we will go into far more detail. The important thing to realise about this is that the Attorney-General has blamed all of the so-called `corporate cowboys' of the 1980s for the problems of corporate Australia and the image we lack now. What he is doing, I think, is reminiscent of the actions of a lot of those so-called corporate cowboys in rushing, like a bull at a gate, to get his new Australian Securities Commission set up. I think it would be in the best interests of Australia's corporate image if we were to delay it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring up briefly tonight a quest by Mrs Sonia Turkington of Como in Western Australia. Probably no-one in this chamber has heard of her but the fiftieth anniversary of the mass internment of Italians during World War II occurs this year. Mrs Sonia Turkington, herself the daughter of one of those interned Italians, started this move by writing to the Premier of Western Australia, various Federal Ministers as well as to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case of those Italian internees was quite sad. At the time they were rounded up with no notice and treated like criminals. Those Italians were not subversive, but hard working people mostly living in tents or makeshift quarters. It was slightly different in Victoria because of the intervention of Archbishop Mannix at the time who spoke to the Federal Government and prevented such an event happening there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably some in sugar as well, but in this case I am putting the point of view of Western Australia. Of course, if the case fits Queensland, Victoria, South Australia or anywhere else, I will include them too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I doubt whether they were subversive or a danger to Australian security. Some were single but some were married with young children and their wives were left to their own resources with no help except, I presume, that from relatives and friends who took pity on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am old enough to remember the case in my own home town where rounded-up men were paraded around the streets, as each individual was picked up, and out into the outlying areas as if they were criminals. They were paraded and humiliated. Then they were locked up in one of the local disused halls with nothing but a heap of hay thrown in the middle to sleep on. Even our worst criminals are spared this humiliation. This was inflicted on innocent, hard working men who had no knowledge of, or care for, the war half-way around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, what senators must remember is that most of these people came from remote mountainous, agricultural regions in Italy. Because of overcrowding and no ability to get a job there where there was no industry, they migrated to different parts of the world. I personally remember the taunts and physical assaults we, as children of these people, had to contend with at school. I remember the discrimination we received from a few teachers and public servants although, amongst them, there were some kind and caring ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there were the malicious allegations made to the authorities against naturalised Italians not interned to get them locked up as well. Some succeeded in getting those people locked up. They succeeded by the use of malicious rumours and accusations, and those Italians spent the rest of the war interned. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, those allegations are on the public record now that the secret war files are open to everyone. I have looked at only one case where allegations were made against a person and we all know them to be totally untrue, yet they are there on the public record for his children, his children's children and, probably, his children's children's children to look at for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> In this age when Australia tries to portray itself to the rest of the world as still a land of opportunity, non-discrimination and equal opportunity the time has come to officially recognise and apologise for the injustices to those people who are still living and the families of those who are not. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government, and Government Ministers in this place, to view Mrs Turkington's request-as I said, she is the child of an internee-and to see what she is asking for, and hopefully the Government can see the reasons for granting her what she is asking. The Premier of New South Wales has already done that just in New South Wales. He has, on behalf of the people of New South Wales, taken it on himself to do just that. I believe that this Parliament should look at the idea of following Mr Greiner's lead for all of those involved around Australia. I wish Mrs Turkington every success in her endeavours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks this evening with respect to the operation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority (NCA), and in particular in relation to some remarks that have been made about that Committee and members of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we face some extraordinarily serious circumstances in respect of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. We face a situation where, in my view, Government members, individually and together, are engaging in an unwarranted and unjustified series of attacks on coalition members of that Committee. Why are they doing so? Is it in order to divert attention from the very substantial issues that need to be addressed? Is it to so taint the Committee's proceedings with acrimony and vitriol that it is rendered ineffective? I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, we face the situation where the Committee is being run, in my view, like the Marrickville Branch of the Australian Labor Party. When we look at the situation we see that it is a very ugly picture: Government members engaging, as I say, in unwarranted and unjustified personal attacks on members of the Committee and a Committee that is being disrupted by being run like a New South Wales Labor Party faction. There are ways to run some meetings and ways to run others and that is not the way to run this particular Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation gets much uglier. When we realise that much of what is being said is simply untrue, the picture becomes a very ugly one. We know that today a member of the Committee went into the House of House of Representatives and effectively misled the House. We know that by his own admission. He said in part, referring to Mr Justice Phillips, the new Chairman of the National Crime Authority, and some remarks that Mr Justice Phillips had made at his first meeting with the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>He said . . . He had seen the difficulties about the disclosure of sensitive information and the fact that politicians seem to want to rush into the Parliament and blab information through these processes. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Keefe drew further conclusions, and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Having reached that point, how do we get to a stage when last week Justice Phillips had to say informally to the Committee that he did not see any way that the NCA could deal with the Committee other than on the transcript and totally publicly?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Phillips, or the National Crime Authority, issued a press statement today which occasioned Mr O'Keefe immediately to go into the chamber and withdraw. I congratulate him for doing so-not that he had much choice. Mr Justice Phillips's statement included the following:</PARA>
<PARA>At my first meeting with the Parliamentary Joint Committee, I told them that I believed we could come to an accommodation whereby they received all the information that they needed, and that no members of the Authority would be embarrassed in answering questions about operational matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me interpose here that I have refreshed my memory with respect to that hearing, and it is not my view that Mr Justice Phillips, in saying what he did, was misrepresenting the situation. It is not my view that he told the Committee he was aware of members running into the House and blabbing information at all. But more importantly, other people-not only Mr O'Keefe-have suggested that the NCA is now concerned about whether it can trust this Committee. Mr Justice Phillips felt obliged-obviously, otherwise he would not have done it-to go on in his statement today to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I still maintain that belief-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that the Committee can work with the NCA-</PARA>
<PARA>and have never indicated any qualification or change of it to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a very sad series of circumstances in which Government members of the Committee have been portraying the situation that as a consequence of some honourable senators making a dissenting report to one of the Committee's reports, the NCA could no longer trust the Committee. They are very damaging statements to be making-damaging to the Committee-so much so that the Chair of the National Crime Authority has felt obliged to make his position clear. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be interested if the Chairman of the Committee would now explain in the other place why it is that he is reported, as I think I mentioned last night or the previous night, as having said that he knew that the NCA was concerned about the use of in camera evidence in that qualifying statement. I would appreciate it if the Chairman of the Committee would tell the House whether the journalist made a mistake, shall we say, or whether the journalist lied-though I am not of the view that that is the situation. I would appreciate the Chairman of the Committee, now that we have Mr Justice Phillips's statement that he still maintains that belief and he has never indicated any qualification of it, explaining to the House his position and I will be more than pleased to entertain in the most calm and rational manner any explanation he wishes to put as to why it is that the paper in my State has reported him as saying that he knows of the NCA's concern about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately Mr O'Keefe, who acknowledged that he had in effect misled the House today, went on to say a few other things which he has not withdrawn. Specifically he has said, firstly, that he moved the motion that this particular report be tabled. He did not do that, nor did he move the motion at the previous meeting that the report be made. The minutes of the meeting make this clear. I do not put much emphasis on that; it could have been a simple mistake on his part. It is not important who did or who did not move it. I mention it only because Mr O'Keefe thinks it is important to mention that he did, when in fact he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> He further said that he had provided the vehicle-that is, agreed that a report be made to this chamber-only on the basis that the dissent related only to procedural matters and that specifically it would not include any in camera evidence. He further said that the coalition members had agreed to this, and that is a very serious allegation for him to be making. I want to make it unequivocally clear to this chamber that no discussion as to the content of a qualifying statement took place and, further, that the use of in camera evidence was never raised at that meeting. Nor was it raised with me prior to the release of the report outside the meeting or in its environs. I am not trying to use any trick words to make my point. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked, as is my right, for a typed version of the secretary's notes of that meeting. I believe they will confirm what I have said. I have looked at the minutes of that meeting. They are clear minutes and show that no such discussion or agreement took place. I ask Mr O'Keefe to withdraw those remarks. They are manifestly untrue. There is not a single shred of evidence, there is not a statement that anyone made at that Committee meeting, that could lead him to make those remarks, and I ask that he withdraw them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the use of in camera evidence. I ask myself what it is that the Government is so sensitive about. In that dissenting report, or qualifying statement, there is not one scintilla of evidence revealed which could not have been asked and should not have been answered at public hearings by the NCA Committee. Let the Government members who are so upset about the release of that evidence point out what evidence they say should not have been revealed to the Parliament. Let them point out where they say an error of judgment has been made. I am happy to entertain a debate on that basis, and happy to apologise to the House if a case can be satisfied for that information not being revealed. But I do not believe such a case can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Loosley praised the Chairman last night by saying that he refuses to preside over a committee which rushes to judgment, or words to that effect. Yet the Chairman will preside over a committee that can take hours of evidence on two separate occasions and will force a vote on that evidence before the Hansard's of either of those days of evidence are available for honourable senators who wish to reflect on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may happen in this chamber but the point I am making is that in a committee that is dealing with sensitive matters-and on this occasion it was the most sensitive sort of matter that could have been dealt with-it is appropriate for honourable senators to be able to cast their vote having given very serious consideration to the evidence before them. I do not dispute that some would already have made up their mind. I say good luck to those who can quickly recall evidence from a few weeks before and be satisfied in their minds as to the weight they should give that evidence and compare it to the evidence they have heard on another day and then make up their mind. That is their right and privilege. I maintain it is not their right and privilege to expect other honourable senators to do the same when they want to reflect on these serious matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that some Government members voted on this particular matter that Senator Loosley was referring to without having been at the first day's hearings and, as the Hansard of that day was not available, without having read what had happened. They felt, despite that lack of availability of evidence, satisfied enough to vote on the matter raised on the day in question. That is their decision and I am happy for them to do that if that is what they want. But it was not my decision. That was not the situation I wanted to be pushed into, or that I think any honourable senator should be pushed into. </PARA>
<PARA> I will resist the temptation tonight-hopefully in future we can do this-to list the occasions on which the Committee has in my view been badly run, because I still hold some hope that the Committee can be put back on the tracks, that it will be no longer run in the way it has been and we can function as all the other committees I have worked on have, where we have serious disagreements about political issues and nonetheless use the committee as a forum to put our views forward and at least have them heard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unthinkable that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would refuse the right, for example, of some senators to be heard in this place. They might lose on a vote, but they have the right to be heard, and that should not be denied senators in committee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of Senator Loosley's remarks last night was basically that coalition members had done something intolerable in releasing some evidence-evidence which could have been sought at a public meeting and which the NCA could be expected to answer at a public meeting. The Committee is not permitted to inquire into operational matters under section 55 of the relevant Act. That section constrains the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It now seems from the remarks made by Senator Loosley and other Government members of the Committee that the Government does not even want the Committee to report on the administration of the NCA. That begs the question: what does the Government want the Committee to report on? What will the Committee ever be able to put before this Parliament if not matters that relate to the administration of the NCA rather than to operational matters? That is what the qualifying statement of the Committee report deals with-the administrative nightmare and fiasco that the NCA obviously was during the first six months of Mr Faris's chairmanship. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement of Justice Phillips is, I believe, very instructive. It displays no lack of trust or confidence in the Committee. Placed next to Senator Loosely's remarks of last night, the latter look a bit thin. I invite anyone who is interested to put the two together and make the judgment themselves. There is no point in me wasting your time, Mr Acting Deputy President, or that of other senators by going through seriatim the allegations made by Senator Loosley. I simply invite honourable senators to put the two statements together to see which one can stand up and which one has to fall down. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Loosley said that the Labor members of the Committee sent Hansard away from a meeting on Monday this week because they did not want to read about anything from a briefing from the NCA in the Adelaide Advertiser. That is an obvious inference that, were such a briefing to take place, presumably I-because I am the South Australian member on that Committee-would have leaked it to the Advertiser. I invite Senator Loosley to tell us when he has ever read anything from a confidential briefing in the Adelaide Advertiser, or, for that matter, in some other newspaper. I invite him to come in and back up his statement. As I said the last time I spoke in this place, let him back it up or back off. </PARA>
<PARA> Let Senator Loosley also explain why members of the Committee who were expecting a formal meeting with the NCA-this is the manner in which these meetings are conducted for very good reasons; they are formal meetings with Hansard taken for obvious reasons-found that Hansard had suddenly been despatched. Could he also explain why when they made inquiries at the end of the meeting they were told, as Senator Crichton-Browne said last night, that it was never intended to be an informal meeting and that the NCA had requested an informal meeting?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make something else abundantly clear: I know of no such request by the NCA to have a meeting without Hansard there, nor was that meeting ever intended to be informal. That is clear from the minutes of this Committee. What happened last night was that something much closer to the facts was revealed. Senator Loosley told the chamber that Labor members decided to send Hansard away. I believe they did that to build a picture that the NCA did not trust the Committee, and that deceitful plan came unstuck today. </PARA>

The reason for the presence of Hansard is that the task of the Committee is to oversee the NCA and report back to Parliament, and it cannot do that on the informal discussions it has had. It has to have transcripts of its discussions with the NCA to be able to report properly to Parliament, to peruse the nature of the discussions at a later date. How embarrassing! These people had been flown from all over the place--</PARA></TALK.START>

Because some dirty little plan was cooked up to try to make it look like some distrust existed between the NCA and the Committee. As I said, the kybosh was put on that deceitful little plan today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, of course, invites further questions. I would be interested in Senator Loosley at some later stage telling the Senate why the Labor members, who, I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President-although I do not need to do so, with your long experience in this place-do not have a majority on the Committee, feel entitled to change a committee's program at will without consulting the other members. Coalition members were not consulted; Senator Spindler was not consulted. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that, if the Government wants to have its way on a committee, it can put a motion and when the committee is divided, as it would perhaps have been on this matter, the chairman has a casting vote. In that way, the Government can have what it wants. That is why we were not consulted and why the Democrats were not consulted: the Chairman could not really bring himself to put it formally at a meeting and use a casting vote, which he has when a motion is put, and run the risk of having to put in the minutes the lie that some Government members are peddling-namely, that the NCA could not trust the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the proper conduct of meetings. The Liberals do not have the numbers in this place; the Democrats do not have the numbers; Senator Harradine does not have the numbers; Senator Vallentine does not have the numbers. However, by virtue of having a place in this chamber, they have a right to speak and be heard. That right should follow through to committees. They will not function if that right is not permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently the Labor members on this Committee-let me not include all Labor members in general, because I have worked on a number of committees and have never had problems like this-do not see a need to show the same courtesy at NCA Committee meetings. The simple facts are these. Government members did not want to pursue matters surrounding Operation Ark. I do not think they would disagree with that. They agreed to report to Parliament on the basis of the Committee's current knowledge. That was an acceptable resolution of a difference of opinion. Government members did not want to go on with the matter; coalition members did. The way to resolve it was to report on what the Committee knew at that stage and let Parliament decide whether the Committee should go further. So they agreed to report to Parliament on the basis of the Committee's current knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> They then tried to shelve the report. That was a very embarrassing incident. We had the Chairman of the Committee saying, `There was never any intention to put this report before Parliament', and paragraphs two and three of the draft report explained why it was going to Parliament. It was a very embarrassing exercise. Nonetheless, that attempt at shelving the report was not successful.</PARA>
<PARA> A dissenting report or qualifying statement has been put to Parliament. It revealed the administrative fiasco in the NCA during the first six months of Mr Faris's chairmanship. All the evidence in that report is evidence which could have been sought at a public meeting and which the NCA could have expected to answer at a public meeting, yet Government members have been engaging in a disgraceful bout of baseless attacks on coalition members. They have improperly sought to create the impression that the NCA no longer trusted the Committee. They look stupid for having done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members have complained, and complained to me, that they were not shown the qualifying statement prior to the tabling of the report. Normally they would have been, I quite agree, but this was not a normal situation. It was a situation where some Government members had tried to suggest that the report should be a report to ourselves. How ridiculous! What a waste of secretariat time-reporting a report to oneself. In other words, Government members changed their minds and did not want to report to Parliament. That can only lead one to wonder why. </PARA>
<PARA> What do honourable senators think would happen if those members of the Committee knew that the report would tell Parliament what Government members did not want Parliament to be told-that is, that the tensions in the NCA at that time were intolerable and that this must have impacted on the efficiency of the Authority? That is all that the qualifying statement says. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable senators what would have happened. The Labor fellows would have got together and moved a motion to delay the report by a few months to give them time to move a rescission motion, which, as honourable senators know, they need seven days for. And then none of this material, quite properly put before Parliament, would have seen the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the disclosure of evidence before the Committee, I have already said that nothing was disclosed that could not and should not have been given in evidence at a public hearing. It is interesting that Labor members think evidence should be released only if the majority agrees. </PARA>
<PARA> None of them has told us when the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties was asked by Mr Melham, very confidently, about the right of individual senators to reveal such information, what Mr Ron Merkel from the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties said. He responded to the effect that it was not so much a right but an obligation. In signing the qualifying statement, I believe that I was fulfilling my obligation as a Committee member to report to the Parliament on the operation of the NCA. This is an important function. The monitoring of a body with the powers the NCA has is a very important protection of our democratic rights. I will not be put off that task by cheap innuendo and unsubstantiated, outrageous allegations by Government members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise. It is probably my preoccupation with Senator Vallentine that caused me to say that. I do say that Senator Vanstone was right in absolutely everything she said in substance. It seems to me that, besides all the other sins of the Labor members of this Committee, there is an abysmal lack of understanding of Standing Orders. I do not say that by way of mitigation but in respect of their compounding the sin. If they are going to embark themselves on certain activities and certain conducts they have got to understand-as I said last night-that there is more in politics than numbers when one gets into the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The old adage in the Right of New South Wales that if one has the numbers everything else will follow fails in this place. It fails most of all on committees, where the Standing Orders provide very clearly how one can be accommodated. Mr O'Keefe said that they had indicated that the dissent was simply to be their protest, that we had used the guillotine to get the matter finished, and that there would be no further delay of another three or four weeks to consider the transcript after we had sat there and had about five hours of discussion with a number of Queen's Counsel. I said I was prepared to provide the vehicle, the report on Operation Ark, and I was prepared to wear their dissent on the matter of that procedure, but I was not prepared to have that dissent cover the issues that had been involved in in camera discussions.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate: How could any member or senator who has been in the place for two minutes possibly imagine that being a signatory to a majority report gives one some right to vote on the content of the minority report, or worse still, that, having chosen to sign a report, one has some right to vote as to whether there is going to be a minority report? But perhaps it was best epitomised when he said he would allow a report to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Here was the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, the responsibilities of which are enshrined in section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act, required to inquire into Operation Ark, and there was some consideration as to whether the Committee would report to the Parliament. Now, the very reason that the Committee is dealt with in the Act is to have it report to the Parliament so as to ensure there is some accountability by the National Crime Authority to the Parliament, and through the Parliament to the wider community-to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Here there was some discussion as to whether or not there would be a report on the very issue which the Committee had been addressing at some length. Then there was an absurd proposition that in some gratuitous way Government members of the Committee would allow us to have a minority report, and that we could have a minority report only providing that we said what they wanted. How steeped in ignorance can one be? However, they are the facts. Notwithstanding that that was the claim, as Senator Vanstone says, that is quite untrue. That was not the discussion; that was not the consideration; and that was certainly least of all a deliberation. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the matter of in camera evidence, which has been discussed. I will save that for another time save to say that the question of the use of in camera evidence and its necessity is very much in the eye of the architects of the majority report and the minority report. To begin now to argue some fundamental principle that there is something wrong with it, and to start at committees to move motions that in camera evidence will not be made public through a report, is simply a manner and mechanism of censorship of minority reports. I suspect that that is one of the reasons that the architects of the Standing Orders provided. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be quite simple by virtue of the numbers on a committee to take all evidence in camera and then have the majority of the numbers on the committee decide what in camera evidence would be released in the majority report, but not in the minority report. It is a classic mechanism for censorship, and it is not what I advocate to a government shortly to be in opposition. I remind the Senate that the last report that had a great deal of in camera evidence of a very sensitive and very serious nature was the report on drugs in sport. One of the signatories to that unanimous report was Senator Collins, now a Minister. So it is very much a subjective judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I am moved to the temptation of the view that it is not the principle of using in camera evidence that offends the majority on this Committee; it is the fact that the minority report, together with the in camera evidence, exposes the fact that the majority members of the Committee were not prepared to deal with some very serious matters. I suspect that thus far that is why the Government itself, and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in particular, have been very silent in their response. It has exposed some matters that needed to be exposed, and it has clearly exposed the majority members as seeking to cover up what ought to be exposed. That is more offending and more agitating than the fact that the in camera evidence was used in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn ever so briefly to Mr O'Keefe's comments today. We can thank Justice Phillips that we had Mr O'Keefe go back into the Parliament and apologise to the Parliament-using the parlance of parliamentary language-for misleading the chamber. I rather wonder whether, if Justice Phillips had sat silent, we would have had that apology, or whether those misleading, inaccurate and fundamentally untrue statements would still be sitting on the Hansard record irrefutably undenied. It is important that what was said by Mr O'Keefe be understood. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I do not mind telling the Parliament this-that about two or three weeks ago, or it might be a bit longer than that, the new Chairman of the NCA, Justice Phillips, met with the NCA parliamentary Joint Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is true-</PARA>
<PARA>It was his first meeting with the Joint Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is true; this is what is pertinent-</PARA>
<PARA>He said that he had observed the relationship that had developed over the years-</PARA>
<PARA>that is untrue-</PARA>
<PARA>He had seen the difficulties about the disclosure of sensitive information and the fact that politicians seem to want to rush into the Parliament and blab information through these processes. This led to a very difficult relationship between the NCA and the parliamentary Joint Committee. He said that he had noticed the shift that had taken place since Mr Faris had taken up his chairmanship. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely totally untrue. Not one of those words or the impressions or the inferences was uttered by Justice Phillips. Then we had the further compounding of that untruth. Mr O'Keefe said:</PARA>
<PARA> Having reached that point, how do we get to a stage when last week Justice Phillips had to say informally to the Committee that he did not see any way that the NCA could deal with the Committee other than on the transcript and totally publicly? In other words, five years of work went down the drain in two weeks of work by two people-</PARA>
<PARA>the two people being Senators Vanstone and Crichton-Browne. Those are the claims made by Mr O'Keefe. I remind honourable senators of the immediate rebuttal of Justice Phillips, the Chairman, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>At my first meeting with the PJC committee, I told them that I believed we could come to an accommodation whereby they received all the information that they needed, and that no members of the Authority would be embarrassed in answering questions about operational matters-</PARA>
<PARA>not general, informal, casual matters but of an operational nature. He went on to say in conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>I still maintain that belief and have never indicated any qualification or change of it to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Justice Phillips said frankly that Mr O'Keefe was telling lies. His statement declared Mr O'Keefe to be a liar. </PARA>

Mr O'Keefe, being politically sensitive, would understand who the public would believe, and he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

I expressed my grave concerns about the effect of the long term relationship between the National Crime Authority . . . and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority caused by the actions of Senators Vanstone and Crichton-Browne in releasing confidential in camera evidence in breach of the terms under which the Committee agreed to report on Operation Ark. </PARA>

<PARA>Confronted with the truth, Mr O'Keefe regurgitated it. I find it particularly unfortunate that it took the courage and the commitment of Mr Justice Phillips to address this matter. He did make one thing fundamentally clear to our Committee. When asked two provocative, unhelpful and embarrassing questions of a political nature, he made it quite clear that he had no intention of becoming involved in matters of political decisions. He made it quite clear that he would not become involved in matters of conflict between various members of the Committee. I got the impression-I hope this does not provoke a statement from him-when Justice Phillips answered the second time that there was just a touch of steel in his voice. He had been asked two questions and he had been caused to respond that he would not get involved in the politics of the Committee. That was a pretty clear message, I would have thought, to even the insensitive members of that Committee. He was not inviting questions of that nature either then or in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few matters have been raised tonight. Senator Panizza raised the question of treatment of people during the Second World War. From his speech I did not pick up completely what he thought the remedy would be but the Government acknowledges that many people were badly treated during that time by the then United Australia Party and treated a little better under the Labour Party rule during the Second World War-but nothing to be proud about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the essential problems of the time was that there was no Australian Citizenship Act. Had there been, many of those problems would have been resolved. It is interesting that many of the Italians now about 60 years to 70 years of age are starting to write their memoirs of this period and of their experiences in Australia and during the Second World War. Some of it makes very fascinating and intriguing reading. No doubt Senator Panizza will continue to take up these matters and hopefully will be able to progress his views further. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Vanstone spoke on the National Crime Authority. I do not claim to be able to follow the byzantine intricacies in this particular spat. It seems to be reaching Blue Hills proportions. There are concerns, not necessarily as expressed by the two senators who have addressed the matter tonight about the disclosure of in camera evidence. It is not necessarily to do with whether the evidence is in a minority report or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that there are two different issues running: one is minority reports and one is in camera evidence. They are two different principles. If in camera evidence is to be consistently disclosed it would be my attitude and the attitude of all Government members that they will not participate in in camera hearings in future and that all hearings will have to be open. Then there can be no further dispute about disclosure or otherwise. It is very hard to judge, having taken in camera evidence, whether it should be public record. It is to do with committee systems and whether witnesses will come forward in future, et cetera. I now favour all evidence being on the record. If people do not want to give evidence, the committee system will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot comment on the to-ing and fro-ing between the two chambers on the National Crime Authority. Senator Vanstone says that the committee system is being attacked. I cannot judge that. I can judge one or two other committees in this Parliament and in this chamber that have been so reduced by the behaviour of at least one coalition member that I cringe every time I watch it. That is one of the estimates committees. The treatment of public servants who appear before that committee is one of the biggest disgraces that I have seen in this Parliament in the 10 years I have been here. That is something I will take up another time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne blatantly misled the Senate tonight. His opening remarks were that he would be brief. As usual, he went on for about 15 or 20 minutes. I would just like to draw that to your attention, Mr Deputy President. In conclusion, if I had my time over again, I would vote for Senator Crichton-Browne and not you to be in that chair because I would not have to listen to him on the adjournment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government has pursued every appropriate avenue to promote the safety and welfare of Australians in Kuwait. The Government has made repeated representations to the Iraqi authorities to allow Australians (and other foreign nationals) asking to leave Kuwait to do so. Australian women and children wishing to leave were successfully evacuated from Kuwait with the assistance of several of our Embassies, particularly Baghdad and Amman, and other arms of government, including the RAAF. While our concern now focuses on the Australians remaining in Kuwait, we are equally active and concerned about Australians restrained from leaving Iraq. We do not have a resident Australian Embassy in Kuwait, but have received close cooperation from western missions in Kuwait. Officers from our Embassy in Baghdad have made four visits to Kuwait in difficult circumstances to assist Australians there, and more visits are planned. However, the Iraqi authorities have recently suspended permission for diplomats from Baghdad to travel to Kuwait, a move which we are seeking to have reversed. Our Embassy in Baghdad is managing to maintain indirect contact with Australians in Kuwait, and is continuing to provide other practical assistance such as passing on medicine and messages and mail from next of kin. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also kept in close touch with next of kin of those Australians unable to leave Kuwait and Iraq. The Government has also broadcast a series of messages of advice and encouragement through Radio Australia to Australians in Kuwait, the most recent being made by the Prime Minister on 4 October. The Prime Minister said that the Government would deal sympathetically with requests for assistance where families of those trapped in Kuwait and Iraq were in particular need, and called upon financial institutions and other organisations to be sympathetic and fair in dealings affecting families with breadwinners held in Kuwait and Iraq. Australia has also lent its full support to the Security Council Resolutions calling for the Iraqi authorities to give immediate and unconditional approval to foreign nationals to depart from Kuwait and Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) We estimate that there are 35 Australians still in Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Government acted quickly to implement the comprehensive mandatory sanctions on Iraq applied by UN Security Council Resolution 661. Relevant Government departments and authorities are alert to the need for strict enforcement of these measures to ensure adherence to the UN sanctions and are acting accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>(A) 7 August, the Minister for Defence withdrew his permissions under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, effectively blocking all exports of military related equipment to Iraq. (B) The Australian Customs (Prohibited Exports) and (Prohibited Imports) Regulations were amended on 8 August to prohibit the import of goods from, and export of goods to, Iraq and Kuwait</PARA>
<PARA> (i) if there is an attempted import or export of goods in breach of these regulations, the relevant goods are subject under the Customs Act to forfeiture to the crown</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Austrade has directed its staff not to engage in any activity in relation to the expansion or promotion of Australian trade to Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA>(C) The banking (foreign exchange) regulations were also amended to stop the movement of funds in and out of Australia to or from the Governments of Iraq and Kuwait, their agencies or nationals, without specific approval from the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>(D) Migration regulations effective from 31 August ensure that prospective visitors to Australia who would be likely to engage in commercial or other activities involving Iraq or Kuwait in breach of Resolution 661 will be precluded from obtaining visas.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In 1989-90 Kuwait was the source of some 5.5% of Australia's crude oil imports and less than 2% of Australia's refined petroleum product imports. In 1989-90 Gulf States provided 21 per cent of total crude oil refinery input in Australia. Consistent with its obligations to abide by UN economic sanctions against Iraq, Australia has ceased importing petroleum from Iraq and Kuwait. Several shiploads of Kuwaiti oil which had been paid for before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and were loaded or on the high seas have been allowed to be landed in Australia after the necessary exemptions were granted under the Australian Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. These shipments were fully consistent with Australia's obligations in relation to UN sanctions against Iraq.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The following payments have been made by the Commonwealth to Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd for the Ravenshoe mill:</PARA>
<PARA> June l988: Loan...$4,500,000</PARA>
<PARA> July 1989: subsidy...$2,125,000</PARA>
<PARA> January 1990: early part payment</PARA>
<PARA> of subsidy...$968,841</PARA>
<PARA> Total...$7,593,841</PARA>
<PARA> The company made one loan</PARA>
<PARA> repayment of:...$300,000</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-(4) These payments to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd were made following the formal Agreement between the Commonwealth and Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd which was signed on 29 June 1988. The Agreement was drawn up by the Attorney-General's Department on the basis of advice from the Department following consultation with an inter-departmental meeting comprising the Departments of Finance; Primary Industry and Energy; Attorney-General; and the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth monitored the loan and subsidy assistance. For example, the sawmill was visited by DASETT departmental officers on several occasions and regular telephone conversations occurred with the company to ascertain progress on the sawmill re-tooling and staffing levels. The Department satisfied itself that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the sawmill work force remained above forty all the time,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the first loan repayment was made on time, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the retooling was taking place.</PARA>
<PARA> Current indications are that the sawmill appears to have operated at an overall profit from 1 July 1988 to 20 April 1990 (the date of appointment of Receivers).</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commonwealth sought audited annual financial reports from the Company. In March 1990 as part of a mid-term evaluation of the program, the department requested its financial advisers, Price Waterhouse, to carry out a review of company records, paying particular attention to validating that the assistance was being used for the purposes set out in the agreement and to report generally on the uses to which the funds had been put.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's system and procedures for administering the Structural Adjustment Package were the subject of an internal audit in January/February 1989 to assess their adequacy and effectiveness. At that time, compliance with the Audit Act 1901, Finance Regulations and Directions, and other relevant instructions was also reviewed. The administration of the Structural adjustment Package was reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in March/April 1990. The ANAO's review assessed the adequacy of controls over:</PARA>
<PARA> * the receipt of applications for assistance*</PARA>
<PARA> * the determination of entitlements, and the payment of moneys.</PARA>
<PARA> In neither case were any problems identified in relation to the payments to Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) By deed made on 20 April 1990 between Gary Erle Dibley (Acting Chief Manager, Sydney Office, Westpac Banking Corporation) and Barry Raymond Cook and Gregory Paul Kelly, Messrs Cook and Kelly were appointed the Receivers of the undertaking and assets of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd. On 4 July 1990 a letter was sent to Mr G Keny terminating the agreement between Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth dated 29 June 1988. The letter sought repayment of the $4,200,000 outstanding from the loan, and invited negotiations for temporary assistance during 1990/91 to keep the APS sawmill at Ravenshoe operating until a purchaser was found for the sawmill.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No payments have been made under the Agreement of 29 June 1988 since it was terminated on 4 July 1990. However, on 26 October 1990 a payment of $188,000 was made to the Receivers under an agreement between them and the Commonwealth for payment of amounts up to $467,000 to assist them in keeping the APS sawmill at Ravenshoe operating for a short period while they endeavour to sell the mill as a going concern. The Receivers will endeavour to maintain a work force at the APS mill at 48 employees and in any event will not allow it to fall below forty employees during this period.</PARA>
<PARA>(7) to (9) The Commonwealth was not a party to arrangements between the sawmill and its creditors and is not aware of the reasons for individual commercial decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>(10) and (11) On 15 April 1988 the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories announced``a package of job creation, labour adjustment assistance and business compensation worth up to $75.3 million to offset the impacts of the cessation of rainforest logging in the wet tropical rainforests of North Queensland.'' The Minister said that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The financial assistance and jobs package includes:</PARA>
<PARA> - Up to $50.9 million over the next three years to create jobs and provide other adjustment assistance for displaced workers.</PARA>
<PARA> - Up to $24.4 million for companies and businesses. This will include:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Major timber companies previously logging inside the World Heritage area;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Other businesses including logging contractors, sleeper cutters, suppliers and rainforest timber users; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. A series of payments for the retooling of the Associated Plywood Sales (APS) mill at Ravenshoe to enable it to process plantation timbers. Negotiations with APS will decide both the size and schedule of payments.''</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Business compensation under the Structural Adjustment Package is paid to any businesses that could demonstrate</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that they were logging or sawmilling companies or contractors or closely related businesses which were substantially dependent on the timber industry (ie, their principal activity is/was the direct supply to, or use of the products of, the logging and sawmilling industry); and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department's corporate plan identifies a range of strategic priorities which are delivered through various programs. Biotechnology is seen by the Department as a series of technologies which are encompassed by several of the strategic priorities, rather than as the basis for a strategic plan in its own right. The Department recognises the important contribution biotechnology can make to the competitiveness of Australian firms and supports strategic research and development in biotechnology under the Grants for Industry Research and Development (GIRD) scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Research and Development Board's Biotechnology Committee consults with industry to identify priority areas for biotechnology research funding. This on-going process has included an assessment of the opportunities for biotechnology to contribute to the development and competitiveness of Australia's marine industries, especially aquaculture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) There are three Special Air Service personnel in Papua New Guinea at the present time. There is a Captain and a Warrant Officer located at Goldie River Training Depot. They are there in the capacity of instructors, training the PNG infantry in basic infantry procedures.

All were posted to Papua New Guinea in January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Papua New Guinea's policy on Bougainville is an internal matter for the Government of Papua New Guinea and has always been regarded so by the Australian Government. The Australian Government supports the Papua New Guinea Government's stated policy of negotiating a peaceful solution to the Bougainville problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Bougainville is not a matter for unilateral action by Australia. There has been no scope for Australian `mediation' in this internal PNG issue. But the Australian Government has always made clear its readiness to consider any practical help which might facilitate a solution, and that it is prepared to help where it can in reconstruction on Bougainville once a settlement has been reached. Australia has also offered to provide humanitarian assistance, should our help be required.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. There is only the normal requirement for Papua New Guinea to seek Australia's agreement before sale or transfer of the patrol boats to a third country.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As has been reported in both the Australian and PNG media, Papua New Guinea has used its patrol boats in patrolling operations around Bougainville and to escort civilian vessels involved in the recent attempt to restore government services to the province.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) In providing assistance to Papua New Guinea Australia was responding to requests from the democratically elected and properly constituted Government of Papua New Guinea.

<PARA> (8) (a) The Australian Government has not been involved in and (b) pressuring the PNG Government on any issue. Regular high-level dialogue takes place with the Government of Papua New Guinea about the whole range of our interests on the basis of our shared commitment to constructive neighbourly co-operation.

These patches are designed to be applied to the skin and to deliver a pre-determined dose of oestradiol, one of the most active of the naturally occurring female oestrogen hormones.</PARA>
<PARA>These particular patches have been considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC), an independent body of experts whose job it is to advise the Minister as to whether or not a drug should be marketed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Total programmed aid to PNG in 1990/91 is estimated at $306.6m compared to expenditure of $313.0m in 1989/90. In addition, unprogrammed aid expenditure (including emergency aid, aid through non-government organisations, the Development Import Finance Facility and aid expenditure by other Departments) was estimated at $24.8M in 1989/90. Accurate estimates of unprogrammed expenditure in 1990/91 are not yet available but are expected to be of roughly the same order.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The bulk of Australia's aid ($275m in 1990/91) is in the form of untied budget support representing at present about 17 per cent of PNG's budget outlays. It is not possible therefore to specify the geographic destination of these funds.</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the project aid program ($31.6m in 1990/91) is focused on human resources development and strengthening key institutions (taxation, customs, civil aviation, financial management for Provincial Government staff, the police, agricultural research and extension, and land administration). These activities have nation-wide benefits. However there are two integrated rural development projects focused on specific areas:</PARA>
<PARA> - the South Simbu rural development project aims to increase the income and improve the nutritional status of the population of two of the poorest districts in PNG situated in the south of Simbu Province. The project is concentrating on the development of food production, livestock, mixed farming and fisheries. The project will improve farmer access to technical advice, farm inputs and markets. The project is being jointly funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development ($US3.5m loan) and AIDAB ($A3.3m grant). An appraisal/design study is being conducted in 1990 to prepare for the extension of the project to a number of districts in North Simbu;</PARA>
<PARA> - the Kandrian-Gloucester District Development Project Feasibility Study is focused on the Kandrian-Gloucester district of West New Britain province. This region has a very low level of per capita income. It aims to establish the viability of a project which would aim to increase and sustain the rate of economic development within the project area, establish the physical and social infrastructure necessary for an accelerated rate of economic development, improve the provision of health and education services to isolated communities and their nutritional status; and develop an effective management and planning capacity at district and provincial levels of Government. The estimated cost of the feasibility study is $955,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the payment of monthly cheques by AIDAB, budget support is administered by the PNG Government as part of its total budgetary revenue. The Australian Government does not have a say in how these funds are spent, but AIDAB closely monitors PNG's economic management and performance. Project aid is jointly administered by the PNG Government and AIDAB, and is generally tied to the provision of Australian goods and services. Within AIDAB, the PNG program is managed by the Director of a Section (Pacific and Papua New Guinea Branch, Country Programs Division). The Director and staff are responsible for policy development, program delivery, the pipeline of activities and oversight of expenditure. In fulfilling these responsibilities, the Director consults closely with the Counsellor (Development Assistance) and staff, Port Moresby, whose duties centre on liaison with PNG officials, initiation of new activities and the implementation and monitoring of the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Budget support, which accounts for approximately 90% of programmable aid in 1990/91, is administered by the PNG Government. All project aid is channelled through the national Government although some provinces and areas benefit from specific projects eg. the South Simbu and proposed North Simbu Rural Development Projects, the proposed KandrianGloucester District Development Project (see above). Also a Financial Management Improvement Project, which Australia is cofinancing with UNDP, includes computerisation of the financial management system of the 19 Provincial Governments and the training of 600 Provincial staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Apart from the integrated rural development projects above, there are currently three projects in the agriculture sector:</PARA>
<PARA> - the Coffee Development Agency Project (Australian contribution of $3.5M) which aims to assist in the control of coffee leaf rust through the provision of expert advisers and equipment;</PARA>
<PARA> - the Coffee Research Institute Project ($3.2M), a collaborative research program between the Coffee Research Institute and the Plant Research Institute of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Victoria, which aims to improve the productivity of PNG coffee growers; and</PARA>
<PARA> - the Cocoa Quality Improvement Project ($3.4M) which aims to improve the quality of cocoa grown by smallholders through a program of applied research and extension of existing technology.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's assistance to each of these projects is mainly in the form of advisory services and training.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research, which is funded under the aid program, has undertaken a total of 17 projects with a total financial commitment of $11.3M in PNG and the South Pacific. Projects completed or currently under way in PNG include</PARA>
<PARA> - Transport and Storage of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables;</PARA>

<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will nominate a suitably qualified scientist to participate in a scientific delegation to visit Johnston Atoll early next year. The visit will provide the opportunity to assess at first hand both the storage arrangements and operation of the facility. A visit to the facility by senior South Pacific Forum country officials is also being arranged and is expected to take place early next year. Australia will be represented on that visit. The Department is engaged in on-going discussions with United States officials to ensure that environmental and safety standards are continuously applied to all aspects of the destruction program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In a letter to the Chairman of the South Pacific Forum the U.S. Secretary of Defence Cheney has advised that all chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll will be destroyed and not retained as part of the United States' retaliatory stockpile. Following the `Four Corners' program my Department sought and received confirmation that the position stated by Secretary Cheney was the authoritative U.S. position in relation to the stocks shipped from Germany and those currently on Johnston Atoll. A senior U.S. official described any statements to the contrary in the `Four Corners' Program as misleading and inaccurate. The intention to destroy these weapons was recently reiterated to me at the Australia-United States Ministerial talks held in Washington on 8 October.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As I made clear in the `Four Corners' documentary, the position taken by the Australian Government on the Johnston Atoll facility is contingent on the destruction of the chemical weapons. The Australian Government has also made clear that its support for the destruction program is based on the facility only being used for the destruction of stocks already there, those being brought from Germany and possibly, old Pacific stocks and that it is to be closed down after those operations are finished.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australia has maintained close contact with other countries concerned over the situation in Myanmar with the aim of taking joint action whenever this is possible. After the Myanmar elections on 28 May, I wrote to the leader of the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), Senior General Saw Maung, requesting the SLORC to make an early transfer of power to a democratically-elected government, and release political detainees. I also wrote to the leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which won the majority of seats in the elections, offering the Australian Government's support. At that time, I urged likeminded Governments to take similar action. Australia has been regularly associated with joint diplomatic demarches in Yangon in which the United States and European Community countries have also been prominent. Most recently, Australia joined eighteen other countries, including the US and Japan, in a demarche organised by the European Community. The demarche, which took place on 21 September, expressed the hope that democracy would soon be restored to Myanmar in accordance with the wishes of the people as expressed in the May elections. I also raised the situation in Myanmar with my ASEAN ministerial colleagues at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference in July. At the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), I drew attention to the situation in Myanmar in my address to the General Assembly. Australia has also raised the situation in Myanmar in the Third Committee debate on self-determination.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At the UNGA I was able to meet with the leader of the Myanmar delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw. During our discussions, I expressed great concern that the ruling SLORC are showing no signs of transferring power to a democratic government and observed that the situation in Myanmar appears to be explosive. I was also critical of human rights abuses that are occurring in Myanmar including the detention of a locally employed staff member at the Australian Embassy and the continued detention of the General Secretary of the NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) At the UNGA, and during the Australia-United States Ministerial Talks on 8 October in Washington, I also had opportunities to meet with a number of ministerial colleagues from other countries and was able to explore further possibilities for international action. Australia is now taking further action, focused on coordinated statements at the United Nations General Assembly and action in the UN Commission on Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is correct that the US Congress has recently passed a bill calling for the US President to impose appropriate economic sanctions against Myanmar if Myanmar did not end martial law, transfer power to a civilian government, release political prisoners and take effective action against narcotics production by 1 October. The US Government has recently sought Australian support for such action and the possibility of Australia joining the US in applying sanctions is currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The utility of imposing trade sanctions has, among other things, to be measured by the extent of likely international support for them. It is open to doubt whether sufficiently broad support for sanctions yet exists. The Government is assessing this question in consultation with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I would be happy to meet with the Australian representatives of the Democratic Alliance of Burma should they ask to meet me. I have consistently been supportive of the views of the Burmese community in Australia and their desire for democratic reform in Myanmar.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3851" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (l) There have been media reports to the effect that fighting between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government forces has intensified. The intensification of hostilities was the result of an offensive launched on 22 August by the Sri Lankan Government forces against the Jaffna Peninsula, the heartland of the LTTE, to relieve an army garrison that had been besieged in Jaffna Fort since hostilities commenced in June. On 13 September the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) did, in fact, succeed in breaking through to the fort, despite heavy resistance from the LTTE. They were unable to press on further into the peninsula, and thirteen days later the SLA withdrew from the fort itself and evacuated almost all the gains achieved by the offensive. Following the withdrawal, the situation reportedly calmed, and Jaffna returned virtually to normal. On 16 October, however, the SLA launched another major offensive against the Jaffna Peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is a considerable degree of confusion about the situation on the ground in the affected areas. The LTTE in particular has worked actively and effectively to focus international attention on its claims of genocide and devastation in Jaffna. Whilst it would be an exaggeration to say that Jaffna and other cities have been `destroyed', during `Operation Fort' in August and September, the level of aerial bombardment did intensify as did the consequent level of material damage and civilian deaths.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The resumption of hostilities between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers has witnessed clear instances of human rights violations by both sides, the incidence of which continues to be high. The LTTE have perpetrated a number of atrocities, especially against Muslim communities in eastern Sri Lanka. There have also been atrocities and other actions involving abuses of human rights perpetrated by individuals or individual units within the Sri Lankan security forces, apparently acting on their own initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Government has been most disturbed by the indiscriminate killing of civilians that has occurred since hostilities resumed in June. I have made formal public statements expressing concern on three occasions (on 22 June, 7 August and in the Parliament on 19 September). I have condemned the actions of the LTTE in breaking the ceasefire and in perpetrating the massacres against Muslim civilians. The Australian Government believes the Sri Lankan Government has been making genuine efforts to maintain effective discipline amongst its forces. Some units of the Sri Lankan security forces have nonetheless perpetrated a number of excesses, and as a result we have expressed our concern and reminded the Sri Lankan Government of the need for restraint.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. The Australian aid program to Sri Lanka consists of developmental food aid, postgraduate training awards in Australia, a rehabilitation and reconstruction program in the North and North East, and minor activities managed by the Australian High Commission in Colombo, as well as special emergency assistance, worth $200,000, that has been directed through UNICEF, Care Australia and Community Aid Abroad. The nature of these activities is such as to ensure that funds are directed to the intended beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As I outlined to the Senate on 19 September and as the Prime Minister elaborated subsequently in the House on 11 October, following my discussions with President Premadasa during my visit to Sri Lanka in August about ways of making progress towards a peaceful settlement, the Prime Minister wrote to President Premadasa to set out some options in the Commonwealth context which the Sri Lankans might like to pursue. We await a response from President Premadasa to Mr Hawke's letter and, in the interim, continue to follow events in Sri Lanka closely with a sense of deep concern.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) I am advised that the United States authorities indicated to the Australian Government their consideration of several alternative routes for the transportation of chemical weapons from Germany to Johnston Atoll. Although there was no obligation for the United States to consult Australia on their final decision, the Government was given to understand that the route most likely to be chosen would maximise transit in international waters and that these routes were classified to improve the safety and security of the operation. I understand that shipment has almost concluded. The nature of the cargo comprised the US stockpile in Germany which consisted of 100,000 steel walled artillery projectiles filled with two nerve agents.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The Government has been provided with information outlining the very stringent precautions being taken to ensure the safety of the operation. In the highly improbable event of an explosion on board either of the vessels used for the shipment, I understand that the cargo would be released to a maximum of two miles downwind before dispersion reduced the risks posed by any leakage to negligible levels. On the other hand, if either of the vessels were to sink, the cargo would eventually leak from the projectiles but be rapidly inactivated through hydrolysis by sea water. Several ships loaded with similar cargoes were scuttled in the Atlantic in the late 1960s, without any recorded adverse environmental impacts. As one of many safeguards against accident, the present convoy is being escorted by United States navy and coastguard vessels equipped to respond to any emergency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) In late 1989 the Health Insurance Commission put forward a new processing strategy for the payment of pharmaceutical benefits. Part of that processing strategy involved installation of a data collection and transmission type device in pharmacies to facilitate the claims processing and payment cycle. This was not continued with. The Government announced in its August 1990 Budget that eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits would be restricted to Australian residents only and that the Commission would provide a computer system whereby pharmacists, if they wished, could check a person's entitlement to subsidised medication. Any such checking arrangements would be the subject of legislative enactment and Privacy Commissioner's approval. The Health Insurance Commission will not develop its plans for the installation of terminal equipment in pharmacies until the Government's legislative package has been approved.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Yes. A pharmacy communications network is proposed for those pharmacies who wish to be connected to the Commission's computer systems.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The cost of each item of equipment will not be known until the precise nature of the function of the equipment has been determined (to be determined at the conclusion of discussions with the Privacy Commissioner) and tenders have been called.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) The Government in its August 1990 Budget announced that claims lodged by pharmacies from February 1991 would be required to be lodged in an electronic format. The majority of Australian pharmacies are computerised following an incentive offer provided by the Government in 1987. Nevertheless, the Government is in discussion with the Pharmacy Guild on implementation proposals contained within its Budget package.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) There will be no obligation placed upon pharmacists with computers to link up with a central computer. However, in terms of checking a patient's eligibility to drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the pharmacist will have to satisfy the Commission that eligibility existed at the time of supply.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) That information is currently supplied by pharmacists in support of their claims for reimbursement. Data collected under the program is protected by the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by the Independent Air Fares Committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A response to the honourable senator's question was provided to Senate Estimates Committee B by the representative of the Independent Air Fares Committee on 3 October 1989 as follows (Hansard, page B193):</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Independent Air Fares Committee has certain powers to initiate air fare reviews, but normally the committee would adjudicate upon an application by an airline. The committee at the moment is gathering what information it can. I think that is a rather hypothetical question and we would have to adjudicate on what facts were placed before us by the airlines''.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, Ansett and Australian Airlines in December 1989 requested substantial fare increases due to the effects of the pilots' dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> After a careful review of all factors, and having regard to the requirements of the IAFC Act, the Committee determined (subject to review by the Committee no later than 23 July 1990) that a 5 per cent fare increase, from 24 January 1990, was justified to partly offset the significant additional abnormal costs which Ansett and Australian had incurred in their endeavours to provide a level of service for the travelling public, as required by their obligations under the Airlines Agreement Act.</PARA>
<PARA> From the evidence before it, the Committee concluded that it was reasonable and equitable to both the airlines and the travelling public for a relatively small proportion of the significant abnormal costs then being incurred to be recouped through a fare increase, which was substantially below the levels sought by the airlines. The Committee initiated a review of Ansett's and Australia's fare levels on 23 July 1990 and determined that no variation to the fare levels approved in January 1990 was justified.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, Australian and Ansett announced that their fares will increase by 7.5 per cent from 1 November 1990 due to costs associated with fuel prices increases. As the fare increase is to apply after 30 October the IAFC's approval was not required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>No. The reduction of $21 million in the provision for doubtful (bad) debts (reference page 68 of Telecom's 1988-89 Annual Report), is due to an accounting policy change whereby doubtful debts are now written off automatically after three months rather than over a period of up to twelve months as was the case previously. This allows outstanding debts to be passed to mercantile debt collection agents at a much earlier stage in the collection cycle than previously. With action now taken at a much earlier stage to recover bad debts an increase in recovery rates is likely. Changes in the provision for doubtful debts have no direct effect on the amount of bad debts written off ultimately.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The service standard measurements being quoted measure different aspects of the cellular mobile telephone service, and they cannot realistically be compared.</PARA>
<PARA>The Pactel standard states a 99% probability of the first call attempt being successful. This measure is calculated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) Each base station in the mobile network is designed to a 5% congestion level. This means that during the busiest hour of the day 95 calls in every hundred capture a radio channel from the base station sending the strongest signal.</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) When all radio channels on a base station are occupied, additional calls are redirected to other available base stations. (Unless the customer is on the fringe of the coverage area, it is likely that there are at least two base stations that could service the call).</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Therefore, the customer who misses out on the first base station has a further 95% chance of obtaining service from the second base station. If a channel is not available on the second base station, there is a further 95% chance of obtaining service from a third base station.</PARA>
<PARA>(iv) The combination of this series of 95% chances of obtaining a radio circuit is that, on average, a customer has a 99% chance of obtaining a radio channel at first attempt. In a fringe area, where service is provided by only one base station, the chances are 95% but in built up areas, and especially in the CBD where many base stations are available, the chance of obtaining a radio channel is greater than 99%.</PARA>
<PARA>Telecom Australia's MobileNet is designed to operate to the same 5% congestion standards on its base stations, and it operates the same call redirection facility. In this respect, there is no significant difference between the design standards of Pactel and the design standards of Telecom Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Telecom Australia works to international standards which state that 90% of the area is covered for 90% of the time at an acceptable signal strength. This refers to the quality of transmission coverage (or, as referred to in the previous answer, transmission guideline) and has no relation to congestion levels-a base station might be heavily congested but the radio transmission could still meet the 90/90 standard.</PARA>
<PARA>Transmission Guidelines are internationally accepted standards that are used to determine the amount of equipment required to provide a reasonable grade of service for the amount of traffic being generated.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the uses of the 90/90 rule is to define the coverage area of MobileNet. MobileNet service is often available outside of the published coverage areas. However, the coverage quality is not up to the standard of the 90/90 rule, which is why those areas are not included in the coverage maps.</PARA>
