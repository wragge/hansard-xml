<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Animal Patents</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate. The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would *reduce biodiversity, *compromise animal welfare, *concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and *allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Officer and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>

<PARA>That further consideration of the report of Estimates Committee C be postponed till after consideration of the reports of Estimates Committees D, E and F. </PARA>
<PARA>I think some people have the view that this rearrangement is simply to suit the convenience of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). When I decided on this course of action, it was not for that purpose. I believe it would be best to have the Minister here, as much for the convenience of the Opposition as for the convenience of the Government. If there is any opposition to this course, we are quite happy to proceed with the consideration of the report of Estimates Committee C and have a chamber duty Minister deal with it; but I do believe it is better to have the relevant Minister here at the right time. </PARA>

Senators are reminded that, under the new procedure, debate must be confined to those matters. The first department is the Department of Administrative Services. Estimates Committee D has drawn to the attention of the Senate a number of matters which are open for debate. The first matter is the sale of government houses in Darwin.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the Department has now supplied a number of supplementary answers to questions regarding housing that was obviously left lying vacant by the Department. From the answers given it is obvious that the housing under review relates principally to that housing that belongs to the Department of Administrative Services itself. This is a matter that I think will need further investigation at subsequent times because obviously other departments now have the exclusive management of their own properties. There could well be other departments that I was seeking to associate with this answer but was unable to do so in the Estimates on 15 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept the answers given by the Department with regard to its own housing and the fact that there is a policy review, but obviously other departments must be drawn in. I will accept the responsibility to pursue that individually with other departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note from the answers given by the Department that Australian Construction Services has, in effect, transferred the responsibility for any answer on this matter to the Defence Housing Authority which is obviously the principal agent in this regard.

<PARA> The Department is obviously ducking for cover and seeking to pass the responsibility for any of these answers to the Defence Housing Authority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A supplementary answer relating to this matter was given by the electoral officers in quite substantial detail, setting out the costs of the remote area mobile polling. I note from that answer that the total preliminary figures that have been provided are of the order of $167,665. These are detailed on a State by State basis. In particular, I note that the remote mobile polling in the Northern Territory took up some $106,137 of that total figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question I would like to pursue with the Minister for Administrative Services on this particular issue is that, noting the obvious qualification in the answer stating that the figures provided were preliminary and that final election costs will not be available until all accounts have been received and processed, what proportion of the costs does this $167,000 and its various State break-ups reflect? Is it anticipated that the final costs will be much greater than the figures provided?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Senate Estimates Committee D it emerged that the divisional returning officers apparently do not provide information to the Electoral Commissioner about the extent to which the electoral rolls are demonstrated to be unsatisfactory as a result of the return-`not known at this address' and so on-of letters sent out by senators and members to their constituents. I am one of those senators who send `welcome to the electorate' letters to several electorates. I can tell you, Mr Chairman, that the volume of returned letters from people who have recently enrolled in those electorates is astounding. I get the enrolment addresses from the divisional returning officer. It seems to me extraordinary that so many people who are listed as having recently come onto the roll are not contactable by mail. What particularly concerns me is the number of letters that come back noting, `Never heard of him', or her, `Never been here', and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point that the Government Deputy Whip makes, that they do not want to acknowledge receipt of a letter with the crest of the Senate on it. Maybe they are sufficiently misguided not to do so. But the reality, it seems to me, is that the failure rate of letters sent to people who have recently enrolled has reached, in my experience, an alarming level. What was even more alarming was the fact that in Senate Estimates it appeared that the Commissioner was totally unaware of this. He claimed that he had received no complaints whatsoever about the nature of the rolls from anyone, as I recall. Perhaps I am being unfair to him. I simply want to stress the unsatisfactory nature of the rolls, particularly as we have several electorates where the result rested on under 1,000 or so votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many members and senators not only write `welcome to the electorate' letters but they also direct mail. They send direct mail to large sections of the electorate, or to the total electorate. Many Labor members of the House of Representatives used an illegal allowance provided by this Government, which they ought to repay. This allowance was not granted to senators, as a political stunt aimed at preventing senators countering this political gimmick. It cost $30,000 a member, and now the taxpayer is being made, illegally, to carry that cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Many members like me, who at their own expense sent direct mail to sections of the electorate, found a grossly unsatisfactory failure rate of letters being returned with the words `Not known at this address'. We keep hearing that the office is happy about the nature of the rolls, that there has never been a greater attempt to clean them and that there were door to door visits a year or so before the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> But what I am really concerned about is the failure of the Commissioner to recognise or to have been informed that senators and members are returning these failed envelopes to the divisional returning officer (DRO). This suggests to me that there is a lack of concern and a lack of willingness to take action on this matter, emerging in effect from a lack of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether members of the House of Representatives have the view that they should advise their divisional returning officer of the number of failed letters. I hope they do but it would seem to me that we could perhaps encourage the Government, as it clearly has an enthusiastic support for the concept of people writing to their constituents-even illegally, by providing them with illegal stamp allowances-to show the same enthusiasm in encouraging senators and members to return the failed envelopes to the DRO and also to encourage the divisional returning officers to make certain that the hierarchy in the Electoral Commission is aware of this failure rate. I ask the Minister: To what extent is this check provided by senators and members as to the veracity or the accuracy of the lists checked, and to what extent is the Government pursuing the matter to make certain that the rolls are as clean as possible?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I will give him a full, adequate and accurate response and maybe at the end of it he can apologise for some of the inferences he has been making but, given his record, I do not really anticipate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume should take into account that, in respect of the last election in particular, a full-scale electoral roll review was conducted in 1989. That is one particular and comprehensive way of checking the accuracy of the electoral roll. A second way is to keep a continual monitoring of Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) generated mail returned to sender. Of course, that is an important mechanism. A third way is failure to vote, and that is always followed up. </PARA>
<PARA> However-and this is where I think Senator Baume might have been a bit unfair to the Electoral Commissioner, and from where I was last week at the Estimates Committee hearings I also had difficulty in understanding the direct purport of Senator Baume's questions-the Electoral Commission advises that confirmation of an elector's eligibility to remain on the roll is sought when members or senators advise that welcome-to-the-electorate letters have been returned, they being letters that politicians send out to people who they have been notified have moved into the electorate. When members or senators advise that those letters are returned the AEC responds to that particular problem. However, returned mail from members' or senators' mailings to all electors in a division does not automatically generate follow-up by the AEC. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, when people register as moving into the electorate and correspondence to them from members or senators is returned and those members or senators advise the Electoral Commission, that is followed up. General mailings, however, have particular problems. For instance, the computer tapes provided by the Australian Electoral Commission to, for instance, the Liberal Party in New South Wales were provided, in fact, last year. They were tapes which show electors by residence in September 1989, some six months before the election. Naturally there was some movement between the time of making the tape and the time of the mailing out by members or senators, so we should take into account that perhaps those tapes should not be seen as the most appropriate way for comprehensive checking of whether people are or are not in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> We are taking further measures. For instance, the AEC is currently undertaking a survey in a sample of divisions of electors enrolled in the period prior to the close of the rolls for the 1990 election. I am informed that, while the investigation is by no means complete, preliminary analysis of a small sample of the data suggests that the return to sender mail is not a totally reliable indication that the elector no longer resides at the enrolled address. For example, the data shows that a significant proportion of returned mail was due to very slight errors in the addresses keyed into the enrolment system. For instance, people may still be in the location that they have indicated but the tape itself may not have total accuracy. It is quite clear also from the surveys that some people object to direct mail from any source. I am one of them. Although still living at the address, they indicate return to sender. </PARA>
<PARA> The data also suggest-and I think this is important-that large numbers of electors legitimately on the roll at the close of rolls had moved to a new address within one month of polling date. This highlights the mobility of the population and the need to use the most up-to-date electoral roll information available when directly mailing electors. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing the Government has done-and it is important and perhaps Senator Michael Baume could take it up with his colleagues in New South Wales-is to take a decision that the Electoral Commission be funded to undertake annual roll reviews in those States which are prepared to share equally in the costs of maintaining joint rolls. Such arrangements are in place in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. We are currently looking at provisions for financial arrangements with other States but, in view of what Senator Michael Baume is concerned about, in view of the State that he represents and in view of the political affinity that he has with the Government, it could be useful if he were to put in a good word with the New South Wales Government for it to undertake the commitment that some other States are undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Australian Electoral Commission is consistently and comprehensively addressing this particular issue. I think, as I made the point just a little while earlier, Senator Baume's questions were a bit difficult to decipher on the night and I think the attack on the Electoral Commissioner is unfair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the embarrassment of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) coming in here having been party to the $30,000 rip-off which the High Court decided was illegal, and I recognise that his incredibly offensive behaviour at the beginning, attacking me personally and suggesting that I should apologise, is part of that embarrassment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts, of course, are to the contrary. I draw the Minister's attention-if he can tear himself away from his discussion with the Deputy Whip-to the text of the record of the Senate Estimates Committee hearing. For his benefit, I refer to page D32. I can understand that the Minister himself may have difficulty comprehending things-he has an inbuilt inability to listen to what people are saying anyway or maybe it is an inability to understand clear, uncomplicated English. I do not know why otherwise the Minister did not understand the import of my question or why anyone else might not have. Perhaps I should read it to him:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asking a management question. I am asking you: Do divisional returning officers indicate up the management chain a sort of failure rate, if you like, in things like welcoming new people to the electorate and so on? Are you, in a managerial sense, checking the failure rate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The answer was to the effect `We update the roll' and so on. I pressed the point. I said that that would recognise the failure rate only by inference. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> You do not have established a managerial system under which divisional returning officers advise up the chain the extent to which, say, new additions to the roll have been found within a very brief time to be simply not approachable, not contactable by mail and, therefore, putting in serious doubt the reliability of that roll. There is no administrative mechanisms apart from the inference that you can make?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply from the electoral officer was:</PARA>
<PARA> No, not to my knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>What scope for misunderstanding, for lack of comprehension, is there except from a Minister who does not want to comprehend? I certainly do not apologise to the Electoral Commissioner, the Minister or anyone else. I asked a simple question and the reply was, `No, not to my knowledge'. If the Minister would just forget his bunkum and political nonsense and deal with the matters of fact it would be a great help to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not doubting in any way the fact that there are special reasons why there is a failure rate. It may be that some people have as little intellect as the Minister and simply refuse to accept mail and, without any knowledge of what is in it, write on it `Return to sender'. If there are people such as the Minister around I suppose it just makes it harder to run a coherent and intelligent society. I understand that there could be slight errors in the tape. If there are such errors I hope that when they are corrected-I presume they are corrected when they go back to the divisional returning officer-the senators and members who send out welcome to the electorate letters are advised so that they can send a letter to the correct address. I do not know whether that is so. Maybe it comes out automatically in the new print-outs. I would like to be assured that those corrections are conveyed to the senators and members who are sufficiently enthusiastic to send out welcome to the electorate letters. I am glad to say that the Minister dropped his political nonsense and adopted a more conciliatory role at the end of his comments and mentioned the question of joint rolls. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator for New South Wales I would certainly be only too keen to discuss the matter with my State colleagues to see the extent to which action can be taken to ensure that the best possible rolls are available for both State and Federal elections. This is particularly so in New South Wales where a Labor gerrymander has meant that it takes almost 53 3/4 per cent of the vote for a Liberal-National Party government to be elected. The Labor Party could win an election in New South Wales on less than 47 per cent of the vote because of the gerrymander that exists there. I share with the Minister a great enthusiasm to clean up the rolls and the electoral system in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I am overjoyed to see that the New South Wales State Government has managed to get through the upper House a proposal to reduce the size of the Parliament and have a redistribution which creates a fair electoral system to correct the Labor gerrymander. So there is a special reason why in New South Wales there should be a joint effort to have the best rolls possible coinciding with a major redistribution. I give the Minister an undertaking that I will raise that with my New South Wales colleagues. In the meantime I would like a reasoned, rational, coherent and sensible reply to the matters of fact that I raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite certain what that means. I can understand that the Minister could not understand my direct English because I have great difficulty, as I think my colleagues do, understanding his tortured English. I asked a simple question. When there are errors on the tape and a senator or member sends out a letter to someone and the error is such that the letter is not delivered and is returned and the senator or member then sends the letter to the divisional returning officer, is the correction to the roll made then conveyed to the senator or member and in what form is it conveyed? That is a simple, uncomplicated question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was intrigued to note that the Minister chose to make no alteration whatsoever in his first offensive and nonsensical remarks about how my question was unintelligible. I have repeated the question that I asked in Senate Estimates Committee D. I now go back to that matter. Is there a mechanism by which the Commissioner becomes aware of the failure rate on `welcome to the electorate' letters, or was Mr Rehn from the Australian Electoral Commission correct when he said that to his knowledge there is no mechanism by which the Commission becomes aware of the failure rate that divisional returning officers become aware of, other than by inference in the volume of alterations to the roll?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Minister has just acknowledged is that the Electoral Commission has no knowledge of the failure rate of its new enrolments as indicated by the returned letters that senators and members send off to divisional returning officers. It seems extraordinary to me that the Commissioner has no concern apparently to find out, or no mechanism to find out, what that failure rate is on new enrolments. It would seem to me that it would be a matter of some substance to the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister says, I cannot understand why there is a problem communicating. I thought my question was very simple. I now ask the Minister: Would it be the Government's intention to keep a closer watch by having some sort of mechanism to find out what the quick failure rate is? As evidenced by the returned `welcome to the electorate' letters, I presume that is the only quick mechanism available by which new enrolments can be readily and speedily checked. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Electoral Commission has some other mechanism it would be interesting to know what it is, but I would have thought that there was an in-built system available through the parliamentary officers to enable a very speedy check on new enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the point quite readily that the changes to the rolls are sent up the administrative ladder but the changes to the rolls may well have emerged from having received notification of change of address and all sorts of other factors. I am specifically asking about a failure rate where people are purportedly on the roll and their failure to be at that address is reported for the first time to the divisional returning officer by a letter being returned to the senator or member who sent it out. Surely it would be a matter of some significance that there is such a rate of early failure. </PARA>
<PARA> All I ask is: Would it not be in all our best interests if this matter was addressed, or even recognised, by the Electoral Commission? As I understand the response, which was `No, not to my knowledge', the Commission does not even have the mechanism, at the administrative level, to find out what the failure rate is. The divisional returning officers correct their rolls apparently on the basis of the returned envelopes but the Commission has no knowledge of or interest in it, and this Minister clearly has no determination to do anything to help clean up these rolls. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave the Senate a rather comprehensive answer at the start. As part of that there was a fairly clear indication that in a number of specific ways there is a commitment by the Australian Electoral Commission to ensure that the rolls are kept up to date. Of course, one of those is the one I mentioned almost at the end of my remarks, that is, the survey that is conducted after an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We went to the question of people enrolling and a way of ensuring that there is accuracy at that particular level. I canvassed the fact that when members or senators advise that welcome to the electorate letters have been returned or when other people who do the same sort of mail-out so advise, as I said earlier, that advice is taken into account by the Electoral Commission and followed up. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing further to that that should also be noted is that I am sure it is understood by members and senators that when somebody does register to enrol, within about a week or two of their indicating their intention to enrol, lodging their forms and so on, they get an acknowledgment card sent back to them by the Electoral Commission, acknowledging the fact that it has received their intention to enrol and that they will be placed on the roll. That, to the Electoral Commission and probably to any fair-minded person, would be the most appropriate mechanism to use as an indicator as to whether that particular application for enrolment is legitimate. If those cards are sent back the Electoral Commission will obviously take them into account and does take them into account to ensure that there is not a bodgie enrolment application. That is very much one of the number of parts of the mechanism to ensure that the rolls are accurate. The world does not start and end around the letters that Senator Michael Baume sends out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Electoral Commission has a number of mechanisms, including that mechanism I just mentioned, to ensure that the rolls are kept accurate. One such mechanism is any advice that members or senators might give as to the return of welcome to the electorate letters, as opposed to a general direct mail-out. I made that particular point clear at the start as well. </PARA>

<PARA> In terms of mechanisms to push the information back up the system and whether there are any managerial systems under which the returning officers are advised, I am advised that on a divisional level all these matters are taken into account. If anything extraordinary appears the Electoral Commission, meeting as a commission and meeting as members and State returning officers from time to time, obviously pays attention to any extraordinary matter. In terms of the day-to-day running of the Commission in this particular area, the mechanisms are there and they are run at a divisional level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At long last it has sunk through to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). Even though I read the question I asked at the Senate Estimates Committee, only by way of interjection from me has the Minister at last comprehended what I asked about. Maybe because he was so busy talking to someone else, I should repeat the exact question. It can be found on page D32 of the Hansard record of the Estimates Committee D hearing. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Do divisional returning officers indicate up the management chain the sort of failure rate . . . In things like welcoming new people to the electorate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's response just now was that it is managed at divisional returning officer level. That was not the point of the question. I fear that the Minister may be the only person in this chamber and the only person among the people listening to this broadcast, who would still be unaware of the import of the question. Either it shows a massive determination not to understand, or an incapacity to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> I am asking two simple questions. I will make them as simple as possible so the Minister can understand them. Do the acknowledgment cards provide a recognisable failure rate of new enrolments? If so, does the failure rate shown by the return of acknowledgment cards get reported up the chain anywhere in a managerial way to the Electoral Commissioner or his office, or does that failure rate remain locked in the files of the divisional returning officer?</PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that if there is a failure rate from acknowledgment cards, there is some managerial benefit in the Commission's becoming aware of it so that it can at least have a view of what a problem is so that it can then establish how to deal with it. Unless it understands the magnitude of the problem, its capacity to find a solution to it may well be limited. That is on acknowledgment cards. If in fact the Commission does all those things with acknowledgment cards why does it not do exactly the same thing with welcome to the electorate letters returned by senators and members. If it does not do it with acknowledgment cards, can it smarten up its act?</PARA>

Senate Baume made some suggestions that I canvassed earlier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was present when the original questions concerning this matter were raised at the Estimates Committee hearing. I will make a suggestion to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and to the Australian Electoral Commission resulting from my own experience. Over many years I have received, on a monthly basis, labels of new enrollees from one or two electorates in South Australia and I understand that other senators receive one or two such sets of labels on a monthly basis, as do parties. A division of the Electoral Commission sends to about three or four persons-the member for the electorate, a senator interested in that electorate and at least two major parties-such a set of labels of new enrollees, on a monthly basis. That is all well and good. However, we do not receive a computer print-out of corrections made to the electoral roll on a monthly basis. It would go a long way to solving all the questions that have been raised regarding this matter if, in addition to the labels that we are sent in the way that I have outlined, the divisional office of the Electoral Commission included with the package of labels a computer print-out listing deletions from the electoral roll of which perhaps there would be 500 entries, and corrections to the electoral roll of which perhaps there would be 100 or 50 entries, on a monthly basis. Over the seven or eight years that I have been a senator, I have received about 1,000 new enrollees per month, per electorate, and I think that there would be at least 500 deletions and perhaps 50 corrections per month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that if we received such a computer print-out and if that list were sent to the other persons receiving labels, as I have already outlined, we would be accountable to our electorates. We would be able to engage in a constructive dialogue with the divisional officers of the Electoral Commission and we would be able to check, ourselves, what had happened to those envelopes that we had taken to the Electoral Commission every month or two, which had been returned to us marked `Return to sender' or `Not known at this address'. We would be able to check our information with the list of deletions and corrections that would be clearly notified to us on the computer list. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the Electoral Commission's point that the most sure confirmation of a person's address will be that person's confirmation letter returned to the electoral divisional officers. I acknowledge that there will be some electors who, in the words of the Minister, would put `Return to sender' on some categories of mail. However, if we received such a computer print-out on a monthly basis, everything would be clear. Indeed, such lists could be held at the divisional office of the Electoral Commission so that any interested member of the public could also view them. </PARA>

It might be all very well if one serves an electorate where there is a relatively stable population, but if one is serving an electorate such as Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, for instance, where the population can turn around completely from one election to another, I would dread the thought of the monthly returns that would come from the divisional returning officer informing one of the additions to and deletions from the electoral roll.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the big problems we have as senators serving the people of Australia is coping with the amount of paperwork we have to handle to the moment. If we are going to add further reams and reams of paperwork on top of this, we will be floundering. We will not end up doing the job to which we have been elected. I would certainly not seek that service from the divisional returning officer if it were provided. I want these remarks to go on the Hansard record.</PARA>

I do get returns of mail saying people have moved on. One can take action but generally one has to do so through the mailing system. If one is servicing a rural electorate, one runs into difficulties in getting responses. I think the poor old electors are hurt enough at the moment with the amount of unsolicited correspondence that they get coming in. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we to add another tier to the process of the divisional returning officers by having them action letters which are sent out by members and senators but returned unopened? Many letters which we send out have our return address and name on them and people automatically recognise them and return them because of their political beliefs. It happens even to me. I said by interjection to Senator Michael Baume that people probably do it to him because they are aware of it. We do have to be careful how much more bureaucratise we load onto the system. We do have to be aware that the people that we really should be concerned with here at the moment are the constituents. We are here to serve them and the electors of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been taking this matter up with the Electoral Commissioner since 1987, and a lot of the replies that I have been getting from him just say that a high degree of mobility is the explanation for the number of envelopes returned, and not electoral fraud.

<PARA> The other thing that concerns me is what has happened during the last election. To give an example, in places such as Nimbin-where nobody really seems to know who lives there and when they live there-it is very easy for people to enrol without actually giving an address at which they will live. Why does the Minister not have more advice given to the electoral commissioners to have roll cleansing and habitation reviews very quickly after an election to find out whether the people who voted from a particular address actually lived at that address. I think if that spot checking was done all around Australia, it would definitely take away a lot of the concern and worry that I have. It would not be hard to do, but in places where the enrolment has changed dramatically, I think it would be one of the answers to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the Minister gives the instructions to the Commissioner or tells the Commissioner to do something about it we will have this concern. I have had it for three years and all the other senators here today are concerned about it. I am not suggesting it just because we want to stir the Minister up-which obviously Senator Michael Baume did at the start of his remarks, quite rightly, to get him moving on this subject-but because the people of Australia do not only want to know that the right thing is being done, but want to see that it is being done. At this stage I think my opinion and the opinion of a lot of people in the community is that electoral fraud is going on; and until it is proved otherwise, that is the way we will think. </PARA>

The particular proposal that he put up is in fact being acted upon right now in the way that he wanted it to be acted upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did mention at the start, in response to Senator Michael Baume, that the Electoral Commission is currently undertaking a survey in a sample of divisions. That survey basically goes to those who enrolled in the lead-up to the election but who are not living at that particular address now. Each one of those addresses has been doorknocked in a way that was recommended by the Joint Standing Committee. That survey and its results should, I think, be quite useful in ensuring that the appropriate mechanisms are put in place in future. Essentially what Senator Brownhill has asked to be done has been done in a sample of divisions. In those divisions I am told it is a rather exhaustive job. Doors have been knocked on to ensure that fraud is not occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague raised the question of corrections. I am advised that at the time we get the computer labels of additions some States also have available deletions and corrections. The corrections are available as part of the computer tape that would ordinarily come through with the computer tape labels; but deletions are available in some particular States. South Australia and Western Australia are two States where I am informed these deletions are made available. They are made available, and some honourable senators, I am informed, have indicated that they do not really want them. But I think in Senator Teague's case we should take it up and see whether we are both on the same track. If we are, we can rectify it. But if we are not, we can see what the issue is. </PARA>

By the way, as I understand it, this chamber rejected the Government's proposal to validate retrospectively an illegal payment, the purpose of which was to influence the result of an election. We are still waiting, of course, for the Labor members who used that money to repay it to the people to whom it belongs-the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not holding my breath for that illegal payment to be repaid, but I suppose if it depends on morality, we certainly will not expect it to be repaid. The point is that the Labor Party was involved in this enormous direct mail campaign. I am wondering whether all Labor members at least gave the Electoral Commission some benefit for the $30,000 they illegally spent by making certain that all returned envelopes went back to the divisional returning officers. If they did not, I wonder whether the Minister will, in this conciliatory mood in which he suggested I do something about the State Government, make certain that his colleagues send all the failed letters back to the divisional returning officers if they have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I particularly want to make is this: Senator McKiernan said that he did not want to be inundated with paper, particularly in an electorate like Kalgoorlie. I am interested to see that Senator McKiernan obviously has such little faith in the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) that he wants to send `welcome to the electorate' electoral letters out in that area, particularly when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is a Labor member. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely in these times of modern technology the simplest thing to do would be to give us all a disc. The Electoral Commissioner could simply give us a compatible disc; although the Government's equipment purchases seem to be determinedly along the lines of not buying equipment that is compatible, so maybe that would not work. Surely material could simply be given to us on disc. We would not need reams of paper; we could press a button and sticky labels could emerge in our office without involving the Electoral Commissioner in such problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just wondering whether the Electoral Commission makes any enrolment information available either commercially or to other people in this way. It does not seem to me to be a problem to give us discs, unless there is some confidential information on the discs. For example, we no longer get people's occupations in the way we used to, and that kind of confidentiality could be maintained if an appropriate button were pressed when transferring information from one disc to another to enable us to have a disc. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister also tell us how many electorates and which ones were in the sample of the check on how bad the rolls were? If that information is confidential it would be a disappointment because it is reasonable for us to be advised of the electorates so we can see whether they are Labor- or Liberal-held electorates that have been checked in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is that, through the fog of information that settled over the Minister at Estimates Committee time, he has confused questions I asked with those asked by Senator Parer. Having gone back, at last I can see what prompted the Minister's obvious befuddled state. Nevertheless, Senator Parer's questions also merit a more coherent answer than the ones we got in Estimates hearings. Senator Parer made the point that these broader direct mails, across the whole spectrum of the enrolment list, have a very large failure rate. That is why the direct mail that all the Labor candidates were involved in illegally would have had a large failure rate, too. Senator Parer asked Mr Cox:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that, but with political parties engaged in direct mail and with the state of the rolls as they are, what sort of returns would you expect of envelopes which state that either the person is not at that address, has moved or whatever?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cox, the Commissioner, responded:</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that we would not have that information. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Parer asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Have you had any complaints on this following the election from particular areas?</PARA>
<PARA>There were complaints of a massive failure rate on the printed rolls, or certainly within a very short time of the final printed rolls. Mr Cox in reply said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Parer pressed him and said:</PARA>
<PARA>You have had no direct complaints?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cox said `No', and added:</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first I have heard of it. That is returns to parties?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Parer said, `Yes'. Mr Cox continued:</PARA>
<PARA>No. That information would not come to us, except in an anecdotal way, and I have not even heard that. </PARA>
<PARA>This strikes me as not just incredible but also appalling. It would seem to me to be absolutely essential that, in a pre-election environment, when we get such an enormous failure rate at least the Electoral Commissioner would be advised by the divisional returning officers of a pretty substantial failure rate. I know that divisional returning officers are very busy in the run-up to an election, but we were asking questions of the Electoral Commissioner on 15 May-1 3/4 months after the election. Surely in that period, even by anecdotal means, the Electoral Commissioner should have become aware of this failure rate. Senator Parer sends in his failure rate, I send in mine, and looking around this chamber, other senators, including Senator Teague, send in theirs. To think that the Commissioner has not been advised, even anecdotally, by divisional returning officers suggests that there is a clear need for some mechanism, which is what I asked for when I first started talking about this matter an hour or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of just saying, `No, there is no mechanism; no, I do not understand what you are talking about; no, I have something to hide', can the Minister give us some information on this matter? Because it has taken such an effort to get anything out of the Minister on this issue, I am wondering what the Government has to hide on this question. Why has it been so reluctant to ensure that the Electoral Commissioner is fully informed? Why is the Minister not saying, `Yes, we will look into that matter and get some kind of information channel up', so there is some sort of guideline about what is an unacceptable failure rate, so the divisional returning officers know they have an obligation to let the Commission know that the rolls were in a pretty hairy state, if they were, before the last election? All I can say is that the rate of failure that I got from the letters I sent out in the marginal electorates was sufficiently large to cause me grave concern about the results in marginal seats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to this debate in my office and I would like to put my own personal experience as a senator on the public record. I write to new enrolments on the rolls in four Federal electorates in Queensland-all Labor-held. Some of them are quite marginal. Over the years my office has averaged between five and six letters per block of 300 new enrolments returned endorsed `Not known at this address, return to sender'. That is nearly 2 per cent. We are pretty confident of those figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For years we advised the Electoral Commissioner that these people were not at the address that was on the new roll. Nothing seemed to happen about that and in recent times we have ceased advising the Commissioner and we are just watching the rolls to see whether these names are deleted. So far I cannot pass an opinion on that point. It is not a matter of dwelling on the fact that maybe 2 per cent on the electoral roll are phantoms and put on by the Australian Labor Party, presumably; it could well be higher than that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, if the electoral rolls are being rigged, and rigged carefully and intelligently, when a letter arrives from me and the person at the address opens it because my name-Senator MacGibbon-is on the front and he finds it is a welcome to the electorate letter and just puts it in the waste paper basket, I cannot recognise that as a non-return. I do not know that that person does not exist. So the figures of phantoms on the rolls may well be higher. If we are dealing with a figure, in my experience, of about 2 per cent of people who are not on the rolls-that is about 1,400 in an electorate of 70,000-it is more than enough to win that electorate. If we look at electorates that are closely contested, such as Fisher and Dawson, to name but two of them in Queensland, and if a party can put 2 per cent of phantoms on for its side, it is doing very well. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing is that the very high percentage of these non-returns come from people in caravan parks, lot so and so in a suburb or a small town, or from a post office in country towns. Given the closeness of results in many electorates, I find the whole matter very disturbing. Elections in this country are won or lost on marginal seats, and if the system by which the polling takes place is not accurate there is not much point in having an election at all. Already we have the situation where the boundaries are rigged because we have a government in power which, for a second term of office, is a minority government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may be able to satisfy some of the points that Senator Crichton-Browne may wish to raise. I refer to Senator Michael Baume's earlier point about direct mail-outs and whether information was made available to the Australian Electoral Commission. I am advised that it is generally a normal practice of some members to provide information about the return of direct mail-outs, but we do not have any information as to who may have done it this particular time. I am informed that the use of discs is an expensive mechanism. It is made available to each of the parties once every three years. It is not commercially available and would be an expensive thing to make available to everybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume mentioned a survey. I think he was concerned that the survey would be politically biased. I am informed that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, in its recommendation as to the conduct of this survey, recommended that two electorates be surveyed after the 1990 election. The Electoral Commission is surveying six electorates-two marginal electorates for each party and two so-called controls. The field work has been completed; the analysis is still being completed. It would be premature to give the names of those electorates, but we will consider that matter in six to eight weeks when the work is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon raised the question of phantom voting, as have others, and that matter is being addressed as part of the survey. The people who are being investigated are those who enrolled as being new to the electorate, from outside the electorate, and have voted, that is, those people who enrolled somewhere in the vicinity of four to six weeks-I do not have the specific timeframe-before the closing of the rolls. Thirty-eight thousand names are being checked and 36,000 different addresses are being checked to ensure that the survey is being conducted fully and adequately. It is fair to say that this is one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching surveys of this nature to be conducted-not only by this Electoral Commission, but probably by any other in the world. In respect of the question of phantoms, it is best that we hold judgment until we get the results of that particular survey. </PARA>

In relation to those booths, let me give an example of what I find to be remarkable statistics. I refer first to the booth at Kalumburu, which is on the north-west coast of Australia. There were 140 formal votes and one informal vote cast. The results were 129 for the Labor Party-that is 92.1 per cent of the vote-and five for the Liberal Party, which is 3.6 per cent of the vote. What a great box! If the Minister reckons that that is cooking with gas, let me refer to Oombulurri, which is just across the gulf from Wyndham, for those who need a geography lesson on Western Australia. It used to be the Forrest River Mission in happier times. There were 71 formal votes cast. This Aboriginal community is made up essentially, but tragically, of illiterate and innumerate Aboriginals. Seventy-one of them cast a vote, 100 per cent of which were formal. Not one of them made an error with his ballot paper.

I am sorry if I offend the Minister by having to go into some detail to arrive at the question, but I think there is no more lucid or sophisticated way in which I can do it. I refer to the teams of electoral officers who fly around, at enormous expense to the taxpayer, to collect votes in remote areas. One finds, for instance, that the first team, as it travelled around these remote areas, relying on the electoral roll to determine who is entitled to vote, attracted 164 formal votes and eight informal votes-that is a 95.3 per cent strike rate. Of those, 91.5 per cent, or 150, cast their first vote for the Labor Party and one vote was for the Liberal Party, which means that we got 0.6 per cent of the vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the second team, there were 428 formal votes cast and three informal-that is a 99.3 per cent formal vote. It is remarkable by any measure. Of those, 387, or 90.4 per cent, cast their first vote for the Labor Party and 2.8 per cent for the Liberal Party. At Mount James, 22 formal votes were cast, there was not one informal vote, and 86.4 per cent of those cast their first vote for the Labor Party and 4.5 per cent for the Liberal Party. I have selected those figures randomly. At Beagle Bay, for instance, 99 formal votes were cast and one informal-which means a 99 per cent formal vote-and 85.9 per cent of those were cast for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> In those remote areas the Australian Labor Party vote averaged between 85 per cent, at the very worst box, and 100 per cent. The vote of the Liberal Party of Australia was as low as 0.6 per cent while, in one devastating box, we actually got 10.8 per cent. </PARA>

If one looks at the informal vote in these areas one sees that it is dramatically less than the average for Kalgoorlie and for Australia as a whole. This begs the question: Given that the Aboriginal communities in these areas are, by any measure, unsophisticated-many of them sign their names with a cross rather than their name-how does the Department determine with any certainty, that they are not on the roll two or three times? If they are using the postal voting system, how does it determine that they do not vote two or three times?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with Senator Crichton-Browne in expressing concern about the cost related to the remote area mobile polling. A very similar situation to that outlined by Senator Crichton-Browne arose in many communities in the Northern Territory, particularly the Aboriginal communities. In the circulated supplementary answer to a question which details all of the costings it is noted that some 147 places in the Northern Territory were visited and that some 10,198 votes were issued. From recollection, of those 10,000 votes in the Northern Territory the House of Representatives vote for the Country-Liberal Party totalled approximately 1,600.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sad saga of this event is that there is no such thing as a secret vote in remote area mobile polling in Aboriginal communities. One of the conflicting principles of this issue is the way that assistance is given to people who often claim to be illiterate. Whilst I accept that there is a very high proportion of illiterate voters, there is also a very significant number of Aboriginal constituents who are not illiterate but still claim assistance in completing their voting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling, you are starting to suffer from the same problem as Senator Crichton-Browne. You must relate your remarks to the maintenance of the rolls rather than the voting procedures, which is not a matter before the Chair at the moment. We are on the subject of the Electoral Commission procedures for the maintenance of electoral rolls and taking account of reports of mail returns following bulk mailings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share Senator Crichton-Browne's concern, particularly about the statistics, which I do not have readily available. It is also very interesting to note the enrolment numbers in each of the places visited and the number of people who actually voted. There are significant discrepancies between the actual enrolments in each location and the numbers that voted and how that transposes to the costs of the Electoral Commission. The Commission obviously makes decisions about which community to take the remote mobile polling booth to according to the enrolments in that community. When there is a turnout of only 10, 20 or 30 per cent at a polling booth in a community, the basis on which the Commission has made extensive decisions about finances must be seriously questioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

I wonder whether we are straying into the general question of mobile polling and not, as indicated by you earlier, relating our contributions to the actual maintenance of the roll.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two matters are intricately linked to the maintenance of the rolls. For example, the number of votes issued in the Northern Territory is 10,000, yet, the numbers on the rolls is in many cases much greater. I was trying to ascertain how the Department made the decision to spend $106,000 visiting those communities. Whilst it is certainly academic and interesting to note the political consequences of the lack of a secret ballot and the manner in which the costs are imposed on scrutineers and officials, this issue needs to be very seriously addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of points have been raised. I think Senator Crichton-Browne made a point about the assistance provided to Aboriginal voters by providing mobile polling booths in these remote areas. In order to be pertinent to the question of accuracy of the electoral roll, we have local electoral assistants in these areas who belong to the communities and who identify voters at the time of polling. That is one way of ensuring that we know who is voting. However, Aboriginal people, like migrants and people who are illiterate, are covered by the provision normally available in the Commonwealth Electoral Act-the avenue of assisted voting. Having spent a lot of time years ago trying to help people in migrant communities to vote, I know that there is nothing more frustrating than seeing totally confused elderly people attempting to vote-and knowing full well whom they wanted to vote for-but being incapable of--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is probably something more frustrating than that for Senator Crichton-Browne: his being over there and our still being over here. I hope that he suffers for a lot longer. It is totally frustrating watching those people trying to vote. The point is that people can, and obviously do, avail themselves of this particular provision of the Electoral Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Tambling raised a point about a suspected discrepancy between the numbers who vote at a mobile polling booth as opposed to those who live in communities. As a representative of the Northern Territory, Senator Tambling probably knows full well that in this process there is a hub community and that those from outer areas have access to the mobile polling facility in that community. Quite often, there is an arrangement that allows people from outside that community to vote at a mobile booth. The other thing that happens with voting generally is that people may not be in their community on the day of the poll. For example, they could be in Alice Springs, Darwin or Katherine. As a consequence, there may be discrepancies in that area as well. I think that answers all the questions that have been raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give notice to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and to the Australian Electoral Commission that at the next Estimates hearings we will expect a careful account of the management of the electoral roll at the divisional level and, in summary, across the whole nation. The questions that have been raised today should be no surprise to the Senate. Many senators have been involved in the last hour and a half in this committee stage discussion of matters that were considered by Estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The primary question is the integrity of the electoral roll. A 98 per cent integrity is not good enough because we have the clear knowledge that the last election was decided on the basis of less than one per cent of the vote in a dozen electorates. Therefore, with the last general election very freshly in our minds, it should come as no surprise that, when the estimates of the Australian Electoral Commission, which comes under the Department of Administrative Services, are before us, we should ask, `What is the management system for ensuring the integrity of the electoral roll?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions have been asked by Senator Michael Baume, Senator Parer, Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Tambling, Senator MacGibbon and me. We are not satisfied that the Government or the Electoral Commission has a management system in place that will demonstrate to this chamber and to the public that there is a 100 per cent-or very close to that; say, 99.99 per cent-integrity in the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the use of computers and management techniques, facilities are available to the Electoral Commission to post in on a monthly basis in a straightforward and comprehensive table the number on the roll in a particular month, the number of deletions, the number of additions and the number of corrections with regard to 150 electorates over 36 months. This information should be able to be notified not only in respect of a division but also on a comprehensive basis across the whole country. That kind of careful management has not been demonstrated in terms of its impact upon us or in the answers that have been given to the Estimates Committee or here today. When we come to the Estimates following the August Budget, we will be looking carefully for a management system that will give greater accountability and certainty and satisfy senators of all parties that there is integrity in the electoral roll.</PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for all of these questions and concerns is that we, as members of parliament, need to communicate in a regular way to people in the many electorates. In order to do that, we need accuracy. When we find inaccuracy, or allegations of inaccuracy, we want to know what response is given to each item of information that we give to the divisional officers of the Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in the committee stage debate of the Appropriation Bills we have demonstrated that we need assurances. Over the coming months there should be put in place a management system which not only achieves the goals we have been pressing for but also which is actually seen by individual senators to be working in the months leading up to September and October when we will be asking very carefully for the Electoral Commission's answers on this management question. </PARA>

He has asked for two mechanisms to be made available to ensure the openness of the system. In both cases, they are available. South Australian and Western Australian senators can get the corrections. The fact that Senator Teague does not get them may reflect the fact that the information is not coming through to him or it may reflect something else. But I am advised that South Australian and Western Australian senators can get the corrections. All they have to do is ask for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator McKiernan said that a 2 per cent return of letters in respect of Kalgoorlie could be quite normal because of the floating mining population. But I have had a different experience. Earlier this year, I conducted a mail-out to a cross-section of people living in the outer metropolitan seat of Canning in Perth, advising them of where my office was, and what it could do for them, if they needed any help. I had a return of roughly 1 3/4 per cent which, of course, is lower than the experience in Kalgoorlie. I think the Minister might find this funny, but I have kept all the returns and I can show them to him. Of the 1 3/4 per cent-this is quite a big packet-only one return was sent back marked `junk mail'. The recipient has the perogative to make such a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bulk of the letters that were sent back were marked `Address unknown'. If a letter turns up at a house, even though the previous occupier may have moved, there is generally an address available to forward it on to. It seems peculiar to me that 97 per cent of the returned ones had `Address unknown' written on them. One would think that at least 50 per cent of people would be bothered to readdress the letters that were sent to that address rather than mark them `Address unknown, return to sender'. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect that I found funny or peculiar is that I did a mail-out to explain what my office was about to all the Italian families in the electorate of Canning, and I got one back. </PARA>

I suppose one could infer two things from that: first of all, that the Italians are more stable than the average Australian; and, secondly, that they will not be used as ghosts, stooges or something like that. I found it peculiar that, of the 400-odd letters sent out, I got one back. The others I got back-accounting for not quite 2 per cent-were all marked `Address unknown'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I could comment on mobile polling booths-I will be very brief-I was part of a mobile polling booth team this year, and we went to a couple of booths that we did not go to at the last election. We got some votes there this time, and some were informal whereas last time there were no votes that were not informal and no votes for us. I could carry on and set out some of the things that were said well away from the polling booths, but they are not part of the subject being discussed at present, and I will find an opportunity to mention those matters later on. </PARA>

He was not able to get any votes for the Liberal Party in the areas that he related. Congratulations!

However, as I mentioned earlier on, if Senator Panizza is talking about a mail-out as part of a general mail-out, using the computer tapes that might be available to parties and whatever, then the information on those tapes is recognised as being somewhat outdated, and that is not a cost productive way of ensuring follow-ups in those cases.

We have in place an automatic procedure called a de-duplication process which is geared towards ensuring that people are not enrolled, for instance, in two particular areas, electorates or locations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that I do not intend to be provocative in saying this but I think it is a rather unfair representation of the Aboriginal people to be concentrating on them on this particular issue. The sort of question that Senator Crichton-Browne raises, quite honestly, can apply whether somebody is Aboriginal in a remote area, or living in the heart of Toorak in Victoria or other appropriate places in WA. If people have this sort of malevolent intent we have mechanisms in place to try to stop it. We believe those mechanisms, in terms of checking, go as far as any system can go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Crichton-Browne has instances like the ones he is talking about we would obviously very much like to hear of them. But to seize on an Aboriginal person-mythical though he might be-and describe that particular person in a deprecating way is a totally unfair bias in this debate. Let us have a fair description of the people we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of this particular area I will answer directly the issue that Senator Crichton-Browne raises without going to the padding, which I find quite offensive. We have Aboriginal field officers. We have listings of both European and skin names. Those Aboriginal field officers assist the Commission in locating those people who may be registered more than once. Those field officers assist in a very constructive and positive way, working through the communities with the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Crichton-Browne, if he has a specific case, to put it up. We find in this area that quite often there is a lot of anecdotal evidence and mythology. If the Opposition wants to spend government resources pursuing that sort of stuff, I would hate to see what the deficit would be if it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us acknowledge that we are talking about an Electoral Commission which is independent of government, and has been set up after consideration of a report by the Parliament. It is run by persons who are independent of government-for instance, I cannot direct them as their Minister. Let us acknowledge that there is no bias within the system. If one loses an election obviously one gets sour about it, and I have felt sour in the past as well. But let us also acknowledge that what the Commission is doing in this area, in terms of the de-duplication process, the survey that has been conducted since the election and so on, has provided very good instruments geared towards ensuring that we have an honest roll and honest elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I have referred to Bayulu, Beagle Bay, Kalumburu, LaGrange, Lombardina, One Arm Point, Oombulgarri, the central reserve, Jigalong, Mount James and the three remote teams is that 99 per cent of the voters are Aborigine. Tragic as it may be, they are almost all illiterate and innumerate. A look at the level of formal voting shows a distortion of the national average. It begs a question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to turn his back and wander around does not change the facts. When one looks at the vote one sees box after box contrary to the national, State and local average. The votes cast in favour of the Labor Party were 92.1 per cent, 98.6 per cent, 92.3 per cent, 89 per cent and 85.9 per cent, and the Minister wonders why I raise this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise it because, quite frankly, I question the integrity of the voting. I am not questioning the integrity of the voters. I am asking whether there is a mechanism in place that prevents the corruption which is widespread in the north of Western Australia as the result of the manipulation of the Aboriginal community by thugs, bullies and Labor supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister thinks he will put me off by suggesting there is something distasteful about raising the matter, I have news for him. I will pursue it until I am satisfied with the answers, and the Minister has not satisfied me that there is any comparison between Lygon Street and Wiluna. The truth of the matter is many of those Aborigines are mobile; they go from settlement to settlement and invariably they stay but for a few days with their friends and relations. They move from one centre to another centre for ceremonies, funerals, celebrations or for the sheer pleasure of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost without exception they have no fixed abode, unlike somebody who lives in Toorak. People do not live in the park in Toorak, then flit across to a park in another suburb. The normal lifestyle for these people, basically, is to live as fringe dwellers, tragically, with friends and relations on Aboriginal reserves on the edge of town. It is very difficult to detect them in the same way as when they are being sought for other reasons there is great difficulty in locating them. I asked what arrangements the Government has in place. Senator Bolkus gave me an analogy and said that he had satisfied me. He has not. I am not reflecting upon the integrity of the Australian Electoral Commission; I have no reason to do so. I think that it does a good job under difficult circumstances. In some respects, I think its cleansing of the roll is more efficient and effective than it has been in the past-but it is far from good enough. </PARA>

<PARA> I made the point about the bias in what Senator Crichton-Browne raised that people are mobile wherever they are. Mr Chairman, I know this is straying a little, but a case was reported on the weekend of a company director who has discovered the state of the art technology in tax avoidance and tax havens. Offshore companies can be used as tax havens and this person does not even have to be identified as the owner of shares; he does not have to provide a location for a meeting of company directors. This person is John Elliott. So Senator Crichton-Browne should not tell me that people are not mobile, no matter what their class structure, position or location in society. What I said to him is that if he is concerned about something he should not develop this picture of a mythical person, but give us some facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raised this matter in Senate estimates Committee D. I bring it to the attention of honourable senators in the committee stage of this debate because I want to acknowledge that Mr Cox, the Electoral Commissioner, gave very welcome assurances that he would be happy to bring this whole matter to the attention of the media. That is set out on page D27 of the Hansard. Also, with regard to the question of avoiding any selective reporting of House of Representatives results and Senate results, on the same page of Hansard he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Certainly I have taken good heed of what you have said for next time. </PARA>
<PARA>Along with those assurances there was still an acceptance by the Electoral Commissioner that he would find out what percentage of votes cast were counted and available to the media on polling day. That is one of the questions that has not yet been answered and which we will come to later. If the Minister is able at this stage to give a clear answer to the question concerning the percentage of Senate votes counted on polling day it will help us to unravel the primary failure in reporting to the Australian public about the Senate count on the evening of the last general election. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there are two possible explanations for this unprecedented failure to relay to the Australian public the outline of the Senate vote that Australia had exercised that day. One explanation is that an insufficient number of Senate votes were counted on the evening after polling day and that therefore the media, regarding it as an insignificantly low proportion of Senate votes cast, did not see it was worthwhile to describe through television broadcasts, or to show tables through the television coverage of the Senate vote. There is a second explanation, that is, that there was not 2 per cent of the vote counted but perhaps 80 per cent of the vote counted and that the goal set by the Electoral Commission to have a very substantial count able to be described on that Saturday evening was achieved. Therefore, it leads to the explanation that the media failed to receive that information or failed to regard it as significant enough to include in its presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever of these two explanations was true at the last general election, I want to make it quite clear that the polling information in the coverage given from the tally room was the first election I can recall when there was no information given about the progress being made with the Senate vote. As far as the public was concerned there was an assumption that it was only the House of Representatives vote that mattered that day, that although every elector went to the polling booth and cast a vote for House of Representatives candidates and cast a vote for Senate candidates, when the results were being examined by the public there was an exclusive concentration on the House of Representatives and no information at all about the Senate. The danger in that situation continuing in future elections is that it will reinforce the mistaken perception amongst some members of the public that the Senate is not as important as the House of Representatives. We know in this chamber that in terms of parliamentary conduct-I am sure that the Ministers present would agree with this-this is the only legislative chamber that remains in the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> With the guillotined short debates and the iron use of numbers by the Government in the House of Representatives, there is too meagre an examination of legislation and other matters in the other place. The House of Representatives, of which I make not disparagement, is notable for other achievements but, in terms of the public's expectation of parliamentary debate on legislation and holding the Government to account, this Senate Chamber is the place to which the public should look. That correct perception is undermined if on the day of a general election there is zero information given to the Australian public about progress with the Senate count. As we know, we cannot expect a decisive outcome on that evening. We cannot even the next day expect to have candidates knowing who has been elected to the Senate. Usually it takes some six weeks for the Senate vote to be counted because of the enormous number of candidates and of the complications involved in determining the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with 80 per cent of the vote counted, as it should be on the night, it is possible to determine five out of six senators who are going to be elected in each State and to have a reasonable basis for estimating what will be the outcome of the sixth Senate place in each State on that night. It would then be possible for an informed political journalist or for spokesmen from major parties to say that on the basis of the 80 per cent count that has been indicated by the Electoral Commission and clearly displayed from the tally room to the Australian public they are confident, given past experience, that a particular party will retain all of its 30 senators or two senators or one senator and that the outcome is likely to be this in each of the States. That was impossible after the last general election. I want to have the answer to the question I put on notice in order for us to work out more carefully which of the two explanations is most likely for the failure on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to Senator Teague's question is that the Senate is just not sexy in news terms. The information I have is that, on the night, the first preference votes were counted in all polling booths and transmitted to State returning officers and then to the central tally room. They started coming in after 9 p.m. I am further informed that by the end of the night they had all come in. There was a bit of a hold-up because of the blackout that took place during the night. I am also informed that they also appeared on the screens in the tally room on the night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the information I have it appears that maybe the House of Representatives, with some particular interest, held the media's attention more than the Senate. I cannot imagine why that would be. Maybe one of the reasons was that most of the Senate positions were predictable on the night, apart from the last one and, in some cases, two. In those circumstances we know that one of those results was finalised only last week. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot and should not canvass why the press reports the way it does other than to say that, on the information I have, there were a lot of Senate results through centrally and displayed on that night.

<PARA> I also bring to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services, as Senator Michael Baume did during the Estimates Committee hearing, that Senator Michael Baume was present in the tally room where there were displayed on various boards results from various electorates and the Senate, and that at the last time that he himself looked there was only a 2 per cent Senate vote showing on that display board. </PARA>

Finally, I conclude that when we can determine, in the light of that information, what the explanation is for that failure to relate the Senate count to the Australian public I can then put the plea to this Government and to the Electoral Commission that if the media had the information available and made the decision not to relay it to the Australian public-whether or not that information is, to quote the Minister, `sexy' or not-the Government ought to relay to the media that there is a responsibility to inform the Australian public of the results in this important part of the Australian Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in that light that I have noted the answer given by the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Cox, that he will certainly do so and that, in arrangements for future elections, he is happy to take up with the media the fact that there is an understanding given by the Electoral Commission to the media that there is a public responsibility for at least the relaying of information about the Senate vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A third one, set out on page D33 of the Estimates Committee Hansard, concerns the very useful report Project Parliament: The Management experience. I referred to that in the Estimates Committee hearing and the Minister will remember that I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Minister, may I make the suggestion to you that there be a government assessment of this report in the relevant parts of your Department and that there be consideration of a Government response to it, otherwise perhaps this very good report will be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the value of the report is not just government-</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly agree with that-</PARA>
<PARA>obviously it is of value to the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA>I also agree with that. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>I will consider your request, Senator. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to talk about the inadequacy of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to manage the placement of cables and necessary infrastructure in this building for the handling of a communications system, including sound and vision transmission from the chambers, data information, videotex and all the other materials which are enormously useful in this building. The report to which I referred was highly critical of the managerial performance of the ABC and raised some particular matters in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> With the completion of this building an 11-year program has ended and the Parliament House Construction Authority will no longer exist. I would like to hear the Government's response to the summation of the most important building project that Australia has known, the building of the new Parliament House, which has been carefully evaluated as to what lessons are to be learnt from the managerial experience of a 10-year building project of this scale. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, you and all honourable senators know that if there had been a parliamentary report with similar terms of reference and a similar set of recommendations voluminously and carefully set out at the end of that report, there would have been a necessity under our procedures in this chamber for the Government to respond to each of the recommendations one by one, and to give an account of how it had received the evaluation and what it was doing about the report's recommendations. Not for the want of the Construction Authority continuing in office I would like to hear from the Government in a systematic way as to what it is doing about the recommendations in this very important and valuable report. </PARA>

It was not the intention of the Government to respond in a formal way to the report and, having considered the honourable senator's request, I am sure that that is the Government's position. However, the report will be used by both government and the community as a useful resource of the experience and lessons can be drawn from it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer to the damning criticism by the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, of the Minister for his determination that the Commonwealth not be a party to a royal commission into organised crime and related matters. Does the Minister agree that he has failed to understand the depth of feeling in New South Wales about the level of organised crime in that State? Does the Minister understand that this is, as Mr Carr appreciates, an historic opportunity to put the issue of crime and corruption above party politics? Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the most appropriate forum to conduct a major inquiry into organised crime is the Australian Capital Territory Coroner's Court?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="869" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I resent the highly coloured way in which the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has presented Mr Carr's remarks if it is meant to suggest that any decision or any recommendation that I have made in relation to the carrying out of certain inquiries by way of a royal commission into alleged activities of the Mafia in New South Wales and beyond is due to any political prejudice or any political partisan attitude on my part. I reject that charge absolutely and utterly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have never said that the coronial inquest is the only means by which certain matters of concern can be properly resolved. I have pointed to the fact that at the same time as there is a coroner's inquest being undertaken into the manner and circumstances surrounding the death of Colin Winchester there is also an ongoing reference of the National Crime Authority, entitled Vigilante, which is supported by all jurisdictions on the mainland-the Federal Government, all State governments and, I think, the Northern Territory Government-in relation to Mafia activities throughout Australia, particularly those relating to marijuana production and distribution.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in fact, I have never made the sorts of assertions that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate tried to put into my mouth in relation to these matters. In any case, I have said quite clearly that these matters are not foreclosed, that if, at the end of the coronial inquest certainly, it appears that there are matters which require a royal commission, the Federal Government would look at that particular situation at that time. There is no way in which we could have a royal commission running concurrently with a coronial inquiry, as was suggested by Mr Peacock in his press release of yesterday. I think all commentators today have made that very clear.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports by Amnesty International expressing the fear that killings of Palestinians by Israeli forces might be `condoned and even encouraged' by the Israeli Government? In the light of the recent escalation of violence, including killings by the Israeli police and military, and growing international concern about a wide range of human rights abuses, can the Minister inform the Senate of the Government's attitude towards the current situation in the occupied territories and its effect on prospects for negotiations towards a settlement in the Middle East? Can the Minister inform the Senate also of the Government's attitude to the question of Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel and, in particular, to the occupied territories, which appears to be significantly adding to the present tensions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="869" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen references to the Amnesty International report to which Senator Beahan refers. Certainly I express my profound hope that the suggestion that the killing of Palestinians by Israeli forces may have been condoned or encouraged by the Israeli Government is not correct. It is difficult to believe that it could be correct. Nevertheless, the past few days have witnessed some of the worst violence seen in Israel and the occupied territories since the start of the Intifada in December 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Sunday, 20 May, as has been widely reported, a gunman described as a former Israeli soldier opened fire on a group of unarmed Palestinian Arabs near Tel Aviv, killing seven and wounding a number of others. Following news of this incident, rioting broke out in Gaza and the West Bank and in putting down the riot a further seven people were killed and hundreds were injured when Israeli troops fired into crowds.</PARA>
<PARA> In further violence, at least another six Palestinians have been reported killed by the Israeli Army. There have also been repercussions in Jordan with several French tourists wounded in an attack by a Palestinian, apparently in reaction to the events in Israel and the territories. Demonstrations have taken place in Palestinian camps in Jordan leading to clashes between Palestinians and Jordanian security forces.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the perpetrator of the original incident on Sunday has been arrested and that the Israeli Government has condemned the murder in the strongest terms and said that the incident will be fully investigated. While I very much welcome this, I must express, on behalf of the Australian Government, in the strongest possible terms, our deep concern at the subsequent actions of the Israeli security forces in putting down the Palestinian reaction to the murders. In the past Australia has condemned Israel's use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians and I have to repeat that condemnation in response to these latest incidents.</PARA>
<PARA> A particularly disturbing aspect of this latest wave of violence is that it has spilled over from the occupied territories into both Israel and Jordan. This escalation and the spreading of violence only reinforces the view that we have expressed on many occasions: that the Intifada will persist until its political causes are addressed-that is to say, until there is progress towards a settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, this latest violence will serve only to harden attitudes on both sides and, once again, set back the search for peace in the Middle East. The continuing violence reinforces the need for all parties to the dispute to move towards establishing a genuine dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in the context, most reasonably, of the proposals put forward last year by the United States Secretary of State, James Baker.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the last part of the question about the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, estimates by Israeli officials concerning the total number of Soviet Jews who may arrive in Israel over the next three to five years vary between 250,000 and 700,000. I would like to make it very clear that Australia wholeheartedly welcomes developments in the Soviet Union which have allowed Soviet Jews to emigrate. This is an issue on which Australia pressed the Soviet Union for several years.</PARA>
<PARA> While nobody can have any possible objection to the migration of such Soviet Jews to Israel, I, on behalf of the Australian Government, however, share the concern expressed by a number of other countries that some of these new migrants have been allowed to settle in the occupied territories and that the Israeli Government is apparently willing to allow an increase in these numbers. It is obvious that continued movement into the occupied territories, including east Jerusalem, does not encourage Palestinians to pursue a negotiated path towards a dialogue with Israel. Again, I urge Israel and all other parties to the dispute to refrain from actions which might jeopardise the prospects of peace in the region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs that on 2 May last year, in answer to a question from Senator Hill, the Minister indicated that the extent of the role of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in the Bungendore marijuana plantations was to provide the informant, Verducci, to the New South Wales Police. Is the Minister aware that last week in answer to questions put to the New South Wales Police Minister, the Police Minister stated that Operation Seville was a combined AFP and New South Wales Police operation specifically sanctioned by the then AFP Commissioner, Sir Colin Woods, and the then New South Wales Assistant Commissioner, Mr Cec Abbot, and later by the New South Wales Police Commissioner?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the exact language apparently used by Mr Pickering in relation to the involvement of the then Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in the Bungendore plantations episode. However, I am quite clear that the role of the AFP was to offer the informant, Verducci, to the New South Wales Police in relation to the operation which became known as Operation Seville. In fact, I think the informant first approached an AFP officer and as a result of that the New South Wales Police became aware of the proposal to cultivate a marijuana crop in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commissioner of the AFP obviously would have been aware of the plantations-that is quite clear-but I think the word `sanctions' in the sense that Senator Durack quotes Mr Pickering is perhaps not the best word to use.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Northern Australia. Is he aware of the declining levels of air services to north Queensland centres and, in particular, the failure of Ansett Airlines of Australia or Australian Airlines Ltd to guarantee regular flights after deregulation on 1 November? Will the Minister initiate discussion with the airline industry to protect services to regional Queensland-indeed, regional Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, as a resident of the north myself, and as Australia's most frequent flier, I do have a very keen interest in monitoring the services by both the major airlines, particularly to regional centres around Australia. There has in fact been an overall decline in services provided, largely as a result of the impact of the pilots dispute. There has been a very rapid recovery from the effects of that dispute, which did not surprise me but which certainly was contrary to the predictions of some others. The recovery still, of course, has some way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a reduction in the overall number of flights to Townsville, but an increase in the number of direct flights. My information is that the number of seats that are currently being offered to Townsville is roughly the same, in fact, as it was before.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as Proserpine is concerned, I understand that Australian Airlines, which currently operates a once-weekly flight to that community, will increase the frequency of those flights to three per week from July this year. There has been a decline in the number of services provided by both airlines to Mount Isa because of the lack of traffic on that particular route.</PARA>
<PARA> After deregulation occurs on 31 October this year, there will inevitably be changes-and in regional centres probably some substantial changes-in the way in which air services are delivered. I must say that it is a myth happily perpetuated by both Australian Airlines and Ansett that the two-airline agreement forced them into providing a large number of services to centres that they would otherwise, in a commercial sense, not have gone to. It is a myth with which I am very familiar, and it is just that-a myth. The reality is that, even during the course of the two-airline agreement, Ansett and Australian Airlines jointly, as a result of sensible commercial decisions taken by both airlines, are now servicing less than a quarter of the ports they serviced in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> In the bulk of those cases, that gap has been filled, rightly, by commuter operators offering different types of aircraft and able to deliver to the user something that the users consider to be just as important as, say, flying in safe aircraft-that is, frequency of service. In my own case in the Northern Territory, a heavily subsidised government airline, Connair Pty Ltd, with which Senator Tambling would be familiar, operated with massive government subsidies for many years using larger aircraft. Since that government subsidy was removed, those services have been very effectively provided by a number of local commuter operators using modern aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not see it as my role after 31= October to act as some sort of official monitor in terms of the commercial decisions that are taken by the airlines. The very point of the Government's decision, I know with the full support of many Opposition members, to end the two-airlines agreement was to provide a more commercial framework and a much more market driven approach in which that particular industry can operate. But I will be carefully monitoring, in a general sense, the effect that deregulation has on regional air services. I would certainly be receptive to-in fact, I would welcome-feedback from members of parliament about any problems they might see emerging in the early stages of deregulation after 31 October. I would be happy to take those problems up as a matter of course with the airlines concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome a question in this form on industrial disputes statistics because the question focuses on the causes. If the debate on industrial disputes focused more on causes, we might be able to come to a more intelligent debate about remedies and reducing the figures rather than use it as a political football in terms of the statistics recorded. However, with that acknowledgment of Senator Devlin's interest, let me say that in 1982, according to the Bureau of Statistics, wage claims were the major cause of industrial disputes. They amounted to 44.3 per cent of disputes in that year. I might add that in that year managerial policies, as defined by the ABS, accounted for 18.1 per cent of industrial disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That automatic knee-jerk assumption by Senator Hill indicates that he knows nothing at all about the ABS categorisation of those matters. That is consistent with Senator Hill's knowledge on a lot of things in industrial relations. Since the introduction of a prices and incomes accord, the number of disputes involving wage claims has fallen dramatically. The latest figures, for the year ended February 1990, show that wage claims figured in only 14.2 per cent of disputes. Under the accord, during the period of the Hawke Government, industrial disputation has fallen 60 per cent, compared to that of the Fraser years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proportion of disputes linked to managerial policies has risen dramatically. In 1982 they formed 18.1 per cent of all working days lost through industrial disputation, but by 1988 the figure had risen to 52.4 per cent. In 1989 the proportion of disputes due to managerial policies had risen to 54 per cent and in the year to February 1990, the figure stood at 52 per cent. There are a variety of reasons for the problem, including a failure to consult properly, outmoded management-worker relationships, a failure to embrace the principles of a more cooperative workplace relationship and a more participative mode of management, and poor training by middle management and by some shop stewards in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government allocated $12m for the workplace reform program in 1989-90. The three main elements of that program are: workplace resource schemes, under which regional centres will provide advice and support for enterprises on award restructuring and workplace reform; workplace training, which provides for the training of management and union personnel in participative practices and organisational change; and work change assistance, which provides support to employers and unions to help them undertake award restructuring and workplace reform projects and activities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made the point several times yesterday and I will make it again for the benefit of Senator Alston and anyone interested: the greatest problem we will have with the Newstart program during the next few years will be to get people over the age of 50 off unemployment benefits-on Newstart, as it will become-and back to work.

One wonders how we will be able to address those. In some areas, particularly for the unemployed in country areas who have been on benefits for longer than 12 months, it is virtually impossible to get a job. There are simply no jobs available in the areas in which they live. Obviously, many people in that category will be a lot younger than 50 years-some of them will be in their twenties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Social Security inform the Senate what effect payments received via compensation or emergency relief by the victims of the Newcastle earthquake and the recent floods in New South Wales, Queensland and Gippsland will have on pensioner and beneficiary entitlements? Are these payments treated as income for the purpose of assessable income for pensioners and beneficiary recipients? Will this reduce their entitlements?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="875" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Black and a number of other honourable senators have been asking for some time now how payments made to victims of the earthquake and the floods will be treated. Of course, some difficulties in that respect need to be cleared up, not simply by making pronouncements in the Senate but by making sure that those who are setting up funds to assist flood victims contact the Department of Social Security first so that they can determine just exactly what kind of arrangements will need to be made, particularly in the preparation of the deeds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 3 of the Social Security Act specifically exempts from the definition of `income':</PARA>
<PARA>insurance or compensation payments made by reason of the loss of, or damage to, buildings, plant or personal effects;</PARA>
<PARA>In that context, we take compensation to have a pretty broad meaning-broad enough to encompass payments made from relief funds such as the Lord Mayor's fund in Newcastle and a number of other funds that have been set up for the flood victims. If the trust deed of any of those funds is framed in a way that allows payments for such purposes and the trustees make payments of those kinds to pensioners and beneficiaries, those payments will not be treated as income for pension or benefit purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as long as the money is spent fairly quickly on repairs or maintenance, the money will not be treated as an asset for assets test purposes. In most cases, of course, that will not matter because the amounts of money will be too small to affect the assets test. Obviously, since 13 June those thresholds have been reasonably high-$103,000 for single home owners, $177,000 for single non-home owners, $147,000 for married home owners and $221,000 for married non-home owners. They are reasonably high amounts and we do not anticipate that too many people will be affected because of this provision.</PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act does not count as income the value of emergency aid or other forms of emergency assistance. So the emergency payments that were made in the early period after the earthquake and after the floods do not present any problem at all. That would include the payments that were made directly by the governments of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria and not simply the payments made by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA> As with Newcastle, the flood victims in New South Wales, Queensland and, indeed, in Gippsland, in which Senator McGauran has shown such an interest, later received amounts to repair houses or replace belongings. Those amounts will not be taken into account in the assessment of pensions or benefits, provided that the conditions I referred to earlier are met. As I said earlier, it is most important that trustees of those funds contact the Department in the early stages so that they can make sure what provisions in the Social Security Act may apply to those payments.</PARA>
<PARA> Another contentious point that needs to be addressed is the proceeds of insurance claims and how they will be treated when they are paid to victims, although I understand that in the case of the floods there might not be too many who will be eligible for insurance payments. Under the legislation as it currently stands, payments made in respect of insurance claims that were made in the aftermath of the Newcastle earthquake are assessable as assets, at least until they are expended. In most cases, of course, they are going to be expended fairly quickly because people are anxious to get on with their lives and rebuild. Therefore, they will not present a problem. But just in case, the previous Minister wrote to the Prime Minister in February on this matter. We are discussing with the Prime Minister whether or not a 12-month exemption could be provided to people in that category.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Gippsland, the Department did not pay the double rate in affected areas because the impact in Gippsland was judged not to be as adverse as it was in New South Wales and Queensland. To make up for that, the Victorian Government was quick off the mark with its assistance in the form of emergency aid. Since then, we have received some 60 claims from the area for unemployment and other benefits. These are being processed very quickly. What longer term impact there may be on the agricultural sector and the job market is harder to ascertain. Perhaps market gardening in those areas will be fairly badly affected and we may see a rise in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit. We will keep that monitored and make sure that people are paid as soon as the claims come in.</PARA>

<PARA> As to the question of cultural sovereignty, on the one hand, and ownership of television stations and local content and support for the local industry, on the other hand-the television production industry and so on-I think there is some confusion about that issue because of ownership requirements and the support of the local industry. Nonetheless, I think the higher the level of overseas ownership, the less likely it is that attention will be given by television proprietors to supporting the local industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure of the exact date or time, but I remind honourable senators that the Broadcasting Tribunal, to which Senator Sheil referred in his question, in fact introduced last year tighter and more strict provisions in relation to local content and that local content level is to be phased up.

This report is currently being considered not merely by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories but by other relevant government departments.

<PARA> The second part of the honourable senator's question is: is it true that this report makes some recommendations?

<PARA> The third part of the question is: am I aware that it is 12 months since the previous Minister gave his personal commitment to restriction? Yes, I am. Am I aware that forest logging and destruction continue unabated? Yes, I am, although there have been some improvements in the Asia-Pacific Basin in some countries with the production of better management plans.

I did read Mr Murray's comments in the Parliament yesterday and, I must say, I made the same assumption as Senator Faulkner: that the statements had more to do with Mr Murray's leadership problems than with the factual situation at Kingsford-Smith Airport. In fact, I have met the rural airlink action group, which is a very representative organisation, representing most of the communities that use Kingsford-Smith Airport in regional New South Wales, and I could hardly have been more forthright in what I said to them. I noted afterwards that my views were canvassed quite properly in the press by the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I said to it was that Kingsford-Smith Airport is Australia's most important international port, it is Australia's most important national port, it is also an important regional airport for the residents of New South Wales and the Government is not in the business of moving to exclude regional airlines from the use of Kingsford-Smith Airport. What I find to be extraordinary about Mr Murray's position on this-frankly, I would be interested to hear the views of the Premier of New South Wales on this-is that the people of New South Wales benefit to a more direct extent from the importance of Kingsford-Smith Airport in the first two categories that I have mentioned-that is, as an international port and a national port-than any other residents in Australia. It is vital for the residents of New South Wales that Kingsford-Smith Airport continue to be able to offer and operate efficient international and national services because they are the direct beneficiaries of it.</PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out the other day in the Senate, the congestion problem at Kingsford-Smith Airport has to be addressed. The Government is addressing it on a number of fronts, design work has started on Badgery's Creek; a major upgrade of the air traffic control facilities at the airport is to commence and the third runway at Sydney Airport will be constructed if the environmental impact statement indicates that it is environmentally safe to proceed. But if all of that happens it will still not be sufficient to solve the congestion problems at Kingsford-Smith Airport.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Murray's comments were based on a meeting that was held at officer level recently in New South Wales where the officers concerned quite properly put on the table-it would have been irresponsible for them to have done otherwise-all of the options that are currently being considered by government to address congestion at Kingsford-Smith Airport. The particular option that has excited the ire of Mr Murray is peak period pricing. I understand that is what he mentioned in the New South Wales Parliament yesterday. That had to be put on the table because it is a commonplace practice which is used at airports internationally to deal with traffic congestion.</PARA>
<PARA> A successful experiment was run last Easter Thursday which has become known as the Willoughby exercise. There was a voluntary arrangement by the airlines-the first for a long time; and I must say that I am pleased that the airlines agreed to do it-to reschedule their flights at Kingsford-Smith Airport. I am happy to provide any honourable senator who is interested with the detailed results of that Easter Thursday exercise, which significantly reduced congestion, not just at Sydney but also at Melbourne and Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA> A further meeting will take place in the next week or two between the airlines to try to establish, if we can, a voluntary system of rescheduling flights in and out of Kingsford-Smith Airport similar to that which International Air Transport Association arrangements regarding international flights into Kingsford-Smith Airport. The reason I say that is to point out the obvious. I can provide this evidence to any honourable senator who has a real concern about Kingsford-Smith Airport.</PARA>
<PARA> It would not matter if the Government built a third, fourth, fifth or sixth runway at Sydney Airport. If we have airlines which advertise the fact that 20 aircraft will take off simultaneously at 7 a.m. from Sydney Airport, it will not happen, no matter what the Government does about it. That is the situation. It is commonplace for a number of airlines to offer departure and arrival times which are simply not able to be met. A lot of the responsibility initially, I hope, will be taken up by the airlines concerned to provide a rational arrangement of staggering aircraft departure and arrival times so that that extremely important facility at Kingsford-Smith Airport is utilised to the fullest extent. If the airlines cannot do that voluntarily, and we are giving them the opportunity to do so, then a solution will have to be imposed.</PARA>

As far as Mr Hatton's personal safety is concerned of course I do not take responsibility for that safety. It is a matter for the proper authorities in New South Wales. I have already indicated to this chamber, I think in answer to Senator Vanstone, that I believe it is extremely important that Mr Hatton and his family be advised of any threats to his life or limb and some assessment be made of the likelihood of those threats being carried out.

Mr Hatton is not the only person in office, either as a parliamentarian or a Minister, dealing with organised crime who has received such treats. I have had policemen living in my lounge room in relation to death threats. I have had police cars parked outside my parents' home in response to death threats.

Our approach has consistently been to seek to shore up commitment to democracy and human rights while at the same time dealing with the objective realities of those in possession of power and authority in a country where Australian interests are substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, of course, deplored both coups instigated by the Fiji military forces in 1987, and we continue to do so. We took a number of measures at the time to signal our abhorrence, including the recall of our High Commissioner and the suspension of civil aid and defence cooperation. Against the subsequent background of modest but steady improvement in Fiji's internal political and human rights situation since 1987, Australia has taken a number of steps toward a gradual normalisation of bilateral relations with Fiji, including the appointment of an ambassador, resumption of the civil aid program and resumption of ministerial and official contact on a wide range of issues. The exception is defence cooperation, the suspension of which remains firm. We have continued, and will continue, to make clear to the Fiji Government our hope that it will encourage a process of dialogue to arrive at an outcome to Fiji's problems which is broadly acceptable to all the communities there.</PARA>
<PARA> That approach is clear and straightforward but I notice that it has been the subject of a number of criticisms of varying degrees of stridency from the Opposition.

Most of the surveillance costs are attributed to Coastwatch which, in the normal course of events, lets us know and requests our intervention. There is, of course, very little prospect of ever recovering any costs. The boats themselves are deliberately of very low quality so that when they are seized they cannot be sold. About the only fate for them is an annual burning and the sending of the photos back to Indonesian fishing villages as a warning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Questions as to excise, of course, are more correctly directed to the Commonwealth Treasurer as the question of Commonwealth tobacco excise is a matter for him. I am quite sure that I can refer elements of Senator Maguire's question to the Treasurer for examination. I think honourable senators will be aware that there is certainly no safe level or form of tobacco use, and that is the interest of the Community Services and Health portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. In fact, in 1987 there were 18,000 tobacco related deaths. The Federal Government is very concerned about tobacco consumption and has introduced major initiatives to address this problem, including banning smoking in Commonwealth buildings and on domestic airline flights and prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in the electronic and print media. The Government is currently conducting a $2m national media campaign to reduce smoking by young women across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Maguire's question may have been prompted by a report by the Victorian Office of Prices on cigarette pricing, consumption and health costs. That is a report on a study of the relationship between cigarette pricing, consumption and health costs and was released only last month. It has not yet been examined in detail by the Commonwealth Government. It makes several recommendations, including one that the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy develop a specific taxation strategy as part of its overall smoking control program. I believe that the Council of Ministers will meet on 9 June and perhaps this matter will be given consideration at that meeting. The questions raised by Senator Maguire are central issues for consideration and I believe that both the Treasurer and the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy will give them the very careful consideration they deserve.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The need for the Government to establish a Register of Foreign Ownership of Australian land, property, businesses and resources.''</PARA>
<PARA>There is rapidly growing alarm in this country over the extent of, and increase in, foreign ownership of Australian real estate and business. Of particular concern is that the extent and concentration of foreign ownership of Australian land, property, business and resources is known neither to the Government nor the public. This is because the Government has so far refused to respond to widespread community support for the establishment of a register of foreign ownership. The Australian Democrats have consistently advocated such a register for many years. My predecessor as Democrat senator for Western Australia, former Senator Jack Evans, introduced a private member's Bill into this place in 1984 to establish such a register. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year former Senator Janine Haines moved amendments during consideration of the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988 to achieve the same result. Those amendments were defeated by a combined vote of Liberal, Labor and National Party senators. This morning I gave notice that the Australian Democrats will, before the end of this autumn sitting, reintroduce a private member's Bill to establish a national register of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also pressed time and time again for increases in the powers and resources of the Foreign Investment Review Board-the FIRB-so that it can adequately monitor the level of foreign investment and assess whether or not particular proposals are in Australia's national interest. The Government's response has been to significantly reduce the capacity of the FIRB to carry out its tasks. Its staff has been reduced from 60 to 20. In its 1983-84 annual report the FIRB stated that it had rejected 4.2 per cent of foreign investment proposals. In 1986-87, less than 0.4 per cent were rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Any development, trend or activity which has the capacity to significantly affect our economy or to affect the degree of control we have over our own destiny as a nation must be studied and monitored. The rapidly growing foreign ownership of Australian property, businesses and land could have a major impact upon our economy. If foreign ownership is concentrated in certain critical industries and activities in could lead to a situation where our State and Federal governments could lose effective control. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it absolutely clear that the concern of the Democrats is about purchases by nationals of all foreign countries equally, no matter where the investors in question are from. We are as concerned about British, American and Japanese investments as we are about investments of any other foreign nationals. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to understand foreign ownership and to understand to what extent and in what industries it may constitute a threat, we need first to establish a public register of foreign ownership and then all Australians will be in a position to know which of our national assets are in foreign hands. This fundamental information is our right and it is essential to public policy making. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the first question I asked in this chamber when I became a senator was about the question of a register for foreign ownership. The then Premier of Western Australia, Mr Brian Burke, made a public statement that there was no need for such a register in Western Australia. When I questioned him to what extent Western Australian assets were foreign owned he said he did not know. Current Premier, Carmen Lawrence, has not made a statement about such a register, but Mr Barry MacKinnon, the leader of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, has indicated publicly that the Liberals would be in favour of a register of foreign ownership for Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the belief of the Federal Government and the Federal coalition Opposition that increases in foreign investment are necessary to meet the interest bill on our foreign borrowing. Indeed, the corporate debt binge of the mid to late 1980s, which was encouraged by this Government with its negative gearing policy on foreign borrowings, is now resulting in a swap of foreign debt for foreign ownership and control. The vast majority of Australians do not welcome this shortsighted economic solution which will lead only to long-term problems in the shape of future payments of rent, profits and dividends to overseas owners, and it will significantly reduce the control which future Australian governments will be able to exercise over our economic situation and well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, approval for 100 per cent foreign ownership in the service industry real estate category is given unless the Treasurer judges the proposal to be contrary to the national interest. Many real estate investments do not have to come before the FIRB at all. Purchases of rural property worth less than $3m and businesses worth less than $5m have been exempt from FIRB approval since 1987. Purchases of several adjoining properties each worth less than $3m can result in enormous areas of rural land passing into foreign hands and the well-being of whole Australian communities can come to depend on the whims of absentee landlords. This is a particular concern in Western Australia and in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> When on 30 April 1987 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced the changes I just mentioned, he forecast that they would reduce applications needing FIRB consideration from 1,300 to 400 annually, but what he did not forecast and what has transpired is that the easing of the approvals procedure has been followed by a substantial sell-off of Australian assets without substantial benefits to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating's forecast of 400 applications annually needing FIRB consideration looks very sick today in the light of the most recent statistics. In its 1988-89 report, the FIRB reports how it considered 5,163 applications for foreign purchases of Australian assets, 4,398 of which it approved. Another 688 were withdrawn or approved automatically; only 77 were refused. I repeat: of 5,163 applications received, only 77 were refused. </PARA>
<PARA> Various sections in the community, including the National Farmers Federation, have expressed concern about the acquisition of rural properties and pastoral leases and the possibility of vertically integrated industries controlled by foreign interests; that is, not only the land, but also the transport, abattoirs, and the processing-the whole show. Foreign ownership has implications for virtually every facet of the Australian economy. Foreign investment occurs in the banking sector, the timber industry, the food and drink industry, tourism, recreation, mining, fishing, residential and commercial sectors and the media. My Australian Democrats colleague Senator Powell yesterday introduced into the Senate a private member's Bill to limit foreign ownership of television broadcasting stations to a maximum of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The banking industry is a good example. The current Government broke with a long established tradition by admitting foreign banks into Australia. The Australian Democrats strongly opposed that decision. However, it was supported by the Liberal and National Party senators in this place. The Government claimed that there would be all sorts of major advantages for Australians. It made statements such as that banking would become more competitive, customers would receive a wider range of services and better services, and that the sleepy Australian banking industry would be stimulated by the new competition and would become more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is now possible to assess the success, or otherwise, of the Government's initiative in allowing foreign banks into Australia. Essentially, the result is a disaster-at least for the ordinary people of Australia. I also remind the Senate that it is alleged that, under pressure to maintain profits in a new competitive environment, banks have, on occasion, cut corners, betrayed their fiduciary duty to customers and trapped clients-especially small business people-in excessive levels of debt, and stripped some clients of their assets. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Paul McLean has repeatedly called in this chamber for an inquiry into banking in this country. Only yesterday he reminded the Senate that he had tabled examples of banks that had foreclosed on the assets of small business people and then sold them at 25 per cent of the valuation they had arrived at when they induced the business people to take the credit-or debt as Senator McLean called it. In come cases that happened fewer than 12 months after their original transaction with the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also informative to note that in 1983 when this Government came to power, and before it launched into its deregulation of the financial sector, the percentage of our foreign debt owed by all financial institutions was 11.4 per cent. The percentage owed by the banks as a subset of all financial institutions was 4.1 per cent. By 1989, the percentage owed by all financial institutions had swollen to 33 per cent and that of the banks to 19.2 per cent. Thus during a period of six years the banks' percentage of our debt multiplied five-fold. During the same period their share of the debt of all financial institutions grew from around one-third of the total amount to almost two-thirds, thus opening the door to foreign investment and participation in our economy. This has contributed to the massive blow-out of our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now give the Senate some examples from my home State of Western Australia perceived foreign ownership and of who protested-sometimes vainly-against foreign ownership. One group in Western Australia which has expressed deep concern is the crayfishing industry. That industry was greatly concerned about a proposal last year which would have given a foreign-owned company a 25 per cent share of Western Australia's crayfishing processing licences. It quite rightly feared that foreign-owned processors would discriminate against Australian-owned producers. This would result in sales and profits flowing back to overseas interests, takeovers of vessels and Australian-owned fishing businesses, loss of profitability and viability of Australian businesses and possible manipulation of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, more than 250 crayfishermen gathered in Geraldton for an angry meeting in January 1989. In February 1989 a delegation led by the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (Inc.) met with Mr Keating in Canberra. Mr Keating then stated that he believed it would be against the national interest for the Western Australian crayfish industry to be 25 per cent foreign owned. </PARA>
<PARA> West Australians were also appalled when they learned that tourism developments on Rottnest Island were being considered for sale to foreign interests. The angry reaction in Perth to the proposed sale of leisure facilities at Rottnest intensified after it became known that the intended purchaser was a subsidiary of the Japanese sports group, Victoria Company Limited. It happens that the Victoria Company is offering $303m for the purpose of the Burswood Island Casino and is also offering to buy out Mr Dallas Dempster's share in the Burswood Property Trust for $93m. Interestingly, Mr Dallas Dempster is also Chairman of the Rottnest Island Authority-a State Government statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of circles that we have in Western Australia and it is part and parcel of WA Inc. The connection between the interests of Mr Dallas Dempster and the Victoria Company can no longer be ignored. The company already owns restaurants in Perth and a chain of gift shops with the insultingly inappropriate name, Purely Australian. If the FIRB had wider powers I believe that a full and public investigation conducted into the proposed sell-off of the Burswood Casino facilities would have been very much in the public interest and would have revealed the sensitive issues involved in the ownership of these assets. </PARA>
<PARA> If the foreign ownership register, which this Bill seeks to establish, is put in place it would be possible to ascertain what other Australian assets are owned by this company and what the ramifications are. A register of foreign ownership would also reveal the level of foreign ownership of mineral sands industries in Western Australia and elsewhere in Australia. This is a rapidly burgeoning industry in the south-west of Western Australia which is laying siege to many environmentally sensitive areas and threatening the social fabric of established rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent study case could be the sale of assets worth $550m by Pioneer International Ltd, including mineral sands mines in the south-west of Western Australia, which have been operating as Cable Sands (WA) Pty Ltd. An alarming aspect is that a proposed, highly controversial, cable sand mine at Jangardup on the south coast of Western Australia was assessed by the FIRB as a current mine. According to the FIRB guidelines, the sale of a currently operating mine does not require approval. I will quote from a letter from Mr J. F. Livermore, Acting First Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, of 18 January 1990. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's foreign investment policy differentiates between existing developed mines, exploration rights and new mines for development. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for Nissho to acquire the Pioneer assets was primarily viewed as the takeover of an existing mining business and was examined on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This view is not shared by many Western Australians who are aware that the proposed Jangardup mine is certainly not an existing mine and that it has, in fact, not yet received final approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the colonial takeover of much of Asia and Africa by the European powers in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was, in most cases, powered initially by foreign investment. Merchants established trading posts and acquired land, wealth and economic power. By patronage and manipulation they stealthily translated this into political influence and political power. When the local people woke up to what was going on and became perturbed and restless, the Europeans called in the military power of their country of origin to protect their, by now extensive, interests. Thus did mighty India with her enormous population and vast resources slip, with barely a whimper, beneath the British yoke. Thus did the textile merchants of Lancashire grow fat on cotton grown in Indian soil by Indian labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanisms today may be slightly more subtle but they are potentially, in essence, the same. Force of arms will probably not be needed. Economic takeovers are less bloody and less disruptive to profits. But the ultimate loss of power and control over one's own destiny can be just as complete and just as devastating. Despite the big increase in foreign ownership in Australia, which is evident from the figures in the FIRB annual report of 1988-89, no-one knows its full extent. At present there is no way of finding out precisely how much of Australia has been sold, leased, loaned, mortgaged, or simply given away. I remind the Senate that in 1987 the Premier of Western Australia, Premier Burke, is on record as having stated that he did not know how much of Western Australia was foreign owned. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a register of foreign interests which own or control Australian assets is a simple but necessary aid to the economic well-being of Australia. Such a register would require foreign corporations to provide annual returns to the Treasury. Once we gain a comprehensive picture of foreign ownership in Australia we will be in a position to assess possible economic risks and threats to our national sovereignty and to take steps to exercise control in areas where this is shown to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a register will need to be complemented by an increase in the powers and resources of the FIRB. Indeed, in 1988 the United States House of Representatives debated and passed a Bill to establish such a register of foreign ownership of assets and land in the United States. So if the mighty United States economy, the most powerful on the Earth, can be threatened by foreign ownership, how much more vulnerable are we in Australia to this threat? If I had time, I would read to the Senate part of the debate on that particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a characteristic of banana republics that they allow foreign ownership to flourish without control, their limited resources to fall into the hands of foreigners, and their labour to be exploited for the benefit of those same interests. If we are to avoid sliding downhill into banana republic status, we need desperately to know who owns what. At present no-one knows the extent of foreign ownership in Australia. When there is no knowledge, there is rumour and speculation. I commend this urgency motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be wonderful for the Australian Democrats to come into the Senate with no aspirations ever to govern the country, to have no responsibilities for the things they advocate because they know they will never have to implement them. It is even more easy when one, in particular, knows she is not going to be here much longer. They do not have to consider priorities. They do not have to worry whether what they are doing is more important then the hundred other things they would like to do-they just say that we should do them all. Then they come up and say they are all urgent. This is an urgency motion. It is a wonderful matter of urgency. Senator Jenkins said they proposed it in 1984. The senator who proposed it lost his seat. It was again proposed in 1989, and the senator who proposed it lost her seat. I hope it is not contagious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter is not in any sense urgent. The first thing that we want to comment on about this motion is that it is supposedly an urgency motion. We can talk about the merits of it in a moment. Firstly, I just want to say whatever definition of urgency Senator Jenkins might have, this is a blatant misuse of the Standing Orders of the Senate. She pretends that something that may or may not be a good idea-depending upon one's view of the merits-is, six years after it was originally proposed, paralysingly, urgent, when we all know that it is not. The failure to distinguish between the important and the urgent is one of the problems that besets people who do not have to set priorities and who never aspire to govern. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do we think this motion is being put? Everybody knows why, but let me just put it on the record for any poor benighted soul who might read this bit of Hansard. It is because the Australian Democrats need to get their division numbers up. They need a few divisions where they vote against everybody else. So they say, `What is the silliest idea we can think of that anybody who might ever have to govern the country would not agree with?' They dream it up not as a matter of public importance but as an urgency motion so we have to have a vote. Then they get their division numbers up. It is a bit pathetic. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to join the debate, I just resent being told this artificial proposal pretending that something is urgent has to be dragged before the Senate when we have so much other important work to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk about foreign investment and let us talk about whether we ought to have a register, its costs and its benefits. The debate about foreign investment is an important one. I have to say it was not advanced very substantially by the comments we just heard, nevertheless the fact that people can say unimportant things about it does not mean it is not an important question. There is an important question of balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The things Senator Jenkins said are not entirely without merit. The conclusions to which she took us are quite erroneous, but it does not mean there is no reasonable cause for concern for the legitimate interests of Australians about foreign investment in Australia. There needs to be a balance between the benefits which foreign investment brings to Australia and the rights of Australians to have the final say over the nature of that investment and over the way in which the economy develops. I think that balance is important. It is the theme to which I wish to return on several occasions during this discussion, because although I think the Democrats have got it wrong, I certainly think the Opposition's proposals in the last election were equally ill-founded. So we need to talk about that question of balance. Let us talk about the Democrats' proposal first and then about the alternatives, should time permit. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of cost benefit analysis does one apply to this proposal? At the end of the day that is what we need to decide, not ask what is the total aggregate of good ideas that might be in the world that we could introduce if only there were enough resources. We need to know what are the benefits of doing this against the costs of doing it, without looking at the ultimate question-which we do not have time for-which is what are the alternative things we could do with these resources. So what are the potential benefits?</PARA>
<PARA> After we have a register, nothing actually happens. It is not like saying that we are going to strengthen the FIRB. Maybe we can declare it a national monument and everybody can come and look at it-it will become a tourist attraction-because it is an after the event register. What it says is 17 things happened last year which we wish had not happened. It is not an action; it simply provides a record of what has happened. What are we going to do with it? When one starts looking at costs and benefits, the register does not get to the crux of the problems. There are issues to be looked at in foreign investment, but a register is not the solution. I am not pretending that this is the Democrats' intention, although others might say so, but the unintentional consequence of what it would do would be the release and exacerbation of the xenophobic pressures which can always build up in a country, particularly in time of economic adversity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a significant downside that needs to be looked at. I think foreign investment needs to be looked at in a very non-discriminatory manner. I want to reiterate, because someone on the other side of the chamber seemed to be concerned about it, that I am not alleging that as the motivation of the honourable senators who put forward the proposal; I am simply saying we have to look at the unintended consequences of things that happen as well as the intent of the people who proposed them. Many dreadful things have happened, caused by people acting with the best of intentions. The thing about it is that we do know the position. It is not as if governments have been unable to act in areas of foreign investment where they have been concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very strange day to initiate this proposal. Yesterday the Australian Government announced actions to make strict limits on foreign ownership in a very important strategic area of our interest-not so much important economically, but important culturally; it is important to the preservation of the Australian culture. The day after that proposal we did not need a register to find out there was a problem-that information was available. We were able to find it and we were able to know what policy we wanted and to act. Most other countries have acted in similar ways without such a register. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about the problems that people perceived in 1987. The Government acted in 1987 on the question of the ownership of residential land. We did not need a register to tell us that there was a problem. We did not all need to sit down and say, `It has gone from 11.2 to 13.9 per cent'. Sufficient information was available for the Government to act when it believed it was necessary to act in the national interest. What we need is a Government with the will to act and the capacity to protect the national interest when required, and that will and capacity has been exhibited. We can have a perfectly legitimate debate about whether there is too much control or not enough, but it does not need some sort of register. There are already reviews made of a wide range of areas of foreign investment proposals. They come before the FIRB. Some people might wish more of them were rejected; some people might wish more of them were allowed and none were rejected, but we certainly get plenty of information. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the costs? Trying to find the benefits, I must admit, is a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack. There are public direct costs. The Commonwealth Government at the moment in the main has no record of these transactions. They are not transactions conducted under Commonwealth jurisdiction; they are records conducted under State jurisdiction. We have land registers. We have corporate affairs commissions and we have one thing that is increasingly coming under Federal jurisdiction-the Australian Stock Exchange. Essentially they are where these records are kept, but predominantly they are not matters of Commonwealth responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing I say about that is that, if there are to be such registers, I think they ought to be set up by the States. I do not want to go along that tangent. My colleague Senator Schacht might wish to pursue it subsequently. There would be significant direct public cost in establishing the very large record-keeping proposal. Nobody has yet effectively costed it because the cost of costing makes it not worth doing also. It is quite clear that we do not need a major survey to work out that we are talking about a significant bureaucratic task in establishing the records, establishing liaison with the States, getting the information from the States, and maintaining and reviewing the information regularly-that is, were we to get the cooperation of the States for the proposal. I have to say that the track record in that area is not fantastic. </PARA>
<PARA> For some years we have been trying to set up the Australian Securities Commission. Even after we get every State government to agree, we still cannot guarantee to get the legislation passed because the reprobates in the Legislative Council of Western Australia will not pass it. They still think they are living in the nineteenth century. I would love to have a debate about that some time. They are living under electoral rules that protect them as though they were living in the nineteenth century; but we will debate that at another time. It is an appalling decision. In a situation where five State governments in Australia do not control the upper Houses in their States, we may well find that, even if the Federal Government has the will, it does not have the capacity to set up this register. </PARA>
<PARA> There are private direct costs. Every foreign company and every individual who comes from overseas to do business in Australia would find that process more expensive because they would have to set up extra bureaucratic functions and extra reporting services and would have to keep extra records, et cetera. It makes Australia a less attractive place in which to do business. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also substantial indirect costs. There are a number, but I want to refer to only one: it would send absolutely the wrong signal to people around the world about Australia's attitude to foreign investment. Australia needs, has always needed and continues to need foreign investment. Since 1788 Australia has always had foreign investment. Actually, there is an interesting historical argument about whether we had some before then. But let us not worry about that. Australia is a very small country with very large capital requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are not to have that foreign investment, how will we supply the jobs to Australians? We will otherwise be trying to invest solely upon the basis of the inadequate savings of Australians or we will have Australian companies borrowing money overseas so that they can tap into the savings of other countries to invest in Australia and thus create the jobs, with the debt consequences that follow. I have to say that the balance to which I referred before is a very difficult one to strike. It is true that we want to maintain a high level of investment in Australia if we are to sustain growth and keep providing jobs to Australians. The Opposition, in its policies at the last election, was recommending a virtual open slather. At page 21 of the Economic Action Plan, the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> These controls-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, controls on foreign investment-</PARA>
<PARA>should be abolished except for certain strategic areas as the media, and with them the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole box and dice was to go. I am not actually sure that that was the policy of the Opposition, because a few days later the National Party of Australia put out an election policy statement which on page 29 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We will ensure there is a more effective review and monitoring of foreign investment in Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder all the National Party senators have left the chamber. They probably wanted to vote for this motion and were not allowed to. That is why they have left. Their policy says that they want to have more effective review and monitoring. Senator Jenkins should have been liaising with Senator Boswell. He might have been onside with her, for the first time. I am not quite sure what the Opposition's policy was. If we assume that we should attribute the Opposition's policy to the Economic Action Plan, I say that it fundamentally got the balance wrong. My view is reinforced by the Opposition's reaction to yesterday's decision concerning television ownership. I think Opposition members are quite wrong about that. I think they have the principles wrong. They have the balance wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have a very broad understanding of the role which foreign investment can play and has played in Australian development over the last 200 years. They are aware that we need the extra investment to generate our growth. They are aware that benefits flow from foreign investment in terms of access to technology. They are aware that it potentially gives greater benefit to markets, that international companies coming to operate in Australia are much more likely to be export orientated and that we are much more likely to get access to the markets of their host countries when there are investments developed from companies from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamentally, we are saying that Australia needs to be internationalising the Australian economy-not trying to wrap it in cotton wool but opening it to the world, saying `We are prepared to compete; we are prepared to go out and take the world on in terms of trying to provide efficiency, trying to be competitive, trying to be open'. Therefore, we need to continue to encourage Australian companies to extend their operations internationally where it is appropriate and in their interests and to have others invest here. It is necessary; it is inevitable anyway. We could not prevent it if we wanted to-unless we want to model ourselves on the Burmese economy. The modern industrial world, the modern financial world, is a 24-hour a day high-tech immediate communication world. We have to be open to that sort of investment. I think the balance is important and it is difficult to strike. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that it would be an extremely expensive exercise for the Commonwealth Government to set up such a register. It sound easy but it would be very difficult. At the moment there are no records upon which the register can be based at the Commonwealth level. It would require extensive new reporting mechanisms. I am not sure whether doing it annually is a particularly useful exercise anyway. In these days of modern computers, this is a bit of a quill pen suggestion. If we were going to do it, we would want it to be a contemporaneous record. Nearly all those records are computerised. We would need to maintain those contemporaneous records, but that is a very expensive task. If it is to be useful, we need to get the information at a time when it is useful, not much later. There would be substantial public costs. There would be substantial private costs. There is substantial net detriment to the Australian economy. It would be sending the wrong signals to the world about the way in which we want our economy to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government already can act, and proved yesterday that it is prepared to act, when it believes the situation requires such action. The information we require on which to act in those areas is substantially already available, but is assisted by the occasional Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys. They are much more likely to be a useful source of information on which to base policy than is a necessarily imperfect and after the event register. Even were it to be cost effective and done perfectly, it is highly unlikely to be a very useful document. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want to send the wrong signals to the rest of the world. We want to maintain our commitment and our momentum to internationalise the economy. I agree that it is important that we talk about the matter because there is a delicate balance to be maintained between the need for foreign investment and the right to control our own destiny. That balance, I think, is being struck. We need to continue to talk about it. I do not believe a register makes any contribution to that and I urge the Senate to reject the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my belief that the call for a register of foreign ownership in Australia is an emotional and, maybe at this stage, a dangerous diversion away from the very serious economic problems confronting this country. They are problems which are the direct result of seven years of Labor mismanagement. I thought it was appalling that in the response that Senator McMullan gave to what Senator Jenkins believes is a matter of urgency he handled the matter in a very light way. There is emotional concern among the general public and the reason for that concern is not recognised. How did we get to that stage? We got to that stage because our economy has been allowed to get into the situation that we are in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The single most important and serious problem for this country is the chronic current account deficit-a fact mentioned by Senator Walsh in recent times. The fact is that month in and month out, year in and year out we import more than we export. As a result, our net foreign debt had increased under seven years of Labor from some $30 billion-odd to $118 billion at the last count. When we buy more than we sell there are only two ways to pay for that deficit. Both involve the savings of foreigners. We either borrow the savings of foreigners or we encourage the savings of those same foreigners into investment in Australia. It is the latter which must be encouraged at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the Australian Democrats' motion is that it positively discourages foreign investment and it puts out a signal of uncertainty about the future of that investment. While a lot of people say that that could not happen in Australia, a lot of foreign investors in South American-type countries-honourable senators might recall the Treasurer, Mr Keating, talking about our going down the Argentinean road-have seen assets seized. It is the wrong signal to give at a time of almost economic crisis in this country. Prior to 1983, I would have favoured debt rather than equity participation. Prior to coming into this place I put that statement on the record. My reasoning for it, in those days, was that, if one had the capacity to repay the debt, in time one would have total ownership of the particular asset concerned. The sad reflection on this country is that today that is not an option. We must seek equity investment from overseas. Debt must be serviced, irrespective of the profitability of a particular organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In these disastrous economic conditions this can often mean that an overseas lender can acquire, sometimes unwillingly, an Australian asset by default. I give a current classic example of the Bond University. No Australian buyer can be found for the Bond share of this particular institution. I understand that over the last couple of years it has been totally funded by the Japanese partner. What may well happen is that the Japanese partner will become the reluctant owner of 100 per cent of Bond University. With this sort of build-up and antagonism towards foreign ownership, I can tell the Senate what the headlines will be: `Japanese own and control Australia's only private university'. Shock, horror! Yet it may be the only option-not because the Japanese particularly want to do so but because there is no option. With equity investment, foreign investors take their chances. If they succeed, they get a return; if the investment suffers a loss, they must pay their share of the loss. I do not believe that the Australian Democrats can have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last three years I have sat here and listened to the Democrats railing about the level of overseas borrowings. We heard former Senator Haines complaining-demanding, in fact-that interest on overseas loans should not attract a tax deduction. As I indicated earlier, if we have this continuing deficit between what we buy from overseas and what we sell, when imports continue to exceed exports, we have no option but to take one of those two courses. We do have some options, of course, to overcome the need for such massive foreign investment. One option is to export more and import less and engage in more local manufacture of consumption goods. By that, I mean making the things that people want to buy. We have to ask ourselves a lot of questions. Of our exports, over 80 per cent comprise minerals and primary products-commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> With the current slump of our second largest export earner, wool, our position is looking more and more desperate. I would rather use the word `desperate' than the word `serious' which was used by Senator Button and for which he was savaged by the Treasurer. When I saw the savaging by the Treasurer, I wondered whether his incredible reaction related to his sensitivity to the role that Senator Button played when he had the job of messenger to bring the bad news to Mr Hayden in 1983. Perhaps Mr Keating saw Senator Button in this instance as being once again the messenger-this time, however, somewhat more subtly. </PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for exports is decidedly gloomy, and it gives me no pleasure to say that. Not only is there trouble with wool, but the price for steaming coal has gone soft, with prices reduced by over $5 a tonne. I remind the Senate that coal is our largest export earner. A part solution to our problem is to lift the level of processing of our raw materials prior to export-what is commonly called value added. The point I make is that, if that were profitable, it would already be happening. The reason why it is not happening is the sort of question that should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Factors acting against value added are numerous. We can ask overseas investors why they do not go into this. One of the complaints made-I think this is what Senator Jenkins was referring to-is that the sort of foreign investment we are getting is coming into areas that people do not like. They are saying, `Why can't they go into areas which give us more value added, in raw materials or import replacements?'. One will always get the same answer when one asks those potential overseas investors this question: `Why are you putting 16 golf courses on the Gold Coast in Queensland? Why aren't you making something that replaces imports? Why aren't you making television sets and so on?'. The answer is always the same: we have an inflexible industrial relations system with entrenched restrictive work practices, which make our unit costs of production uncompetitive. It has nothing to do with wages. It is an entrenched system and it is endemic throughout Australia. It does not matter what institution one goes to, one will see it. I ask that, some time down the track, the Democrats bear that in mind when we start looking at freeing up the industrial market. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a grossly inefficient transport system and a waterfront which is a scandal-not only in respect of cost but because of its notorious unreliability. It has been said to me on many occasions that people would not mind the cost if they could be assured of reliability. We have a tax system which is not competitive in a competitive world. I say this deliberately, because these were the factors which prompted the China Steel company to decide to put its steel plant into Malaysia rather than into Gladstone. Gladstone is a major coal outlet for Queensland. The opportunity to use our coal to process steel with iron ore from the Pilbara for export may never come again. It is another opportunity lost. This was brushed off by Senator Button in Question Time yesterday when he simply should have said, `We could not compete'. Malaysia offered better prospects than Australia. It was a better place to invest some $US2 billion. What a sorry state this country has got itself into. </PARA>
<PARA> Another obvious solution is to engage in the manufacture of import replacement goods; we should make the consumption goods that people want to buy. If it were possible, this area could be taken up by small to medium business. But it is not happening. Why not? With interest rates running at about 20 per cent-three times more than our overseas competitors-it is absolutely impossible for a legitimate business to survive. The majority of businesses do not have access to equity financing; their only option is borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> I could not believe the remarks made in this chamber yesterday by Senator Button about the many small business failures. I think these are the words he used: `Thousands of small businesses were in this position because their owners and managers were inexperienced and should not have gone into business'. I find that an incredible remark. It is a sign that a government has lost touch; it has its head in the sand. </PARA>
<PARA> I telephoned a couple of banks this morning. We are sitting on a volcano. These are direct remarks made by bank authorities-not people with an axe to grind but genuine remarks made by people I have known for some time. In the past a person with difficulties-whether he ran a business or owned a home-would communicate with his bank. For example, if he had to pay about $1,000 a month to the bank-I am just pulling that figure out of the hat-he would say, `I have some difficulties. Can we make a deal?' The bank would accommodate him and maybe say, `Let's make it $100 a month. How will you go with that?' and he would accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> That position has changed. They are not communicating. In fact, the banks are taking a different view. Telephone calls are not being responded to and letters are not being replied to. In some cases, this is forcing foreclosures. People are not able to cope. </PARA>
<PARA> People such as Nobby Clark are trying their best to give signals. But, as I understand it, they are reluctant to spell out the detail of the disaster because they do not wish to exacerbate an already disastrous position. In other words, they do not wish to precipitate panic. In addition, we have the entrenched restrictive work practices and an inflation rate of 8.7 per cent-double that of our trading partners-which, with the passage of time, guarantees the destruction of any competitive edge which a business might have had at the time of its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that-this is something that has not been considered-an inflation rate double that our trading partners will eventually ensure the destruction of our established markets for our minerals and primary products. No-one considers that. They think we can go on forever with an inflation rate of 8.7 per cent exporting those products to the world. Overseas buyers in the balanced markets-over long periods we do get balanced markets-will not pay any increase greater than their own inflation rate. That must always be remembered. With the inflation rate of our major trading partner running at between one per cent and 2 per cent or thereabouts-it has been that for the past decade or so-and ours at 8.7 per cent, one does not have to be a mathematical wizard to recognise the seriousness of the problem. They are saying, `We will not import your inflation'. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done to address the structural problems? First, it will not deregulate the labour market. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is hell bent on increasing its power base and the Australian Labor Party is its political arm. Second, there has been no micro-economic reform except in the deregulation of the financial markets, which happened very early in the piece. Senator Collins has bravely given the Labor Government 12 months notice of resignation in this regard. I congratulate him for that. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern about the Democrats' urgency motion is that it is geared to inflame the emotions of nationalistic Australians, of whom I am unashamedly one. We must be very careful about this. I know that it is not intentional, but it also smacks of racism. I will not go into that. Both these factors serve only to frighten foreign investment which regrettably we badly need, away from Australia. My State of Queensland, which has been the centre of great foreign investment, has a foreign registry. What happened after the books were closed? The headline came out: Queensland `1pc foreign-owned'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating an urgency motion put by Senator Jenkins. It calls for the establishment of a register of foreign ownership to register and keep track of certain classes of foreign ownership. Senator McMullan said that because we had raised this issue on a number of previous occasions, it was therefore not of urgency. We argue on the contrary: precisely because the Government and the Opposition have consistently refused to accept our arguments for the establishment of such a register, the matter becomes more and more urgent as time goes on and as this country passes more and more into the hands of foreign owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, we could parallel this with a patient with a pimple on his face who turns up to see a doctor. The patient might say, `This is not a particularly urgent matter. I will simply treat it with some hot compresses and it will go away'. The doctor recognises that it has the potential to become a very urgent problem. The patient ignores the doctor's advice and goes away. </PARA>
<PARA> Within a few days the patient has meningitis because of the infection travelling inside the skull. As the patient approaches death the problem becomes more and more urgent. The fact that some days earlier the doctor signalled that this was an urgent problem does not in any way deny its urgency; in fact, it confirms that the doctor was right in the first place. So the Australian Democrats were correct when raising this matter some years ago by way of a private member's Bill-and we are correct today. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a point to what Senator McMullan was saying. At this stage we are calling for a register. We clearly recognise that as the first necessary and essential step to knowing exactly what level of foreign ownership we have in what areas. We would then move on from that to more properly monitor and control that ownership so that it did not lead to the condition with which Senator Jenkins concluded her speech-the loss of control over our own destiny. That is what we are really on about. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed to hear both Senator McMullan and Senator Parer suggest that by raising this issue we were raising the level of xenophobia or racism. I think that Senator Jenkins was quite clear in saying that we are not concerned whether it is foreign ownership by Germans, French, Japanese or anybody else; it concerns people who are not nationals of this country and who therefore owe a primary allegiance to another country. That is the question, particularly when the level of foreign ownership is quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the levels of foreign ownership-Senator Parer has mentioned that Queensland has established a register-one sees that in the six months April to September 1989 Japanese investors poured $2.3 billion into Australia. Interestingly, that figure did not come from Australian sources because we did not know; that figure was taken from the Japanese Ministry of Finance. The Japanese Ministry of Finance keeps those figures. Senator McMullan was wrong when he said that most foreign countries do not keep such registers. The truth is that most countries do keep registers. Australia is the odd nation out. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of proposals for investment in Australia has been mentioned by Senator Jenkins but it is worth repeating because it underscores the weakness of the control which is currently exercised in this country. She pointed out that in 1988-89 there were 5,163 proposals for investments in Australia, only 77 of which were rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, when one looks at the sectors into which the investment passed, those which recorded strongest growth in total expected investment were tourism and-wait for it-real estate. Quite contrary to what Senator Parer was trying to claim-that is, that foreign investment is going into some sort of productive investment which is going to relieve our foreign indebtedness-large amounts of foreign investment at the moment are going into real estate and speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if one turns to Senator Parer's own State, one finds that Mr Parker of Burchill Bate Parker, speaking of the activity of foreign investors in Queensland, is quoted in an article in the Australian of 2 December 1989 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . many of the integrated resort entrepreneurs sought large parcels of land, obtained rezoning approvals for an integrated resort, and then sought partners or investors or simply sold the land. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what is going on extensively not only in Queensland but also in other States, particularly in Western Australia where there is massive speculation in Australian real estate of no benefit to this country whatsoever. In fact, it mitigates very much against the purchase of real estate by Australian nationals because it is simply another instrument entering the market. I point out that Australians wanting to borrow money in Australia to buy Australian real estate, say, for building a home or some quite legitimate purpose, face particularly high interest rates, as Senator Parer correctly pointed out. A Japanese person wanting to buy Australian real estate to speculate against that Australian purchaser can borrow money at low interest rates and afford to hold on to the land for a long time. That sort of investment is directly acting against the interests of Australian home purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the rural area, the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council has released a report on the purchase of properties for the raising of livestock. An article in the Australian Financial Review of December 1989 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the Council said that official statistics on foreign investment in rural property were poor, and non-existent for meat processing and feedlots. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere in the report of the Council it was strongly recommended that a register be established so that the Council would know exactly what was going on in that area. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> However, based on industry information, it said Japanese-owned abattoirs in Australia accounted for 23 per cent of beef and veal exports to Japan in the first half of 1989 and 14 per cent of cattle killed for the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Current and planned investment in beef feedlot capacity was put at 165,000 head, equal to around 66,000 tonnes of beef exports suitable for Japan, or just under half the current total of 136,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It further proposed that the board maintain a more detailed record of foreign investment in livestock production and meat processing, and that information collected from both recommendations be published annually. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in its report the Council mentions inter-nation profit shifting. This is what happens when there is vertical integration of an industry such as the beef industry and those who own the farms also own the transport systems, the abattoirs, the ships that take the produce overseas and the wholesaling and retailing facilities in foreign countries. Transfer pricing can easily mean that there will be no benefit whatsoever to the country in which the cattle are raised and the abattoirs are sited. The Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council drew attention to that. The Australian Financial Review article pointed out that the Council said that one of the effects of foreign investment was:</PARA>
<PARA> Inter-nation profit shifting, of which there already were strong suggestions, although no hard evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> On the latter, the council recommended the Australian Taxation Office explore ways of ensuring effective monitoring of price movements to limit opportunities for profit shifting. </PARA>
<PARA>How is the Australian Taxation Office even going to begin to look at this area unless there is a register of foreign ownership, unless it knows which countries it is dealing with are foreign and where the shareholding lies? A Sunday-Mail article of 3 December 1989 states:</PARA>
<PARA> PRIME Queensland land is being bought by foreigners at an increasing rate. </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment Queensland is the only State that has a register. I point out, in answer to Senator McMullan's claim that the establishment of a register would be costly, that every single land transaction in Australia is currently registered. In the case of South Australia, transactions are registered with a board which keeps that information. All that would be required to establish a register is a statement as to the nationality of the person buying the property at the time of the land transaction. This is not a particularly costly process. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The state's foreign land register shows the value of foreign-owned land in Queensland is 30 times higher than when the Sunday Mail last checked the register six months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week, the register showed $1553 million worth of land in foreign hands-with more than half the total value owned by the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> And that figure could be just the tip of the iceberg because foreigners have until April 17 next year-</PARA>
<PARA>and that, of course, is this year-</PARA>
<PARA>to declare their interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly, we have a serious and growing problem in respect of which evidently and, perhaps for slightly different reasons-but that is not particularly relevant here-both the Government and the Opposition turn their backs. They do not even want to know the extent of foreign ownership let alone do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins drew attention to some of the history of economic trading which led ultimately to total foreign ownership during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. I would like to look at what has happened in this country. Just last year we dealt with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation. We have debated extensively the prior ownership and occupation of this country by Aboriginal people, a people who had no sense of land ownership as we see it. They belonged to the land. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) attempted to insert into the ATSIC legislation a preamble which said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> And whereas the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land;</PARA>
<PARA> And whereas they were dispossessed by subsequent European occupation and have no recognised rights overland yet recognised by the Courts other than those granted or recognised by the Crown;</PARA>
<PARA> And whereas that dispossession occurred without compensation and no serious attempt was made to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with them on the use of their land;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> And whereas it is the intention of the people of Australia to make provision for rectification . . . to ensure for all time that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples receive that full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior ownership and occupation of the land, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire;</PARA>
<PARA>What hypocrisy! This Government not only displaces those people and replaces that attitude of belonging to the land with one in which land simply becomes a commodity to be traded, brought and sold, but also it proceeds to sell off that land as hard as it can lick to foreign interests. At the same time as it does this, it claims that it wants to enter into an instrument of reconciliation with those same Aboriginal people which will recognise that culture, that prior occupation and that prior ownership. What hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters were dealt with, but let me raise the matter of the Torrens Island power station in South Australia. This power station was built by the Electricity Trust of South Australia. It has been sold by the Government of South Australia to foreign interests and then leased back in a way in which the people of South Australia cannot even find out who owns the principal power station which generates their electricity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also ask the question: where is the urgency in this motion? This matter can be regarded as urgent only because Senator Jenkins wants to make it urgent before she moves out of here. She has only got this week and next week to go. It is simply so that Senator Jenkins before she departs, and the Australian Democrats, can feel good about something. They will feel they have achieved something if they speak about this matter, let alone have the motion agreed to. As has already been pointed out by other speakers, this motion is simply a tabulation of what is already known. As one honourable senator has already said, this information is available in titles offices around Australia. One probably has only to put in the right code, hit a button and one has all the information one wants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to the Foreign Investment Review Board. Incidentally, I should correct what Senator McMullan said about our policy in the last election campaign. Our policy was to do away with the Foreign Investment Review Board, but if Senator McMullan had read on a little further he would have discovered that we were going to put it in the hands of Treasury. He failed to point that out, so I take the opportunity to do so. I believe the Foreign Investment Review Board has always worked from the wrong end. If the problems the Democrats are worried about were apparent, they should have been addressed by the Foreign Investment Review Board looking at properties valued up to $2m or $3m, rather than the more expensive ones. In any event, the smaller landowners the Democrats worry about could not compete in that market. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be directing my remarks in this debate to the foreign ownership of land in the agricultural sector. I quote from the report of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council on foreign investment in rural properties, which is the same report Senator Coulter quoted from. That report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics from FIRB indicate that there were only 14 proposals by foreigners to purchase rural land valued at over $3m in 1987/88. A further 78 proposals were received for property valued at less than $3m. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is hardly an avalanche of property going to foreign ownership. Foreign investment in land in Australia is not necessarily a bad thing. No-one is forced to sell land to an overseas buyer. There is no Act of Parliament that says, `You shall sell to a foreign buyer'. Land has to be on the market in the first place and the owner has to be happy with the person to whom he sells the land, whether it is an Australian or an overseas buyer; so no-one is forced to sell. Of course, there is an advantage in having foreign buyers when there are not Australian buyers who are prepared to pay a reasonable price, or any price, for land-and that has happened. When there are buyers of that magnitude during a downturn in the economy, it has a stabilising effect on the market. If a farmer wants to sell out or is forced out, then he can go with some dignity and, more importantly, can get the finance either to start again or go into retirement or whatever he might be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Land bought by overseas interests cannot be shifted overseas; it has to stay in place. The land remains, it produces, it employs extra labour, and it pays local rates and taxes. The land generally goes through a redevelopment stage. I have yet to see a farm bought by overseas interests where there is not a complete or semi-complete development. New fences, buildings and dams create demands for employment and materials. These are all aspects that I personally have taken notice of over quite a number of years. Foreign buyers of land are not interested in all sections of farming areas, or pastoral areas for that matter. Senator Coulter referred to the Aborigines having their land taken from them. What foreign buyer would want to buy the land that Aboriginal communities have been on or are now on in semi-arid desert country? It is important who the buyers are and what sort of land is involved. Americans have generally gone for high rainfall pastoral country; Germans have generally gone for medium to high rainfall sheep country; Japanese have gone for high rainfall coastal country; and the Italians have gone for lower than medium rainfall country. What is more, their activities in land purchases have not all coincided. If the economies of other countries were strong at the same time as Australia's economy and if foreign buyers were all interested in acquiring land in Australia at the same time we may have a problem, but it generally does not work that way. We have had American interests, then Japanese interests, then German and Italian interests, and even English interests, but not all foreign interest comes at once. Of course, the purchase of land by foreign interests is not just happening in Australia; it has happened in many other places. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of farming land, another aspect to consider is that fewer Australians now want to be farmers. If we do not have willing buyers in Australia-bearing in mind that the farms cannot be shifted-what is wrong with selling to foreigners who are willing to produce? Farmers' sons and daughters are now more interested, if they have academic ability, in entering the professions. A good example of that was in the big downturn of 1971 when, for the first time in Victoria, there was a waiting list for admission to university. The reason for that was that more country children were coming through wanting to go to university. Of course, they may have gone back to the country later, but who knows? So reasons exist for land being available to be purchased by foreign owners. </PARA>
<PARA> If foreign ownership of land is deemed to be a bad thing, then the only way out is to have a healthy farm balance of trade. That is the only way we can buy back the farms. If a build-up of foreign ownership of land is occurring-and this has happened in the past-a healthier economy is needed in order to buy back the land. Esperance, in Western Australia, in the late 1950s and early 1960s was developed mostly by the Americans. All the Americans have now sold out there. The economy improved in the 1960s and the Americans were bought out and went back to the United States. The Kimberley cattle stations in the 1960s and 1970s were largely owned by American interests. If one were to go up there now one would not find any land owned by an American. </PARA>
<PARA> In the late 1970s and early 1980s there was an influx of German money into Western Australia, buying medium to high rainfall sheep country. The Germans did not work the land themselves, but leased it back to the owners who needed capital, or to neighbours. If one went back now one would see that, once again, there is no German ownership in those areas. Once again, the farms have been bought back. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, now the Japanese are in the high rainfall station country, because that is the flavour of the month, or the year. As has been pointed out, they have come here and taken on cattle stations and bought out feedlots, and they are exporting beef back to Japan. But if we are here in another five years time debating this question we will find that they have all gone home. Hopefully, when the economy revives-when we are in government-the farm will be bought back. Then, so many years down the track there will be a phase when others-maybe the Indonesians-invest in farming in Australia. We will go through the same thing where the Democrats-if there are any left in the Senate-will be bringing up the same matters to make themselves feel good. These phases have been part of Australian life probably since 1788, and they will continue for the rest of our days. As I say, the trend can be reversed with better balance of trade figures for Australia. Then we can buy the farm back. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's economic policy has brought the country-and rural industry-to its knees. The agenda has been high interest rates, high inflation and wage rises without an equivalent rise in productivity. The failure to address deregulation of the closed shop industries has prevented our primary industries from competing with overseas competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been the deregulation of the wheat industry during the last 12 months, which we accepted in return for a promised deregulation of the waterfront to get costs down, and deregulation of coastal shipping and the labour market. I do not know whether the Government promised to deregulate the labour market. If all these things are not done to bring us back into a competitive position with overseas competitors, we will never be in a position to prevent the overseas ownership of Australian land. That is the only way we can do it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the example of what happens on the waterfront. It takes a container ship roughly 16 hours to turn around in Japan, and in Sydney it takes eight days, at least. The other example is getting fertiliser from the east coast to Western Aus tralia. It costs $50 a tonne, and it also costs $50 a tonne to bring it from Florida. They are examples of what is wrong with the Australian agricultural industry and why it cannot compete with overseas land buyers at the present moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time I have left I will quote a few figures that have just been released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> The index of prices received by Australian farmers fell by 1.8 per cent in the March quarter 1990 . . . This decrease, which followed a fall of 2.9 per cent in the previous quarter, resulted mainly from a fall in the prices received for vegetable and fruit crops . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Crops to register price decreases were potatoes (46.7%) vegetables (20.1%) citrus fruit (7.3%). </PARA>
<PARA> Sheep prices have declined for three successive quarters, falling 9.5 per cent in the March quarter 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the more important part of the document, which I should quote before my time runs out:</PARA>
<PARA> The index of prices paid by farmers increased by 1.0 per cent in the March quarter 1990 following an increase of 0.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Prices paid items to show the largest quarterly increases were fuel (3.6 per cent) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those are examples which show why foreign would-be owners of land in Australia are able to compete because the Government has not properly controlled the economy in this country. While I have time, I seek leave, subject to what the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Mr Tate) may say, to have a table and a graph incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in this debate my colleague Senator McMullan raised a very pertinent point-I think he hit the nail on the head-about this urgency motion and the fact that the Australian Democrats have to get the score up a bit by having a vote called where they can show that the Government and the Opposition voted against them. They need that for statistical purposes come the next election-even though it is still some three years away-to prove that from time to time they are, supposedly, the only honest people in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I really think what they have put up here today is a charade. Senator McMullan was quite correct-this issue of foreign investment has been the subject of debate in Australia ever since I have been involved in politics at various levels. It does not have to be the subject of an urgency motion today, as though whatever motion the Senate carries today will have a profound effect on foreign investment in Australia. We are only going through the charade of this debate because the Democrats need to add a couple of goals to their scoreboard for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I want to say that after hearing the two Democrats speakers I was waiting to get an explanation of what would be their next course of action if the motion were passed and in the near future a register were set up to establish a list of all the foreign owned land in Australia; all the property, businesses and resources. Both Democrats speakers today gave no indication of where this would lead us, and what would be their proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I think they ought to be a little bit more fair dinkum. If they do have a concern about the present level of foreign ownership in Australia, it is not just a matter of drawing up a register, compiling it and, therefore, getting the statistics-it is what is going to be done with that information. Neither speaker gave any indication of what the Democrats would want to do. One can only surmise that they would propose, in a very general way, that there should be new restrictions placed on foreign investment because Australia's sovereignty was being affected and these evil foreigners were taking over the running of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the best they can come up with-and I can only assume that because they did not give any explanation-it is a pretty appalling effort. They have said that this is so important that we have to have an urgency motion and a vote, without giving any indication of where it would lead. It is typical of the Democrats. I believe it is one reason why Janine Haines did not win the seat of Kingston. In the last 10 days of the campaign we were finally able to hammer home in South Australia just what the strange mix of Democrat policies was, and what would be its effect on the ordinary electors of Kingston. For the first time we actually get exposure to what the Democrats were offering, in a higgledly-piggledy way, and the electorate started to wake up in Kingston. I suspect that had the coverage been given to the Democrats around Australia, their vote would have been a lot less. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of statistics and figures. I admit to Senator Coulter and Senator Jenkins that I do not claim to be an expert on the issue of foreign investment, but I have perused the last annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board. There is ample information in it for anybody-whatever his other perspective-to make judgments, in a considered way, about the debate we should have on foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have been trying to paint the picture here today that we do not know what is going on. They tell us that they want to know the names of particular people who own particular pieces of property. A few years ago in this place when we had the debate about the Australia Card, the Democrats were jumping up and down about infringement of privacy and people's personal affairs. Yet they say that we have to go one step further in this area and list every foreigner individually so that we can chase them down, so that we know who they are-that that information should be available. We all know what that will lead to. It will lead to certain minority groups in our community-unfortunately, only small minority groups-using that as a basis to whip up a xenophobic attitude towards foreigners in this country. I think that would be an appalling outcome. The Democrats' inconsistency is exposed when they argue about the so-called evils of the Australia Card in invading people's privacy. Yet in this area they want to invade people's privacy, name people, have them listed all around Australia in all these areas-not just property and land, but business and resources. The information is overwhelmingly in the FIRB report. If the Democrats think there are still pieces of information missing, let us raise it with the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Bureau of Statistics and get them to put in the information. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the figures in the annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board. They show that in 1988-89 foreign investment in Australia was $26.1 billion. They also show-which honourable senators opposite have not mentioned once-that in the same year Australian investment abroad was $10.5 billion. I want to know whether the Australian Democrats oppose Australian investment abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of years, as a member of parliamentary delegations, I have had the opportunity to visit the countries of South East Asia and the South Pacific. The one thing that comes through all the time is that they want foreign investment from Australia. They want their standard of living and their economies to improve by getting investment from Australia in various industries-in the tourist industry, in appropriate agricultural development and so on. They do not make any beg pardons about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats say at one level, `We do not want foreign investment in Australia because we think it is evil. We think it will lead to the diminution of our sovereignty'. Yet they are quite willing to give a complete miss to the view that Australia is a significant investor in its own region to the advantage of countries in the region which want it. We have to get an answer from the Australian Democrats about that. </PARA>
<PARA> That report mentions that in 1988-89 Australian banks borrowed $8 billion from overseas. That includes Australian-owned banks. I want to know whether the Australian Democrats favour cutting off that $8 billion of borrowings, that foreign money coming into Australia. Let us not beat around the bush. Where did most of that $8 billion that the banks borrowed go? It went to provide consumer credit to ordinary Australians to enable them to buy houses and so on. We would never get a comment out of the Australian Democrats hitting the nail on the head about what they want to do about banks restricting that sort of borrowing because that would affect ordinary Australians. We do not get any of the hard decisions taken by the Democrats in this debate, we just get the waffle and the soft-headed attitude that it is something to do with evil foreigners investing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report lists in a table the total level of foreign investment in Australia in 1987-88-$191 billion. The United States of America is the second largest investor in Australia, with $39 billion. It slipped from being the first in the previous year. The United Kingdom, with $44 billion, is now the largest investor. Japan is the third largest, with $26 billion. Over the last four or five years, Japanese investment, though significant, has increased by roughly the same proportion as investment from the United Kingdom or the United States of America. Many smaller countries have invested in Australia, at much smaller amounts, but probably have shown bigger increases in percentage terms. The underlying current in some of this criticism of foreign investment is directed particularly against the Japanese. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is not what the honourable senator said, but let us not beat around the bush. When we get down to the bottom line of some of this debate around Australia, unfortunately small minority groups argue the foreign investment issue on the basis that it is Japanese investment-not that it is American or British. Yet the Japanese are by no means the biggest investors. In real terms Japan has only about 13 per cent of our country's total investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to point out an interesting figure in this document. In 1988-89 it was indicated that there would be $32 billion of foreign investment in Australia, although not all spent in one year, 1988-89; it was indicated that some of it would be spent over a period longer than one year. What is interesting is that, if that figure had not been invested in Australia, the current account deficit for the year, which was $18 billion, would probably have been over $40 billion. What would the economic ramifications for Australia be if we had a current account deficit of $40 billion-plus? The dollar would at at about 15c, interest rates would be at 50 per cent and the unemployment rate would be about 15 to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite are going to attack foreign investment, let us look at the up side of it. The up side of Australia's present economic situation is that foreign investment means that our current account deficit is a lot better than it would be without it. We have heard nothing from the Democrats, who want to reduce foreign investment, about how they would handle that problem or about what would happen to us if there were a big increase in the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes that I have left I want to deal with the issue of whether Australia should have a closed economy or an international economy. Fifteen months ago I visited a country that for 30 years had been the ultimate example of a closed economy. I do not accuse the Democrats of having the same view as General Nie Win in Burma. He had the most xenophobic attitude. That was the reason he survived for 30 years. He played upon the xenophobic attitude of the Burmese people about their being surrounded by enemies, cutting themselves off with the view that they did not need anybody else. In 30 years Burma went from being one of the best economies in South East Asia to being the worst, the biggest basket case of all, because they cut themselves off in every way. If we went to cut ourselves off, we would end up with the same result. The only way this country will improve its economy is to internationalise it, to be involved in trade with other countries. We cannot trade with other countries if we take the attitude that foreign investment either in Australia or out of Australia is inherently evil. If all countries took that attitude we would go back to the sixteenth century and the policies of mercantilism, with all its attributes, such as conflict. It just does not work. There has to be give and take in international trade, in international finance and in international economies. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State of South Australia 10 to 12 years ago Chrysler had a car manufacturing plant which by all accounts was a basket case. My colleague Senator Foreman was secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union at the time. One only needs to speak to him, the workers and the employees at Chrysler to find out about the problems that that company had and the fact that it really had no future. A Japanese company, Mitsubishi, bought it, bought out the American partner, and then started what in many cases has been a revolution in industrial relations, investment, new procedures and new management practices in the plant. </PARA>
<PARA> So what do we have today? We have a factory whose productivity is up and which is actually exporting cars back to Japan. Anybody who 10 years ago had said that a car factory in Adelaide would export cars to Japan would have been locked up in Parkside. But it is now happening because the Japanese put in the effort with their technology, with their management practices and with better industrial relations and the work force responded with improved productivity. That is a result of foreign investment, not just of money but of ideas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The debate from the Government and the Opposition has been interesting in parts, but I put it to the Senate that no speaker from the Government or the Opposition has given a valid argument against the setting up of a national register for foreign ownership. I wish to address some of the points made by some of the speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McMullan queried the fact that the Australian Democrats have brought this issue up again today when we brought it up six years earlier. He did not add that in the six years since this matter was first raised by the Democrats in the Senate the overseas debt in this country has increased enormously. Indeed, Senator Parer mentioned that when he spoke. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also had from honourable senators from both sides of the chamber some spurious arguments which did not address the issue at all but, I suspect, rather gave everyone here an insight into motivations that there might be when matters for debate are brought up by members on their side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We have stated all along that a register would be a starting point. What is the harm in knowing where we stand? When we try to elicit facts with regard to foreign ownership it is very hard to find them. As Senator Coulter said, each land transaction is registered and therefore it is a simple further step merely to have on the land transaction whether the buyer is an Australian permanent resident or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer referred to our import-export deficits, the level of our overseas debt, the need for more manufacturing in Australia, the need for more downstream value adding and the need for more import replacement goods. Nobody can argue with any of those facts as stated by Senator Parer or, indeed, with those points he made. But they are nothing at all to do with Australia having a register of foreign ownership. In fact, there were no arguments against that register. Senator Parer also referred to the banking industry and slated the banking industry as it stands at present. If the banking industry is a test case of advantages which are supposed to accrue to the Australian people from deregulation and foreign investment, then all the signs are that those advantages are illusory. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht used a couple of arguments that it was very hard to connect with the motion presently before us. He correctly said that it was material brought forward by the Australian Labor Party which frightened people from voting for Senator Haines so that the Democrats could have gained their first seat in the House of Representatives. He neglected to mention that it was not only the Labor Party but also the Liberal Party which brought material forward deliberately to frighten people, material which was extremely misleading. The costings put out by Senator Walsh on Democrat policies were put out in such a way as to presume that all those policies would be implemented within one year. That is absolute nonsense. No policies brought forward at election time are there to be implemented immediately in 12 months. Those costings also did not take into account Democrat policies which would save a great deal of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht also mentioned the Australia Card. The Democrats were against the Australia Card legislation as brought forward in this Parliament. That was a registration of Australian citizens which was not a mere registration but which would have allowed details of Australian citizens to be given to other departments besides the Department of Health, which was responsible for the Australia Card legislation. Senator Schacht said that, if we were against the Australia Card, we should also be against registration of foreign investors. I would say that that is very different. If there is no difference, why do we have an immigration department which screens overseas people before they can come into this country, whether on a permanent or temporary basis? That is a very different matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht also raised the question of Australian investment going abroad. He suggested that, in taking the line that we have in advocating a register for foreign ownership in Australia, we are suggesting that Australian investment abroad should be limited. I suggest to Senator Schacht that, when making such statements on a broad basis, he should look at some of the countries which are soliciting Australian investment, countries such as Burma and Indonesia. He would find that it is the elite segments in those countries that are advocating Australian investment. If he asked some of the ordinary people he might find a different story. In fact, the immediate past President of the Philippines, Marcos, was particularly keen on overseas investment in his country-investment by the United States of America and Australia. Yet in these very times the people of the Philippines are resisting overseas investment which would bring them nuclear power in the form of a nuclear power station which they do not want. </PARA>
<PARA> At present no-one knows the extent of foreign ownership in Australia. Where there is no knowledge there can be rumour and speculation. We have heard honourable senators here mention xenophobia and hysteria. I put it to the Senate that rumour and speculation, where the degree of foreign ownership is not known, can lead to very genuine hysteria. </PARA>
<PARA> A register would provide us with the facts. It would allay any possibility of hysteria and it would make it possible to assess what foreign investment is in our interests and what foreign investment is opposed to our national interest. It is not a case of whether we should have foreign ownership or not. It is a case of how much we have and, in looking at that, how much the people of Australia want and in what areas they want it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the annual report of the Special Investigations Unit for 1989, that is, up to 30 June 1989. It is nearly the end of May 1990 before it has been tabled in this Parliament. That is not altogether the fault of the Director of the Unit, Mr Greenwood, who submitted it to the then Attorney-General, Mr Bowen, in November of 1989, although the actual date in November 1989 is not shown. There seems to have been an extraordinary delay in this report being presented to the Parliament. However, fortunately, some assiduous members of the Opposition who were at the Estimates Committee hearings last Tuesday were able to get information which has helped to repair that omission, and material has been made available in answers to questions which can be seen in the Hansard for Estimates Committee E. </PARA>
<PARA> What has transpired, of course, is the continuing increase in the width of the investigation of this Unit. In his report before us Mr Greenwood has given the figures as they were at 30 June 1989, namely, that 603 files had been opened by this Unit, and there were still 292 under investigation in some form or another, although those were being winnowed down to probably fewer than 50 cases that were likely to lead to prosecutions. However, it has now transpired that, despite that process and despite the fact that it looked as though this Unit was coming to a close, it was revealed to the Estimates Committee only last week that in fact 64 further files have been opened since 30 June 1989 and that, indeed, it expects to receive a further list of 55 persons from the Wiesenthal Centre. So another 119 files have been referred to this Unit despite the extensive investigation that it has been conducting for three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the Unit has now been revealed in this report. In the 2 3/4 years that it has been in operation to the period of this report it was $3.7m. It is estimated that the current year's operations will cost another $4m. </PARA>
<PARA> The most spectacular proceedings of the Unit's activities involve a prosecution which is going to run into constitutional problems. It is the subject of a High Court challenge which will be heard shortly. Perhaps of even more concern is the fact that there is a large committal proceeding to be heard and, as I understand it, evidence for this will be taken largely in the Soviet Union. Enormous expense will be incurred in the taking of all those depositions from witnesses in the Soviet Union. That is a point which I particularly express concern about because in our extensive debates in both chambers over the War Crimes Act the Attorney-General of the day, Mr Lionel Bowen, made it very clear that witnesses against any person accused of war crimes under this Act would be brought to Australia and available for the trials which would be taking place in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the fact that depositions are being taken in the Soviet Union, which depositions will be required for the committal proceedings, does not mean that ultimately this evidence-if it gets to trial-will be taken in written form and that the witnesses will not be brought to Australia. That would be a matter of very grave concern to many of us in both Houses of Parliament, particularly the Senate, which was assured that witnesses would be brought to Australia to answer before a trial in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak on the subject of the Special Investigations Unit's annual report. I think it is well known that I strongly opposed the War Crimes Act which this Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is the hatchet arm for-I suppose that is a way to describe them. I objected to the Act because, in my view, it was deeply divisive. It was in clear contrast to a resolution of the House of Representatives in 1961 which said, with all parties agreeing-there was only one dissenting voice-that the time had come to forget about the crimes of World War II and if migrants came to Australia and lived within our laws they need fear nothing in our courts about the events of the Second World War. This whole Act and the activities of the SIU are in clear defiance of that understanding reached by this Parliament nearly 30 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will summarise briefly my objections to the Act because, of course, the SIU is implementing the Act. It is retrospective in the criminal sphere, which I think is very objectionable. A fair trial, as Senator Durack touched on, is almost impossible nearly 50 years after the event with witnesses being heard in places like the Soviet Union. There are enormous difficulties at this stage about the credibility of the witnesses. The legislation itself was very badly drafted. It confuses war crimes with crimes against humanity, which are quite different things; it is probably unconstitutional, because the international law on which it purports to rest did not exist at the time the offences were committed; and it is highly selective. It deals with only one small area of war crimes and crimes against humanity, those committed in Europe during the period from 1939 to 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> There have probably been 100 million crimes against humanity committed in the lifetime of living Australians. Why are we concentrating on such a small number? I am afraid I have always thought that the motive was entirely political, not legal, although I accept the very great distress caused to relatives of people who have been subject to or killed because of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Nevertheless we have the absurd situation where we are investigating, at enormous expense, crimes committed perhaps 50 years ago. Today if people committed a crime against humanity as defined by the Act in Cambodia, or in occupied Palestine for that matter, and subsequently emigrated to Australia the Special Investigations Unit would be unable to look at them. The Unit would be unable to do anything about them and they could not be charged with anything because the Act does not cover war crimes or crimes against humanity in general; it covers only particular ones in a particular area. That seems to me to be an outrage. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Durack said, the SIU spent $3.7m up to June 1989. It is now operating at a cost of about $4m a year and so far one person has been brought to trial. It is estimated that that trial and subsequent trials will cost $5 3/4m each. We have to think about why we are doing this. What social objectives are being achieved for Australia by this highly selective business of looking at events in another country 50 years ago?</PARA>
<PARA> I think this Unit will go on forever until all the conceivable people are dead because it still has 212 current files and is adding to them. Any time it is proposed to close the Unit down, the Unit will say, `Ah, we have a number of investigations very near completion, we must continue'. As it says in the SIU report, it is renewable each year in the Budget context. It will go on forever providing an enormous bonanza for the legal profession but no benefit, just deep division, for the Australian people. I hope the Government will close this Unit down as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the first week of this session of the new Senate I spoke for the Opposition when Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), put down a statement that outlined a three-phase approach to his modifying the regulations under the Migration Act. The whole thrust of that ministerial statement, as I outlined then, was to respond to the serious failings of the draft regulations that had been promulgated by the Government on 19 December. To the extent that it was possible for the Minister to make specific changes to the regulations, as announced in that statement, it would be acknowledged by everybody that they are his Government's response to the two reports of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted when I spoke for the Opposition, in responding to the Minister's statement, that whilst I could hold the two reports in my hand they had not been published and I could not refer to them. However, they have now been published. They are freely available and their full worth can be recognised by not only this chamber but all those in Australia who have a careful interest in immigration and ethnic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I should acknowledge that, with the cooperation of the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Joint Committee on a confidential basis brought our deliberations to the knowledge of some significant community groups with an interest directly in the Migration Act and the draft regulations. So whilst I commend the work of the Joint Committee whose reports we have now tabled, I wish to commend very truly those associations and individuals that made private submissions to us on a confidential basis because that was the limit of the consultation that was allowed to us in the agreement with the then Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The most urgent aspect of the first report-to some extent this is a major item in the second-is the plea that the whole apparatus of law and regulations that was in draft to be promulgated on 19 December last was chiefly inadequate because it removed, for the first time, the kind of flexibility needed for a Minister to make sensible decisions in migration matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister, Senator Robert Ray, had been rather too preoccupied with stopping any possibility of corruption through even members of parliament, ethnic leaders or particular families that happened to have access to the Minister to put a case in private chambers for a matter to be approved. I welcome the intention of Senator Ray to stop such privileged access to a favourable government decision. As we know, there are about one million applications for immigration to this country every year and some 140,000, about 10 per cent, are successful. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past a great deal of emotional and other commitment was put to those marginal cases that might have been successful had an extra argument been put, had an extra basis been given for the Minister to approve the application. It is unfair if, say, only 10,000 out of that one million cases can be considered by the Minister. However, in remedying that kind of corruption of the system, the Minister was too determined and he removed from his own powers any ability to be compassionate. When I say any ability, I acknowledge that in an earlier stage in debating the Act we certainly provided for a review tribunal and any unsuccessful applicant could appeal to the tribunal for consideration, but the tribunal is bound by law exactly. If a case falls-despite the sense, justice or fairness of its being approved as one equivalent to others that are approved-the tribunal is powerless to find in favour of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the negotiations that the Opposition had with the Minister in the middle of last year, there is still a provision in the Act for the Minister to consider an unsuccessful applicant even after the tribunal stage and to approve it if it is in the national interest and if a persuasive case is presented, even if it is not strictly according to the guidelines that were binding the consideration of the application up to that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden of our first report was to say that this was still woefully inadequate. There needed to be an ability for the Minister to act in a much faster way, and so on. I note that the burden of the two reports has now been acted upon to a large extent in the ministerial statement that was put down a fortnight ago. I do not have the time, given the few minutes left to me here, to report upon a wide range of regulations, but now they are so publicly available they can be referred to by everybody and the good work of the Joint Committee can be seen for itself. I am delighted to see that there is going to be a continuing Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations and I wish that Committee very well. </PARA>
<PARA> In the two minutes that remain to me, I wish to touch upon a matter related to the whole burden of migration regulations. The Secretary to the Department, during the course of formulating the regulations-indeed, in setting up the procedures under the Act-determined in large degree the resources of the Department to achieve this quite radical reformulation of our immigration laws in this country. I refer to Mr Ron Brown. I refer to him here even though we will come to this matter in consideration of the Estimates Committee report tomorrow because I want to make it very clear that we still have not had in this chamber an explanation as to why the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) intervened and Mr Brown is no longer the head of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. We know that Mr Brown made a statement that he had chosen to retire from the Public Service and that he would be working as a private consultant, and we respect that decision. Mr Harris, the former Deputy Secretary, has also left the Department and is now working for the Industry Commission. We know factually that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we have asked the question in this chamber of Senator Button and in the Estimates Committee hearing-we even received a written piece of paper following the Estimates Committee questions I put-we have not yet received actual answers to the question that the Opposition is putting about Mr Brown and Mr Harris. I want to alert the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is not responsible because these decisions were made before he was given the portfolio, that we intend tomorrow during consideration of the Estimates Committee report on the estimates of the Department of Immigration to have full and clear explanations of and exact answers to the questions that have been put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us today two reports from the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. The first report was presented to the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on 28 November 1989 and the second report was presented to the Minister on 12 December 1989. That is, these reports were presented to the Minister just some weeks before the final migration amendment legislation came before the Senate last year and also before the migration regulations were tabled on 19 December last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has responded to these reports in three ways. Firstly, we saw the resignations which were referred to previously by you, Mr Acting Deputy President; that is, the resignations of two top level public servants from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Secondly, we had the Minister's statement concerning a projected review of migration regulations in which he stated that there would be considerable changes. Thirdly, in March this year there was a new edition of the Procedures Advice Manual, known as PAM. The changes to that manual cost some $102,000. We have seen, in the first few months of this year leading up to the election, a series of hasty changes brought in by the Government as a result of its bringing forward the legislation too quickly last year without proper research and information and also as a result of its producing a great number of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Those regulations are under severe criticism in both of the reports now before us. I commend the Government for acting upon the recommendations contained in the reports and changing the regulations to a considerable degree. However, the Government could quite easily have avoided that situation. It is tragic that this whole situation has degenerated into a charade. I use the word `tragic' because the whole immigration area affects people's lives so closely. People do not choose to migrate to another country just for fun or just on a sudden idea. It is often a matter which is debated in the family for some time. It is a matter which takes some organisation. If migrants who are looking to come to Australia are living in a country which has some form of internal problem, or where the family itself is in danger of being imprisoned by the authorities, they, of course, have other reasons for coming here. Nonetheless, the Government, when it chose to try to codify every single sort of circumstance that a migrant could come into or to categorise every single person who could seek to come to Australia, found that it simply could not do that. That is where this whole business went very wrong indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer briefly to the mandatory deportation orders. I asked at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing how many mandatory deportation orders had been issued by the Government since 19 December because this was a matter that had concerned me a great deal and also concerned some of the organisations which wrote into the Committee. In fact, the answer to that question was that there had not been one mandatory deportation order issued since 19 December. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department issued me with a list of the non-mandatory deportation orders which had been issued and the countries to which those people were deported, and I thank the Department for that. But I ask again: Why has the Government put in place a mandatory deportation order and a non-mandatory deportation order when, according to the list furnished to me, if a person is to be deported this is very easily done. The problems with the mandatory deportation orders are that, once they are signed and set in train, then, according to legislation, they cannot be stopped in any way, even if it is found that other information which was not previously available has become available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to that is to say, `Well, the person could simply be deported to Norfolk Island'. That person could then, presumably, be brought back into Australia, in which case it means that the mandatory deportation orders are themselves a farce and simply should not be there. So I take the opportunity again to make the plea to the Government to remove the mandatory deportation orders from the legislation because the government has already the power to deport people. </PARA>
<PARA> We learned that the harshness of the regulations is to be relieved in some way. And, indeed, I am sure that those of us here concerned with those migration regulations will look forward to seeing that promise of the Government brought into being. When, in December 1988, the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs announced that there would be a change in the migration laws and that they would be codified and made fairer, everybody in this chamber and, I am sure, everybody in the community at large was very pleased to hear it. But we had a very different sort of procedure before us. It seems now that the Government is willing to change its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that these reports have now been tabled and made public. I advocate that honourable senators read the criticisms contained in these reports. The Committee was very fortunate to have expert advice. It had the advice not only of various groups and organisations in the community to which it was able to send the draft regulations for comment, but also of an excellent consultant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like Senator Jenkins and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, had the pleasure, sometimes, of serving on this very important Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. It was a pleasure to serve on it at times but I must indicate that we were operating, particularly in the latter stages, to a very tight schedule and time frame, and that in itself caused difficulties for those members of this Committee who served in this place rather than in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on three separate occasions I, on behalf of the Committee, sought leave for the Committee to meet while the Senate was in session in order to finalise the report and meet the deadlines. We were granted leave to do so on only one occasion and we were grateful for that. With that in mind, and with the formation of the Joint Committee on Migration Regulations, I made the point very strongly that that Committee should seek to meet only when both Houses are not sitting. It was rather unfair, particularly at the latter part of last year when we were moving into our fifth week on end of sitting, for us to be expected to carry on the requirements of the job to serve in this place and also meet the tight time frames that were imposed on this Committee. I have alerted the current Committee to that problem which beset us senators last year and I have indicated that some guidelines need to be established in regard to this. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to pay tribute to the consultant that served the Select Committee, Dr Kathryn Cronin, and also to the Committee Secretary, Robina Mills, and her excellent staff who served us exceptionally well. It was an enormously complex task to look at close to 200 separate regulations and take submissions from a vast array of community organisations who were obviously very deeply interested in the matter that was before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins, in her opening comments, described the speech by the Minister, Mr Hand, two weeks ago as a tragedy and a charade. I think that is a very unfortunate choice of words on such an important topic to Australia and to those people who have hopes of migrating to this country. It was far from a charade and certainly nowhere near a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that migrants continue to come to Australia, and there are many more people wishing to come to Australia than we can take. Indeed, honourable senators will be aware of the current debate that is being whipped up in sections of the community at the moment for us to cut back on the numbers-on the 140,000 we are currently taking in. It is certainly a tragedy for those people who miss out. Each and every case that I deal with as a member of parliament on behalf of people who do not have any real hope of coming into Australia is indeed a personal tragedy for them and their families. It is a great difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> We could satisfy each and every one of them if we had no limit to the number of people that could be allowed to come to Australia, but I do not think we can move to that scenario. Despite the best will in the world by each of us in turn on a non-party political basis, we just cannot do that. There have to be some limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> In codifying the regulations, the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and his officers in the Department were in the long term doing a favour for those advocates who represent people seeking to migrate to Australia. They were setting some ground rules, some parameters in which people could move. Each honourable senator would be aware that an enormous amount of energy can be put into each individual case that is taken up on behalf of one's constituents. In some cases, despite the amount of energy that is put in, one knows from the beginning that it is very unlikely there will be a positive result. Now we will be able to sit down, look at the rules and regulations, advise the constituents that they should not in some cases waste their time and energy and perhaps a substantial amount of money in pursuing the case because there is very little hope of success. In the long term that will be beneficial to each of us; it will be beneficial to those relatives of people wishing to migrate to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject Senator Jenkins's comments that the Minister's statement a couple of weeks ago was a charade or, indeed, a tragedy. I also reject the conspiracy theories that have been raised on a couple of occasions today in the chamber about the resignation of Mr Brown, the Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Mr Brown has put down his own statement as to why he decided to leave the job. I do not know what strains Mr Brown was under, but as human beings and as individuals we should accept what this individual says and not attempt to point score and put words into his mouth as to why he left that occupation. If he chooses to do otherwise, and comes out and makes accusations or tells a different story from the one that is being told at the moment, let him do it. But until he does, we should respect his rights in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final comment on the question of deportation. Indeed, probably like many other senators in this place, I too have handled some deportation matters. Deportations, too, are whipped up by the media. We see very heart-rending scenes of individuals being forced out of Australia, scenes that gather a lot of public sympathy when they come forward. When people approach me about going public on a grievance they may have, one of the strongest pieces of advice I give them is not to go to the media, because if they do it virtually will ensure that they will not be successful in their case. No Minister of any political colour will allow the media to determine government policy, nor should he. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make this comment in closing about the question of deportations: certainly it is heart-rending when one sees people forcibly removed from Australia. It should be remembered, when we are watching scenes such as that that those people are here illegally, are not entitled to be here, and in many instances are taking up a place that could go to one of those many thousands of genuine cases that want to come in. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Mr Acting Deputy President, in your comments a short while ago said that perhaps only 10 per cent of applicants are successful. I think the 90 per cent of people that miss out, who are abiding by all the rules and conditions and regulations, are more entitled to sympathy than the few people who try to breach the rules and short-circuit the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Discussion of this report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is very timely as we are having an appropriations debate where in many instances we have found that annual reports, particularly from governmental authorities, have been very late indeed. In fact, we had an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) report presented the day before yesterday the lateness of which seemed incredible. It was not as a result of any delay by the Auditor-General or any disputes on accounts, because the Auditor-General's report was signed in August of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McKiernan says, it was just trying to keep it a secret. After all, it was ASIO. I do not want to flog a dead horse, but there is a real need for further improvement in reporting, particularly of non-statutory bodies and statutory bodies which do not have the same reporting requirements that the departments have. This report by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration indicates that departmental annual reports have been presented to the Senate in a far more timely way in the latest year than ever before. This massive improvement is, I believe, in large part due to the enthusiasm and energy of this Committee of the Senate, of which I might say I am not a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statutory authorities, unlike the departments, are not legally bound by comprehensive and up-to-date reporting rules. The reporting rules for the departments of state require departmental heads to provide their Ministers by 31 December each year with a report on the operations of their departments during the year ended on the preceding 30 June. The same legislation requires that each annual report be tabled in both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days of the report being received by a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> A table in this report shows the nature of the significant improvement in the timeliness of departmental reports being presented to this chamber. In 1987-88 the number of departments of state that had reported by the end of November totalled only 10 out of 18. In the latest year that number of departments which had reported by the end of November increased to 17 out of 18. I commend the departments for their improvement and also for the fact that in most instances draft reports were made available to Senate Estimates committees so that those committees would be aware of matters of great significance raised in those annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> To that extent I suppose it is unfortunate, as we are discussing these supplementary Estimates Committee hearings in the chamber this week, that some reports-for example, the Auditor-General's reports which are of great relevance to the matters we have been looking at-came in just after these matters were discussed. I urge the Auditor-General to ensure that his reports which bear relevance to the actions of the Senate's Estimates committees should be made available, if possible, before those meetings. After all, the Auditor-General should be able to be aware in advance of the dates of the Estimates committee hearings. It is a shame that the high level of work done by the Auditor-General is not being fully utilised at an appropriate time because of these slight delays in getting the reports before honourable senators. I make the point that while the departments have improved so strongly, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory authorities, in contrast, report in accordance with guidelines that have not been updated since 1982 and that fall far short of the reporting requirements faced by government departments and major organisations in the private sector. The Committee recommended urgent review of the statutory authority guidelines in its 1989 report. Although there has been no substantive government response to the Committee's recommendations, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has begun an inquiry into the statutory authority reporting guidelines which is likely to resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The simple fact is that as this Government pushes more and more organisations into becoming statutory authorities, rather than authorities that report direct to Senate Estimates committees, there is a real risk of a diminished reporting responsibility of this chamber and an additional need for timeliness in reports by statutory authorities. I do not see why, if the body becomes a statutory authority rather than just a section of a department, it should not be under the same obligation to report speedily and thoroughly as departments are. I think the Government should be encouraged to proceed speedily to fix up a significantly growing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention that there has been an increase in the number of departments that have included audited accounts in their annual report. As I recall, only two last year failed to have an audited report in their annual report. I believe it is absolutely vital. Apart from anything else, it is important to see which departmental reports are qualified by the Auditor-General for failing to meet statutory requirements, or for any other matter. To that extent I am looking forward to the debate, perhaps later today, on some Auditor-General's reports which I hope will be presented to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, some of the non-statutory bodies under the control of some departments are not being appropriately referred to in departmental reports. That matter is raised in this report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the considerable attention devoted to the subject-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the matter of statutory and non-statutory bodies-</PARA>
<PARA>by this Committee and its predecessor, the presentation of information on non-statutory bodies (NSBs) in departmental reports remains far from satisfactory in many instances. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As there is no comprehensive listing of NSBs, it is not possible to verify that the coverage in the departmental annual reports is complete and accurate. Nevertheless, many defects were apparent. </PARA>
<PARA>Among the defects, for example, the report refers to the Treasury's annual report and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction to the Treasury's report states that the Foreign Investment Review Board is the only non-statutory body within the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact there are eight other non-statutory bodies known to exist within the Treasury portfolio and no reference whatsoever was made to them. I agree with the report, which concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>The coverage of the information on NSBs provided in the various departmental reports was variable and generally incomplete. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Government should act on this area with speed. I support the Committee's report and endorse the fact that the Committee welcomes a significant improvement in the general quality of the majority of departmental annual reports. I only wish we could say the same about statutory bodies and non-statutory bodies. I also wish that we had greater access and greater capacity to deal with many of the limited liability corporations now being created by this Government which occupy an uncomfortable halfway house. We should have the capacity to examine them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this unanimous report put down by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration entitled The Development of the Senior Executive Service: Performance Based Pay. From the outset I believe this exercise of trying to subvert the centralised wage fixing system is fraught with danger and is something that we should all be very well aware of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rationale behind performance based pay, theoretically, is linking the pay system to performance so as to provide an incentive for improved performance. As was put to us by many witnesses, in actual practice this does not seem to work. I refer to evidence given by one or two of those people, in particular Professor Robert Wood of the Graduate School of Management at the University of Western Australia who argued, firstly, that there were measurement problems associated with performance. He also said there were problems with the perceptions of equity. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Wood also raised the question of privacy. In other words, when these particular performance payments are made, he queried whether they should remain private or whether they should become public. As a cynic I tend to believe that, even if that information were private, it certainly would not remain private for very long. That would have the effect of creating a certain amount of disenchantment with other members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) who did not receive performance pay. Another witness who is well known to quite a few honourable senators, John Nethercote, in his usual succinct manner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> [Performance based pay] misinterprets the motivations of our officials . . . They want reasonable remuneration but one reason we can have confidence in our senior officialdom is that monetary incentive is not uppermost in their minds . . . Most significantly, [Performance based pay] will be corrosive of a fundamental quality in public departments. To run successfully, they call for a high degree of collegiality and cooperation at senior levels. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting also to note some evidence given in a lecture by David Laughrin, a senior officer of the British Civil Service, who reported that the introduction of performance based pay in Great Britain encountered quite a number of problems. He said that it was-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . much more difficult to deal with resistance and scepticism about the schemes than many of those responsible . . . expected. This was because they challenged the cultural values of the civil service. These values included an attachment to fairness, equity of treatment, openness on remuneration, and work relationships based on teamwork and group results . . . The result was that some of the early recipients, against all expert predictions, refused bonuses, paid them to charity, or shared them with their staff. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that that is most significant. Also, we heard evidence from Professor Rainer Koch of the University of the Federal Armed Forces of Germany, who indicated to us that the introduction of performance based pay in the West German Federal Civil Service in the early 1970s had been unsuccessful. The main reasons which he gave were that it was very difficult to define individual contributions to corporate performance. He was most scathing of any attempts that should be made by this Government to introduce this at such short notice. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of those hearings, the Committee recommended that performance based pay not be introduced for the SES until a formal study of costs and benefits of the proposal has been undertaken and that it has been established that significant net benefits are likely. The evidence that came to light from the different departments was that, if this proposal goes ahead on 1 July, which we are led to believe will occur, a lot of departments do not have in place effective staff appraisal systems. It certainly seems a case of putting the cart before the horse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that one of the biggest problems with performance based pay is that of having a fair and equitable appraisal system of the Senior Executive Service to allow the performance based pay to be paid in an equitable way. We were told in evidence, when we asked the Department of Finance how it intended to hand out this money-and it came as a shock to most of us, I believe-that it would hand a basketful of money, equivalent to a 10 per cent wage rise, to each department to dispose of as it wished. I was rather shocked that, if a department had a staff appraisal system in place, of those people judged to be capable of receiving an extra benefit or bonus, some would receive a bonus and others would not. So, in effect, the 10 per cent could become 20 or 30 per cent. I can understand that it could create a lot of staff morale problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore recommend that, if performance pay is introduced, it not be introduced until an effective staff appraisal system had been operating for at least one year and had been independently evaluated. We also recommended that any performance pay be given as a bonus payment rather than as a supplement to regular salary payments. It is quite obvious to anyone who knows about the way the Public Service works that, on the one hand, if it is given as an annual supplement to regular salary payments, the whole intention of performance based pay would fall down. On the other hand, if it is given as a one-off bonus payment and if the performance of a particular officer is judged to be not as good as the year before, the bonus cannot be given. Therefore, we would end up with the staff member trying to increase his performance to receive a bonus in the next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had two major concerns. As I said earlier, one concern was that some departments do not have in place staff appraisal systems. The other concern related to the rush to implement this scheme in the next two months. If it is introduced, it certainly runs a great risk of failure. The whole matter was summed up very well by David Leaver when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We still believe that it is being done . . . to get around the [wage] guidelines rather than because people have thought through the whole process. That is the wrong reason and that is a recipe for a stuff-up. </PARA>
<PARA>We hope that Mr Leaver was wrong, but the evidence we received-and we were unanimous in our report to the Senate-lends us to support that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I just say that it is rather ironic that on 22 December, the Senior Executive Service of the Public Service, by broad banding its six wage grades into three, effectively increased its wage package on average between 6 and 19 per cent. When, or if, performance pay is implemented on 1 July, it will be awarded with the full support of the Government and the Industrial Relations Commission, at least another 10 per cent, and it could go as high as 30 per cent. So there is a total, potential increase in SES pay of anything between 16 and 40 per cent. Given the fact that Cabinet, in the last day or so, has given the okay for a 42 per cent increase to top public servants, it is ironic to remember the fight that was put up by the Government against the airline pilots who had an ambit claim of 29 per cent, and the destruction that that dispute caused our nation. Yet we see here, with the full approval of the Government, a performance based pay--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots dispute has presented its report. As a member of that Committee, I wish to address one element in the report relating to the cost charged by the Commonwealth for the use of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft by the airlines throughout the dispute. When the Committee was sitting, we simply did not have any information as to how those costs were put together. It is only today, in response to a question I asked at an Estimates committee, that that information has become available to us from the Department of Defence. I wish to comment on that very briefly. The overriding characteristic of the charges levied by the Commonwealth for the use of Boeing 707, Hercules and Hawker Siddeley 748 aircraft, is that it was such an unbelievably low charge.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much was the 707?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The airlines were charged only in the order of $2,970 per flying hour. As someone who has owned and operated aircraft in a private capacity for over 20 years, I find the costing absolutely unbelievable. It was a gift-a straight-out subsidy to the airlines by the Government. What has become clear in the response from the Department of Defence today is that the Department was ordered to recover only the additional cost level. That was never made clear to the Committee. But in the report from the Defence Department today the additional cost level is defined as the cost which neglects the servicing charges by the Air Force and the manpower needed to maintain the aircraft. There is no inclusion of the capital depreciation and none of the overheads for owning the aircraft are included. In other words, it is a direct operating cost of the aircraft with not even an aircrew component in it. The additional costs are defined in the Defence Department report as having three basic components-fuel, spare parts and contractor servicing. We would remember that the fuel component was agreed to be picked up by the airline. In the end, there was some mess-up about that. The Air Force ended up providing some of its own fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an extraordinary basis on which to charge for the hire of the aircraft. Originally, the Air Force came to the airlines and said, `We estimate it will cost us $12,031 an hour for a Boeing 707 and $4,953 an hour for a C-130 aircraft'. In the end, the airlines paid not $12,031 an hour for a Boeing 707 but $2,970; they paid not $4,953 an hour for the Hercules but $806.</PARA>
<PARA> The mickey mouse economics that the Defence Department, at the Government's behest, was forced to implement were based on this mythology of an additional cost. The more hours that were flown the more the additional cost was diluted. The additional cost was taken as being developed by this spares holding, which was on a five-year average, and the contractor servicing for fixed charges, and divided by the number of hours flown. So the more hours flown, the more the cost came down. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an entirely dishonest way to calculate cost. It is true that there are fixed costs such as insurance and the holding of fixed spares, as well as the mandatory inspections that have to be done on a calendar basis as opposed to an hours flown basis. The other side of the operating costs of an aircraft relates very much to the hours flown. They do not get cheaper the more hours one flies. A classical example of that is engine costs. The life of an engine is calculated by the number of hours it runs, not by the number of hours since it was last overhauled and sits in a hangar. I do not know what it costs to overhaul the engines in a Boeing 707. I do not even know what particular Pratt and Whitney engines they are. But, by way of comparison, I know that years ago the PD6 turbine engines in a Twin Otter cost about a quarter of a million dollars each to overhaul. I presume that the much larger engines in the Boeing 707 could quite realistically cost at least $1m each to overhaul-maybe $1.5m; I do not know. With four of those engines, one would be looking at a running cost of at least $800, maybe $1,000, an hour in engine costs alone to operate that aircraft. None of this was factored into the charges that a generous government levied against the airlines for the use of those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The report from the Department of Defence establishes, without the slightest shadow of doubt, that the Government embarked on a massive subsidy to its good mates, Sir Peter Abeles of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Mr Harris of Australian Airlines Ltd. It was nothing more than a blatant transfer of funds from the taxpayer to two companies. That is absolutely wrong. The Department of Defence has had its funds cut back pretty well every year by this Government. It is very short of funds. It has massive resignation rates, high training costs, cutbacks in operational training exercises and all the rest of it. At the end of the day, the Department of Defence will have to pick up a very large part of the cost of this, for which it will receive no recompense at all from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A great difficulty we had with this report was working out the Government's motives. We simply did not know why Mr Hawke was being so generous to Mr Abeles and Australian Airlines. Why did the Government not do something to resolve the pilots strike? The evidence given to the Committee was that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots was prepared to settle that dispute from 12 September. But there was a lockout by the airlines, which was actively supported by the Government, against any resolution of the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of that strike is absolutely devastating. Hundreds of tourist industry businesses in Queensland have gone out of business because they have gone bankrupt. We have lost billions of dollars. Our international reputation as a tourist destination has been destroyed for years and it will not be re-established quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a core of about 16,070 pilots reduced to about half that number. The cream of that pilot core-the professional body of airmen in Australia-has gone to airlines such as Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines Ltd and, particularly, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. Pretty well all the check and training captains from Australian Airlines went. We are left with the pilots that could not get jobs with overseas airlines. The overseas airlines picked the eyes out of them. Where would we be today if the cream of our surgeons went to work in America, the United Kingdom or another country?</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those who went overseas, a large number of pilots who were close to retiring age said, `We do not want any part of this' and took premature retirement. The loss of expertise can be seen in the way the aircraft are being operated today. This dispute should never have occurred. Opposition members on that Committee do not support the action of the pilots. We speak out against it. But the greatest folly of all was the folly of the Government in actively supporting the airline management, which, for reasons of very short-sighted commercial advantage, chose to take on the pilots federation with no thought at all for the consequences to this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. It is a great honour to be selected by the Liberal Party of Western Australia and appointed by the Parliament of Western Australia to represent my great State here in the Senate. At the outset, I pay tribute to my colleague and predecessor, Fred Chaney. Fred Chaney's career in the Senate was long and distinguished and I wish him great success during his time in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel a strong sense of responsibility to the people of Western Australia, representating them as I now do as a senator. There are few times in the past two decades when a new member, rising to make his maiden speech, could not have been confronted with a feeling of urgency and the need to reform. I guess it becomes somewhat repetitive and trite to restate the necessity for political action to solve this nation's significant problems, when this has been so often and so clearly stated before. Yet, no matter how often this has been stated by past generations, the myriad of problems facing our nation remains. Many of the problems have worsened considerably despite the very best efforts of very well intentioned politicians who have been elected to this Parliament in the past two decades. There is certainly an intertia which permeates the political process and seems to frustrate the course of reform and adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> What then are the causes and where are the solutions? For a long time I have believed that it is important that one's community activity should involve an interest in politics. This belief is clearly not shared by many of my generation. There is a deep-seated mistrust of politicians and a lack of understanding of politics. Those of us who have pursued the pilgrimage to parliament and who sit in the various parliaments share many common ideals and make significant sacrifices in the pursuit of those ideals. In the main, we are committed to the institution of parliamentary democracy. We also have our own visions for a better future for our nation and the well-being of our fellow Australians. Those visions vary as do our philosophies and the policies we would pursue to achieve those visions. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Young Liberal State President in the early 1980s, I toured around secondary schools in Western Australia with the non-partisan objective of encouraging the youth of Western Australia to become involved in political parties. Indeed, I encouraged those young Western Australians to join the political party of their choosing and to take a role in determining the future shape of this nation. I implored them, as a young Winston Churchill had done so many decades before, to consider the question, `Does our nation always have to be ruled by old men?'. I ask, `Why cannot many young men and women concerned for the future of their nation, for their generation and for future generations, become active in the politics of their nation?'. Government does not always have to be in the hands of the older generation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is heartening to see that over the past few years the coalition parties across this nation have actively encouraged younger members to gain high office, both in the organisational wings and the parliamentary wings. I feel sure that this augers well for the rebirth of our fortunes. But the fact does remain that membership of political parties in Australia is very low-shamefully low. I am sure that if all political parties achieve an increase in membership at a grassroots level, our political parties will become more vibrant and representative and the political process will win. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks we have heard much spoken about community disdain for politicians on both sides of the political fence. The quality of our politicians and our accountability reflects the level of community involvement in the political process. The people of Australia get the government they deserve. I put it to the Senate that we do deserve better. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that the politics of the 1990s are very different from the politics of the 1980s. Politics in the 1980s were domi- nated by the tactics described in the book Programming the President-I guess, in Australian terms, it would be called `Programming the Prime Minister'. During the past decade of missed opportunities, our game was led by telephone polling and opinion polling. Policy was dictated by the politics of expediency with the longest term vision being firmly focused on the next Morgan gallop poll. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not direct all of my criticism at the current Government. Former State and Federal governments squandered vital opportunities to implement long needed and important reforms. The examples of good words and noble rhetoric not being matched by good deeds and real action would fill a tome and are part of the cause of why politicians are not trusted. </PARA>
<PARA> One example that is very close to my heart and has been high on the agenda of the Liberal Party of my generation is voluntary student unionism. The principle of freedom of association and the individual's right to choose to join or not join a union is a fundamental philosophy in which I believe. It is a principle that has been supported by the Liberal Party across Australia for many years. Yet, Liberal State governments in the early 1980s right across Australia failed to apply this philosophy when it came to student unionism and the payment of student union fees. I eagerly await the next era of Liberal-State governments and trust that they will use their power to implement this long overdue reform. Again, I look forward to the New South Wales Liberal Government showing the leadership that is required in this policy area. Men and women must be free to choose whether or not to join a union. There are no special cases and there are no exceptions. We must be free to choose. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this philosophy must also apply to industrial trade unions. I suggest that the continuing decline in union membership across Australia cannot be arrested by the formation of 20 mega-unions. The percentage of people in the work force who are members of trade unions has fallen from 51 per cent in 1976 to 42 per cent in 1988-the last figure recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. As with any organisation, when a union becomes too large the distance between the grassroots and the leadership becomes too great and the hopes and aspirations of the rank and file become very remote from the agenda pursued by the union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that trade unionism can be a positive force for Australia, but it needs to be democratic. The membership needs to be voluntary and the trade union leadership must reflect the needs of its membership. These needs will clearly vary from enterprise to enterprise, from State to State and from region to region. But I suggest again that the future of unionism is in decentralising it-taking control back closer to the grassroots. If we can do this, the proportion of those who are members of unions will actually rise. I am convinced that the current approach to union amalgamation and centralisation will hasten the current decline. Big government, big unions, big business and their cosy deals have ruined this big country. I hope that the era of the big deal is over. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three policy areas that I wish to concentrate on in this speech, namely, micro-economic reform, federalism in the 1990s and environmentally sustainable economic development. There is no doubt that there is a growing consensus about the dire economic circumstances in which we find ourselves today. In the early 1980s we referred to the `misery index', which was derived from adding the inflation rate to the prevailing unemployment rate. We could now claim to be beating almost every other nation in the civilised world in terms of an index of doom. I proposed that a cocktail derived from adding the net foreign debt as a proportion of gross domestic product of 32.9 per cent to the inflation rate of 8.6 per cent, an unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent and prime lending rates of 18.5 per cent would create a staggering index of 86.2 per cent. Of course, this is a very meaningless figure statistically, but it is a stark reminder of the sort of pain that people, their families and their businesses are undergoing. It shows why our economic activity has stalled. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to work hard to bring about a downward trend in this doom index, and perhaps on this day every year we could look at that figure again and see whether we are succeeding in this place to do just that. Of course, the bringing down of this index can be achieved only by providing an economic environment where the hopes and aspirations of individuals can be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of Australians do believe in the concept of reward for effort, a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, and an extra reward for an extra hard day's work. Australians are competitive by nature and will always rise to meet a challenge. We have proven that time and again on the sporting field where we have taken on the best the world can offer, and won. But the prerequisite to this success is a level playing field, clearly defined goals and incentives to achieve those goals. </PARA>
<PARA> This environment does not exist in Australia at the moment, and that is why the political agenda of the 1990s has the words `Micro-economic reform' written in big letters at the top. Australia cannot compete successfully on the world market with the inherent structural rigidities and inefficiencies which afflict our productivity as a nation. The Liberal Party, for the past seven years, has championed the policies of deregulation and privatisation. These are the fundamentals of micro- economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a high level of debate within the Government about the pace of this reform, but the Government is severely handicapped by the political forces within Caucus, pressure from its trade union constituency, and outdated ideological baggage which maintains a com- mitment to centralised control and government ownership of trading enterprises. I hope that the Liberal Party in Opposition can contribute to this debate. Our policies prescribe urgent and rapid reform, and we will, by leading the debate, blaze a trail that will, to some extent, assist the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little use in talking in the language of micro-economic reform, privatisation and deregulation as most people in the community do not really understand what these terms mean. But people do understand the concept of freedom and of free enterprises. People are generally aware of waste and inefficiency and the lack of responsiveness to change within govemment. We are all exposed to it every day. People are also aware of the strong dedication to service and the needs of the customer within privately owned busi- nesses, and few would argue that if we can transfer the operations out of the Government sector and into the private sector then our economy will become more vibrant. Of course, the great thing about this transfer into the private sector is that it need not be revolutionary; it can also be done without causing dislocation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, what it will do is increase opportunities for Australians and create far more flexibility and choices in employment. At the moment, 27.2 per cent of our working population is employed within the government sector. I suggest that, as the number of people employed in the free enterprise sector and within small business increases, there will be greater freedom, as people employed within the private sector will have more flexibility in career moves.</PARA>
<PARA> I have always said to those people who have worked with me that when the morning comes that they do not want to leap out of bed and tear into work, that is the morning that they should start looking for a new job, because no-one should have to spend five or six days out of a seven day week doing something that does not provide them with both personal satisfaction and adequate financial rewards. This is what privatisation and micro-economic reform is really about. It is about creating a better environment for each and every Australian to achieve their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA> This should be the focus of the debate and the test of any micro-economic reform agenda. What does micro-economic reform achieve for individual Australians in terms of creating more opportunities and more economic freedom? It should not relate to the needs of peak employer groups, peak trade unions and government, for when these groups set the agenda the individual loses out. One of my goals as a senator is to see privatisation and deregulation policies communicated in digestible language and to see these policies successfully implemented. When we talk of privatisation it is no longer a question of will we do it, but a matter of when-and I will use all my energies to ensure that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my other fundamental objectives as a senator representing Western Australia is to maintain a strong and vibrant federal system. Too often in the past the rhetoric of federalism has concentrated on States rights. This is seen to be reactionary, conservative and parochial. Centralists who usually, and not coincidentally, live in the more populous States often use the phrase `States rights' to demean the politics of federalism. As a phrase, States rights shares the weakness of privatisation, in that it is not very descriptive and can readily be misused. Indeed, the advocates of States rights who use the phrase and then leave it to stand alone as if it is self-evidently righteous do more harm than good in the debate on the inherent benefits of the federal system. The benefit of a decentralised political system is that decision making is kept close to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Government and Parliament are accessible and responsible to individual and community needs. Yet since Federation we have witnessed an entire procession of politicians from all political parties come into this place and try to centralise power. The proponents of centralisation would have us believe that it is more efficient to centralise control into one government and that we can get rid of duplication and make things more efficient by doing just that. The same logic could be applied to a dictatorship or a one party state: it is very efficient but far from my vision of representative and accountable democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The most successful companies in the private sector ensure that decision making and responsibility are delegated right down the line to ensure that the customer deals with the decision maker. The world wide trend to franchising is evidence of this. At a time when businesses, faced with fierce and escalating international competition, are decentralising to ensure they can adapt to change quickly, we are continuing to centralise political power. At a time when the nations of the Eastern bloc are clambering for democratically self elected government, we are continuing to centralise power in the Federal Government at the expense of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> My proposition is that Australia cannot become more competitive and more adaptive to a rapidly changing international economic climate without a decentralised political system. Our commitment to federalism must be based on this principle and not on reactionary States rights dogma. </PARA>
<PARA> Federalism does not mean buying off the States with grants and handouts and large regional offices. It requires real control by the States of those areas of responsibility not reserved for the Commonwealth under the Constitution. The current negotiations over the control of corporations and securities law are a classic example of the States being bought out by the Commonwealth. I implore the business community to see this centralist grab for power for what it is. The business community must send a clear message to the State governments that are caving in to the Commonwealth's national scheme. Business people across Australia must inform the State governments that control and accountability for corporate affairs has to be retained at the State level where the majority of business activity takes place. This does not deny the need for a strong national corporate watchdog, which must be well resourced. But this can all be achieved by an upgraded and more accountable cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what the Federal Government promises today about the level of services that businesses in the outlying States will receive from the Australian Securities Commission, that promise will be irrelevant, because control and resources will be determined here and will not be responsible to business communi- ties at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of federalism during the 1990s must proactively decentralise both power and responsibility and reduce Federal Government intervention and control. I am dedicated to achieving this shift away from centralised power for the benefit of both my nation and the people of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also committed to achieving environmentally sustainable economic growth. Again, many centralists would have us believe that the only way to achieve economic growth and protect the environment at the same time is to hand over control to Canberra. Of course, much of this control has already been assumed by the abuse of the external affairs power and the use of World Heritage listings. </PARA>
<PARA> When we move down the path of centralised government control through regulation and prohibition then a whole diversity of environmental enterprise and entrepreneurship will be smothered at birth. The recent Globe 90 international conference in Canada focused world attention on the potential for environmental management and associated technology to become a rapidly growing industry in this decade. It is an industry in which Australia is very well placed to lead the world, and I put it to the Senate that it is a potential source of future export income. But this can occur only if the Government stays right out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The growing environmental consciousness is a worldwide movement of public opinion. It is a grassroots change that will reshape our industries and technologies, but this will be from the ground up. It is the sort of change that is naturally suited to a decentralised decision making and law making structure. Dr David Suzuki's catchcry of `Think globally and act locally' is to me a call to our fellow man to do away with the rhetoric and take action. That action starts in our very own backyards. It embraces local communities, our towns, our cities, our regions, our States, and a shared responsibility for our nation and our world. This should be the order of priority for our environment policies. We must reject calls to hand over control of the environment to the government in Canberra. We must encourage local action on local problems and cooperative solutions to national and global problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The environment debate during the 1990s should not be fought on the grounds of how `green' one politician or one political party claims to be. This is quite irrelevant and quite transparent. I know many environmentalists around this country who would have been sickened to see politi- cians jumping on the Green band wagon and saying, `Me too'. The debate must focus on how best to create the framework which will harness the force of individual commitment and enterprise in achieving our vision of a healthy economy and a protected environment. I think I have made it pretty clear that there are two paths down which we can travel: one is the path of centralised control and regulation and the other is that of encouraging free market solutions which provide incentives for individuals, businesses and industries to enhance and protect our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a rapidly increasing level of information about our environment. This has created a healthy awareness of the long term damage that can be caused by disregard for natural ecosystems. This awareness exerts both political and market pressures on governments and industry. Industry is forced to take a longer term view than just looking towards the next quarter's profits. Companies which pollute the environment will be put out of business by the consumers of their end products. This market pressure was evi- denced by research referred to in the Australian Financial Review of 16 May. The Quaker Oats company in Canada found that 41 per cent of Canadians had either stopped buying or switched brands on the basis of company environmental records. This is a trend in consumer behaviour which, no doubt, will become even more widespread as the years go by. This behaviour is far more effective at regulating the actions of industry than arbitrary limits imposed through regulation and bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not advocating `She'll be right' and that we can just leave it all to the private sector, because there is a very important role required of political leadership. We do have a responsibility to ensure that resources such as clean water, clean air and forests are protected for the benefit of mankind in perpetuity. Past generations of Australians have been responsible for visiting some major environmental disasters upon this nation, but I do not think it is fair, relevant or helpful for us to place all the blame on our forefathers. What is relevant is that our generation assume responsibility for rectifying those past mistakes. What we must also do is ensure that our natural environment-and our knowledge of how to manage it-is passed on to the future generations in a far better condition. This is a goal I will work towards as a senator and a goal I will encourage my generation to share. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to redefining the debate and the objectives of micro-economic reform, the relevance of federalism in this new age, and environmentally sustainable economic development. My Party clearly has not been successful in communicating its philosophies and principles in these areas in the past, but I do look forward to dedicating my efforts to communicating these policies while in opposition and making sure they are implemented when next we return to government. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I consider it a great honour and privilege to serve alongside my colleagues in the Senate and to work for the achievement of these goals. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. It is an important speech for the people I am referring to, and it would look a little bald left as it was, without being completed. I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without going over all the matters I had referred to, I was speaking about those people who I believe have been neglected by the Government. I refer to those who are dependent for their incomes to an extent on the activities of the Child Support Agency and who receive maintenance for children through that Agency. I have complained previously in this place, and did on the last occasion I spoke, about the fact that the Agency is not operating properly. I support the work of the Agency, but I believe it must be made to work effectively and efficiently and to see the the money that is paid to it gets to those who need it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I told the Senate that I had been invited by the Melbourne office of the Agency to visit and see what it was doing. I have no complaint about the Melbourne office of the Agency. I have had no dealings with that office and I certainly do not go to Melbourne very frequently. I am talking about the difficulties people in Canberra and the surrounding districts have in getting their money out of the Child Support Agency. I am talking about the many instances where advice duly supplied as to the whereabouts of a non-custodial father was not acted upon or was acted upon so late that the information was already out of date and opportunities for recovering maintenance were thereby lost. I am not talking about delays of just a few weeks; I am talking about delays of several months. I am talking about excessive delays in acting on variations of court orders, occasioning loss of maintenance. I am talking about the total failure to act to recover arrears of maintenance owed, failure to issue summonses and failure to commence recovery action. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about numerous instances of lost or mislaid forms, causing delays in starting maintenance recovery. I am talking about failure to pay money to clients on the basis that they had been overpaid, with no explanation offered as to how the Agency worked out that there had been an overpayment. Where moneys have been paid by a person to the Agency for the support of children they ought to be passed on, not held by the Agency because it believes there has been an overpayment. I am talking about the Agency's refusal to pass on maintenance duly and voluntarily paid for a child the subject of a court order. I am talking about the failure to process payments received on time so that they can be paid on time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is little wonder that the Agency's phones are running hot with inquiries from its clients wondering about the status of their cases and what is being done for them. When I refer to the phones of the Agency running hot I mean phones, because there is no office in Canberra that a person can go to to sort out the problems I am speaking of. It is much more difficult to do that over the phone-assuming, of course, that the phone is answered when a call is made to the Agency's office in Sydney. Unfortunately, the experience of many women who have contacted me is that they feel they are met by an unsympathetic and unhelpful response when they do get an answer to their calls. One woman who rang me had rung the Agency to inquire why the consumer price index increase had not been added, as stipulated in the court order-an adjustment upwards, annually, as is the case with many, in accordance with the CPI. She was told that she would have to calculate this herself. </PARA>
<PARA> It was lucky for this woman that she knew how to go about getting the official quarterly CPI statistics from the Bureau of Statistics. It was lucky that she was in Canberra and it was able to be done relatively easily. She had to do the calculation herself and provide the information to the Agency as to the amount that should then be paid by way of an increase in maintenance before it would even contemplate writing to the father to ask him to increase the amount that he was paying. As I said, it was fortunate that this woman was able to do these calculations. Many in the community would not have known where to get the CPI figures from, would not have the numeracy level and efficiency with numbers to work out the sum to be paid, or to even feel confident that they had done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Another woman who was owed several hundred dollars in arrears and who inquired what the Agency was doing to recover the money was informed that there were people in more need than she; that she was a low priority. How the officer speaking to her was qualified to judge this I really do not know. It is worth noting that this response from the Agency implied that it was pursuing larger debts. I do not know how large they need to be before they are regarded as being sufficiently large to warrant action by the Agency. But I am in contact with one woman owed several thousand dollars in maintenance who has had no more success than the woman owed a few hundred dollars. It seems astonishing to me that anyone could regard maintenance being paid through the Child Support Agency as not of sufficient importance to give collection of it a very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Another woman rang the Agency to ask why her money had not turned up. The money had been received by the Agency on the last day for the cut-off but the Agency had failed to key the amount into the computer and the payment could not be made. She was told that she could go to Social Security to get an advance on her pension. She told the Child Support Agency Officer that she was not on a pension and was then quizzed by the officer as to why she was not out working. He clearly had concluded that she really did not need the money. I repeat: How could people be dealing with the Child Support Agency if they did not need the money for the support of the children in their care? This woman was told that she was just one of 48,000 cases in New South Wales and that a special case could not be made out for her. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had numerous complaints with regard to the Agency, for example, phone calls not being returned; letters not being answered; long waits on the telephone to get through; officers who will not give their names to clients so that they cannot ring and get to the same person a second time; and, if one gets a name, one can never get the same person on the phone again when one rings back. The other excuse which is used quite frequently is that the computers are down. One might frivolously ask-down where? As far as the clients are concerned they might just as well be. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me, from the dealings that my office has had with the Agency, that there is a real morale problem. I feel very sorry for the staff who are trying to work there. Clearly, they are not sufficient in number to do the job efficiently and well. Therefore, there is a very high staff turnover. People obviously feel very unhappy that they are not able to do the job properly. The area is understaffed. As a result, the staff are harassed and overworked. Clearly, the new staff are not receiving adequate training before they are thrown into the job. As a result, the clients become frustrated with and justifiably angry at the treatment that they receive from the Agency. That is why so many people have come to my office to seek intervention on their behalf. All they want to know, mostly, is what is happening and that is what they cannot find out. </PARA>
<PARA> My office has had considerable dealings with the Agency looking after Canberra clients, the Chatswood office. We have experienced many of the same problems in getting information that clients of the Agency who have come to me as constituents have had, for example, failure to return phone calls and officers being unwilling to supply a name so that a follow-up can be pursued with the same person. There have been occasions when we felt that the `intrusion', one might call it-that is the way it seems to be-of my office was not welcomed at all. There does not seem to be a recognition of the fact that something within the Agency is causing this amount of unhappiness, and the intervention of a third party, that is, a member of parliament was not welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some of the most recent encounters. In making inquiries on behalf of four women having problems with the Agency we were trying to find what was happening with each of their respective cases. In three of the cases maintenance was in arrears and, supposedly, action was being taken in the enforcement section. In two of the cases it was the slowness of the Agency itself which had contributed to the accumulation of arrears. There were two situations where the client had duly provided all the information necessary for the Agency to commence recovery by way of direct deduction from the salary of the payer, but in both instances it had not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> One woman had sent in her application with all the details in January 1989 but it was not until May that the Agency contacted the ex-husband's employer to request the withholdings. The employer promptly complied and sent his paperwork back so that the deductions could start from June. From January to May of 1989 nothing was recovered, and this woman is supposed to be supporting her children with that money. </PARA>
<PARA> When asked why this was the case, my office was told that it could have been incompetence, lack of training or carelessness but that there was little point in raking over it. I do not agree with that. When asked what was being done to recover the arrears for this period, the advice given was that it was in the hands of the enforcement section. The officer to whom my office was speaking could not tell from the computer records how this was progressing. A similar situation existed with the other two cases to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> There are occasions, of course, when one gets on to somebody at the Agency who is most anxious to be helpful but who is not able to do what he would like to do. The girl in this particular case was not able to get us through to the enforcement section. When she tried to find out the phone number of the enforcement section for us so that we could ring it directly, she was told that numbers for the enforcement section would not be made available. It is an extraordinary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I believe it is because the Government has not provided sufficient staff for the job that the Agency is trying to do that the staff are getting frustrated and leaving. New ones are coming on and are not being adequately trained to proceed in the way that they would like to. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a question of accountability-accountability to the clients who are dealing with the Agency. Many people have sought to deal with the Agency because they believed that that would be the best way to proceed with the collection of maintenance, so that there would be a record for both parties and that everything would proceed smoothly. As a consequence many have been disillusioned. They feel utterly powerless to do anything about dealing with the Agency because of its situation in Sydney and because there is no office in Canberra. There are others they have to ring. I am not suggesting for a minute that we should have an Agency office in every town, but when we think of the number of people in Canberra and its districts, it does seem surprising that it cannot be handled better than it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agency is not able adequately to provide the service its clients deserve and which it was intended it should carry out. However, I will not go over the details that I have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that there is evidence of a very high staff turnover. I believe that it is not the will of those within the Agency that things are turning out as they are. We must remember also that since it was set up in 1988 it has had additional responsibilities added to its original charter; that is, the imposition of the administrative formula which now operates to determine the amount of maintenance that any given person is required to pay. I will not go into the details of the formula. I am not challenging that. I am merely indicating that there is now a great deal more work to be done by the Agency to get the information that is required to assess the amount of money that ought to be paid by a person for children when the matter is being dealt with by the Agency. I think that considerably more staff and more training are required to enable staff to do the job that we expect of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will take this problem seriously. It is not just a few Canberra women who have come to me that I am talking about; it is everybody who is dealing with the Agency and who is entitled to expect that it will provide for their children in the way in which it was intended when the legislation went through this Parliament. The Government has made a lot of commitments to women and children and to children in poverty, and the legislation which set up the Agency is a prime example of its achievements. I challenge the Government to make it work and make it work in a way that is meaningful for those who rely on it. It is false economy to skip on the necessities of the system and the structures that are necessary to make it work. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, staff who ought to be dealing with payments coming in and going out are spending much of their time dealing with inquiries-the sort of inquiries, just a few of which I have mentioned-which I have received through my own office. If staff are tied up endlessly on inquiries we are not achieving what we set out to do. The mere fact that there are so many inquiries to the Agency ought to be an indication to the Government and to the Minister that something needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own admission is that the Agency has not been as successful as anticipated in collecting and recovering maintenance. An independent report released in January showed that it was originally expected that savings to the taxpayer would amount to $120m in 1988-89 and $190m in 1989-90. This would have been derived from reductions in social security payments to sole parents who would now be getting maintenance. It is clear that these estimates were substantially over-optimistic. When the report was released the expected savings for 1988-89 were estimated at a mere $20m, not the $120m originally foreshadowed. Savings for 1989-90 are estimated to be in the region of only $40m. </PARA>
<PARA> The report itself lays some blame at delays in starting the scheme and getting it functioning as it should. No-one doubted that there would be teething problems. The report noted the delays in getting payments to custodial parents after an order had been registered with them. The then Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, reportedly expressed his concern about it. He is alleged to have said that it is important to recognise that this delay occurs only once before the first payment is made. It is unfortunate, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I have to tell you that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much to be done in this area. As I said, I have spoken on it before. I hope not to have to speak on it again. I believe that it is in the Government's interests to put a bit more effort into making sure that the Agency functions properly. I certainly hope that it will do this for the sake of the clients who rely on it. There is enough stress being a sole parent with an inadequate income without the worry of maintenance not coming through, especially when we know that it has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government to look at the matter for the sake of the staff who are attempting to work within the Agency, and to thereby increase the savings on the social welfare expenditure and convince women who are presently getting less than adequate treatment that there is some basis for the Government's alleged claim to be concerned about women and children living in low income families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this very lengthy Auditor-General's report, report No. 32, which we have received today and which is of some substance. This report reveals that both on the revenue and the payments side there are some improvements that need to be made to protect taxpayers' interests and the interests of all Australians. It also reveals some fiddles being done by departments playing around with their balances at the end of the year to make certain that they are theoretically spent to ensure that the money does not get taken from them out of the following year's allocations. This 30 June fiddle is well-known, and the Auditor-General is on to it and has revealed it in some instances which I will deal with briefly later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The key elements of this report concern the financial statement relating to the aggregate financial statements of the Government, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA> revenue collections in the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs Service were adversely affected by the incidence of evasion and other breaches of relevant legislation</PARA>
<PARA> overpayments of benefits may have occurred at the Department of Social Security and Employment, Education and Training where payments were partially dependent on voluntary compliance, and</PARA>
<PARA> some pharmaceutical benefits were paid to pharmacists by the Department of Community Services and Health when entitlement was not evident and where prescriptions were incorrectly categorised because of insufficient verification of claims. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General notes some problems with controls over expenditure. In the report he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretaries of the Departments of Social Security, Aboriginal Affairs and Employment, Education and Training were unable to certify, in their respective certificates on the financial statements, that payments of benefits and allowances under various programs of Commonwealth assistance were made in all instances in accordance with the program legislation and or established entitlement criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to go into great depth about the extent to which those breaches took place. There is a list of breaches at the end of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the matter of pharmaceutical benefits the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> The audit reports on the financial statements prepared by the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of Veterans' Affairs made reference to varying degrees of incorrect payments made under the Pharmaceutical Benefits and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits schemes respectively. Payments under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are made under the National Health Act 1953 and amounted to in excess of $1 billion in the 1988-89 financial year. Payments under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are made under the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 and amounted to approximately $90m . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Both departments have advised ANAO that because of the high volume and low individual value of claims processed it was neither practical nor cost effective to make full validation cheques prior to payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, the Audit Office concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that the checks carried out by the departments had not been sufficient to reduce incorrect payments to a satisfactory level. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear statement from the Auditor-General that incorrect payments are at an unsatisfactory level in this area. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The existence of a high error rate in the validity of entitlement numbers and the limited nature of post payment checking undertaken by the Department of Community Services and Health was . . . raised . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It was raised earlier last year. There was a response to this from the Department. The Audit Office now says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . however, considered that the limited post payment checks in place were not sufficient to ensure that significant misuse of the system was prevented. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Audit Office considered:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that there was not evidence that the Department had undertaken a formal risk assessment regarding the nature and level of post payment checks which ANAO considered desirable in view of the high level of error detected. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously there is a need for dramatic improvement. No doubt the Audit Office and the departments hope that the planned change for the administration of these schemes through the Health Insurance Commission will lead to some more effective way of dealing with this matter. It clearly needs that improvement to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of matters I want to raise on the question of fiddling the accounts at the end of the year. There is nothing new about fiddling accounts; it is just that it should not take place, particularly when it is in breach of the law. This, of course, is the simple fact. For example, there was a concern by the Audit Office relating to prepayments. There was a prepayment of $12.7m by the Department of Social Security to Telecom Australia which was made right at the end of the year in order to avoid that allocation not being spent. The Australian Audit Office questioned whether in fact this prepayment was effectively a form of investment, because it was to earn interest at some 15 per cent on the outstanding balance and therefore was outside the power of the Department to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> The Audit Office also questioned whether the arrangements may have been made in order to avoid the lapsing of the appropriation and noted that additional estimates of some $11.5m sought in March 1989 would not have been needed without the prepayments. That is the interesting point for the Senate as we at present deal with Additional Estimates. Here we have the Department of Social Security asking for Additional Estimates of $11.5m, having in fact prepaid an account of something like $12.7m that was not due until the following financial year. It simply did not need the money in Supplementary Estimates and it fiddled the books to get this claim through this chamber and through our Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it absolutely vital that the Auditor-General has been able to tell us that we have been conned by the Department of Social Security but the big question is whether or not it is a sensible and proper thing to do because the Department signed the contract with Telecom for the prepayment of telephone accounts on 30 June 1989. The Audit Office naturally asked what less advantageous contractual arrangements would have occurred if payment had not been made until 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of legal advice about this and, as I understand it, the Attorney-General says that there was no express requirement in the Appropriation Act that moneys paid relate to services rendered in the current year. But the wash-up of it all is that on 24 November 1989 the Department of Finance issued a revised Finance direction, 8d, which precludes an arrangement involving the early drawdown of cash if it would result in an adverse cash management outcome for the Commonwealth as a whole. The agreement with Telecom, the Auditor-General says, would not have met the requirements of this revised direction in that the rate of discount received by the Department from Telecom was less than the Commonwealth paid for its short-term borrowings during June of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only one instance shown here of this kind of fiddle. There is another one closer to home, once again within the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) of our own Parliament. It seems to be the popular whipping boy around here. We have an advance payment to consultants of $239,845. A payment of about a quarter of a million dollars was made in June 1989-is that not remarkable?-for the provision of consultancy services to the Department. The Audit Office found no evidence to support the explanations put forward by PISO through the Department that there were requirements for this advance payment to secure the services of key personnel. On the basis of the Audit finding, the Audit Office concluded that the prime motivation for the advance payment was to avoid the lapsing of the Department's appropriation, and the Department was therefore in breach of Finance direction 8d as it applied at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Fiddling the books, when it is done in the private sector, is regarded as pretty naughty. I do not see why we should not regard this kind of fiddling the books, particularly when it involves the misleading of the Senate and of the parliamentary Estimates committees, as also quite improper. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also some problems pretty close to home relating to a cleaning contract in this building. In June 1988, the Joint House Department entered into a five-year contract for the cleaning of designated internal areas of the new Parliament House and encountered major difficulties with the operation of the contract almost from its inception. In response to Audit Office findings, the Department agreed that the certifying officer could not satisfy himself that the amount of $876,028-that is, an additional payment for cleaning here-claimed by the contractor over and above the fixed rate was correct. He could not satisfy himself that that payment was correct. The failure to ensure the correctness of payments is in breach of Finance regulation 45/1 (a). The Joint House Department also agreed that additional cleaning involving the payment of $433,153 was incurred without formal prior approval by an officer holding an appropriate delegation from the parliamentary Presiding Officers and that the cleaning of the car parks, road, basement and loading docks areas-that is, another $172,800 claimed-was allocated to the contractor without public tenders being called. </PARA>
<PARA> All these transactions breached Finance regulations. I must admit that it is probably difficult for us here to complain about what other departments are doing in terms of fiddling the books when we find that our own administration in this place is in fact breaching the requirements of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another curious situation in the Attorney-General's Department which shows how energetic and enthusiastic that Department is in fixing up mistakes. An account styled `Commonwealth investment equalisation account' had a balance of $381,615 at 30 June 1989 and had been inactive since 1985 when this amount was credited to the account, apparently in error. We have had $381,615 sitting in an account called `Commonwealth investment equalisation account' since 1985, when it was put there by error. Again I think we can expect better of our departments, and I am glad the Auditor-General has been able to discover this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has since been advised that the account has now been cleared by a transfer to revenue, but the matter was still under discussion with the Department at the date of preparation of this report. I would think it would be appropriate to have some pretty solid discussions with the Department on that sort of matter but, as I said, these issues are of some substance. </PARA>
<PARA> I now have only a couple more points that I want to make, and one of them relates to the granting of invalid pensions. The Auditor-General, I think, makes a very sound point when he says that he is of the view that the grounds on which an applicant may qualify for an invalid pension are not sufficiently clear and that an excessive degree of reliance is being placed on the discretion and judgment of departmental staff to make determinations which are in accordance with the legislative provisions and which would achieve consistency and fairness in outcome no matter at what regional office a person makes application for a pension or benefit. In other words, one can get an invalid pension by going to office No. A because the person there helping me has the capacity or desire, to grant one because of the discretion given. But one can go to office No. B and not get one, having exactly the same level of invalidity. I agree with the Auditor-General that that matter of great substance should be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is that the Department of Finance is supposed to be the one that is, if you like, purer than pure. The Department of Finance is supposed to supervise these matters and make certain that proper accounting procedures continue. In the list at the back of this report there are 12 examples of breaches of Commonwealth law by the Department of Finance of its own requirements. For example, with respect to receipt books there was no evidence of independent monthly checks. One would hope that the Department of Finance might actually be able to get its act in order. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of evidence of expenditure problems; overpayment of claims; and four breaches of Commonwealth law by the Department of Social Security. The Australian Electoral Commission was making payments when the certifying officer was not duly appointed, and there were numerous breaches of the law by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) where payments were made without evidence that expenditure was duly approved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had numerous breaches as credits were offset against expenditure without the authority of the Minister for Finance. That is a simple way of boosting one's expenditure by slipping whatever revenue one has into one's expenditure accounts. There were numerous breaches by DEET where expenditure was not recorded on a functional basis as required by the Department of Finance. In the Joint House Department payment correctness checks were not performed on eight occasions involving a breach of the law. It also managed to breach the law by duplicating payments on five occasions. I commend the Auditor-General's report No. 32 to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very pleasing to see a report which was received by the President only on 21 May, two days ago, tabled so promptly and available to the Senate for consideration. This report is a special and comprehensive review of the operations of the Squirrel training helicopters which are located at the Royal Australian Air Force Base, Fairbairn. These helicopters have been used primarily for the initial rotary wing flying training for Navy, Army and Air Force helicopter pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise by the Auditor-General was to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the utilisation of these helicopters and their maintenance. The report made some important findings which I think should be brought to the attention of the Senate and studied by honourable senators. I do not propose to go into them in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, the findings of the audit review were that considerable cost savings could be made by different methods of management and of the work practices in relation to the maintenance and utilisation of these helicopters. The report made a number of suggestions to the Department of Defence as to how they could be achieved. In fact, the Auditor-General has identified the possible savings of at least $2m per annum in relation to the management of these helicopters. One of the important recommendations is that by contracting out the maintenance functions to private industry there is a potential to make even further significant savings. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that of the 31 recommendations made by the Australian Audit Office the Department of Defence has agreed in principle with virtually all the recommendations in one form or another. The exercise has been a valuable one. In view of the fact that so much agreement has been reached between the Audit Office and the Department of Defence we hope that there will be scope for these very considerable savings to be made. I think that is very important because the Opposition has been highly critical of the lack of adequate management practices and excessive overheads in this Department and believes that significant savings can be made if the Department looks carefully and in detail at its operations at central management level and at its management practices throughout the whole of the defence service. </PARA>
<PARA> The report highlights the savings that can be made and the importance of the contracting out of so many of the Department's functions. Obviously there has been far too great an adherence to the traditional methods of providing one's own in-house services. This is one particular and relatively small area-namely, the maintenance of this group of helicopters-where significant savings can be made as identified by the Audit Office. Greater readiness to contract out to private industries, as the Audit Office suggests, would result in significant savings and another method by which much better management could be installed in this large and important department. I believe that this report certainly deserves greater study, which I hope to be able to give it. I know that colleagues of mine also wish to study it further and comment on it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> Thirdly, Senator Parer this morning asked for clarification of information supplied in response to questions he asked about the numbers of ministerial staff now compared with the number at the end of 1982 and the composition of the extra 18 positions determined for office holders. Specifically this morning I think he asked whether the extra 18 positions should be added to the 235 positions mentioned as the total number of ministerial positions. The situation is that there is a total of 235 positions available for filling by ministerial staff, including five positions from within the extra 18 positions recently determined. They are the extra 18 positions that Senator Parer referred to. The remaining 13 of those positions are not for filling by ministerial staff. Eight of the positions are allocated to the parliamentary secretaries, two to the Australian Democrats, and one to Mr E. Mack, the independent member for North Sydney. My Department has assumed that the remaining two of the 18 newly created positions will be allocated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). It should be noted, however, that the final number of staff positions to be available to the Leader of the Opposition is not yet known. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a couple of brief questions. The Senate is well aware of the problem of dead rent that has been raised repeatedly by me and others in Senate Estimates committees. In the Auditor-General's Report No. 31 the matter of the Rialto Building in Melbourne is revived, if I can use the word `revived' about dead rent, and he reminds us that in his report last year it appeared to the Australian National Audit Office that dead rent amounting to approximately $3.6m, or 52 per cent of the actual cost of the fitting out of the Rialto Building in Melbourne, was excessive, in its view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dead rent-in other words paying rent for an area you are not really occupying-totalling $3.6m is, I think by any judgment, excessive. In response, Australian Construction Services (ACS) advised that it considered the major factors contributing to the dead rent related to delays in submissions of client briefs and industrial disputation and were outside its jurisdiction to control. This raises the simple question of how we can make certain that client departments who are to use the space get off their backsides in enough time to make certain that their brief of what they actually want in terms of the way they want to use the space is provided in reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General pressed this matter with the result that the Department of Administrative Services assured the Audit Office that it was continuing in close cooperation with client organisations to refine its procedures to ensure that such costs were kept to an absolute minimum. What I want to know is what action has been taken. It is all very well telling us that the Department has refined its procedures. Has it in fact brought about a better result than this sort of $3.6m in dead rent? I know that the Department quite properly says that its dead rent as a proportion of total rent is pretty reasonable, even in commercial terms. Nonetheless, it is money obviously that the Auditor-General believes can be saved and he certainly makes the point that the amount of money in this situation, $3.6m, is clearly excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are dealing with this question of dead rent and what is being done about it, I point out that the Audit Office also raised the question of 363 Adelaide Street, Brisbane, where penalties and prolongation costs and dead rent were incurred on this project as a result of delays in submissions of layout plans by the occupying department and delays in occupation arising from industrial action by staff associations. </PARA>
<PARA> These delays and costs were largely outside the control of Australian Construction Services and it is noted that in future such costs will be attributed to occupying departments rather than to the Department of Administrative Services. I am wondering to what extent the measures taken so far-which according to the Administrative Services Department are expected to improve overall efficiency-have improved overall efficiency and to what extent there is still a lot of improvement to go before we stop wasting money like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume is right in respect of the relative nature of dead rent. He is also right in the way in which he described the two major problems in respect of Rialto and the Brisbane building. The Australian National Audit Office actually canvassed those two issues. In terms of the response to the review there has been a review of the structure of the Department and that has led to reducing the number of programs from 17 to four, including combining the Australian Construction Services and the Australian Property Group (APG) under one program. That will provide very effectively a one-stop shop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The revised organisational structure has now recently been settled and revised arrangements for the management of fitout are also being implemented. The basis of the reorganisation is a recognition that the client has a real project manager and that fitout and accommodation may be only one part of that project. The client-manager role in the Australian Property Group-that is, the one-stop property shop service, is being reinforced and marketed strongly through a new area of APG Accommodation. The focus and marketing of office fitout in ACS will be upgraded through the establishment of the new business called ACS Interiors and as a consequence that coordination will be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that there will be regular coordination meetings of the client, APG Accommodation and ACS Interiors as frequently as the client wants. Further staff of APG Accommodation and ACS Interiors in State offices will be collocated as soon as practicable. Essentially a lot of the success of this will depend on the culture and attitude of staff of APG Accommodation and ACS Interiors. The mechanisms set in place are geared towards addressing that particular problem. It is too early to give any final or conclusive figures or results as to that, as it has been a recent reorganisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his courtesy and that very fulsome answer, which I must say sounds very satisfactory. I will very briefly deal with the Transport and Storage Group reservations where the financial accounts, according to the Auditor-General, were received on 8 November 1989. A number of significant adjustments to the accounts were required as a result of the audit. The audit found weaknesses in the accounting for plant and equipment caused mainly by inadequate stockpile programs and the failure to update assets registers in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. The Audit Office identified that debts were not being recovered on a timely basis, resulting in debts outstanding over 90 days accounting for between 30 and 50 per cent of total regional office debtors. It also said that the Transport and Storage Group had fuel bowsers located at government depots for the supply of fuel to vehicles on hire and the audit and the audit revealed weaknesses in control over fuel stocks in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria and discrepancies between actual fuel stocks and stock recorded at both locations. In addition, large unauthorised adjustments had been made to the general ledger. I just wondered whether all those matters had been fixed yet. In view of the time, if the Minister would like to incorporate the response, I would be only too happy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (1) As at 31 December 1989, $10,638,534.64 was held in security deposits.</PARA>
