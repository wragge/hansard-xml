<TITLE>Immigrants : Discrimination</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of concerned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth.-</PARA>
<PARA> That although Australia claims to have adopted a non-discriminatory policy in respect to immigrants, yet this policy discriminates against those who have been responsible for development of Australia, the Anglo-Keltic majority who compose 75% of the population now, by the deliberate selection of immigrants from areas from which Anglo-Keltic peoples are not likely to be obtained. At the same time although the Asian percentage of the population of Australia is 4.5% of the population yet Asian immigrants are represented by between 40% and 55.5% of the immigrant intake. Evidence is enclosed.</PARA>
<PARA> Continuation of this policy must eventually alter the ethnic composition of Australia and increase the possibility of racial strife as in Sri Lanka, Fiji and other well known areas of racial strife.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request that immigrants be obtained from areas which will tend to maintain the ethnic structure of Australia as notified in National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia page 2.</PARA>

<PARA>- Compared with other OECD countries our pension system is the least generous.</PARA>
<PARA>- Public hospitals do not give pensioners the priority they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA>- The financial discrimination against married couples who on a per person basis are worse off than a single person.</PARA>

<PARA>- The refusal of taxation and pension income assesors to use `real' income for the interest only deposits and investments commonly used by pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>- The outrageous case where investment capital gains accrued over many years are regarded as income occurring in ONE year for pension income assessment when surrendered or sold, this often resulting in a drastic cut or total loss of pension for one year.</PARA>

I am pleased to report to the Senate that in both these cases the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has undertaken to amend the legislation to meet the concerns of the Committee. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence of the Committee on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>The Hon John Kerin MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Wool Marketing Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1990 No.203, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 23 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Explanatory Statement states that new r.21 (2a) provides that the Australian Wool Corporation may ``seek from registered persons information (etc)'' (emphasis added). If such a provision was made in the Amendment then the Committee would have no objection to this reasonable requirement. The actual provision of the Amendment, however, is that ``the Corporation may make inquiries arising out of the information and may direct (to give information)'' (emphasis added). The Committee would be grateful for your advice as to whether the Amendment as drafted affects the intention of the instrument advised in the Explanatory Statement. As the instrument now stands this appears a wide provision, for which there is a penalty of $1,000, which applies to any person at all. It appears, for example, to permit the Corporation to require banks and other financial institutions to provide details of accounts. There do not appear to be any safeguards or restrictions on this power which as it stands could apply to personal information. </PARA>
<PARA>If it is the intention of the legislation, contrary to the advice in the Explanatory Statement, confer on to the Australian Wool Corporation the power to direct any person to provide information, then the Committee believes that the Regulations should be amended to provide clear and extensive safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Chairman</PARA>
<PARA>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letters of 24 August 1990 concerning the Wool Marketing Regulations (Amendment) and the Wool Marketing Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Wool Marketing Regulations (Amendment) it was not intended that the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) be able to request information from other than registered persons. There are instances where documents may be provided by any one of a number of registered persons at a particular organisation. The intention of the subregulation is that the Corporation be able to seek further information by notice from any one of those registered persons, even though that registered person may not have provided the documents in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations will be amended accordingly at the next available opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>You also noted that the direction issued by me on 31 May 1990 under section 120 of the Wool Marketing Act did not include any system of numbering or citation as is preferred for every series of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Directions issued under section 120 are not instruments in the nature of subordinate or delegated legislation which attract the obligations of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 or the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903. They are administrative directions, to an agency for which I am responsible, on how that agency is to perform its functions. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I do agree that matters such as this which are of general public interest should be easily accessible to the public. To that end, and in accordance with the requirements of section 120, the direction has been published in the Gazette (on 13 June 1990) and tabled in Parliament (on 21 August 1990). In addition, the AWC will, in accordance with section 120(3)(b), publish particulars of the direction in its Annual Report for the relevant period. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe all of these requirements ensure that the direction is included in the public record in a systematic method. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours fraternally</PARA>

<PARA>Senator the Hon Robert Ray</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Defence</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Control of Naval Waters Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1990 No.206, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 23 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that these Statutory Rules, among other things, methodically remove a number of strict liability offences from the principal Regulations, which were last amended in 1976. This is a helpful development which removes from those principal Regulations provisions which are not in accordance with contemporary standards of personal liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted, however, that the Statutory Rules provide, in new r.5, that the Superintendent of Naval Waters may cause to be removed from those waters persons who ``have contravened these regulations''. Your advice would be appreciated as to whether this power is intended only to remove persons who have already been convicted of contravening the Regulations. If this is not so intended, then the Regulations should be amended to clarify the position. Until an offence has been proved by conviction in a court then there is no certainty that the Regulations have been offended. The superintendent is not the final judge of whether an offence has, or has not, occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that the wording s.4 (k) of the parent Control of Naval Waters Act 1918, as amended by the Control of Naval Waters Amendment Act 1978, is in the same general terms as the present Statutory Rules. In this context the Committee points out that contemporary standards of personal liberties dictate that whether or not a person is guilty of an offence is determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction, not by an opinion formed by a public official. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Senate Standing Committee on</PARA>
<PARA>Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 10 September 1990 to Senator Ray that queried the intended scope of regulation 5 of the Control of Naval Waters Regulations (which was inserted by Statutory Rules 1990 No. 206). </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that it is the role of a court, rather than a public official, to determine whether a person is guilty of an offence and it was not intended to override this principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim was that regulation 5 should apply where persons are in apparent contravention of the provisions of the Regulations (which, for example, restrict entry into naval waters). You will appreciate that such a provision enabling prompt action is necessary for public safety and operational reasons, and is a matter that is separate and distinct from any question of criminal liability. Exercise of the power could not await prosecution and conviction of the person concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I agree with your Committee's view that the provision should be clarified. Bearing in mind the purpose of the Regulations, I suggest a suitable approach would be an amendment of regulation 5 to ensure that the power of removal from naval waters or the foreshore of those waters is explicitly tied to situations where persons are in contravention of a notice under the Regulations. On this basis, a person would be apprised of the specific requirement and have the opportunity of compliance before the power of removal was exercised. This would not involve a judgement as to whether an offence has occurred. I would appreciate your Committee's views on this approach. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) amends several Acts within the Industrial Relations portfolio and also makes an amendment to that part of the Defence Act 1903 which is administered by the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum and many are of a merely technical nature. I will confine my comments to a number of the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Defence Act 1903</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Defence Act to reduce from five years to one year the period during which a former member of the Defence Force is excluded from being a member of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. The Bill also replaces the existing provision for a fixed term of appointment of five years for members with a provision which establishes that period as a maximum term. As a result, shorter periods of appointment will be possible in appropriate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will extend the range of people who are eligible for appointment to ensure that a wider range of candidates with relevant skills and expertise are available to serve on the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Industrial Relations Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A number of amendments are proposed to be made to the Industrial Relations Act to improve its operation, particularly in the area of award observance. </PARA>
<PARA> Although most employers, especially those who are properly informed about their award obligations through membership of an effective employer association, observe awards, breaches are too common. In the past financial year, inspectors appointed under the Act detected over 20,000 breaches. About 17,500 of these were monetary breaches. Over four million dollars was recovered. Most breaches are voluntarily rectified, but regrettably, legal action is frequently required. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are being proposed which will assist in securing the observance of awards in the interests of employers, workers and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> This is to be achieved by:</PARA>
<PARA>* establishing means to supplement for short periods the number of inspectors who secure award observance;</PARA>
<PARA>* providing for action to be taken under the Act to bring about the observance of award provisions requiring the payment of superannuation contributions on behalf of employees;</PARA>
<PARA>* widening the range of persons who may bring proceedings relating to the non-observance of award obligations; and</PARA>
<PARA>* ensuring better employment records are kept. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Act, inspectors have a primary role in securing the observance of awards made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. At present, only persons employed or appointed under the Public Service Act 1922 may be inspectors. It is proposed to permit the appointment of other persons for a fixed term and with such of an inspector's powers as may be specified. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will permit short-term peak workloads to be met more satisfactorily. In addition, it will enable persons with specialised qualifications to be appointed for particular tasks, for example, where highly technical areas of work are involved. Those persons will, of course, be obliged to exercise their powers in good faith and with the same integrity as permanent inspectors under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> An area of particular concern relates to the observance of awards which require the payment by employers of contributions to superannuation funds for the benefit of their employees. Since it was held by the High Court in 1986 that such provisions could be included in federal awards, there has been a spectacular increase in the extent to which workers enjoy such benefits. Indeed, it is estimated that over 50 per cent of workers have some form of superannuation cover and 80 per cent of workers covered by federal or State awards are in that position. </PARA>
<PARA> Occupational superannuation is a key element in the Government's retirement and incomes policy. Greater use of superannuation is being actively encouraged to achieve higher living standards for people who have retired. It is clear that the most important means for accelerating the spread of superannuation in recent years has been through awards. </PARA>
<PARA> All the available evidence including data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggests that a substantial minority of employers are not meeting their obligations in this area. In some cases, this may be a result of ignorance. The Government has developed, in consultation with the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, a national strategy to deal with the problem, including educative and information components and appropriate award inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases, legal proceedings under the Act may be necessary. A difficulty has arisen, however, in relation to the enforcement of award provisions requiring the payment by an employer of an amount on behalf of employees to a superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Act, where an award requires an employer to make a payment to an employee, the court may order the payment to be made. This does not, however, apply to a contribution required to be paid by an employer on behalf of an employee to a superannuation fund, rather than to the employee concerned. An amendment is proposed so that where such superannuation contributions have not been paid, payments may be ordered by the court to rectify the failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also to be made for the court to be able to order the payment of an amount equivalent to any return foregone as a result of the non-payment of the contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> In consultations over the Bill, the Confederation of Australian Industry has not agreed that a court should be able to order the payment of any amount in addition to unpaid superannuation contributions in a proceeding to rectify their non-payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that it would be unfair to exclude the possibility of complete restitution. Indeed, the minority of employers who deliberately refuse to meet their obligations could merely be encouraged to avoid making contributions when they are due. It should also be noted that it will be for a court to decide what amounts should be paid where a failure to make the required payments has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reform is proposed to the provisions of the Act under which penalties may be imposed for award breaches and under which employees may recover amounts due to them. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, because of the wording of the Act, an employee who is not a member of a federally registered union does not have access to the provisions of sections 178 and 179 which permit a court to order the payment of amounts due under an award. Yet in many ways the non-unionised work force is more vulnerable to award breaches. It is unacceptable for an employer to be able to evade proceedings under the Act which would compel compliance with award obligations simply because a worker does not belong to a union. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is proposed to revise the wording of the relevant provisions to allow workers who do not belong to a union to use the more practical and convenient remedies under the Act to recover amounts owing to them under awards. </PARA>
<PARA> An important amendment proposed in the Bill will permit regulations to be made under the Industrial Relations Act requiring employers to keep time and wages records relating to employees. The regulations will also provide penalties for failing to keep such records. </PARA>
<PARA> There is currently no provision in the Act which requires an employer to have such records. At present, a minority of federal awards require time and wages records to be kept. The award clauses vary considerably in style and content and no standard prescription has been established. This leaves an inadequate situation which has caused difficulties in the identification and correction of award breaches. The Act permits proceedings to be brought within 6 years of the occurrence of a breach. The absence of proper records can cause substantial difficulties for both employers and employees in establishing the true position. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision will also be made to clarify the capacity of courts to award interest on amounts due under awards to employees which are recovered under the Act. At present, the availability and amount of interest depends on whether an action is brought in the Federal Court or a lower State or Territory court. A uniform rate of interest will apply to amounts for which judgment is entered but which have not been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Australian Industry has also expressed concerns about interest being ordered to be paid in these matters. While the CAI accepts the clarification of powers of courts in this area, it does not support any extension of those powers. At present there is some doubt about the capacity of some courts to order interest on amounts due before judgment is entered for those amounts under section 178. </PARA>
<PARA> The same problems do not apply to proceedings under section 179 for amounts owing to employees. It would be anomalous for the availability of interest to depend merely on the nature of the proceedings even though exactly the same failure to pay can give rise to proceedings under sections 178 and 179 and, in either case, an order can be made for payment. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be remembered that the awarding of interest on amounts owing before judgment is entered will be discretionary and that, in proceedings under the Act, costs are not normally available. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Industrial Relations</PARA>
<PARA>(Consequential Provisions) Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A new provision is proposed for inclusion in the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act. It concerns the application of the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to a Presidential Member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. A Presidential Member has the status of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and thereby comes within the Judges' Pensions Act unless, before appointment, that person was eligible for benefits under the Superannuation Act 1976. Such a person may, however, elect to forgo those benefits and to come within the operation of the Judges' Pensions Act instead.</PARA>
<PARA> No provision has been made, however, for such a Presidential Member's prior service as a Presidential Member of the former Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to be taken into account in determining whether such a person qualifies for a judicial pension under the Judges' Pensions Act. The proposed amendment so provides. The time in which such an election may be made is stipulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made to prevent a person who has made such an election from continuing to have entitlements under the Superannuation Act as well as under the Judges' Pensions Act. The amendment does not affect other persons who have been or may be appointed as Presidential Members. Their right to make an election of this type, where necessary, is provided for under the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments affecting Australian Federal</PARA>
<PARA>Police Staff</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, consequential on the commencement of certain provisions of the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1989. That Act created new employment arrangements for staff members of the AFP, bringing them into line with uniformed AFP members and replacing the previous Public Service Act arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are of a consequential nature to reflect the new staffing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Remuneration and</PARA>
<PARA>Allowances Act 1990</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 8 of the Bill removes A.C.T. Magistrates from the scope of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990. That Act currently sets salaries for A.C.T. Magistrates and provides that they be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The A.C.T. Administration will now be responsible for funding salaries of A.C.T. Magistrates and can refer the determination of their salaries direct to the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the States Grants</PARA>
<PARA>(Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to this Act are mainly of a drafting or machinery nature. The principal amendments will allow the Commonwealth to make certain advances to the States and to recover its administration costs in relation to the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Scheme. A preliminary estimate of the Commonwealth's administration costs is about $250,000 per annum. All States which are parties to the Scheme are able to recover their own administration costs and have agreed to the provision. </PARA>
<PARA>Consultation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU and the CAI have been consulted over the Bill, with detailed discussions over the award observance amendments proposed to the Industrial Relations Act taking place through the National Labour Consultative Council. Apart from the CAI's concerns which I have already mentioned, the proposed amendments are generally accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill are not expected to have a significant financial impact on the Commonwealth. The amendment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 will allow formal transfer of responsibility for A.C.T. Magistrates salaries to the Territory. The amendment of the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 will facilitate cost recovery by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

I was advised that probably the Opposition was not interested in utilising its General Business time today, but that it was content to have the Senate address only the papers. That advice was given to me only about half an hour ago. I suppose it would have been appropriate for me at that stage to race around to get some understanding between the Opposition and the Democrats that perhaps one of my General Business notices should come on.

<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON DEVELOPMENT OF THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE TABLING STATEMENT BY COMMITTEE CHAIR SENATOR JOHN COATES</PARA>
<PARA>The report I have just tabled represents the outcome of more than 12 months work by the Committee and is the result of one of the larger inquiries undertaken by the Committee in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The SES was established late in 1984 with specific objectives in view. It seemed desirable to evaluate the extent to which those objectives had been achieved after five years. The Committee was also aware that there have been large changes in departmental structures and senior staffing arrangements since 1984. The effect of these changes on the SES and its morale seemed worthy of review. In addition, there have been reports of significant disquiet in the United States at the effects of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act in that country which is thought by some to have been a partial model for the Australian SES. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee found that many of the specific objectives of the SES had not been fully met. In particular, this applied to measures concerned with career planning, staff mobility and personnel management in general. The Committee noted that creation of the SES was only one of many managerial changes in the public service during the 1980s. The effect of some of the other changes worked against many of the specific features originally proposed for the SES. </PARA>
<PARA>The main effect of the changes of the 1980s on senior public servants has been a substantial increase in the power of department secretaries over SES officers (5.7). There is considerable discussion in the report of the implications of that shift in power. The Committee concluded that some central restraints on the powers of department secretaries are justified by more than just the need to protect individual public servants. Although the arguments for increased autonomy of department secretaries have been advanced on efficiency grounds and based on an analogy with the private sector, the Committee was sceptical of many of the efficiency arguments and ruled out any simple analogy between private sector and public service management (5.34). </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry came soon after a period of turmoil in the upper levels of the Australian Public Service. The Committee found that only about half the members of the SES as at January 1990 had been members when the Service was established five years earlier. Between 15 and 20 per cent of the foundation members of the SES were soon displaced from their positions and the majority of those officers subsequently accepted voluntary redundancy packages and left the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the pace of change over the period, it is not surprising that the Committee heard claims of low morale in the senior public service. Morale is a notoriously difficult quality to measure and the Committee attempted no substantive assessment of the general level of morale in the SES. However, we did conclude that the retrenchment of senior staff should not continue at the pace of the past three years. There is no indication that the general standard of SES members is low. The evidence before the Committee was strongly the other way (5.36). </PARA>
<PARA>As to the third broad area of concern, the consensus of evidence before the Committee was that, while there may be a``quiet crisis'' in the US Civil Service, the situation is not so bad in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The report deals in some detail with the issues of mobility, tenure, selection, relationships between Canberra and regional offices, remuneration and training and development. Its review of these issues led the Committee to conclude that there is a need for better personnel management and policy development in the Australian Public Service. The Committee's conclusion in this regard reflects what is clearly an emerging consensus across the public service (10.23) and the Committee acknowledges recent official initiatives in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The report contains 37 recommendations for improvement. The Committee believes that the improvements it seeks will require a modest increase in central leadership and coordination in the personnel field. </PARA>
<PARA>The Public Service Commission is the obvious location for such a function. Many of the Committee's recommendations would involve increased activity by the Commissioner and, to the extent that they would require increased resources, those resources should be provided to the Commissioner. The Committee stresses in the report that its conclusions on deficiencies in personnel management should not be taken to be criticism of the Public Service Commissioner. Given the devolutionary thrust of recent public service management changes, the limited resources available to the Commissioner and the pressure of events since his office was created, it would be most unfair to criticise the Commissioner or his staff for the deficiencies that the Committee has identified (10.29). </PARA>
<PARA>The detailed recommendations fall into three groups. One group of recommendations is designed to improve accountability for personnel management. The Committee believes that department secretaries should be held accountable for the way in which they manage the people in their organisations as they are for the public monies they expend. Accountability requires public disclosure of performance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has recommended the collection and publication of basic statistical information on SES staff mobility trends, the comparative performance of department secretaries in retention of their senior staff, the extent of senior staff interchanges between public and private sectors, and the operation of the SES recruitment system. The Committee sees all this as basic accountability information, much of which would be useful for management purposes as well. </PARA>
<PARA>A second group of recommendations recognises the scope for common service provision in the personnel area. The Committee believes that some functions, such as training and recruitment, are suited to a degree of centralisation. This is desirable because of the economies available through specialisation but also and more importantly because individual agencies left to themselves may provide less effective services in this area than is in the interest of the service as a whole (10.34). </PARA>
<PARA>Among other things, the Committee recommends in this regard that the Public Service Commissioner experiment with executive search techniques and with the concept of team recruitment as well seeking to increase the opportunities for staff interchanges with state public services and access by SES staff to postgraduate study. </PARA>
<PARA>A third group of recommendations aims to encourage leadership and a degree of entrepreneurship in personnel policy development and implementation. The example provided by the Department of Finance in broader management reform is instructive. A similar approach will be necessary in the personnel field if the deficiencies in APS personnel management are to be confronted and corrected and the Committee believes that the Public Service Commissioner should fulfil this role. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's recommendations involve, for example, the Public Service Commissioner operating an SES temporary assignment pool, reviewing decisions by department secretaries to `spill' SES positions in their departments and nominating additional officers for consideration for particular vacancies when he considers that such action would advance the mobility objectives of the SES. The Committee also recommends that the Public Service Commissioner review and publicly report on such matters as the operation of the interchange and executive development schemes and performance based pay (if the last is introduced). </PARA>
<PARA>None of this requires the restoration of the former Public Service Board. Few of the Committee's recommendations involve increasing central controls or centralising responsibility for major personnel management functions. The abolition of the Board in 1987 represented a large step away from centralisation of control and of personnel management. Three years later, the Committee is recommending fine tuning of the new system, not a reversion to the old. </PARA>
<PARA>I should note in closing that the hearings on which this report was based were completed in the last Parliament and that Senators Alston, Calvert and Durack were able, with the agreement of their party, to continue as members of the Committee in this Parliament until the report was completed. This ensured a considerable degree of continuity of committee membership over the period of the inquiry and avoided the prospect of serious delay in completing the inquiry. I would like to thank the Senators I have already named as well as Senators Burns, Loosley and Walsh and former Senator Black for their efforts during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee Secretary, Peter Hamburger, carried prime staff responsibility for the inquiry while Barbara Allan, Glenice Castles, Steve Curran, Carol Fagan, Michael Game and Krys Turnsek all assisted with aspects of the project. Di Morrison and Michelle Ricketts of the Senate Publications Unit undertook the large task of typesetting the report. On behalf of the Committee, I thank all these officers and also thank the officers of the Public Service Commission, the Department of Finance and other departments and public service agencies who provided written submissions, gave oral evidence at five days of hearings and subsequently responded promptly and graciously to numerous requests for information. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this report usefully documents the development and current state of an important component of the Australian Public Service. This inquiry has helped to confirm me in my opinion that the Australian people generally can be proud of their public service. To the extent that the Committee has proposed improvements, its recommendations should be read as seeking finetuning rather than wholesale change. </PARA>

<PARA> That, on a Thursday to which the hours of meeting for a Thursday of Week 2 apply, the Senate meet from 10 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion would have us meet from 8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. on every second Thursday. Currently we get up at 6.30 p.m. It is introduced not so much to extend time for Government Business, but because of one of the problems that I have perceived in this chamber which has been the inhibition on the part of the Government to bring forward ministerial statements. Because of the sometimes almost undisciplined approach-and I do not criticise anyone for this-there is always a great reluctance on the part of Government, especially in the business committee of Cabinet, to give approval for ministerial statements, knowing that they may well run out and grossly inhibit the time that is normally given to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been looking for some time for a solution to this problem. I believe that if we inserted most ministerial statements in this chamber on a Thursday afternoon, we would have extra time to consider them. We could then have more statements, especially in areas such as foreign affairs, defence and the economy, than we have had in the past. I must say, I am sick of blocking Ministers from making statements on the basis that it will delay the legislative program too much. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular measure is one of those rare ones that, I think, one introduces to the procedures that has advantages for the Government, the Opposition, independent senators and others. The advantage to Government is that many Ministers like to put down a statement in this Parliament rather than by way of press release or some other method. The advantage to the Opposition is that it gets to debate the statements in this chamber. There is a cautionary note for all of us in this: if the Opposition and the rest of the senators decide they want to a five-hour debate on a ministerial statements, they will cut into their own time in terms of private business. It is one of those well-devised Mexican stand-offs in which we all benefit, but in which there is a little bit of punishment all round to make sure it is not done to excess. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like extending sitting hours for honourable senators, but I point out that one of the reasons for the 6.30 p.m. finish was that we used to have a full day starting at 9.00 the next morning. That will be true of some honourable senators-hopefully not every Friday from now on-depending on which committee they are on. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this motion has much to commend it. There are no hidden agendas in it. I hope to see, especially at the start of the next parliamentary sittings in the autumn, more ministerial statements. They will not always come in on a Thursday because I cannot drive the House of Representatives agenda in that way, but certainly all the statements by Senate Ministers will be made on Thursday afternoons, and I will be encouraging my House of Representatives colleagues to replicate that. Obviously, if a very urgent statement comes in the House of Representatives we will not be restricted just to Thursday to discuss it. If it is urgent and important we will have to discuss it outside the Thursday time zone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Government's indication that we might anticipate more ministerial statements. I have been critical of the fact that in the area in which I have responsibility-foreign affairs-in the years that Senator Evans has been Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade there has been only one ministerial statement in this place, and that was in relation to regional security. I think that is highly disappointing. It is very frustrating on important matters. I can remember he introduced what the Government certainly claimed to be an important new relationship with the Pacific, which, I think, it called constructive commitment, and a new relationship with south east Asia, which it called constructive engagement, through lectures to the press in Sydney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express the Opposition's position in this debate and the reasoning that has guided our attitudes to these particular regulations which Senator Spindler is moving to disallow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My first observation is critical of the Government. Its whole handling of the dispute between the pilots and the domestic airlines last year was atrocious. The Opposition had a great deal to say in the Parliament at the time about the bungling way in which the Government handled the matter, and the massive damage done to Australia's transport and tourism industries. I do not need to go over all the details of the criticism which the Government then deserved, and still now deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> My second observation is to note the bungling incompetence of this Government in its handling of immigration policy and legislation in the last 12 months. An enormous amount of confusion has been caused through poor drafting and administration of the regulations made under the new Immigration Act. It is little wonder that there have subsequently been so many extra changes to the regulations in recent months to try to correct errors that have emerged. The regulations we are debating today are part of a larger set of regulations which the Government needed to introduce to cover its errors and its mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I deplore the secrecy with which the Government surrounded the making of these regulations, as the Government did not do anything to make known to the community that these particular regulations affecting foreign pilots had been made. They were approved on 11 July and gazetted on 12 July, but it was only after a number of weeks had passed that their existence became known. With a highly sensitive and controversial matter like this that is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> My fourth observation is to underline the Opposition's concern that the Government made these regulations in July with the deliberate intention of trying to chop off the legal challenge being mounted to its action in allowing the foreign pilots to enter Australia under previous regulations. The Opposition believes in the rule of law in this country, but clearly this Government only believes in it when it suits the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federation of Air Pilots was in the process of testing the Government's actions in the Federal Court and an injunction had been granted on 31 May by the court, because there was a question to be tried as to whether the Government had acted in accordance with the Immigration Act. Yet the Government was obviously fearful of the outcome and fearful that it risked being found out as having acted contrary to law. It has therefore by this deliberate executive action interfered with the normal course of consideration of the matter by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to these four direct criticisms of the Government. All these factors are of concern to the Senate and they reflect no credit at all on the Government. Those factors on their own, of course, are not enough to give grounds for disallowing the regulations. Rather, the Senate needs to consider as a practical matter what the actual effects would be of approving this disallowance motion and making its judgment on that basis. It has to be said that at the end of the whole process, whether handled by the Government in legitimate ways or by the steps that it has in fact taken, the Government is in a position one way or another to achieve its policy of approving these foreign pilots remaining in Australia, and this is the pivotal point to make about the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The pivotal point is this-and it is the foundation of the Opposition's position-that the Government does have the policy initiative and the legislative or regulatory means one way or another to eventually achieve its intention for the foreign pilots to enter and remain in Australia. Even if all the possible court actions were undertaken and the Government only then sought by legislation, even new legislation, to regularise the position of the foreign pilots, the Opposition would not resist such legislation. In short, disallowing these regulations today would not in the end alter the outcome. There is therefore no good purpose to be served in supporting the disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Disallowance would not affect any approvals already given under these regulations, and there is no dispute about that, even if indeed there had been any approvals already given under these regulations. I understand that since 12 July 1990 and up to noon on 10 October 1990 a total of 94 foreign pilots plus their dependants had lodged applications for a class 439 pilot extended eligibility temporary entry permit. A further five pilots were also expected to lodge applications. The Department has not yet processed any of these applications. As a result, none-not one of the pilots-has been granted a temporary entry permit. None of the pilots has therefore been eligible to apply for the class 811 pilot permanent entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, on 28 September of this year, the Federal Court varied the then standing injunction on the entry of foreign pilots from overseas. This variation of the injunction has allowed two pilots who were processed for permanent entry at the beginning of 1990 to enter Australia. So disallowance makes no difference to the standing of any of these applications. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, all those pilots who have made application before the date of disallowance cannot be affected, at least in the traditional view of the law on this point, a view which I understand is held by the Government. I am aware that there is a contrary view also being argued about this, but I do not want to take the time of the Senate with a lengthy discourse on the interpretation of section 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act. Section 50 makes it clear that repeal-which by section 48(6) includes disallowance-of any regulation at all made under any Act shall not affect any right, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any regulation so repealed. Any departure from what I call the traditional interpretation of that section-and it is the traditional interpretation which I have summarised and which I believe to be the view of the Government and it is the view also of the Opposition-would have very wide implications for all law, for all regulations, far beyond this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> There are wide areas of immigration law where, with the changes that took effect last 19 December, applications previously made but not at that date processed are to receive consideration on the basis of the law as it has been to now interpreted. I would contend that to abandon the traditional view on this point-and of course it is not for us to abandon it, it is for a court to determine-would produce many outcomes that would be inequitable and undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also that these regulations are not retrospective, at least not in the narrow or strict sense of the word. That is, legally they are not retrospective. They simply are in effect from July and applications are made subsequent to their coming into force. Thus the new regulations may not technically prevent the seeking of judicial review of the use of the employer nomination scheme to sponsor the pilots, but they make it pointless to do so. In that wider sense they may be thought to have a retrospective effect on the consequences of past actions, but in the narrower sense they are not retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is currently seeking to mount some form of legal challenge to the new regulations. They are of course perfectly entitled to make those attempts in the courts and that can proceed if the Senate chooses not to disallow these regulations. In fact the courts, if the Federation's argument is accepted, are in a better position to give a remedy than is the Parliament. If disallowance were successful it would only open up a new course of action for the Federation, it would not reinstate the position to that which applied before the new regulations were agreed to. In summary, the Opposition does not believe that disallowing these regulations would have any practical effects in the long run, and therefore we do not support this disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to the speech by Senator Teague on behalf of the Opposition. It was a well-constructed, erudite examination of the question at hand. However, I consider that the latter observation that was made by Senator Teague needs to be analysed very briefly. What Senator Teague was saying was that the courts are in a better position than the Parliament to deal with the question which is of concern to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, in that if this disallowance motion is carried-the new regulations concerning which the Federation has some legal action on foot-well then obviously that legal action would be useless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that the purpose of the Federation in taking that legal action is for that very reason, to render the regulations void. They are either rendered void by that action before the court or they are rendered void by the disallowance by this chamber. I am carrying no can at all for the Federation. I believe the Federation, in its activities, went beyond the pale in the dispute, but that is not the issue here. As I see it, the issue here is whether the courts are to be regarded as the sole protector of the rights of individuals or whether the Senate, which has always been regarded as the protector of individual rights as well as, theoretically, of State rights, should be able to play its part and should exercise that function adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have a responsibility to scrutinise and to audit executive government decisions. What we have here is an executive government decision taken to undermine the rights of individuals when it was seen by the Executive Government that those individuals may have succeeded in the courts. To my way of thinking, as Senator Teague has said, that was not an appropriate action for the Federal Government to take and that is agreed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to support this disallowance motion and I hope that it will be carried because then the issue itself may come before the Parliament in the proper way by way of legislation if the Government so chooses. It will be then that the issues can be canvassed and a decision made at that time on the basis of the second reading speech of the Minister, the responses of the Opposition and of other senators, the Democrats and Independent senators, and indeed the ability of the House of Representatives to consider the issue in its proper form. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that that is the correct course to follow. I will not go into the merits or otherwise of the issue itself and whether or not there should be foreign pilots in this country at this time. That is not the issue at the present time. The issue is whether the Government acted correctly in bringing in new regulations when it could see that the previous regulations would not have held up before the court challenge. That is the issue. It is my view that, in considering that issue, we should support the motion that has been moved by Senator Spindler for the disallowance of these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> After that has occurred, the Government may wish to bring legislation into the House of Representatives and into the Senate. It will then be available for members of both Houses of Parliament to give mature consideration to the issues surrounding the introduction of that legislation and vote accordingly. I am not prepared to forecast at this stage whether I would vote in favour of such legislation or not. What I am certainly prepared to do right here and now is to vote for the disallowance of the regulations because I do not think that the Government acted properly in bringing in the new regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding on behalf of the Government, let me say that although disagreeing with the first part of Senator Teague's speech, which of course was political and he has the right to make those comments, I commend him for the second part where I think he quite lucidly put out the situation at law in respect of the effect of what Senator Spindler is attempting to do this morning. The reality is that, no matter what we do this morning, the rights of those individuals that are sought to be affected by the move of the Democrats will not be affected. I believe Senator Teague put it quite well when he referred to section 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act. My advice also from the Attorney-General's Department confirms the point that was put quite forcibly by Senator Teague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Harradine has said, we are not here to relive old wars, to canvass the rights and wrongs of the airline dispute. What we really have to tackle today is the precise issue that is raised by the move for disallowance, and that is the effect that that would have on the rights of the applicants and the rights of the individuals involved. This is a useless exercise. I do not know why Senator Spindler has fallen for it. I do not know why he is pursuing it because no matter what the rhetoric, no matter how much time we take this morning, the reality is that the rights conferred by such regulations will still accrue to those individuals involved. Without taking up the time of the Senate much longer, I repeat that this is a useless exercise, one born out of the politics of a year ago, one born out of an exercise which this country would do best to forget, and one I cannot understand the utility of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-When I first raised the issue and gave notice of this motion of disallowance, I stated quite clearly that I did not intend to canvass the merits or otherwise of the pilots strike but that we were dealing with the issue of separating the judicial system from executive government and from the legislative system. I believe that principle still stands. Senator Teague has paid lip service to that principle and I regret that the Opposition is not prepared to fulfil the words it is using by actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact remains that the Executive Government has intervened in a court case which, to put it bluntly, was going against the Government. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) had obtained an injunction on this basis:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Keely said the AFAP had a real case to answer. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation the Government decided that it had better make sure that it could impose its will on individuals who challenged the legality of Government action. The Government proceeded to do so and now that the Opposition has decided to cave in on that principle, it will be able to continue to do so. Stripped of all the legalese, the arguments that Senator Teague has brought forward simply mean that the Opposition is prepared in practice to give the executive government that right. It seems to me that once again the Opposition has given up its responsibility as the Opposition in this House, the house of review. I thank Senator Harradine for his support and for the clear argument on the principles of this situation that he has enunciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I suspect that when we look at the practical effects-and there are some because it is admitted, I believe, that those pilots who have not yet been granted permits to stay under the new regulations would still be affected by a disallowance-we see from the evidence on the table that several hundred pilots have not gone through that process. There would be some pilots who would have to go back to the Government's original legislative basis, which would ultimately be judged by the court, as indeed some of them still will on the basis of the case brought by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. To the extent that several hundred pilots would be taken out of the job market, it would appear to me that several hundred Australian pilots would be in a position to achieve jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a Labor Government imposing its will to allow in a strike situation for the importation of scabs to break a strike. Once again I do not advert to the merits or demerits of the strike; I simply recite the facts. Also, we have a situation in which the Opposition, perhaps anticipating that at some time in the future it will be in government, wants to preserve unto itself a precedent which allows it to import scabs to break strikes. Whatever the Opposition's motivations, it seems to me that it is a sad day for the Senate when we have the two parties agreeing that it is satisfactory for the executive government to intervene in the judicial process and to take away the rights of individuals in that process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated to the Senate yesterday, our principle concern about this unnecessary system of accreditation is the cost element and the absolute disregard that the proposed trojan horse will have for the rights of consumers. In other words, it is a measure driven by those who are much more concerned with the rights and entitlements of people working in the industry. It is disappointing in the extreme that the relevant Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, has been so unforthcoming when various opportunities have been provided to him to explain the nature and extent of these proposals. One could say that his desire to expand his empire makes the Taj Mahal look like a backyard tent. It is quite clear that the Minister is proposing with these regulations to open up a new industry which will agonise, no doubt at great length, over what is meant by quality control and what ought to be regarded as quality standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pointed out yesterday the hypocrisy of arguing on the one hand that there was great community support for an accreditation system and in the same breath urging the necessity for a strong community education component of the system to enable substantial community input to the accreditation process. It is quite clear that this is the product of vested interests who have very little regard for cost factors. </PARA>
<PARA> To call it an industry based voluntary accreditation system is pure casuistry because we know from reading the committee's report further that it has decided to recommend that a relationship be established between the proposed accreditation system and conditions for fee relief. It is perfectly clear that people will not get fee relief unless they comply with a set of open-ended requirements which can be amended endlessly under this carte blanche legislation that the Government has introduced. That is why we are very concerned to see strict limits placed on any guidelines that might be introduced and a requirement that the Minister adhere to those guidelines. Further referring to this biased committee report, it stressed that introduction of accreditation for centres should be seen as a forerunner to the introduction of accreditation across the range of children's services. Yet more empire building without any explanation or justification for such a need.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Minister owes the Australian public a much fuller and franker explanation than we have had to date. All that we have had is a secret analysis by a one-sided committee pushing its own agenda but a Minister utterly reluctant to come into the open and to explain the need for this ideological nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> After talking about the need for a voluntary process and the effectiveness of accreditation in improving quality in the long term-this is probably the high-water mark of this ridiculous approach being adopted-the report goes on to say that these factors are best addressed by the industry itself with assessment by early childhood education professionals. They are the people who have a vested interest in this exercise. They are the ones who will push endlessly to jack up the standards to a point where anything other than community based, non-commercial, services will be unaffordable. I find that hypocritical in the extreme. It is yet another example of this elitist view that somehow child-care is too important to be left to parents. </PARA>
<PARA> We fundamentally disagree with that proposition. We think the whole system should be driven by the needs and concerns of parents. They are the ones who ought to monitor child-care centres. I have no doubt that every mother in the country is particularly concerned to know whether her children are being properly cared for in a child-care centre. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that the only ones who have expertise to make those judgments are early childhood education professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators read some of the literature, especially from the United States, they will find that it is almost impossible to demonstrate the different outcomes that derive from different levels of child-care treatment. I think that the onus is very much on those who argue the need for this whole range of quality control and quality improvement to demonstrate that somehow there will be any better result at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the standard will vary from child-care centre to child-care centre, depending upon the attitude, the initiative and the commitment of those in charge. We simply cannot legislate for standard quality in that area any more than we can regulate student attitudes in class. It is a futile process but it is not just an ideological binge on the part of some when it will have very significant cost impacts. That is our primary concern about all this nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore want to stress to the Senate that we entirely reject that report. We understand that the final report to the Minister (Mr Staples) will involve calls for child-care centres not only to comply with State licensing and regulation, which we do not have a problem with, or to comply with accounting and audit systems but also will establish a quality assurance committee within the centre, composed of parents, staff and other interested community members-a classic trade union approach and again, hypocritical, because this loaded industry committee had no representatives of parents in the first instance. This will simply be yet another way of adding to the career structures and the staffing arrangements which will add to the cost burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know why effective staff developments, which are mentioned in the report, are not in place now. I would have thought that those matters could very easily be dealt with at State level. The report makes recommendations to document and implement a program of appropriate developmental activities across all age groups, to regularly hold staff meetings of which minutes are to be kept and made available for inspection, to adopt or develop an appropriate philosophy, to register with State quality assurance bodies and to implement the above points by 1 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, this is an absolute field day for all those in the industry who see this as the next gravy train. There is no concern at all for parents or the burden they will have to bear in increased costs. I could do little better than refer to the Sydney Morning Herald editorial of 10 October 1990 which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The Government must ensure that its historic decision to extend the availability of child-care is not undermined by those who consider private centres ideologically unsound, or who put the interests of child-care workers above the interests of parents. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very serious issue. We do not for one moment want to see any reduction in standards but we believe that the proper and appropriate place for these standards to be monitored is in the home by those who have the greatest interest-not the 9 to 5 bureaucrats who stand to make money out of the system but those whose welfare is of paramount concern: the parents of the children. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why what Senator Walsh said to that Sydney meeting recently was such great commonsense. Senator Walsh even claimed that in Queensland-and probably in other States but to a lesser degree-the Department of Community Services and Health was deliberately locating children's services program centres close to commercial centres with the unstated intention of putting the commercial centres out of business. I do not discount that for one moment. The way in which that Department has tried to get control of the whole process by requiring income testing to be carried out by the Department of Social Security and having the payments made by another department is the high-water mark of unnecessary duplication from a department which for many years has opposed any extension of fee relief to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard it as a very unhealthy involvement, apart from a flat contradiction of all the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) professes to be concerned about in the lead up to the special Premiers' Conference. The sooner that Department can be weaned off this unnecessary bureaucratic expansion the better. I do not think one can do much better than to refer to Peter Walsh's article of 4 September in the Australian Financial Review to demonstrate the length to which some people seem to be prepared to go to turn the debate on its head. </PARA>
<PARA> We remain firmly committed to parents having high quality child-care service. But we also think that their interests ought to be paramount and that cost factors ought to be very much at the top of the list rather than completely ignored, as they have been to date by the Minister and the loaded advisory committee that he established in secret. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In replying to the second reading debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, I thank those honourable senators who have contributed. I remind honourable senators that, in fact, there are three main parts to this Bill, which attempts to achieve several objectives. I am glad for the support, with modifications, that has been indicated from around the chamber in relation to at least the first two parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that it is the Government's intention that non-residents of Australia, whether they be Australian citizens residing abroad or long term visitors from overseas, should not have access to Medicare eligibility. The Government believes that only persons who actually legally reside in Australia should have Medicare entitlements. I believe that that policy would be well supported in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that the Government has decided to discontinue the payment of Medicare benefits for medical treatment received overseas. This will, of course, require Australians travelling overseas to look to their insurance cover. But I believe that this amendment will also be generally understood in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, as I say, it is certainly the intention of the Government-this is manifested in this Bill and, I believe, supported on all sides of the chamber-that only those legally resident in Australia should be entitled to share in the benefits of the Medicare scheme, which is supported by the taxpayers of Australia by way of a special levy and in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill gives effect to some of the structural reform being undertaken in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in that the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority is to be established. This is one of the key elements to come out of the very long process of consultation and even confrontation between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The restructuring of the retail pharmacy industry has been a painful process. I believe that the various measures which will be under the auspices of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority to assist that process of reconstruction will ameliorate and alleviate some of the hardship which market forces alone would have wreaked on many pharmacies carrying on business in situations where there is a conglomeration of retail pharmacies in very close proximity to one another. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time and at the other end of the extreme, the Authority will have a special duty to ensure that persons who live in isolated areas of Australia have reasonably ready access to a pharmacy. To that extent, special provision will be made to ensure that pharmacies are available to dispense pharmaceuticals in a way that makes them accessible to people in rural and provincial Australia. I believe that that is also very important. But there is no doubt that the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority is going to have a very key role to play. I believe that it is a very sensible arrangement and a very good result from the long period of consultation that took place. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards child-care, I think the Government has to take note of the underlying sentiment of some of the contributions that have been made today. I for one certainly believe that any system of child-care which has as its primary focus the enhancement of the opportunities for work of those who take care of the children in those centres is not properly focused. I believe that the Government is very conscious of the need to keep in mind always that the welfare of the children committed to the care of the various centres around Australia is the absolute primary responsibility of those involved in childcare, whether it be non-profit, commercial or however it is organised. </PARA>
<PARA> Many thousands of Australians are involved in the provision of child-care. The large majority of those would be extremely dedicated people who take a great deal of pleasure, quite apart from professional satisfaction, in standing in for parents in relation to the care of children during the course of the day because of the need for a parent to undertake employment or engage in other activities of a social or community kind. Enabling children to be placed in this sort of care allows the parent concerned to have freedom to engage in activities in the community which would otherwise be more difficult, if undertaken at all. If the child-care were not available, parents might feel that they would be trapped at home. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a salutary warning to give, but I do not believe that the Government's proposals are in any way motivated or designed to achieve a simple increase in the role of child-care supervisors. Rather, they are designed to ensure that the very proud record of this Government in the provision of child-care continues so that we have one of the very best integrated systems available in the world, going from non-profit community-based centres through to the more commercially-based sector of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the improved fee relief system in relation to non-profit child-care services now covered by the program came into being a couple of weeks ago on 1 October. This Bill extends the improved system to commercial, employer provided and other non-profit child-care centres not currently covered by the program. It is intended that these new arrangements will come into place on 1 January 1991. This will be of great help to the many thousands of families which currently use these centres. I believe that the fee relief will be well accepted and regarded by them. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the provision of certain criteria for the accreditation of these centres is concerned, I understand that this is not a duplication of State licensing regulations in relation to, for example, the space that is available per child or the ratio of workers to children. It is more to do with the quality of the care that is being provided and undertaking activities which will ensure that there is a stimulating, friendly and happy environment for the children committed to the care of these centres by the parents concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Senator Alston's misgivings and some cynicism, I would hope that the committees which will have a role in this regard will, indeed, listen very carefully to the parental input and will, quite rightly, regard the child-care centre as simply standing in the place of parents. I hope that they will give very full weight to the contribution of parents in that process and not be swamped by other contributors to that committee process who claim to have an expertise in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, I believe that the commonsense of parents ought to be given the fullest possible consideration and weight. I am sure that that would be the intention of those undertaking this accreditation process which is, as I say, concentrating on what happens to the children hour by hour and day by day. That is obviously an area in which parents, in association with the dedicated workers who are to be found in these various centres, have a primary expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the honourable senators who have contributed to the debate and commend the second reading of the Bill to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of the Opposition on the First Home Owners Amendment Bill 1990 which puts into effect the Government's decision to abolish the first home owners scheme. The Bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 by removing provisions which have been duplicated in the Crimes Act 1914 and making it an offence to recklessly make a false or misleading statement when completing an application for the first home owners scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also establishes 30 June 1991 as the cut-off date by which applications for assistance under the first home owners scheme must be received by the Department of Community Services and Health. It also corrects drafting oversights affecting applications made since last December and corrects anomalies which occurred when references to migration law in the First Home Owners Act 1983 were amended by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Financially, savings from the abolition of the first home owners scheme, according to the Government's figures, will be $33.4m in 1990-91 and $61.8m in 1991-92. The Government announced its intention to abolish the first home owners scheme in the 1990-91 Budget with effect from 22 August 1990. However, all approved ongoing payments will continue to be met and persons who entered into a contract to purchase or build a home before 22 August 1990 will also be eligible for assistance provided they submit an application prior to 30 June 1991. The Government also proposes, in place of the first home owners scheme, to give additional funds to the States for home purchase assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will not be opposing the Bill because essentially we believe that the principle behind the devolution of the first home owners scheme to the States is the correct procedure. However, we still have concerns about the way the Government has made the changes. The shadow Minister for housing-the honourable member for Forrest, Mr Prosser-is particularly concerned about the lack of detail which has been given accompanying the changes, in particular the reduction of funding that will result for housing. The Government has allocated only $14m to be distributed among the States this financial year and $30m next year. This compares with Commonwealth funding for the first home owners scheme of $119m in 1989-90 and $176m in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> This paltry amount to be allocated to the scheme this financial year means that financial assistance to first home buyers has dropped by a massive 850 per cent. It also means that this money has been held in the Treasury and has not flowed on to first home buyers. Once again, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has shown his true mettle-not only record interest rates burdening home buyers but also pocketing money which rightly should have gone to first home buyers. I point out that if ever there was an example for the States of what this Federal Labor Government means by devolution of authority to the States, this is a classic example of the way it operates. It should be a warning to the States when they are negotiating a transfer of powers with this Government down the track at the Premiers Conference. I say to the States: count your change; make sure you have not been ripped off; make sure you are not being required to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Clearly, although the authority may go to the States, it does not look as if the money is travelling with it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Opposition has no problem with the principle of devolving responsibility to the States because, given the varying price of houses and land in each State, it is appropriate that the scheme be administered in a manner which takes account of those differences. The States are best placed to do this. For example, the average price of an established home in Sydney is now $206,000; Melbourne, $127,000; Brisbane, $86,000; Adelaide, $89,000; Perth, $97,000; and Hobart, $78,000. There is also merit in the administrative savings that this would mean by transferring the responsibility to the States because the States already have their own housing assistance programs while the Commonwealth administered the first home owners scheme. This has doubled up on work, is inefficient and is certainly more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly inappropriate and inefficient to continue to have two levels of government administering the same type of home purchase assistance, but this still does not overcome the fact that the Government is not properly funding the States. In fact, the cutting of this funding goes back on one of the commitments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Prime Minister gave his assurance that where functions for which the Commonwealth had responsibility were transferred back to the States, fair compensation would be given. I would hardly claim that dropping funding by 850 per cent was fair compensation. One wonders that the Government could claim that it is doing a fair job in this respect. The veterans in this country who are fearful at the moment of the handing over of the repatriation hospitals to the States should also take a close look at what is happening to the funding of the first home owners scheme. I believe that it will be a pretty similar operation. First the Government hands over the authority to the States and then it forgets to hand over the money with it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has not developed any formula for the allocation of funding between the States. The shadow Minister, in his speech in the other place, asked the Minister whether the funds will be allocated on a per capita basis proportionately according to house prices or whether they will just be split between the States and Territories eight ways. Until the States know what level of funding they are to receive it will be impossible for them to start developing a replacement strategy to assist first home owners. The Opposition criticises the Government for this inefficiency and lack of planning. It is a classic case of all gas and no lemonade: announce a policy and there it stops. This is what happened with the training levy and now it is going to happen with the first home owners scheme. Here we have a very good concept failing at the implementation stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) said in his second reading speech that the Commonwealth will develop broad guidelines against which the States will develop more flexible deposit assistance. But these guidelines have not been forthcoming. The Opposition is concerned to see that when these guidelines are developed the Government will ensure that home deposit assistance, as administered by the States, remains targeted at low income first home buyers. I trust that this will be the case. The Minister also stated in his second reading speech that the new deposit assistance arrangements are envisaged to come into effect from 1 January 1991 provided agreements can be reached with State and Territory governments. I find it very odd that the appropriate guidelines were not negotiated before the Government's announcement of its decision. It would certainly have eliminated much of the uncertainty that is being experienced by the States and prospective home purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA> As the new arrangements are not expected to come into effect until 1 January next year-and that is if the Government and the States can reach agreement-and the old scheme was abolished as of 22 August this year, there is some time gap where no assistance is available at all. A funding vacuum exists where home buyers are completely locked out of home purchase assistance. The Opposition is concerned for those eligible first home buyers who would otherwise have been approved to receive assistance. Because of the time lag, this vacuum, there is nothing available to them. It is a problem that will be exacerbated if the State and Federal governments cannot reach agreement and the implementation drags on. </PARA>
<PARA> This flows on to the very important economical problem that this Government's high interest rate policy is having for families trying to make ends meet and to afford a home of their own. Home ownership has become a privilege. It is almost incomprehensible that that could have happened in our country. At one time owning a home was the great Australian dream and now it is only a dream. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to the increased costs for families trying to repay their mortgage. In December 1989, families were spending up to 36.4 per cent of their income just on repaying their mortgage. That meant that the average family was making mortgage repayments of over $1,000 a month, and those were families that had started out making repayments of $227 a month. The situation is even worse in Sydney. By June this year home owners there were paying 44.3 per cent of their income on their mortgage. That equates to almost $1,300 per month. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Government done to our young people, our young families? For those who have managed to cope with the huge increases in interest rates, inevitably there have had to be dramatic changes in lifestyle. Families have been forced to make enormous sacrifices. In some cases, couples have put off having children because they simply cannot afford them. One salary is no longer enough. Mothers are fast becoming economic conscripts, many having to take up outside work and be forced to leave their children in day-care just to make ends meet. The percentage of women forced back into the work force has increased dramatically in recent years. Whilst I recognise that not all people are there because they need that income, a high proportion are. I draw your attention, Mr Acting Deputy President, to some of the figures. In 1983-84, 2.3 million women were in the work force. In the last financial year this had increased to 3.2 million. This represents an increase of over 34 per cent. As I say, financial necessity is not the sole reason for this increase. Women's emancipation obviously accounts for much, but not all. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to read a study done by Helen Glazer of the Institute of Family Studies in 1988. She found that 56 per cent of women with babies under 18 months were back in the work force `because they needed the money'. Yet, we hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) attacking the Archbishop of Brisbane because he had the gall to criticise the Government's performance and the high interest rates on mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA> As the academic from Deakin University said on AM this morning, the Prime Minister is not too good at accepting negative feedback. I will tell the Prime Minister, I will tell the Government, in no uncertain terms, what any Australian who lives outside the Lodge or Kirribilli House really knows: high interest rates are hurting Australian families; they are seriously hurting Australian families. They are hurting them in the change of the lifestyle for those who wish to stay at home with their small children and have no choice but to go back into the paid work force. They are hurting the young couples who are putting off having children in order to be able to have a home. They are hurting those who, because they are on low salaries, can never aspire at all to getting a home. This is the Government that has reduced the funding to first home owners in such a dramatic measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate that at the moment the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, the National Australia Bank Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank are charging home owners 16 per cent for their mortgages and that the Westpac Banking Corporation is still charging 16 1/4 per cent. That is the reality, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, and whether the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) suggests that it is all the banks' fault, it is a direct result of Government policy that we have high interest rates on mortgages in this country, and there is no getting away from that. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the latest figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the makeup of Australian families. Those figures show that 50 per cent of households, either through choice or of necessity, have two full-time breadwinners, and that the proportion of Australian two-income families with children is increasing at a fast rate, from 20 per cent in 1988 to 24 per cent currently. Furthermore, 27 per cent of childless couples have both partners working full time, and many of those couples are madly trying to get a deposit together in these difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Mr Peter McDonald, commented on the preference that mothers with young children have for part-time employment, but the evidence was that many families had to have both husband and wife with full-time jobs in order to meet their housing costs, particularly in Sydney, where the costs of a standard mortgage require two people to work full time in order to meet those costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can rant and rave about banks until it is blue in the face; the fact remains that because of Government policy Australian families have had extreme difficulty in getting or maintaining homes or home loans. Families have been forced out of their homes and onto the streets because they have not been able to meet their mortgage commitments. Record numbers of people have been opting to stay in the private rental market. Constantly we hear welfare organisations saying that the number of people coming to them for help has increased dramatically and that the sort of people coming to them for help has changed dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer is it only low-income families or people who would have been deemed to be in low socio-economic groups; it is also people who would have been expected to survive a downturn in the economy. They too are coming for help because of the commitments that they have been caught up with in coping with the high cost of housing. Waiting lists for public housing have increased dramatically as more families find it difficult to cope in the private market. Public housing lists are currently at record levels. The Commonwealth Government simply has to act fast in giving the States both direction and funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition supports the Bill and the principle that it outlines, but we condemn the Government for its failure to put into place the necessary guidelines, the funding and the directions to have the policy function properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that the Australian Democrats, too, will not be opposing the First Home Owners Amendment Bill and also that I find myself in agreement with many of Senator Newman's remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) said in his second reading speech, the main purpose of this legislation is to preclude any further payment of assistance under the First Home Owners Act 1983 to applicants who contract to purchase or build, or commence construction of, a house after 21 August this year. The Bill also incorporates a number of minor amendments by establishing offences for misleading statements made in relation to an application under the first home owners scheme and for obtaining payment of assistance under the scheme by false means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues that the decision to end the first home owners scheme was based in part on the fact that the scheme was no longer proving to be an effective way to assist low income earners who wanted to enter the housing market.  That is true; but we need to look more closely to identify the reasons for it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons which most affect New South Wales is that there are massive discrepancies between the States in terms of housing costs. In view of this, I find it disturbing that the Government then goes on to suggest that the housing situation since the scheme was introduced in 1983 has actually improved because of its policies. This argument appears to be based on the Government's presumption that the alleged benefits arising out of a deregulated financial sector have allowed for an increase in the supply of housing finance, thus making it easier for people to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The question which we have to ask, though, is: At what cost do people in the community now have to borrow in order to buy a home, particularly in Sydney? The answer is quite simple: hundreds of thousands of Australians are currently experiencing considerable hardship because they have been unable to obtain adequate and affordable housing and housing finance. I am afraid that most of those people are in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Public housing waiting lists are longer than at any other time since 1983 and there are now more families in the suburbs of Australia's main cities who do not have enough money to spend on the necessities of life and who are actually spending less and less on the basic household items of food and clothing because the bulk of the family budget now has to go towards the cost of meeting mortgage repayments or rent. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that it is now immensely difficult for people to become home owners because of the lethal combination, especially in Sydney, of high interest rates and high home prices, both of which are the result of the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) now show that housing affordability has been dramatically eroded over the last few years. In fact, the ABS, through its housing affordability index, shows that housing in this country is now more expensive and more difficult to achieve than ever before. It is this trend of increasing pressure of housing costs on families in all kinds of situations that is of enormous concern to us. Of course, we accept that some of the causes for this situation are complex, but the pressures of high interest rates and of the Government's consistently reducing its own outlays of expenditure in housing over the years must surely be major factors.</PARA>
<PARA> Groups as diverse as the Housing Industry Association and the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) have expressed similar concerns about the Government's housing policies and about abolishing the first home owners scheme. ACOSS in particular has in recent years, in its pre-Budget submissions to the Government, devoted a great deal of attention to housing. It has consistently been at the forefront of community-based organisations warning the Government of how serious the crisis in housing has become for those families struggling to meet repayments or to put together a deposit, and probably while they are paying rent. High housing prices and high interest rates have eroded the home purchasing power of all Australians to such an extent that, as Senator Newman said, the great Australian dream is that-just a dream. Nearly one in four private tenants have incomes below the poverty line after paying their housing costs. Rents and mortgage repayments have pushed thousands of Australians into poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Total Government funding for housing to the States in this year's Budget has again been reduced. Added to previous years, this year's allocation now means there has been an effective decrease in funds available for housing and for housing assistance since 1986-87 of more than 40 per cent. If one looks at the Budget's forward estimates, one sees that funds to be allocated under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in the years 1993-94 will actually be held at the value of 1990-91 dollars for each of the next three years. The Government plans a decrease in real terms of more than 20 per cent over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I find this an alarming situation. The most alarming feature of this Bill comes in the claim that, as a result of ending the first home owners scheme, the Government will redirect to the States and Territories the money saved so they can distribute the funds to assist low income earners in purchasing homes through schemes already administered by them. Some additional funds have been promised to the States for housing assistance but, as Senator Newman has told us, those amounts do not equal what would have been the case had the scheme continued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has committed itself to providing only $14m this year and $30m in 1991-92, equalling a cost saving for the Government of $33m this financial year and $62m for 1991-92. The Government is arguing that, although the scheme has been abolished, the funds that would have ordinarily been set aside for it will now be redirected back to the States and Territories for them to administer. Clearly, this is not the case. Terminating the first home owners scheme and then handing over less than half the money to the States does not represent fair compensation to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting point in the Minister's second reading speech is the suggestion that the scheme must be abolished because it is no longer viable. Yes, as I said before, this is true; but why? As far as we can see, there are two basic reasons: firstly, the Government has consistently tightened the eligibility provisions of the scheme, making it extremely difficult to qualify for assistance; secondly, the Government has refused to index the income eligibility threshold since 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, these two factors, as well as the rising cost of living, mean that the threshold is now at a totally unrealistic level. In fact, instead of indexing the scheme in order to keep it in line with inflation, in 1986 the Government actually reduced the value of the grant from $7,000 to $5,000. Since then, inflation and the cost of buying a home-particularly in Sydney-have increased massively while the size of the grant has stayed at $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the Democrats will not be opposing this Bill, but, as Senator Lees will say in a moment, we do have a number of concerns surrounding the Government's apparent lack of commitment to the housing sector, and this legislation obviously typifies that abrogation of responsibility. We trust this type of policy decision is not an indicator to further cut-backs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As my colleague Senator Bourne has already indicated, the Australian Democrats will not be opposing this legislation, which abolishes the first home owners scheme. As Senator Bourne has pointed out, our main concern about this legislation relates to the lack of commitment on the part of the Government to direct the net savings from its decision to terminate the first home owners scheme towards other forms of housing assistance. The Government says the savings from its decision-and I will simply run through them before I state where we believe they should go-will be as follows: $33.4m this financial year; $61.8m in 1991-92; and $81.5m in 1992-93. That is a total of $176.7m over the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are told that the Government has allocated $14m this year and $30m next year towards the additional deposit assistance under a scheme to be administered by the States. As Senator Newman and Senator Bourne have already pointed out, we have no details as to how exactly this is, indeed, to be administered. That still leaves significant funds saved from the abolition of the first home owners scheme which are not being committed to housing. In effect, the Government has cut its overall housing support in the Budget and, with its usual rather misleading rhetoric and bluster, is trying to disguise the fact that a very sizeable cut has occurred. The Australian Democrats believe the decision to abolish the first home owners scheme and the failure to maintain real levels of funding to its housing responsibilities reflect the Government's paucity of ideas when it comes to tackling the housing crisis in Australia. It is now making its impact felt beyond the low income earning area and is increasingly starting to bite into so-called middle income Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not greatly concerned at the death of the first home owners scheme, as it was becoming increasingly obvious that the scheme itself was not within the reach of many low income families. In fact, the scheme was underspent this financial year by $26.5m and I think it is fair to say that in many ways the scheme had already outlived its usefulness. What is so disappointing about the decision that the Government has made is that the Government has chosen not to capitalise on these so-called savings, or additional money, generated from the abolition of the scheme and turn its mind to more creative funding options to provide secure low cost housing for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also disappointing to see the increasing willingness of the Commonwealth to look at devolving its respon- sibilities in a very half-hearted manner to the States. I do not want to labour this point, as it has already been quite well covered, but it is often of concern that the Government appears eager to practise a policy of devolution to the States in several key areas without ensuring that commensurate funds are available, and without proper consideration of the effects on the community of this devolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian federal system provides excellent opportunities for the financing of innovative housing programs, and it is high time the Government directed funds towards exploring some of these alternatives. Certainly, we welcome the establishment of the national housing strategy, headed by Dr Meredith Edwards-although I would make the point that this is something that community groups have been pressing for for quite a long time. However, the Democrats do not believe that the Government needs to wait for the reports of the strategy in order to direct funds towards innovative housing options. Many of these options have been around for quite some time-many years. They are popular in other countries and, with many Australian families now being squeezed out of the housing market, they deserve closer examination here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe we urgently need to take a new look at the way people, particularly those on low incomes, are housed. We need new ways of, firstly, reducing the overall cost of housing; secondly, cushioning the impact of rising house prices; thirdly, making better use of our existing housing stocks; and, fourthly, developing new forms of tenure. It is this last option that I particularly want to look at now. </PARA>
<PARA> In some ways, the existence of the first home owners scheme reflected our obsession with owning our own homes; it was also a by-product of a housing system which remains largely locked into one form of tenure-home ownership. It is not the case any more that this form of tenure is attainable by the vast majority of Australians. Indeed, it may not even be the preferred option of many Australians who would be content with security of tenure at an affordable price. Home ownership continues to be supported by policies favourable towards it at the expense of other options. The favouring of this form of tenure above all others means we are limiting or denying access to affordable and secure housing for a significant and growing proportion of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> One alternative form of tenure that I personally have seen working well in my home State of South Australia is cooperative housing. Cooperatives have been with us for many years but they have, unfortunately, generally been seen as fringe alternatives to home ownership. I believe this is not because cooperatives as a form of tenure are inadequate or have less to offer; rather, it comes, we believe, from a lack of commitment at Federal and State levels to fund and promote cooperative home ownership as an attractive and viable alternative. I am not saying this sort of scheme would suit everybody. What I am saying is that a continued failure to fund these sorts of programs as demanded is denying many Australians the opportunity to access secure and affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA> While cooperatives may not be in vogue in Australia, in many European countries close to half the housing stock is held in cooperative tenure of varying sorts covering the range between public housing and home ownership. South Australia's housing Minister, Mr Mayes, recently returned from a trip to the Netherlands during which he observed that 45 per cent of all housing in the Netherlands was held in cooperative forms of tenure, largely funded by private banks. As in other European countries, cooperative tenure is not seen in the Netherlands as just the province of those on low incomes; rather, it is seen as a way of improving and extending housing options for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that the Commonwealth has encouraged some minor experimentation through local government and through the community housing program under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, but this level of commitment remains paltry in the overall scheme of things. For example, a total of only 367 dwelling units were approved under this program in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best developed model in Australia is that of the common entity rental cooperatives (CERCs) in Victoria. A CERC is essentially a small tenant-run version of public housing involving several households. Properties are owned by the cooperative and cannot be sold. Initial capital is provided by the Government and the remaining funds, usually some 20 per cent, are borrowed privately. A guarantee against default is provided by the State. Although this program is at present restricted to low income tenants who provide no equity, it would be possible to extend the scheme along European lines to cater for tenants who are able to contribute equity. I believe it was one of the shortfalls of the first home owners scheme that it was not available for cooperative ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> Cooperative housing and shared-equity housing are two alternative forms of tenure that could quite feasibly attract significant private sector support, and ultimately prove to be a method offering secure housing to more Australians. However, a move away from the preferential treatment we presently give to home ownership as our dominant form of tenure requires some leadership from the Government. It is a great disappointment that the Government has not chosen to exercise a bit of leadership by seizing upon the opportunity provided by savings made from the termination of this first home owners scheme to redirect funds towards other forms of tenure. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very least, the Government should have ensured that the savings were not lost to the housing sector in toto. This sector is feeling the pinch of the Government's economic policies and, as we all know, housing is being driven further and further out of the reach of ordinary Australians. To abolish a scheme which, despite its many shortcomings, at least improved the housing opportunities of some Australians and further compound the damage by failing to direct the resulting savings to the Commonwealth's housing responsibilities, is yet a further indication of how out of touch the Government is with the savage effects its economic policies are having on middle and low income earners in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the Government's response to that growing group of desperate people who cannot afford to buy or even rent housing. Here I want to look at another sector that could have been significantly assisted through these savings, had the Government chosen to do so. I would like to quote now from a series of reports looking at homelessness and looking at those who are living on the streets in Australia. I begin with the Burdekin report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children. Yes, I acknowledge that the Government has responded to this report, but as yet we have seen no significant changes and no significant results from that response. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Crisis refuges do not offer stable, secure and adequate housing for young people, or the other support services which young people need to move towards either family reconciliation or independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Public housing authorities do not offer significant affordable and adequate housing for young people who simply need accommodation. Private sector accommodation is inaccessible for many because of their low income, legal barriers and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that tens of thousands of Australia's children are being denied their basic right to special protection; adequate housing; protection from neglect, abuse and exploitation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I move on to another report, prepared in South Australia by Suzi Quixley for the South Australian Youth Housing Network called Whose Children?, which particularly looks at the problems associated with under 16 year-olds who are homeless. I quote from this report:</PARA>
<PARA>Preparing to write this report was like listening to a broken record! Time and time again, both respondents to the survey and the literature stated the urgent need for long term, stable, secure accommodation for under 16 year olds.</PARA>
<PARA>I move to another area, and that is accommodation for people with disabilities. There is a recent Senate report, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs which I am sure the Minister has plenty of copies of. But the problems that were found through that inquiry are highlighted in another report on Homeless People with Severe Mental Disorders in Inner Melbourne. Here it highlights the difficulties, not because there are increasing numbers of people with mental disorders, but because the available housing stock is decreasing. I quote from two tables. The first relates to rooming house numbers in St. Kilda. In 1963 there were some 605 independent rooming houses and by 1987 that number had dropped to only 117. If we look at the second table, boarding houses and apartment houses and this again is in inner Melbourne we see that in 1960, there were some 34,000 beds available for these people. By 1980, the number had dropped to less than half, down to 15,881. This is another example of the areas in which the Government could have taken some serious interest and allocated the funds that have been made available through the savings in the first home owners scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> With an estimated 1.5 million Australians living in housing related poverty, this is not a response that can be excused or justified or obscured by the window dressing of the National Housing Strategy. It is simply a sleight of hand trick which cuts the Commonwealth's housing budget at a time when it should be recognising its responsibilities in this area and moving towards extending the housing options available to those people in this country who are desperately in need of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government likes to remind us ad nauseam of our need to stop seeing ourselves as the lucky country, and instead to become the clever country. I, for one, am constantly amazed by the Government's inability or unwillingness to match its rhetoric and take up opportunities which would actually make progress towards that mythical goal of the clever country. It seems to me that here was one such opportunity to improve and extend our range of housing options and provide at least the basis of ongoing Commonwealth responsibility for innovative housing alternatives. Instead the Government has, once again, failed to put its money where its mouth is and middle and low income Australian families, the homeless and people with disabilities will once again bear the brunt of a Government decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on the First Home Owners Amendment Bill 1990. I think that in particular Senator Lees is to be commended-along with Senator Bourne and Senator Newman-for her contributions in which she placed emphasis on the need for Australians to have access to affordable and accessible housing, rather than with having an obsession with the absolute need to have home ownership in the name of one person or as joint holders of the title, which is the common practice in most households in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought that many of the points that Senator Lees made about cooperative housing, as a different way in which housing stock can be held by persons in the community, were very fascinating and very interesting. I would hope that in the strategy review being undertaken at the behest of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), which is looking at Australians access to affordable and accessible housing, that that particular form of ownership, which has great currency in certain European countries, is one of those forms which is considered. I hope that whatever assistance can be given by governments is made available. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not only talking about home ownership, although primarily that is the focus of this particular scheme, but we are really broadly looking at the question of affordable housing-that is shelter for Australians. Of course, when one thinks of that, one also thinks of the rental market, which is an increasingly important focus of the attention of both the Federal and State governments. Indeed, in the guidelines for the mortgage and rent assistance program-which I am quite willing to table and which are being made available by the Minister in regard to the reallocation of funds which can come about through the abolition of the first home owners scheme at the Federal level-there is a lot of attention paid not only to deposit assistance and mortgage relief to help those who are experiencing difficulty in securing their accommodation by way of those traditional methods of acquiring home ownership, but also there is quite major provision in relation to assistance for rental payments. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there can be assistance provided through the scheme in regard to the payment of rental bonds; removal expenses and utility deposits; payment of rental arrears; flat rate payments or payments to reduce rent payments to a specified proportion of gross income for those persons experiencing short term financial difficulties; and payments to community organisations and local Governments to enable them to purchase, upgrade, lease or otherwise acquire dwellings for rental to low income persons requiring short term rental accommodation. This is a matter which I know Senator Lees is particularly concerned about. A very good illustration in relation to the availability of that sort of accommodation is the St. Kilda area. </PARA>
<PARA> I know from my own experience in Hobart around the university in old Sandy Bay that when I was a student, there was plenty of accommodation around those areas but as the trendy little boutiques have moved up from the main street into the side streets and taken over a lot of those dwellings for fashionable retailing outlets, so much of that accommodation is no longer available. Payments to community organisations can also be made, as to local governments, for the provision of housing information and referral services to renters. I believe we will see there that what the Government has in mind is that not only deposit assistance and mortgage relief but also assistance to renters should be a real focus because there are so many different housing needs being experienced by Australians, either by necessity or, of course, in certain situations by choice. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not always traditional home ownership which is the focus, as Senator Lees quite rightly pointed out. Nevertheless, it is because the Government's first home owners scheme achieved many of its objectives that it is now thought appropriate that the Federal Government retire from that particular field. The Senate will recall that when the scheme was first introduced on 1 October 1983 there was a need to assist moderate to low income people into home ownership, to stimulate construction of new dwellings and to create new jobs. We were in a situation where that was a target. Of course, the stimulation of the housing construction sector is always a way in which that sort of economic activity in creating new jobs and providing new dwellings can be accomplished. At that time, the Senate will recall, housing activity was at a 20-year low. Only 105,000 dwellings were commenced in 1982-83. Since its inception, the first home owners scheme has helped 360,000 households into home ownership at a cost of around $1.53 billion to other Australians contributing their taxes to that particular program. I do not think any of them would begrudge that expenditure on behalf of those 360,000 Australian households who have benefited from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having achieved many of its objectives, the thought is, and the Government policy embodied in this Bill provides, that the various target groups and the various objectives be approached not through two levels of government, as is the case at the moment, but by allowing the administration of the schemes to be streamlined and the funds provided to the States to enable them to assist Australians into affordable housing. That is being achieved as part of the social justice strategy of the Government. I believe that affordable and appropriate housing will be made available through the proper placing of responsibility for these programs in the State administrations rather than through this scheme administered by the Federal Government. I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate and I commend the second reading to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> We are debating cognately the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. The purpose of this legislation is to facilitate the collection of employer contributions to the new retirement and redundancy scheme. What this will do is collect around $150m from the industry, which in turn will collect it from the users, who in turn will collect it from the people of Australia. The Government will match that figure which it will then collect directly from the taxpayer. A total of $300m is to be put into a fund simply to pay out those people on the waterfront who are redundant. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the fund build-up, the expenditure of which is to be authorised by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA), is to pay out 3,000 employees on the waterfront who are 55 years of age or over and for 1,000 younger people to be recruited. As part of the package, enterprise agreements are supposed to be introduced to the industry, that is, the pooling arrangement is to be replaced with enterprise employment. The question I ask is: Is it really going to happen?</PARA>
<PARA> I noted with interest an answer to a Dorothy Dix question on Monday when the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) came in here full of excitement, like a bullfrog in spring, and said he was pleased to announce that the agreement had been reached between National Terminals (Australia) Ltd and the relevant unions for an enterprise agreement. As one industry person said to me, `He had to say that so he would not have to resign, as promised earlier in the year'. It is interesting to note just what the Minister said in answer to that question. I will quote in part what he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I was also in the happy position to announce that agreement had been reached between National Terminals and the waterfront unions on enterprise agreements . . .</PARA>
<PARA> There are only minor drafting alterations to be made to the agreement and the sending of the agreement to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority for its assessment is now imminent. All major issues have been agreed and only minor drafting changes now need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to direct a series of questions to the Minister about his happy announcement that this agreement has been entered into. I would like to see him answer these questions, either in response to the second reading speech debate or during the committee stage. I ask: Have the agreements been endorsed by the employees of National Terminals? Have they even seen the agreement? Have they been signed by the relevant unions and the company? When they are submitted for approval of WIRA, will the Authority adopt the same approach to the assessment of work practices as it did in the case of grain manning, that is, are operational requirements to be the criterion? Do the indicated productivity increases, performance improvements and costs savings warrant the expenditure of taxpayers' money on special redundancy payments?</PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that an enterprise agreement means very different things to different people. It should not, for instance, mean a single union monopoly with identical agreements. It should not mean a closed shop. If that is what eventuates-and it has all the earmarks of happening, I might say-$300m will have been wasted and the Minister will have failed in his micro-economic reform claims. </PARA>
<PARA> We are an island continent. We are a long way from overseas markets compared with many of our competitors. We have an acute and entrenched current account deficit running at the rate of some $20 billion a year. Hence, with our debt increasing at that rate, our gross debt is now in excess of $150 billion. Our primary industries, and in particular wheat and wool, are facing an appalling crisis. The aim of this Minister and of this Government must be not just to have a token improvement in productivity but to have the most cost efficient ports in the world. We should aim to be the best, not just to have some token increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister claimed in his answer that there would be productivity increases of 30 per cent in the port of Melbourne and 60 per cent in the port of Sydney as a result of this particular agreement. I want to ask the Minister how real that productivity improvement is. How much of it is reflected in the capital injection made by National Terminals to lift its game-I do not object to that; I agree with it entirely because it always has to be a part and parcel of the operation. What is the real labour productivity increase, if any?</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may remember that one of the great claims made at the time of the in principle agreement was that productivity-and labour productivity was referred to specifically-would increase by something in the order of 25 per cent. I might say that that still does not lift us into being among the world's best but it is an increase and it is a move in the right direction to which no-one would object. </PARA>
<PARA> In the understatement of the year, the Minister stated, in his second reading speech to the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been poorly served by its waterfront industry, with major costs for the rest of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the Australian waterfront is the achilles heel of this country and any costs which are unwarranted flow on to the whole economy. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This Key point in the export trading chain has been characterised by gross inefficiencies and high costs due to any absence of competition and competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a big step forward for the Government as it does at long last recognise that there is a problem. The Government has valiantly defended the actions of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia on every past occasion in this place. I frankly have lost count of the number of times that we in the Opposition have raised this as a very serious issue. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Minister should also have said, if he had the intestinal fortitude to do so, is that with the waterfront being the soft spot for Australia's exports and imports the country has been held to ransom by a handful of militants who, because of self-interest, very effectively sabotaged Australian industry by guerilla tactics-not just on a yearly basis but monthly and daily.</PARA>
<PARA> How serious is the Government about micro-economic reform on the waterfront? Is it handing out $300m directly and indirectly in taxpayers' money to a bunch of mates who have over a long time, because of the monopoly of power held by a few people renowned for featherbedding, been paid for work not done? They were also renowned, as everyone knows-this is nothing new-for phoney strikes on safety issues and strikes in opposition to another government's domestic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who receive the monthly reports from the Australian Chamber of Shipping cannot help but notice that month in, month out there is always a dispute at one of the major ports in respect of such matters as the domestic policies of South Africa. Late last year there was a series of them in respect of Fiji. I do not know when the militant trade union movement decided that it was going to be responsible for the foreign affairs of this country but that is the way it is acting at the expense of every Australian citizen. Every time this action is taken, serious damage is done to our exporters, particularly our manufacturers who are struggling already with incredibly high interest rates and an exchange rate which most people agree is overvalued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred on Monday to the enterprise agreement. I want to ask him a number of questions to which he must respond in the wind-up debate if he is to give credibility to both micro-economic reform and the use of a substantial amount of taxpayers money genuinely to reform the waterfront. We do not want a veneer. I would hope that all of us in this place are here for a purpose and that is to improve the lot of this country and every Australian. We want to be assured that at the end of the day there will be genuine improvements, not just marginal improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also ask to what extent the rorts have been removed from this agreement. In my own report entitled Rorts in the Ports in May 1989 I highlighted quite a number. I am one of a long line of people who have been hammering home to this Government that if we are in some way to get Australia right, we have to do something about the incredibly appalling situation in our ports. </PARA>
<PARA> I want the Minister to come clean and advise whether these restrictive work practices are or have been totally eliminated in the enterprise agreement or whether they are still there. Does he have a copy of it? Not only I but, I am sure everyone in this country would appreciate just seeing what is in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a few examples of very serious restrictive work practices which I believe have not been eliminated because of the demands by the Waterside Workers Federation not to give them up. These practices, which have come in over many, many years, are the result of the waterside workers being able to hold stevedores, shipping companies and users to ransom. In other words, if they did not pay up there would be incredible delays. I can go on and on. But let me give a few examples; and I would like some answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The famous two-up two-down arrangement is the requirement for cranes to have two drivers. One drives up in the crane and the other stands on the wharf and does nothing. Has anything been done about this precious little arrangement which over a year can amount to in excess of 480 shifts being allocated to down drivers in a single port? This, in fact, was the figure for 1988-89 for the Port of Brisbane, which is nowhere near the size of the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The next one is stop-work meetings. These, as everyone knows, are held at a time in which productive work should be being carried out. If we have genuine enterprise agreements, are stop-work meetings to be restricted to the enterprise involved or will it be the old story of applying them to the whole port? My understanding is that the Waterside Workers Federation has refused to give up this little rort. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the amenities men? This is one of the classic featherbedding cases on the wharf and there are many. The sole role of the amenities men is to tidy up amenities rooms after breaks and safeguard waterfront workers' personal belongings. They do not trust one another. The amenities men have no real cleaning jobs to do as the job in most cases is carried out by port authorities. It is also well known that the cost of using cleaning contractors is one third of the cost of using Waterside Workers Federation labour. In reality, the amenities jobs are given to those in the Waterside Workers Federation ranks who I understand have some sort of skill or disability problem. </PARA>
<PARA> What about all the allowances: travelling allowances, site allowances, telephone allowances, laundry allowances, dirt allowances, rain allowances, cold allowances and so on? I do not know the answer to those latter questions. The Minister should tell us, however, whether any of those have been eliminated in these so-called enterprise agreements. All of us-not just members of this chamber but the Australian people-need to know what we are getting for paying out $300m to reform the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Another rort is first-aid men. In the ports that I looked at over the years I found that a fully qualified waterside worker was employed in each stevedoring gang to man the first-aid station. I understand that the union demands that this person be retained. In 1988 alone it was calculated, again in the Port of Brisbane, that these first-aid men cost $1.5m and in the process tied up 17 qualified waterside workers who could have been doing other jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Critical to any genuine enterprise agreement is the recruitment process. If we are genuinely moving to enterprise agreements, the enterprise must be able to choose its own employees on merit without interference. Again, my understanding is that the Waterside Workers Federation continues to insist that the union must have a say in recruitment, promotion and demotion of all employees within the enterprise. I also understand that the union demands that it will determine who will make up the supplementary work force. For those in the Senate who are not aware what that is, it is the supplementary labour force when additional labour is required at peak periods in ports. The union is demanding who should make up that supplementary work force. </PARA>
<PARA> These questions go to the core of enterprise agreements. We either have them or we do not. If the position is as I understand it and as outlined, the enterprise agreements will be nothing more than a disgraceful sham to the cost of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Another critical area is that of maintenance. When announcing the reform process, the Minister quite clearly stated that the parties had to agree to arrangements to enable the effective contracting out of maintenance work where it is more efficient than in-house facilities. This was quite clearly stated by the then Minister, Mr Willis-it is very sensible stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> What that means-and there can be no quibbling about that statement-is that where it is more cost effective to do so, outside contractors will be brought in to maintain the equipment; in many cases, equipment that they themselves built or supplied. I understand that the union will not agree to that prerequisite which has been laid down and which is part of the plan for waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I again wish to refer to the Port of Brisbane which, as I said earlier, is an indicative port; it is not one of the two major ports in Australia. Conditions that apply there almost certainly apply in every other major port in Australia because the WWF always make sure that the same conditions apply right around the country. In 1988, all maintenance work on Brisbane wharves, such as repairs to common ordinary fork lifts used throughout Australia, cranes and refrigeration equipment-there is nothing terribly unusual about it-had to be done by WWF members. At that time, those tradesmen were among the most highly paid employees in Australia on the wharves, earning around $80,000 a year. That is in 1988, so one could presume that the figure is higher today. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, I was advised that outside contractors would cut maintenance costs by more than 75 per cent. That is real micro-economic reform. We must be looking at cutting costs so that we can be more productive. It is not a matter of being conscious of the fact that tradesmen, who probably should not be there in the first place, will lose jobs. No one likes anyone losing jobs. But, we must recognise the fact that we are part of the world scene. Unless we are cost competitive, there is no hope for this country correcting its balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> If the issue of contracting out is not included in enterprise agreements, clearly this Government and the unions-it is a tripartite agreement-are not honouring the in-principle agreement of 12 months ago. I understood that one of the points that had to be taken on board by WIRA when it handed out the money was that all the issues in the in-principle agreement were to be adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very serious issues and I believe that they must be addressed and responded to by the Minister. After all, it was he who came in here the other day and basically said, `We've done it. We've got a real enterprise agreement.' I want to know what is in that and what is not in it. Otherwise, the public who are paying the $300m to buy out work practices can quite legitimately claim to have been conned by this Minister and, yet again, by this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the costs on the waterfront, by far the major concern of our overseas customers is lack of reliability. We have very regrettably an appalling reputation overseas for lack of reliability. I do not know one exporter who is obliged to use our ports who has not had to run the gauntlet of claims of lack of reliability when dealing with overseas buyers. There is no doubt whatsoever that this factor alone has cost this country billions of dollars in lost export income. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I came into this place, year in year out I would try to persuade overseas buyers and potential buyers that our industrial relations were improving. I might as well have been whistling up a wind. I might say that this caused me substantial embarrassment because I knew I was apologising for my fellow Australians who were wrecking our export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with lack of reliability is that to buyers it equates to a lack of trust. Everyone knows that one of the most devastating and destabilising remarks that could be made of another person is that he or she is unreliable. I think every individual is aware of that. When it is applied to a country it brings great shame on that country and the individuals whose sole aim is to promote it and promote the export of our goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> To a buyer, reliability means that goods will be supplied to the buyer at the time specified and required by the buyer. It is a matter of honouring one's commitments. It is, in fact, a matter of honour between two people from different countries. Regrettably, I have seen no indication that this critical factor is even recognised by the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though we have serious reservations about the claimed beneficial effects of the expenditure of $300m in buying off the Waterside Workers Federation-and I will frankly be surprised if the Waterside Workers Federation does not end up playing the Minister and the Government off a break-we will not be opposing the legislation because it is, I believe, a move in the right direction. It is only a minor move but at least it is a move. We will be keeping our eye on this to ensure that the Government's claims, the Government's promises, in micro-economic reform are fulfilled. As I indicated, I have serious reservations about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, we will not be opposing the legislation. I foreshadow that during the committee stage of the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill we will be moving an amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share Senator Parer's concern that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, is not in the chamber while the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill are being debated. I wonder whether he is counting the days on his calendar to the time limit concerning his very public undertaking to resign if waterfront reform was not implemented within a certain time. I guess that he is a little anxious at the moment as the days tick by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Parer has said, the Liberal and National parties do not oppose this legislation because we believe that some reform, minuscule though it is, is better than no reform at all. We believe that the reform proposed for the stevedoring industry should have been greater, but it is not with this legislation. We are supporting it because even little reform is better than none at all. We wish to place a timetable upon the Government to ensure that the reform proposed takes place within a finite time, and Senator Parer has mentioned that amendments will be moved at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues of reform which needs very careful consideration by the Government, and the Minister in particular, relates to reform in regional ports right around Australia. These are places where trade and business is not sufficient to have waterside workers working full time on stevedoring labour. The Inter-State Commission Report on Waterfront Investigation, volume 1 at page 147, acknowledged this, stating:</PARA>
<PARA>The existing cross-subsidisation of stevedoring labour in smaller ports should be terminated. The Waterside Workers Federation should enter into in-principle agreement for withdrawal of its coverage in ports where integrated workforces are established. Port authorities should consider the establishment of integrated workforces and initiate discussions with all interested parties but they should not inhibit stevedoring companies from operating under the new enterprise employment arrangements. In ports where it is considered more efficient to operate labour pools the pools should operate on a fully commercial basis; that is, they should be separate enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for Gellibrand, Mr Willis, told the House of Representatives on 1 June 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>The gross inefficiencies which have been allowed to develop in these industries have restricted our economic growth, reduced our living standards and impaired our capacity to develop our export markets. In part our balance of payments difficulties are directly attributable to the acute inefficiencies in these key industries in the export chain. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same speech the Minister said that the Government believed that a satisfactory agreement would need to include firm commitments from industry parties on a number of matters, one of which was the following:</PARA>
<PARA>The parties will need to commit themselves to the introduction of measures to improve the small and intermediate ports, through revised employment arrangements, including enterprise employment, commercial port labour pools and the use of port authority labour.</PARA>
<PARA>Later the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government endorses the broad thrust of the ISC's recommendations in relation to port authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Cairns Port Authority has proposed an integrated port work force which is described as being employment by a port authority of port and stevedoring labour interchangeably, so that if workers cannot be employed full time on stevedoring duties they can be interchanged and used for other matters. This goes against what the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) usually requires and is quite insistent about. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand the situation in the Cairns port, in the past there have been some 23 Waterside Workers Federation employees working only part time stevedoring ships, as the ship traffic into the Cairns port is not continuous. There have been 23 people there to do it. In addition to this, the Cairns Port Authority also employees a work force of about 40 people in general multi-skilled work, mainly doing maintenance and repairs around the port and otherwise being gainfully employed on a full time basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand further that the port authority in Cairns believes that it needs an integrated port work force which would include five or six of the current Waterside Workers Federation workers. The Cairns Port Authority, I understand, thinks that only five or six are needed to do the work that 23 are now being paid to do. When these five or six workers were not loading and unloading cargo, they would be incorporated in the multi-skilled maintenance work force operated by the Authority in the Cairns waterfront area. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority has reached an agreement with the Waterside Workers Federation which provides that 13 of those 23 WWF members currently working at the Cairns port would be retired out of the industry on very generous redundancy packages which are being offered all around. The talks to date have suggested that 13 should be retired. That would leave 10 WWF workers remaining at the port. I understand that this 10 that it is proposed be left cannot be legitimately and gainfully employed and that only a maximum of six can be properly, gainfully and economically employed at the Cairns port. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the issue is so important to Cairns businesses and manufacturers and people who use the Cairns port-so important to the overall viability of the Cairns port and business generally in the Cairns area-that the Cairns Chamber of Commerce has arranged alternative employment for those four or five Waterside Workers Federation members who cannot be gainfully employed at the port but who have not been one of the 13 to get the generous redundancy packages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I took my place in the Senate in May one of the first requests I received for help was from a small South Australian health fund. That fund, and I might add others which have followed asking for similar help, have continued to call and visit my office regularly. The simple fact is that these funds are in trouble. They are being forced out of business. They are in trouble despite providing an excellent care and contribution package. They are in trouble despite being viable. They are in trouble despite being expertly run with administration costs being kept to a minimum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, these small health funds find themselves with problems through no fault of their own. They are in trouble simply because of government policy. My colleagues in the other States tell me that they too receive regular calls and visits from small health funds. These people are begging for help, begging for some respite from the ill-considered government policy known as reinsurance. Of course, I realise that this complex and damaging policy is at present the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator for South Australia, I wish to put on record as a matter of public interest the damage reinsurance is doing to the small health funds in my State. In general, health funds, big and small, are experiencing difficulties in South Australia, as they are around Australia, but in the past year membership losses and health funds deficits have been far greater in South Australia than in many other States. Health fund contributions last month again rose significantly in South Australia. Accordingly, membership will again drop just as significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Management of one health fund has estimated that less than 42 per cent of South Australians will have private health insurance by the end of 1990. In these difficult economic times young families and young people leaving school are increasingly finding that ever-escalating and expensive contributions to the big funds are simply impossible to maintain. So yet again the pressure on the public health system grows. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation one would have thought it logical for any government to attempt to keep as many people as possible with private health cover. But, no, that is not the approach of the Government. The Government with its reinsurance policy is crippling the small funds, which had no need to increase their contribution schedule at the rate or to the level of my State's major fund, Mutual Community Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Reinsurance really comes into the stranger than fiction category, or maybe it would be in the Monty Python category if it were not so painful. In South Australia it is certainly causing some great pain. Mutual Community, our major private health fund, has a membership of more elderly and chronically ill people than other funds in the State. The Government's reinsurance principle argues that, because this is so, Mutual Community must bear higher costs per member than other funds- which, I might add, is still a matter of considerable debate. Accordingly, the other funds, the smaller funds, the ones which have worked hard to keep their administration costs and contribution charges down, are made to pass on a percentage of their funds to Mutual Community. It is like asking the corner shop to prop up Coles Myer Ltd. It is about the same sort of principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the small funds, which have lower contribution charges, are being forced by this policy to subsidise the members of the biggest fund, which already charges its members more. The Government calls that fair; others would call it simply ridiculous. Why on earth should the funds whose members happen not to be so chronically ill or the funds with older members which still manage to remain more viable be expected to prop up the big fund with the older population on its books? Economic writer in the Adelaide Advertiser, Malcolm Newell, put the crazy situation into the Yes, Minister category with a description that I would like to quote to the House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if viable funds keep forking out members' money to shore up non-viable funds, the non-viable funds will become viable in the short term-only as long as the viable funds are still viable. </PARA>
<PARA> When, eventually, the viable funds become non-viable because they have been propping up the non-viable funds, that are now (temporarily) viable, the temporarily viable funds become non-viable too. </PARA>
<PARA> So in time, all the funds fall into a black financial hole. </PARA>
<PARA>No-one can deny that there are definitely shades of Sir Humphrey in that quote. Worse, it is happening in most States in Australia. One representation made to me-in fact, the first representation of many made to me about the reinsurance policy-came from the South Australian Police Health Fund, which is forced by this policy to deliver almost half a million dollars each year to Mutual Community. That fund has some 4,000 members-not a large number of members-but it is a requirement under the regulations of the South Australian police force that a member of that force shall be a member of the South Australian Police Health Fund. One cannot be a police officer in the State unless one is a contributor to that health fund. So police officers are in a no win position. Mutual Community has some 30 times that number of subscribers or members. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the fairness? The South Australian Police Health Fund is clearly a very small fund. Established in 1935, it has always had a reputation for excellent service, low contribution costs and high management standards which means it spends just 6 per cent of its income on administration. Despite this display of good management and service, it is now, as one would describe it, being bled dry by a policy which says it must support the big fund in town. Its contributions are being forced up sharply by the pressure of the reinsurance proposal and demands. Its funds are being rapidly eroded and it announced in June that its future viability now was, in fact, in serious jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> In total, South Australia's small funds have been forced to subsidise Mutual Community to the tune of more than $5m in the past year. Last year, the then Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, asserted that funds such as Mutual Community would be able to reduce their contribution rates with the subsidies the smaller funds had to hand over under the reinsurance proposal. That is simply wrong. The opposite has happened. Mutual Community's rates have continued to rise and more and more people have dropped out of health insurance. The vicious circle has meant subsidies from the small funds to Mutual Community have also had to rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The debacle of Medicare continues unabated, and we continue to put bandaid on top of bandaid. Instead of damaging and knocking out of the market the small funds which have been so successful, would it not have been fairer to keep out of the issue and ensure they provided an efficient service to their contributors and their members as being the qualifying factor? Would it not have been fairer to leave it to the big funds-in South Australia's case Mutual Community-to tailor their charges and benefits to suit their contributor's needs? Other areas of insurance do that; why not this one?</PARA>
<PARA> What is so different about health insurance that it needs draconian government measures like reinsurance to prop up certain elements of it? If the small health funds are forced out of the market by reinsurance, we will most likely create monopolies in private health care in each State-a situation which could see charges rise until only the very wealthy can afford health insurance. That is a totally undesirable objective, goal or result from a policy that we now have in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia I have watched with dismay the struggle of the small health funds to stay in business. As I said earlier, I know that this is being repeated in other States throughout Australia. I hope that wisdom wins the day before it is too late, before we squeeze out of existence small health funds providing an invaluable service to their contributors and their members. I repeat that if people want a job in the South Australian police force they have no alternative but to be members of the police fund, because under the regulations they cannot be employed as police officers unless they are. What we are doing with the reinsurance is putting the viability of that fund in serious jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Before it is too late, I trust and hope that the Government will review the proposals. I trust and hope that the Select Committee which is currently reviewing this matter will provide, in its report to this Parliament in due course, some light at the end of the tunnel for small health funds throughout Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address a few remarks on philately. Mr Deputy President, you might well ask whether philately is a matter of public interest. I can assure you and honourable senators that in fact it is. No less a newspaper than the Adelaide Advertiser was able to point out on 21 September that, in fact, stamp collectors have saved Australia Post from massive losses at least three times over recent years. Philatelic services, or stamp collecting, have generated revenue of $40m each year over the past few years and involve about one million Australians. So philately is of some considerable public interest. The Adelaide Advertiser noted that there were 60,000 South Australians on Australia Post's South Australian mailing list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject of philately was sufficiently important to instigate a review of the administration of philatelic services by Australia Post by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and the report of the Committee was presented in the other place in August. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the contribution of philatelists to the total profit of Australia Post is about 20 per cent. But in absolute terms the philatelic profits have fallen by about 50 per cent in recent years. That is probably why this matter was the subject of the Committee report. In part of the report the Committee postulated that the decline was the outcome of stagnant revenue sales and increasing costs and then set about addressing those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an audit review of Australia Post which encouraged Australia Post to adopt a more professional and businesslike approach to the production, marketing and sale of philatelic products. The Committee endorsed that course. I do not endorse that course and I certainly know of a number of philatelists who share my views. That particular course, of adopting a more professional and businesslike approach and talking about marketing, implies that stamp collectors are a market waiting for the stuff to be foisted upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of this stuff-I cannot find any other term to describe it properly-this marketing strategy, that collectors are leaving the hobby. The Chairman of the Committee recognised that when he suggested that people might have been giving up stamp collecting in the belief that Australia Post had too many stamp issues each year. That is probably correct but more important is the marketing attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I have brought into the chamber some examples of the sorts of things which are presented to collectors as a marketing technique. Multi-coloured brochures are presented. They can be found on the counter at Australia Post and they come through the mail with standing orders to stamp collectors. There are such things as Christmas gift ideas for all the family. We are presented with images of nature with pretty pictures, semi-postcard sorts of things, and books, booklets and diaries and deluxe executive book collections-the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that that matter is not much different from the unsolicited marketing matter found in the letterboxes of all Australians who have them which accumulates and is generally known as `guff stuff', unsolicited mail. Some of this stuff can be accumulated. It can be purchased and put on the bookshelf, but that is not really collecting and it is certainly not what philatelists are interested in. It is certainly not what will save Australia Post from continued declining philatelic interest and therefore sales to those sorts of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time on this matter, but I do think it is important to consider, as this has been the subject of a report elsewhere, what philatelists are interested in and what might be done to reduce this decline in interest and perhaps bring about a return to the days when $40m and more might be contributed to Australia Post's revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should recognise that philatelists are in fact interested in things such as postmarks-the real ones, not the special commemorative ones-postal markings, markings on envelopes such as `Return to sender' or the redirections that we sometimes see on our electoral mail: the sorts of things which occur in the process of normal postal services, things which have not been commercialised. </PARA>
<PARA> All one has to do to find proof of such an assertion is look at the specialist journals and the auctioneers' catalogues when this sort of material is being sold. Some of this material sells for thousands of dollars. In fact, quite often this matter is sold overseas and forms a considerable part of our invisible exports. This sort of material is the subject of philatelic journals. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also brought with me the Courier, which is published by the Tasmanian Philatelic Society. Just from looking at the table of contents without reading the thing, one can get an indication of the sort of material which is collectable and the sort of material which is of particular interest to this hobby. It may sound a little esoteric in this place, but I will just read part of the table of contents. What is being considered in this journal-and it is a fine journal and well recognised as such throughout Australia-is The Crotty Closure Puzzle, Manuscript Cancellations on Tasmanian Pictorials, Surveys of Tasmanian Manuscript Cancellations, Amendments to the List of Tasmanian Commonwealth Postmark Rarities, and so on. To some people it may seem esoteric and fairly irrelevant, but to the specialist philatelist it is not: it is fascinating, interesting and not possible to commercialise, not possible to market in the modern whiz-bang marketing sense. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that perhaps one of the best things that Australia Post could do to encourage the growth of this sort of interest and, therefore, the growth of normal mail processing sorts of items, would be to stop trying to take advantage of collectors by marketing unwanted guff. Perhaps the best Australia Post could do for philatelists would be simply to provide the vehicle for postal activities. The normal postal activities will provide the rarities and varieties which philatelists would be interested in and they can then, through the passage of time, collect them and specialise in them. But to be able to do that, those very people would then have to take part in the collection of the complete set of normal postal items. The extra revenue comes to Australia Post from making larger sales of this normal product to philatelists. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody really, in that sort of area, wants to collect the extraneous guff. I would suggest that to have a marketing expert try to find ways to foist more of it on to new collectors and incidental collectors is entirely the wrong attitude to have and entirely the wrong direction to take. I would hope that Australia Post will be very careful about how it interprets recommendation 4.25 of this report. I hope that it realises that a marketing expert is perhaps not the person who might know the most about what philatelists could be interested in. I would refer such a person, in fact, to the sorts of journals I have quoted and hope that they may be interpreted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spent some time in expressing concerns which I know reflect the concerns of other philatelists and I hope that they are taken note of by Australia Post. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on record some recollections of three meetings I have attended very recently. The first of these was the fifth global meeting of World Women Parliamentarians for Peace which was held in Harare late in September, attended by about 45 women from 25 different countries. This three-day meeting was extremely successful. Much of this success was due to the very courteous hospitality that was shown to us by the Zimbabwe Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am now the immediate past President of this organisation and have been succeeded by Edna Madzongwe of the Zimbabwe Parliament. The temptation to go into detail about that meeting is strong but I am resisting it on this occasion. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the declaration of that particular conference and an appendix to the declaration on HIV infection. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>WORLD WOMEN PARLIAMENTARIANS FOR PEACE DECLARATION OF THE FIFTH GLOBAL CONFERENCE HARARE, SEPTEMBER 24-26, 1990</PARA>
<PARA> We World Women Parliamentarians for Peace, attending the Fifth Global Conference in Harare, representing parties from across the political spectrum, still consider the nuclear arms race the greatest continuing threat to humanity. We welcome the end of the cold war and the development towards democracy in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa. We note with satisfaction that disarmament-agreed and unilateral-is proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear Arms Race</PARA>
<PARA> Only 3% of all Nuclear Weapons build-up has been destroyed, Naval nuclear weapons have not even been the subject for negotiations. Ships in the Persian Gulf armed with nuclear weapons are an added threat. Nuclear arsenals are an ever present danger to humankind. We call upon all governments to denounce the use of nuclear weapons and work jointly and individually towards their complete elimination. We affirm our determination as Women Parliamentarians to use our resources to work for disarmament, development and international peace and security. We demand the immediate cessation of all nuclear tests and call upon all Governments to actively work for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The production of more weapons, both nuclear and conventional, consumes economic and human resources which should be used for peaceful development. </PARA>
<PARA>Biotechnology</PARA>
<PARA> The rapid development in the field of biotechnology creates many positive opportunities, but, at the same time, gives rise to a number of new problems such as the military application of biotechnology. </PARA>
<PARA> WWPP will work so that that knowledge in the biotechnology field, is applied in such a way that it promotes peace and equality and counteracts war and poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>Environment</PARA>
<PARA> Environmental problems create conflicts and kill as effectively as weapons. Therefore the struggle for peace and against environmental pollution has the same goal-survival of humankind. </PARA>
<PARA> Huge resources will have to be channelled to research and development of environmentally sound technologies in the l990's in order to eliminate major threats to the survival of humankind posed by unchecked environmental degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1992 a U.N. Conference on Environment and Development will be held in Brazil. We demand that the U.N. undertake a major study into the conversion of military production to environmentally sound technologies, and to present a plan of action for its implementation. All delegations to the Brazilian Conference must consist of as many women as men. </PARA>
<PARA>Disarmament</PARA>
<PARA> Disarmament, development and environmental protection, should be achieved together. We urge the Soviet Union and the United States as a matter or urgency to sign a treaty to substantially reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals. We oppose any attempt to remodernize or to substitute nuclear weapons that have been banned. As a first step towards naval nuclear disarmament we urge all nuclear weapon powers to destroy their tactical nuclear naval weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> We call for substantial reductions of conventional weapons in all regions of the world; for abandonment of offensive strategies; for non military solutions of conflicts and for a new concept based on interdependence and common security. </PARA>
<PARA> We denounce the use of chemical weapons and urgently demand the speedy conclusion of a Universal Treaty on banning and completely eliminating all chemical weapons, without endangering other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We stress that peace will not be achieved without taking into account the aspirations and concerns of all nations and all people. All nations should therefore participate actively and extensively so that negotiations, which affect us all, do not become the exclusive domain of the superpowers. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the fact that the United Nations, supported by vigorous and broad-based popular movements and non-governmental organisations, is growing more effective in conciliating between disputing members. The United Nations and the Secretary General must continue to play a leading role in promoting peace. </PARA>
<PARA>Children and War</PARA>
<PARA> We are Women Parliamentarians, but we share with all women the concern about the future of our children. We consider it an absolute right for all children of the world to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have clean and healthy food. We believe, therefore, that the united voices of women from all parts of society are needed to attain real peace, disarmament and the survival of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> As Women Parliamentarians we are committed to resolving conflict, wherever it may occur, without violence. We are concerned about the abuse and exploitation of children in war. </PARA>
<PARA> As women we demand an end to the practice of using and recruiting children as soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child and urge all governments to ratify the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>THE GULF CRISIS</PARA>
<PARA> We categorically denounce the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq, and condemn this violation of the principles of self determination, international security and human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> We fully support the adoption by the U.N. Security Council of resolutions and recognise the fragility of international security. </PARA>
<PARA> We urge Iraq to immediately withdraw from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> We note the joint statement of the United States and the Soviet Union of September 9, 1990, as a positive step towards the resolution of the Gulf Crisis. We urge the leaders of the two nations to ensure that the situation will not escalate into a conflict of even wider proportions, further threatening international peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA> We emphasise that no solution can be reached by military means, as we all know that violence breeds violence. A political resolution can, and must be reached by strict adherence to the U.N. Charter. </PARA>
<PARA> We deplore the callous use of foreign nationals as hostages and demand their unconditional release, and the restoration of the human rights of displaced women, men and children. </PARA>
<PARA>SOUTHERN AFRICA</PARA>
<PARA> We Women Parliamentarians for Peace are concerned about the continuing destabilisation of the Front Line States, (Angola, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, Mozambique, LeSotho and Zimbabwe) by the minority racist regime in South Africa which has cost these states loss of lives, untold human suffering and enormous losses in their economies and social structures. </PARA>
<PARA> We note with deep concern the covert sponsoring of the violence in South Africa which is erroneously referred to as Black on Black violence. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. We as women call for the intensification of sanctions against South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. We call for the immediate dismantling of the vicious apartheid system. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. We expose President de Klerk's hypocrisy in handling the obstacles hindering the peaceful negotiations towards peace in Southern Africa. This is borne out by the increase in the South African military budget for the years 1990-1991. </PARA>
<PARA> We call upon all the Parliaments, especially women parliamentarians of the World to exert pressure, and through their Governments to mobilise support for the International Community, the World Council of Churches, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the International Parliamentary Union, Amnesty International, and the United Nations to take positive action against this repressive regime. </PARA>
<PARA> We note with anguish the plight of women and children in many parts of our globe, and we call upon all governments, United Nations, and other non-governmental organisations to give priority to the needs of those who suffer most from war and economic deprivation. </PARA>
<PARA>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND</PARA>
<PARA>CHILDREN</PARA>
<PARA> WWPP will work for a situation where violence in all its forms against children is brought to public notice and legal protection is strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> We as women, demand the full participation of women in all decision making on peace, disarmament and development, not only as a matter of equality, but also as a matter of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> We demand that women must be present at every negotiating table and any conference where issues of life and death are discussed. We refuse to share the responsibility of destroying this planet, but we believe that we can and must play a decisive role in saving it. </PARA>
<PARA> We call on all Women Parliamentarians of the World to intensify their efforts to preserve our planet for present and future generations. </PARA>
<PARA>H.I.V. INFECTION</PARA>
<PARA>(Appendix to WWPP Declaration)</PARA>
<PARA> WWPP recognises that HIV (Human Immuno Deficiency Virus) infection is pandemic with above 70% of cases leading to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) within 8 years and then to certain death. </PARA>
<PARA> In developed countries HIV is a disease primarily affecting homosexuals and bi-sexual men and intravenous drug users. Women and their children are increasingly at risk. The potential for prevention and treatment can, depending on resources and the will of governments be realised by targeting specific at risk groups. In developing countries however, HIV is a disease of families and communities, and in some African nations, of their country. </PARA>
<PARA> While firm statistical data is not readily available we note recent estimates reported in the Lancet that as many as 70% of the Ugandan population may be HIV+; and a WHO estimate that 25% of adults in urban areas in East and Central African countries are HIV+. According to a news report WHO estimates that 10 million children will have been infected by the end of the century, with one third of all known AIDS cases to date having occurred in children under 5 years old. Most such children are African. </PARA>
<PARA> Infants born to a HIV+ mother may succumb to an AIDS related pneumonia within days of birth. They may live to 3 or 4 years old. Women may be infected by blood transfusion at delivery and pass the virus to their babe through breast milk. </PARA>
<PARA> HIV/AIDS has devastating consequences for developing countries, debilitating and killing millions of men, women and children. There is no vaccine and no-cure. Prevention is therefore critical. </PARA>
<PARA> WWPP supports the efforts of the WHO. We identify HIV/AIDS as a consequence of underdevelopment and assert that whole country prevention can only be achieved by an urgent redirection of resources from military budgets within and outside these countries into prevention programs. These programs would focus on the reduction of sexual transmission through</PARA>
<PARA> - the training of specific AIDS prevention health workers,</PARA>
<PARA> - the distribution of free condoms,</PARA>
<PARA> - education programs in schools and workplaces, etc,</PARA>
<PARA> - improvement of antenatal care,</PARA>
<PARA> - provision of sterile medical equipment,</PARA>
<PARA> - safe blood transfusion systems. </PARA>
<PARA> WWPP also notes the potential for transmission of HIV/AIDS through tourism. WWPP members are urged to alert their governments to not only inform travellers of the risks of unprotected sex, but also to educate such travellers as to their responsibility not to exploit women, men and children for sex in underdeveloped countries. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second of the meetings that I attended was a conference in Canada of Commonwealth Ministers for Womens' Affairs. This is the third of such meetings, the first having been held in 1985 and the second in 1987. At that conference I was deputising for the Australian Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Fatin), as I had done for the relevant Minister on the two previous occasions. I found this a very satisfying experience. The Canadian Government clearly concentrated a considerable amount of effort, resources and time on organising this conference. As a result, 47 Commonwealth countries were represented at this meeting. The calibre of the debate over the three days is clearly reflected in the official communique which will be a public document once it is transmitted to the Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The theme of the conference was economic equity and women. Other agenda items were population issues, structural adjustment, women and the environment and, for the third time, having been on the agenda for each of the two previous meetings, domestic violence. The quality of the debate was very high. Although half the delegations were lead by men, invariably the male Minister would defer to his women experts on his delegation whenever he felt that his own knowledge was insufficient to meet the requirements of the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise, Mr Acting Deputy President, that between 1985 and 1990 the consciousness, the sensitivity and the determination of Commonwealth governments to come to grips with the issues of women and inequality have greatly been expanded. The Canadian Government is to be congratulated for its role in ensuring the success of this conference and the Commonwealth countries which brought their delegations and which were well briefed should also be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Secretariat provided excellent papers for the meeting, and I would like to offer to make available to anybody who is interested the background papers that were provided for us. </PARA>
<PARA> I also recently led a delegation to the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics when six Australian women parliamentarians who attended a 10-day series of meetings at the invitation of the Soviet Women's Committee. Reports have already been given by the three other senators who were on the delegation. I will try not to repeat matters upon which they have already very competently commented. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a great number of meetings, inspections and visits. We worked hard; we worked constructively; and I was very proud of the delegation. We all took our own experiences, philosophies, convictions and backgrounds with us. But for the whole of the 10 days and during the whole range of experiences that were new to many of us, the conduct of the exercise reflected nothing but credit on the Australian women and certainly a great deal of credit on the Soviet women who had organised this event for us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very short time that is available to me, I would particularly like to comment on four of these meetings. One was with a member of parliament and human rights activist by the name of Valery Borschov. Recently elected, Mr Borschov has been very closely involved with the development of the Helsinki charter on human rights. He also has the distinction of being requested to present himself to a psychiatric institution for examination after he resigned his membership of the Communist Party in 1970. He declined the invitation and apparently nothing very evil befell him as a result. He is now a member of the Soviet Presidium. He described what he called an interesting and a dramatic time in Soviet history, including his membership of the Moscow Helsinki group on human rights since 1975 and having worked with Andrei Sakharov. He is also on a committee which has defended the rights of believers. </PARA>
<PARA> He told us that he believed there were still about 120 people in the Soviet Union held as political prisoners. In response to direct questioning he said that he believed that they had had been given a fair trial. When, after an hour's conversation-and a very, interesting one-we broached the questions of racial intolerance, he gave us his opinion that this was mostly as a result of a very poor economic situation, and that the tensions were temporary ones and not directed to any particular group. </PARA>
<PARA> When asked about equal rights for women, which are guaranteed by a constitution in the USSR, he acknowledged that practically all of the burden of everyday life is on the shoulders of women, regardless of the constitutional, legislative and labour provisions that exist to lighten that burden. When asked what his message would be to Australians about human rights in the USSR he said, `Tell them we are working on it', that he was optimistic; that it was hard to learn democracy; that there would still be a lot of headaches, but that he believed the position in relation to human rights had greatly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second meeting I wish to refer to was with three members of the Presidium in the Kremlin. Once again it was a very interesting experience. One of these was a man of Korean extract who led the discussion. Of the two women, one described herself as a `Party boss' within the CPSU.  The other, newly elected, was previously the medical director of an obstetric and gynaecological hospital in Riga. She told us that she had been preselected and elected ahead of a very large field of men and women. Our discussion with those people ranged mostly over questions of the health of women and general community issues relating to women but also relating to the environment. I feel quite sure that Senator Vallentine has covered that last issue very well.</PARA>
<PARA> We pressed the point about the availability of contraception within the USSR, because we had discovered by then that the easy availability of abortion seemed to have lead to a state of affairs where there had been very little emphasis on the availability and quality of contraception. It seemed to us that repeated abortions were probably very bad in a health sense for the women involved. We were told that the average number of abortions that women are having during their reproductive lives would be from eight to 10. This also seemed to be a great waste of resources and something that we felt could be dealt with very easily simply by making contraceptives available to men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently the quality of condoms in the USSR is very poor, the pill is not widely used nor advocated, and vasectomy is practically unknown. When we mentioned the advantages to the gentleman with whom we were speaking of vasectomy he seemed quite shocked. He told us that people in the USSR are conservative generally and men particularly so. We heard about new pension laws, new payments for families with children, and other income supporting measures. This man particularly seemed very keen to get off the question of contraception, but we took it up later, as I will tell the Senate in a few minutes, in another context. </PARA>
<PARA> On that day we also met with the Women's Political Club, which has recently been set up in Moscow and is chaired by Tatiana Ivanovic, who describes herself as a politologist. She is, I think, the equivalent of somebody like political analyst and historian Dr Marian Sawer in Australia. We heard from these women, again, what we had been hearing in the 10 days that we had been in the USSR-that although previously women had been guaranteed a quota of seats in all governments, since there had been free elections women were not being elected in significant numbers; they were not being supported by women; they simply did not have a basis in the community such as we in Western nations have had to establish in our communities. </PARA>
<PARA> They are taking action to overcome this: to develop non-governmental women's organisations, to make better use of the women who are organised into trade unions, but also to start analysing ways in which conditions for women, in the USSR can be eased. There is no doubt about the fact that currently Soviet women are greatly under stress as a result of running households, of maintaining jobs and of having considerable difficulty in keeping their cupboards stocked. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean that Soviet families are starving. It is not understood, I think, in the West that Soviet children receive a hot breakfast and a hot meal at lunchtime each day; that the majority of workers receive a meal at work; that much of their shopping is actually done through the enterprise. In fact, the enterprise on the whole provides an enormous range of supportive systems designed to make life a little easier. </PARA>
<PARA> My last visit that day was to see he editor of a wonderful women's magazine established in 1914 by Ilyanova Lenin, Lenin's oldest sister. It is the largest women's magazine in the USSR, with 24 million subscriptions and a readership of 100 million. It receives 150,000 letters a year and each of these is replied to. Its editor is Zoya Krylova, who is also a member of parliament and who is waging what may be a very effective campaign on the very issues that were of concern to us- the representation of women, developing women's political acumen and representation, and the issue of contraception and women's health and the standard of health services for women generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that one of our group made that Mr Yeltsin might be persuaded to have a vasectomy as a part of an educational campaign was one that appealed mightily to her. I do not know whether she will follow it through or not but I can see the story making headlines in a future issue of the USSR magazine Women at Work. </PARA>

<TITLE>Administrative Appeals Tribunal</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity afforded by this public interest debate to draw to the attention of the Senate what I consider to be a serious problem confronting people who wish to pursue appeals through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988 I was asked by a constituent to assist him in pursuing a compensation claim through the AAT. When looking at the length of time for which it had dragged on, the delays that had occurred due to the file being misplaced, certain injustices and a reversal of Comcare's previous position, and on checking on what costs would be involved to my constituent, it appeared that he had a legitimate claim for appeal and so I agreed to act as his representative. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time, when my office telephoned the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Hobart and queried what costs would be involved to my constituent, we were advised that there would be no costs apart from those personally incurred by the applicant-for example, the cost of the doctor's report or the solicitors-and this was confirmed to the defendant on two other separate occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the complex nature of the claim and the financial situation of my constituent, being an invalid pensioner, the above information was a major consideration in pursuing this matter and I have his full authority to raise this matter in the Senate. The determination which was forwarded by my constituent advising that the claim was rejected and that he had a right of appeal to the AAT made no mention of costs other than those of a personal nature as explained previously. I quote from the determination:</PARA>
<PARA>You will be liable to pay your legal costs, if any, if you ask for a review and the AAT's decision is not in your favour. If you succeed, costs or part costs may be payable. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have stated, this information is quoted in both the determination and on the document headed `Notice of Rights and Obligations-Commonwealth Employees Compensation Form' which was forward to my constituent. In addition, my constituent personally telephoned the Tribunal to ascertain for himself the information on the question of costs, as he was most concerned about this aspect of the appeal. He was given the same response as my office-that no costs would be incurred, only his personal costs for doctors and other ancillary costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This verbal assurance was given and taken in good faith and therefore the issue of costs was not raised in the usual preliminary conference calls as it was not considered, therefore, to be a problem. The preliminary conference duly took place. </PARA>
<PARA> In July of this year a letter was sent by my constituent seeking written confirmation of the previously given verbal assurances relating to costs, because it was not going to be a simple resolution for the Tribunal. It was obviously going to take some time given the nature of the response in bringing legal representation from the mainland and medical people having to travel many hundreds of miles to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> No response was forthcoming from the AAT on this matter, and it was not until my office contacted the AAT to see why the letter had not been responded to that the advice was received to the effect that costs would in fact be awarded against the applicant by the AAT. I mention that I took this precaution because I was aware of the situation in previous actions and that there was the possibility of costs. So it was necessary to get an absolute clarification. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the fact that it was a compensation case, the awarding of costs-and my constituent is a invalid pensioner as a result of the damage and the injury-is naturally contained in the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act 1971. It appears that no cross-reference is made between this Act and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. I believe that, to prevent a recurrence, and because of the high risk of my constituent being permanently deprived of the small amount of savings that he had, he just said it was not worth the risk, given the strength of the representation that Comcare was going to provide in bringing high level people in to fight this case from near and far-in other words he was perhaps being victimised because of his financial difficulty at the time and the tremendous resources that the Commonwealth was going to throw at him. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that as a minimum, to prevent a recurrence of such a situation, a reference should be made in the AAT Act or in the correspondence that it has with regard to this matter. I am also dismayed that, despite a verbal assurance in the correspondence that it would be answered, to date no written reply has even been received by my constituent. I think that is in poor taste and shows a lack of courtesy and consideration, especially considering the special nature of my constituent's indisposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it most disturbing that in all the dealings with the AAT it took so long before my constituent was fully informed of exactly what the financial implications of pursuing his appeal would be and the tremendous inconvenience that was caused to him. I do not complain about the time that my office took in handling this matter, but I think the whole thing was quite disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> In another case I was approached by a person seeking to lodge an AAT appeal in relation to the higher education contribution reimbursement of fees. Again, it was disturbing to find that in all the information that was sent to this person-by another department this time, the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Canberra-no mention was made of the $300-odd fee which would be incurred should such a person decide to appeal. In this case, had the person not approached my office, that person would have appealed only to find a $300 fee payable, which would perhaps have been higher than the amount involved in the appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> These are but two instances that cause one to begin to wonder just how many other people have found themselves in such circumstances. I therefore urge the Government to take immediate steps to ensure that, when information is given out by either departments or statutory bodies, particularly in relation to AAT appeals, full and detailed information is provided to the people concerned. I believe that it is only fair and just that before a person proceeds with an appeal he or she is made fully aware of the implications of his or her actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I rise to speak on today, the matter of public interest, is one I have mentioned before. My concerns remain the same but some of the information I have is new. It concerns a case I have mentioned before, namely, the Australian Customs Service v. Midford Paramount Pty Ltd and others. I mentioned this before and I am mentioning it now because I am concerned about two aspects of the case. The first is that the Director of Public Prosecutions made a decision to finally lay a prosecution in this matter after relying on information and evidence provided to the Prosecutor by the Department of Industry, Tech- nology and Commerce, namely, by Dr Fitzpatrick from the Light Industry Division. Not only was the provision of that information subsequently found by the magistrate who heard the case to be unreliable but also the witness was totally discredited and there was an air of cover-up permeating the whole Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case basically is this. At the end of 1987 Customs thought that there was a case to investigate regarding the import- ation of shirts from Malaysia by a Wollongong based firm, Midford Paramount Pty Ltd, in that it had a quota under which it had been operating and had sold its business but was still sourcing its imports from Malaysia. The case was based upon the premise that there were conditions attached to the quota which in fact meant that the importer had to be actually owning and manufacturing the shirts in Malaysia in order to attract the concessional duty arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> As events subsequently turned out, that was absolutely erroneous. In fact, the source and the authority for the quota it had was an agreement reached between the Australian Government and the Malaysian Government in 1977. That agreement effectively gave an advantage to Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries. The requirement was that the manufactured product be sourced from in this case Malaysia-Malaysia being an ASEAN country. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the existence of that agreement been made known to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), at the time of the laying of the information, the case would simply not have proceeded because Midford did not breach the conditions that were attached to its quota. But it was the evidence given by Dr Fitzpatrick and the wording of the statement, which he gave evidence that he himself had drafted, that in fact led the DPP to believe that the conditions were that one had to own and manufacture in the country of source. Indeed, at page 7 of Dr Fitzpatrick's statement, which he swore, he said that if any part of this statement was untrue to his knowledge he may be liable for punishment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is DITAC's invariable practice to advise the Australian Customs Service to withdraw quota once it has been advised of circumstances which altered an importers eligibility for quota. </PARA>
<PARA>Upon cross-examination, Dr Fitzpatrick admitted that in fact there was no such precedent. There had been no such example of DITAC finding that a breach had occurred, advising Customs and Customs withdrawing the quota. What had happened previously was that some people who had a quota of this type had voluntarily returned it; handed it in, requiring no verification at all from DITAC. Indeed, in cross-examination Dr Fitzpatrick agreed that the second and third sentence in this statement which I have just quoted from were careless at very best and that the evidence that he had given was therefore not good evidence, but the DPP relied on much of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> As one Miss Hannam, who is a senior legal officer of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, says in her statement dated 6 October 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>During the ensuing months, until April 1988 I met with representatives of Customs, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and other officers of the DPP to discuss the evidence available for possible criminal offences committed by the defendants and others. I examined a large number of documents in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Fitzpatrick would have had access to Cabinet documents which would have evidenced the agreement of 1977 and, indeed, which were subsequently subpoenaed by the defendants and, over the objections of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the magistrate did say that the documents proving the existence of the agreement were to be circulated to the counsel concerned. It was following that that the case was withdrawn by the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fitzpatrick would have had the power to go back to that source document. The truth of the matter is that he did not bother. He simply said there was an anomalies register; that this quota had come from that anomalies register and then the subsequent variation of that in 1982. But he did not go back to the document which, indeed, sourced the authenticity of the quota. He did not do any of the research himself. He relied on information given to him by others, but in Estimates A last Friday he admitted to me that he did not ask people to search all the files. So, at very best, the evidence that was given was careless. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that is equally of concern relates to the behaviour of Customs and, in particular, the behaviour of one Mr Robinson and one Mr O'Shannassy who were operating and reporting to one Mr Strang who heads up the investigative division in New South Wales. Mr Robinson and Mr O'Shannassy were two Customs officers who went to Malaysia in September 1988, after the information had been laid, to get evidence in pursuit of their case. They obtained documents from Midford and various agents and companies associated with it. They obtained some of that evidence on 15 September 1988. In evidence and in her statement Miss Hannam says that indeed the two officers left Malaysia on 15 September 1988. No doubt she was of that view because she was told by Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have three affidavits that I want to table that have been sworn by one U. Mat; by another gentleman, Ong Kok Cheng; and by Keith Neon Woo who, together, have sworn affidavits that, first of all, those officers were still in Malaysia on 16 September 1988, which is the day on which the Malaysian court granted orders preventing those officers from obtaining any documents concerning Midford Paramount Pty Ltd. Nonetheless, those officers were spirited out, and I say it wisely because there is no evidence on the passports of the officers concerned of how they left Malaysia-into Singapore and they left, according to Customs and the evidence given by Mr Kelly last Friday, before the order was made and that was the reason the order could not be served. On the other hand, the evidence of the gentlemen I have just mentioned is that those officers were still in Malaysia on the 16th and, indeed, attempting to get further documentary evidence. I read from the evidence of one of those affidavits:</PARA>
<PARA>In the course of the search, the Chinese officer-</PARA>
<PARA>who was accompanying the two Australian officers-</PARA>
<PARA>enquired whether my wife . . .-</PARA>
<PARA>this is sworn by Mr U. Mat-</PARA>
<PARA>had applied to emigrate to Australia. When I answered in the affirmative, he informed me that it would be in our interest to extend our co-operation to them if she was to secure what she had applied for, since his companions other than the 4th respondents were Australian Government officers. </PARA>
<PARA>There was another statement, sworn by Ong Kok Cheng, in which it was said:</PARA>
<PARA>They asked me whether Shirley Sin Lee Kian could be persuaded to `cooperate' and work with them by which I understood to give evidence against Midford Paramount. They told me that Shirley Sin Lee Kian had applied and was keen to get a permanent residence status in Australia and it could be arranged for her if she would work for them. </PARA>
<PARA>There are similar examples of what I can only describe as coercion that was used to gain control of these documents. Mr Kelly said very positively and very affirmatively in his evidence to Estimates Committee A last Friday that, indeed, these documents had been handed over voluntarily. On that basis, when they came back to Australia, despite the fact that the Malaysian Government had an order asking for the return of those documents, the Customs officer and Mr Strang in particular told the officers that they were going to remain here in Australia and that the documents would be kept. </PARA>
<PARA> This subsequently has caused a great deal of concern between the Australian and the Malaysian governments. The Malaysian Government wished to start extradition proceedings against Mr Robinson and Mr O'Shannassy. However, Mr Kelly, in his evidence last Friday, said that he was not aware of the details surrounding the nature of these activities. This is despite the fact that I have subsequently found out that Mr Kelly went himself to Malaysia to try to hose down the whole episode and to try to deal with the question of extradition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad and sorry case and it is not isolated. The Law Council of Australia, in a submission it made this year to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, said that there is a lack of accountability in the Customs Service. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>This lack of accountability is also reflected in the cavalier approach adopted by investigations officers when conducting their enquiries. The `Elliott Ness' style of raid is still prevalent and there are numerous examples of investigation officers acting in a threatening manner towards importers and their staff. Issues of serious concern include the reliance upon defective Notices to Produce Documents and Warrants by Customs officers who demand immediate access to all documents and records in particular premises and then threaten repercussions if asked to relinquish . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Council gave an excellent example where it said:</PARA>
<PARA>On another recent occasion an investigation officer visited a prominent and respected importer of electronic equipment and under false pretences proceeded to interview junior staff members claiming that he was carrying out a survey for Customs. He then explained that it would be necessary to take certain files and records of the importer's with him for further perusal and that the importer had no legal rights to object or retain possession of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise this matter because the Minister concerned has shown a cavalier disrespect and disregard for this matter. He said that he first became aware of it only when he read an article by Bruce Jones in the Sun-Herald published on 7 October 1990. Two very senior officers who report to him have shown themselves to be less than satisfactory and yet the Minister will not take responsibility in this issue. I seek leave to table the affidavits of Keith Chong Neon Woo, of U. Mat and of Ong Kok Cheng. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in terms of a matter of public interest. I want to put some facts on the table with regard to the current situation in the wool industry. In doing so, I wish I could be making this speech to the Senate in much more satisfactory circumstances. But I also have to say that the recent drop in the dollar is most welcome in terms of the position of not only the wool industry but, of course, all our exporters and a number of our other industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I start talking about the wool industry, I would like to comment briefly on the dollar and interest rates. It has concerned me in this Senate over the last week that claims have been made here that the drop in interest rates that we have seen over the last three or four months has not had any effect on the dollar. I suggest to the people who have made those claims that, if they had addressed them to a reasonable, rational economist, they would have had to come to the conclusion that, had those interest rate drops not occurred, with the events that occurred in Iraq and the oil crisis, our dollar would not have hovered around the 82c, 83c and 84c mark for a time, but in fact would have gone much higher, probably in excess of 90c, and the unemployment figures that we have seen in recent times would have been much worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the recent drop in interest rates certainly is welcome and I believe that it points in the direction that is required in this country to get some of our exporters, some of our businesses and industry in general, back on track. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to lay a few facts on the table about the wool industry. I have before me a table which shows the export figures for the wool industry as follows: In 1979-80, $1.287 billion; in 1980-81, $1.463 billion; in 1981-82, $1.47 billion; in 1982-83, $1.469 billion; in 1983-84, $1.573; in 1984-85, $1.957 billion; in 1985-86, $2.285 billion; in 1986-87, $2.838 billion; in 1987-88, $4.274 billion; and in 1988-89, $4.604 billion. In bringing those figures to the attention of the Senate my objective is to emphasis the importance of the wool industry to the Australian economy. Not only has it been our greatest export earner since Federation but also it has been in the top three export earners in the last 10 years, in most of those years our top export earner. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now read some figures in terms of the current position that we face in terms of the wool industry. The wool stockpile is close to four million bales and is expected to be over five million at the end of the 1990-91 wool selling season in June next year. The stockpile is expected to remain at that level or more in 1991-92 and 1992-93. The Australian Wool Corporation has never sold more than five million bales in a year, and in the 1980s average annual sales were between 3.7 and four million. Production for 1990-91 is estimated at close to six million bales. The trade is expected to buy about four million bales, leaving the Corporation to buy up to two million. The cost to the Corporation of buying these two million bales is estimated at $1.6 billion. Storage and handling will be an additional cost. The current Wool Corporation debt is $2 billion and is expected to peak at more than $2.5 billion this season. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool tax or levy to support this type of buying would have to be well above the current 25 per cent level to maintain a reasonable grower equity in the stockpile next year, and even higher in subsequent years. However, this does not address the continuing oversupply situation and exacerbates the already critical viability problems of growers and the Wool Corporation. Even the most optimistic demand projections for next year do not begin to bring supply and demand into balance. As every one per cent of the wool tax yields $40m, the recently announced increase from 18 to 25 per cent will not be adequate to maintain grower equity unless the wool stockpile is stabilised. The proposed legislation of a 30 per cent ceiling plus a possible 20 per cent surcharge could be necessary, but it would be self-defeating as growers are bankrupted by the dramatically reduced net returns for the wool for several years. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the already announced low value slaughter scheme to humanely slaughter old sheep at an estimated cost of up to $2 a head, a commercial scheme to slaughter the younger sheep must be considered. I would just like to say that unfortunately, in my view, the industry has no choice but to put in place a commercial slaughter scheme. In other words, I am saying that in terms of the situation now with the oversupply of wool the industry is at D-day and it is absolutely essential that the numbers be got down to around 130 million so that we have some chance of equating production with demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, and as unpalatable and difficult as it is, I cannot see any other way. If this action is not taken the stockpile will become an albatross around the neck of the industry and more and more producers will be bankrupted as the tax goes up. This is not a debate about the floor price or the Corporation's existence or non-existence. Regardless of the floor price or the role of the Corporation, supply has to be reduced to demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1974, as I have already stated, sales have ranged between 3.4 and 4.5 million bales with an average of just under four million bales. This means that the Corporation will have to buy close to two million bales this year if the market does not improve. Figures prepared by the Farm Consultancy Group in Western Australia show that between now and November 1991, if the trade buys 4 million bales and the Corporation two million bales the tax to service this will be in the order of 38 per cent. If the trade buys three million bales and the Corporation three million, the tax will be in the order of 45 per cent. If the trade buys two million bales and the Corporation four million, the tax will have to be in excess of 50 per cent-if the Corporation is to maintain an equity of 50 per cent in the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation cannot continue because all that will be left of the wool industry is a huge stockpile and almost every grower in Australia will be bankrupt. To summarise what I am saying, the wool industry has reached D-day. The industry has no choice but to put in place a commercial scheme to reduce flock numbers by 50 million, to around 130 million. To do otherwise would be to condemn most woolgrowers to bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this is the most cost effective short term method of getting production back in line with demand. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Wool Corporation to purchase an additional two million bales over the next 12 to 18 months would cost not less than $1.6 billion plus interest, handling and holding costs. This is on top of the Wool Corporation's debt of $2 billion. The costs of further purchases for the stockpile and maintaining it will mean growers will face a tax of between 35 and 45 per cent at the end of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> A commercial slaughter scheme would cost in the order of $400m and would in fact save growers an enormous amount of money. As unpalatable as it is and as much as I hate the prospect, the industry has no option. Primary Industries Minister John Kerin and his advisers should immediately communicate with all growers as they did in May of this year. I am astonished at how incorrect the information that was given then was. Those who are responsible should be made accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> The day has come when the Minister's office, the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council must spell out precisely the state of the industry. In February we heard the tax had to be 15 per cent, then it jumped a couple of months later to 25 per cent then a little bit later the Minister made a decision to set it at 20 per cent. Now we have prospective legislation before us for a tax of 50 per cent. That is a totally unsatisfactory and untenable position for any industry to be in. They must get on with the job, no matter how unpalatable and undesirable it might be, of putting Australia's wool industry back on an even keel. Not to do this will be to tax producers out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an issue about party politics or about political point scoring; it is too serious for that. It is about putting what has been Australia's most important export industry since Federation back on its feet, and getting it back to being an international trading force. The medicine is not nice; it is downright untenable and extremely difficult to administer. I remind the Senate that we are talking about people in terms of the wool industry; rural people and the people in the support industries who live in the cities. Some vote Labor, some Liberal, some National, some Democrat, some independent and some informal. The political point scoring that has gone on this week when debating the rural crisis has amazed me. </PARA>
<PARA> To give an example of how serious the situation is for some people, I want to refer to the local cafe in a little place on the south coast of Western Australia called Hopetoun. Hopetoun is a town of some 300 people, mainly pensioners, and it relies very much on the holiday period. That cafe, in the first week of the holidays, took a total of an additional $50 across the counter. The chap who owns the place and runs it is John Crocker, and he had people coming in there who actually asked him for three half-pieces of fish and a dollar's worth of chips to feed their family. So I must point out that the situation is serious. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also recognise causes of the problems and the things that we can do. There is little point in talking about or blaming what is occurring overseas. We all know the problems with the American farm support and the European farm support, and we know the efforts that the Cairns Group is making. But there are some things that can be done in terms of the Australian situation. There must be further examination of the part that monetary policy has played in this country in terms of putting the wool industry and other businesses where they are today. There must be more cognisance taken of the effect that even the still relatively high interest rates have on us when compared with our competitors, and we must look very carefully at fiscal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to deal in the time that I have here with the position in the States. I think the States have to take an enormous amount of the blame for some of the problems that we have in industry today. If I just run quickly through the tax increases in the 1990-91 year, we find these figures: New South Wales 10 per cent; Victoria 16.3 per cent; Queensland 7.5 per cent; Western Australia 8.1 per cent; South Australia a massive 18.2 per cent; and Tasmania 12.6 per cent. I do not consider that fiscal policy management to be responsible. I find it very irresponsible, and a great contributor to one of our main problems-that is, inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask ourselves these questions in terms of the economic management of this country: why has New Zealand an inflation rate of 5 per cent, compared with Australia's which is much higher; why has transport reform not been moved on quicker; why has waterfront reform not been moved on quicker and more effectively; and why there has not been effective labour market reform?</PARA>
<PARA> I have endeavoured to outline in the time that I have had the situation which exists currently in the wool industry. I have identified a number of key areas which will help alleviate the problems that exist there. But it is not only about the wool industry, it is about all our exporters, the coal industry and others, and it is about small business. As I said earlier, the wool industry itself has to make a very hard decision, and this is an industry that I have been involved in all my life. I do not believe it has any choice in terms of our current situation but to get supply and demand under control and I can see no way to do that effectively other than by putting a commercial slaughter program in place and getting our numbers back to the 130 million that I talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that I have mentioned fiscal management, and I believe it is necessary in terms of our current situation for particularly the States and also the Commonwealth to look very closely at the expenditure patterns and, in fact, put in place mini-Budgets which will allow them to lower the heavy tax regimes that they have placed on the Australian community this year. It is essential that these types of actions be taken because we need to restore confidence to business, we need to restore our international competitiveness across all industries, we need to get our inflation down, and hold down our current account. Otherwise, I fear for all our exporters, not just the wool industry, and I also fear for our unemployment figures. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These matters were set in train some weeks ago based on classified material. The first steps were taken on 1 and 2 October, when a suggestion was made to Navy personnel in Sydney that it was discretionary whether they wore their uniforms to work, and also that they should vary their daily routine. This situation has been reviewed from week to week and a decision was made to direct Navy personnel in the Sydney area not to wear uniforms to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is essential that at this stage I reject those accusations that have been made in Sydney, not the least by the senior Sydney politician, that this is in any way due to questions of harassment or otherwise. This has had a very wide currency on various talkback radio programs this morning. It is typical of their standard of journalism that it has been given such a run. It has also been kicked along by Mr Greiner, at least in his first interview, although I notice that in his second interview, having spoken to me, he qualified some of the statements he had been making.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not a decision that relates to domestic politics or residents in Australia, but to other information that I and the Navy have available that would be of concern. I am aware, in answer to the second part of Senator Durack's question, that there is widespread community concern. Again I stress that that is based on the erroneous publicity that emanated from a newspaper this morning and certain talkback radio programs.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of harassment, some naval personnel have been harassed in Sydney; that comes with the territory. I think that it is despicable that they have been harassed, but they are readily identifiable and any clown who wants to abuse them in the street knows that they will not respond. The people who have been involved in harassing have my utmost contempt, but it would certainly not be justification for telling people not to wear their uniform.</PARA>
<PARA> On the fourth part of the question put to me by Senator Durack, the matter is being reviewed weekly and will continue to be reviewed weekly. On that basis I will leave it there. But let me put one other thing to rest. There has been an accusation from the Premier of New South Wales that this is a slur on the Muslim community in Australia. I am standing here to say that it is not; it is nothing to do with the Muslim community in Australia. I point out to the Senate that I am one of the few politicians who have gone on public record in the past few weeks defending the Muslim community in this country. The fact is that members of that community have been vilified by the yellow press of Sydney sending some snot-nosed reporter down to stick microphones under their noses asking them the most ridiculous and provocative questions known.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other question that has been raised on this matter, and it has been raised a few times, is `Where is the leadership of the Australian Muslim community? Why don't they speak out on the matter?'. I would like to say that most of them would love to, but most of them cannot do so. Most of them have hundreds of relatives in very vulnerable positions around the rest of the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA> If they were to adopt a high public profile on that, they would pay a massive price for speaking out. I do not expect them to do so. No-one in this chamber should. In summary, these decisions were made on the most valid of security grounds. I assure Senator Durack of that. I would be pleased to have him personally briefed on the matter. I am sure that, as a former Attorney-General, he is aware that I cannot publicly release those reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the suggestion made by Professor Neil Foster of the University of New South Wales that an alternative method of destruction of chemical weapons is being developed, namely, the direct application of super critical water technology, as it is called, to chemical weapons stocks. I am also aware of the comments made by Professor Foster that there is a common belief in the US Army Research Office that the high temperature incineration unit on Johnston Atoll will never be fired up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can only say in this respect that the only currently operating technology for destruction of chemical weapons is high temperature incineration and the only facility currently available to destroy stocks of the US nerve agents is on Johnston Atoll. With my colleague Senator Robert Ray I had a very thorough discussion on chemical weapons issues with Secretaries Baker and Cheney last week in Washington, in which there was no suggestion at all in any of their comments that the Johnston Atoll facility operation would not go ahead as planned.</PARA>
<PARA> Both Australia and the United States are deeply committed to the destruction and total eradication of chemical weapons. We are agreed that the sooner the process of destruction of existing stockpiles is started, and the sooner their total destruction can be completed in the context of the comprehensive international convention now in the final stages of negotiation, the better off the world will be.</PARA>
<PARA> At last week's AUSMIN talks in Washington, Senator Robert Ray and I made clear the basis for Australia's support of the Johnston Atoll facility, which is, in short, that it not be used except for the destruction of stocks already there and those being brought there from Germany and perhaps elsewhere in the Pacific, that it be closed down after those operations are finished, and that its operations be conducted in an environmentally sound way. The final communique from that meeting explicitly stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The United States reiterated its intention to operate the facility in an environmentally safe manner, and reaffirmed its intention to destroy on the island only those chemical weapons already stored there, the US CW stocks being shipped from the Federal Republic of Germany, and obsolete World War II munitions which may be found in the Pacific area.</PARA>
<PARA>I should just finally, however, make clear for the record that if new, more efficient technologies became available and were safe, we would be glad to see them used. Our objective remains the early destruction of chemical weapons in an environmentally sound manner. We have no commitment to any particular technology. I make clear, however, that the Australian Government's own scientific advisers considered alternative forms of destruction before concluding, and reporting to us, that high temperature incineration was the best method currently available.</PARA>

A lot of us could make the distinction between the political decision involved and the military participation. Some could not. Some lacked that sophistication. That was a pity. I hope, as does Senator Newman, I think, that the cleansing operation that went on a year or two ago in the form of a welcome home parade made some people rest more easily in those circumstances than they previously did.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Devereux does raise a matter which has been brought to my attention by a number of senators on both sides of parliament-not only by Senator Devereux but also by Senator Tate and, in the House of Representatives, Mr Duncan Kerr. I have to acknowledge those representations and, as a consequence of those strident representations from, in particular, Mr Kerr and Senator Tate, I have had a close look at this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be acknowledged that the Australian Furniture Research and Development Institute was established in 1989 to undertake research, consulting and testing programs for furniture products. The Government's ceding money has, in fact, provided for the Institute to get off the ground. Last year, the Tasmanian Labor Government provided $30,000, followed by another $513,575 from the Commonwealth Government. This was the first allocation of Commonwealth funds under the Helsham agreement. I also understand that the second allocation of $536,400 under the agreement was provided on 12 October, last week.</PARA>
<PARA> I must also say, in this context, that it is not intended that the Institute be totally reliant on government funding. For its long term future, it recognises, I believe, that it must rely on industry support. I understand that in that context the Australian Manufacturing Council believes that the Institute is, in fact, a role model for that support. However, because of that ceding money from State and Federal governments, the Institute is able to provide a wide range of technical services to the national furniture and timber manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Devereux raises the question of the Scientific Services Laboratories in the Department of Administrative Services. Last year those laboratories decided to enter into furniture testing and evaluation. In response, as I said earlier, I have received quite a number of representations, the basic thrust of those representations being that this initiative would adversely affect the Institute's becoming a viable ongoing concern. I met with representatives of the Institute yesterday, having pursued the issue, and decided that, when my Department does receive requests from Commonwealth departments and agencies for furniture testing or evaluation, this activity will be referred to the Institute.</PARA>
<PARA> I have reached this decision for three particular reasons. I think there is compelling evidence of the need for a single national body to research, test and appraise furniture products to national and also international standards. Secondly, I believe that there is a need for the Commonwealth to demonstrate support for this combined government-industry initiative to establish what will be and is, in fact, a centre of excellence in furniture technology. Thirdly, there is a strong relationship between testing furniture products and establishing a system of accreditation as well as developing industry standards, and the Institute is best suited to cover those three strains.</PARA>
<PARA> To enhance the primary role of the Institute as the national centre for furniture research and the setting of industry standards, the Institute has offered a seat on its board to a representative from my Department and I have accepted this particular offer. The arrangement that I have outlined will operate for the next three years, at which time it will be reviewed. Until then, as I said, all requests for furniture testing through the Department of Administrative Services will go to the Institute and the Scientific Services Laboratories will not duplicate the activities of the Institute.</PARA>

My question is in two parts: firstly, in view of the fact that the Minister invited the welfare rights centres earlier this year to put a submission for funding to his Department and, following the Budget announcement, promised that although they had missed out this year they would be included in the next Budget, can the Minister confirm that it is indeed his Department and not some other department that will make this allocation available? Secondly, is the Minister aware that complex changes in the social security budget this year have resulted in greatly increased numbers approaching the welfare rights centres for assistance, which proves that such centres are useful and necessary to the community? In view of this, would the Minister be prepared to bring forward his promised funding to help these centres which, because of lack of funding, are in danger of closing down long before the next Budget session?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> As far as complex changes increasing the numbers of people using welfare rights centres is concerned, while I do not have any concrete evidence that that is true, I would imagine that it is so. It is not hard to believe that there were some substantial changes introduced during the Budget and, naturally enough, that will lead to an increase in the number of people using welfare rights centres.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted, of course, that not everybody goes to a welfare rights centre because of Commonwealth problems. Many people going to welfare rights centres have State issues in mind, be it housing or a whole range of issues that they want to take up with them. I think the main complaint of welfare rights centres, at least as it was put to me, was that some States, in particular New South Wales, have been withdrawing from their funding and they wanted the Commonwealth to take up the place that had previously been occupied by the States. I think there is some merit in their case. Obviously in the course of the next Budget deliberations we will have to determine just where that merit comes in our priorities list. I, for one, will be a voice raised hoping that we can get some extra funds to them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I did notice that in Hansard the other day some conservative senators were claiming bragging rights for the Fraser Government on its alleged, by them, record on soil conservation. One of the things that I am particularly proud of in my period in the resources portfolio in the last Hawke Government is that we did forge a bipartisan arrangement with the Opposition on soil conservation. We did so because we believed it was important that parliament signal to land-holders that the most serious environmental issue in Australia was that of land degradation. There was a bipartisan political will to try to provide a platform to encourage them to address the issue as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend Bruce Lloyd for joining us on that and indeed, in essence, endorsing the statement made by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, last year-the first ever national environment statement made by a Prime Minister-in which he committed this Government and future governments to a decade-long program of soil conservation. So it is against that background that I am somewhat reluctant to descend to the level of trying to turn a major issue such as this back into a political football. On that basis I will, in a restrained way, simply correct the record and not enter into the spirit of being invited to undermine confidence of land-holders that there is indeed some political argument about the importance of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are that the single most significant event carried out in the last decade or more on soil conservation was carried out by Mr Kerin in 1983. When we came to power in 1983, Mr Kerin moved immediately to repeal legislation that was on the books from the Fraser Government that there be a subsidy for the clearing of land. One of the problems for soil conservation has been that land degradation is generated by overcutting and overclearing. There was a subsidy to encourage that by the former Government. Mr Kerin remedied that immediately and legislatively.</PARA>
<PARA> In the period of the Whitlam Government, Moss Cass, then a Labor Minister, commenced an inquiry into land degradation. The inquiry proceeded and reported in the period of the Fraser Government. The then Minister responsible, Kevin Newman, is to be commended for promoting the findings of that inquiry and proposing measures on soil conservation. Unfortunately for him, his proposals were slashed by the razor gang in the dying period of the Fraser Government which said that the responsibility was not a national one but a State one.</PARA>
<PARA> In August 1983, Mr Kerin introduced a Bill to form a national soil conservation council. That Bill was supported, of course, by the Government and I believe by the Australian Democrats. It was voted against by the Opposition, obviously in a demonstration of its commitment to the issue. In the first year of funding for the national soil conservation program, the Government allocated $5m. In the last two years-1989-90 and 1990-91-our funding base has been $49m, and we have committed $260m to soil conservation programs over the decade from 1990 to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, Mr President, that when we came to power there was no Federal government involvement in soil conservation and no Federal government funding. One of the things that this Government has been able to do is extract a commitment-if there is ever a future coalition government-that it will change that and will help fund a national soil conservation program along the lines that have been bipartisanly agreed to address this urgent national environmental issue.</PARA>

Senator Parer is talking about a great Soviet plot to take over the whole purchasing of government, State and Federal. There is no need for glasnost in this Government; we are approaching government purchasing in a way that Senator Parer would never understand. He never understood it with the Purchase Australia campaign, and he would not understand it now.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer refers to the item being on the agenda for the special Premiers Conference. He may know that-fair enough, he might have grabbed it out of his leaked document-but let me ask him to note that on the whole question of government purchasing, the whole impetus being given to coordinating administrative services Ministers has not only been from the Federal level. We have also had support and encouragement from Mr Webster, the Minister in New South Wales, and, next Friday in Perth, there will be a meeting of State and Federal administrative services Ministers where the question of government purchasing is, I believe, to be on the agenda.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should preface my answer to this question by saying that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) statistical series, `Time lost through industrial disputation' is not the most important measure of lost productivity to industry. The most important measures are, of course, the levels of time lost through accidents and industrial disease, and time lost through what I call the silent strike; that is, absenteeism from work and high labour turnover. Both those measures are running at about 10 times the amount of time lost to industry than through disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is a fascination in the media, and an absolute obsession in the Opposition, about industrial disputes and they do focus on this quite closely. The latest figures were released by the Bureau on 2= October for June 1990, and for the year ended June 1990-that is, for the month and for the year. The figures released by the Bureau show that in June 1990 there were 21,400 working days lost in 86 separate disputes. This is the lowest June working day lost figure since the ABS commenced its monthly series in 1967. In the 12 months to June 1990, there were 1,173,100 working days lost, which is 9 per cent lower than the working day lost record for the year ended June 1989, and 31 per cent lower than for the year ended 30 June 1988. The lowest financial year working day lost figure was recorded last year since the financial year 1967-68.</PARA>
<PARA> The working days lost per 1,000 employees figure of 184, which is another measure, for the year to June 1990, is the lowest financial year figure since this measure was introduced on a monthly basis; that is since the Bureau commenced to record statistics on that measure. At the end of June 1990, the Hawke Government had been in office for 91 months compared to the Fraser Government being in office for 88 months. So, one can make some rough comparisons between the record of the two Governments based on that monthly duration of office. The monthly average number of working days lost since March 1983 is now 113,500, a 54 per cent improvement over the average recorded under the Fraser Government. When one uses the working days lost measure per 1,000 employees, the improvement is even more marked. The annualised average number of working days lost per 1,000 employees since March 1983 is now 228, which is a 61 per cent lower figure than the average of 591 recorded during the period 1976 to 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the major disputes that occurred in the period that the Bureau reported, two of the three major disputes were reported within the Australian Capital Territory which for a small population is a record. One of the disputes was about the administration of the Australian Capital Territory Government and the other about teachers. It is interesting to note that that is a Liberal Administration with a very high level of industrial disputation compared to the rest of the country. On the other hand, Western Australia, a Labor Administration, had record total gross figures; the lowest number of working days lost since the ABS commenced collection. It also had the lowest number of working days lost as a percentage of 1,000 employees.</PARA>
<PARA> They are heartening figures. They are consistent with our performance in Government. It is fair to say that in the current period there have been more industrial disputes attending the Australian Council of Trade Unions in-the-field national wage case campaign, and I expect the figures in the next quarter to show an increase in industrial disputation because of that campaign. However, it is interesting to note that the Opposition spokesman for industrial relations, Mr Howard, has told employers that they should continue with that campaign and continue in direct negotiations, bypassing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. A feature of direct negotiations is a high level of industrial disputes, so when the figures for this next quarter come out reporting the level of industrial activity due to the in-the-field campaign, I do not expect Mr Howard to criticise them, its being a model similar to the one that he is advocating for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Mrs Kelly has reached agreement with Mr Pearce, the Western Australian Minister. I understand that the basis for that agreement is the adoption of the Shark Bay regional plan as a basis for ongoing management of the area.

I am not exactly certain what those boundaries are, but I shall inquire of the Minister and bring that before the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe at the heart of the agreement was the capacity of both the Commonwealth and the State to accept that management plan as the basis for future management of the area and to ensure that in its management we can take into account the views of local people. It has never been the case that all of the pastoral properties around the Shark Bay area were to be included in a final boundary, even though pastoralists seem to form the heart of the opposition. I believe the view that not all those pastoral properties were to be included has in fact happened now that we actually have an agreed boundary. I will make further inquiries of the Minister and try to produce that agreement in the Senate in two weeks time.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that the Salvation Army and the Smith Family report an increase of approximately 50 per cent in their emergency relief claims during this financial year? Is the Minister aware that unemployment has risen by 25 per cent between September 1989 and September 1990, and that the Prime Minister has often stated that unemployment is the major cause of poverty? Does the Minister agree that this outcome is the result of the economic slowdown engineered by the Government's high interest policy on the basis of the Government's own explanation of that policy? Finally, does the Minister agree that the concern about the worsening of child poverty expressed by Archbishop Hollingworth, as a result of the Government's high interest policy, was both justified and constructive and should not be dismissed lightly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the particular report from the Salvation Army which was the premise of Senator Spindler's question but in relation to the question of unemployment, I am able to say that the Government's track record on employment growth has been very well proven indeed. Employment growth has been almost five times the average annual rate recorded during the previous Government's term. We have generated over 1.6 million jobs since we took office, of which over 90 per cent were in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the case that more recently, of course, the labour market has been subdued, with employment falling in August and September, but there has been no major shake-out. The success of the accord in preventing a wages blow-out has helped prevent a collapse in employment in that respect. The accord has, of course, achieved unprecedented real wage moderation in the face of a booming economy. The rise in the unemployment rate since late 1989 was almost entirely due, as Senator Spindler should be aware, to the significant rise in labour force participation.</PARA>
<PARA> That participation rate is showing its normal cyclical response and in the face of the slower labour market it is starting to decline. That is one of the key factors, of course, in the present unemployment figures that we are now seeing. The slowdown in demand growth which is a product, among other things, of deliberately high interest rates has been the centrepiece of government policy along with fiscal policy for some time now. That slowdown is necessary to produce the reduced current account deficit. It cannot be achieved without affecting both output and the labour market. The Budget forecasts an increase in unemployment this year, as Senator Spindler would be aware, although it should start to decline next year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position on the particular question of child poverty-and there is no disagreement between the Prime Minister and Archbishop Hollingworth in this respect-is that child poverty continues to be a matter of concern for us. We have made very significant commitments over the past three years in this respect with funding of the order of $3 billion being devoted to increasing payments to families and children most in need, payments that simply would not have been made if this Government and Ministers like Mr Keating, Senator Richardson and Mr Howe had not been in Cabinet to advance and pursue them with all the vigour that is appropriate to this very difficult subject area.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister wants to make very clear-and no doubt he has had the opportunity to say so himself today-that he will continue to work with Peter Hollingworth to address the needs of Australia's children. It is a matter that we are very conscious of. It is affected, clearly, by the unemployment situation, which was mentioned in the first part of the question. We know that, but our whole economic strategy is designed to redress that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley should be aware that a number of honourable senators have expressed interest in this matter, as has the Privacy Foundation and a whole host of community organisations. There are a number of government agencies which would be involved in the current plan that was announced in the Budget. They include the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which pays pensions; the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which pays Austudy; and the Department of Community Services and Health, which is responsible for the first home owners scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the data matching proposals is to pick up two problems. The first is the detection of duplicate payments, and we would do that by matching information from the other departments. We shall also attempt to secure some knowledge on those who are seeking to frustrate government income tests in particular.</PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the system would work is that the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Community Services and Health will give family identity data, the current recipients of their payments and, where applicable, that of their partner or parents to my Department at regular intervals as is necessary to achieve that stated Government aim.</PARA>
<PARA> Tax file number details will be supplied to my Department as part of that family identity data. They will be given to it by these other income support agencies. The Department of Social Security will at the same time match that family identity data supplied by other income support agencies with the family identity data of its own clients. This will detect, we trust, all incorrect duplicate payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The income test provisions are being strengthened through the comparison of income disclosed to the income support agencies with that disclosed to the Australian Taxation Office. That will be achieved by my Department seeking taxable income and dependent spouse rebate data for the income support clients whose records are included in the computer matching process.</PARA>
<PARA> In nominating the cases to the Australian Taxation Office for which the Department is seeking taxable income details for comparison purposes, the Department of Social Security will indicate to the Taxation Office the tax file number of the cases concerned and a minimum amount of confirmatory information so that the Taxation Office can be satisfied about the accuracy of the data it is giving back to the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA> However, as honourable senators probably know, my Department has an arrangement with the Australian Taxation Office whereby social security clients who do not already have a tax file number can apply for one through a Department of Social Security regional office. It is notified to the client by the Australian Taxation Office and at the same time the Taxation Office also notifies my Department. The Australian Taxation Office has sole responsibility for the issue of tax file numbers and the computer matching arrangements will not change that.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government believes that the connection of those taxation and income support payment systems in the way in which I have just described will detect a considerable number of incorrect payments which previously could not have been detected. All of that will be done under the monitoring and the very watchful eye of the Privacy Commissioner. Furthermore, even if the system were to break down during operation, instead of technicians being able to get into the system to make sure that information is further protected-as is now the case- we will ensure that no entry into the system can be undertaken without a representative of the Privacy Commissioner being present and unlocking the system. I do not believe that we can put in place any more safeguards in the use of tax file numbers than we have now announced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure that, speaking from the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, I am able to answer a question relating to an international covenant that has been referred to in this question. But let me do the best I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My understanding is that the well-being, health and safety of Indonesian fishermen conducting illegal activities in the Australian fishing zone are checked, firstly, when Navy patrol boat crews board their vessels at sea and, secondly, by the Australian Fisheries Service officer when the boat is brought into harbour. In terms of quarantine function, the crew are checked by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers for communicable quarantine diseases and checks are made for any diseases in animals.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been cases of boats being found beached on islands in the Bonaparte Gulf area in which chickens or whatever have been carried from Indonesia for meat or eggs at sea and those chickens have got loose. We have been concerned from a quarantine angle about the possibility of Newcastle disease. On the one occasion that I am aware of that occurring, the quarantine officer killed all the chickens and made sure that there was no possibility of a communicable, quarantinable disease being brought into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Any problems from a health point of view that have been identified were referred to the Broome Regional Hospital for treatment, as have any dental problems. The caretaker at the area in which these people are held has the obligation to supply food and water. I understand that it is an obligation that he discharges quite well. The Broome Regional Hospital has advised that in recent times four Indonesians have been treated for tuberculosis, about 15 people have been treated for cuts, abrasions and urinary tract infections, one person has been treated for an injury received when using a fishing line and one case of hepatitis B has been treated.</PARA>
<PARA> If people are able to walk in and out of the station-I do not know whether that is true; I cannot verify the assertion in Senator Vanstone's question-it must only be applicable on the basis that there is no risk of disease and that their human rights are not inhibited, given that they were illegally in an Australian fishing zone in the first place.</PARA>

Secondly, the Minister was asked why, if the fishermen are allowed to walk freely in and out, we bother to mark the area as a quarantine area. Surely we do not bother to do that unless there is a problem. If there is a problem, why are those people allowed to walk freely in and out of the area?

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The rebate to which the honourable senator referred is the pensioner rebate and has been available to pensioners since 1982-83. The rebate ensures that persons wholly or mainly dependent on Australian social security or repatriation pensions do not have to pay tax on those pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable senator indicated, a pensioner receiving the single-rate of age pension was able to receive up to $8,262 in 1989-90 and not pay tax. The amount of $8,262 represents the pension of $6,962 for the year plus $1,300 of non-pension income. The rebate shades out at 12.5 cents in the dollar for each dollar of taxable income in excess of $8,262; ie it is fully extinguished at an income of $13,574.</PARA>
<PARA> For 1990-91, the level of the pensioner rebate will be raised so that a pensioner receiving the single-rate of age pension can earn an additional $40 per week of non-pension income and not pay tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Persons in receipt of a low level of Commonwealth superannuation pension who satisfy the income and assets tests and the residency requirements will be eligible for a full or part age or service pension and hence for the pensioner tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, provided a person satisfied the residency and assets test requirements, an aged person receiving $8,000 of superannuation in 1989-90 would have been eligible for a pension of some $3,980. On the total taxable income of $11,980, the person would have received a rebate of tax of $199.25.</PARA>
<PARA> Those in receipt of a Commonwealth superannuation pension who are not eligible for a part age or service pension pay income tax on the same basis as other individuals.</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989-90 Budget, the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security announced a comprehensive and far-reaching retirement income policy. This policy recognises the need to balance the requirements of providing adequate income support to those whose need is greatest whilst encouraging greater self-provision in retirement through superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is introducing a better integrated system of social security and tax administration for retirees. A three-stage reform process will be implemented, culminating in 1995 in the complete removal of all age and service pensioners-both full rate and part rate-from the taxation system and making part rate pensioners subject only to the withdrawal rate of their pension entitlement. This means that from 1995, no age or service pensioner will pay tax.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the pensioner rebate will be withdrawn beyond the pension shade-out range. This means that a superannuant of age-pension age would be eligible for the pensioner tax rebate and pay tax at the applicable marginal rate plus the rebate shade-out rate on income above the pension shade-out point.</PARA>
<PARA> In this way all retired persons at the same income level will be treated equally and there will be continuity of treatment between those receiving an age or service pension and those whose non-pension income places them beyond the pension cut-out point.</PARA>

I have a further answer to supplement the answer which I gave yesterday. The Australian company number will help us move towards the uniform registration system of companies by giving a unique number to every company. It is a fact that the Corporations Act 1989 includes the requirement for all companies to display their Australian company number on all business documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In September 1990, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) released an information sheet which described the purpose and use of the ACNs in detail.

Other companies will be advised separately by mid-November, except where the ASC is unable to reach them because they are inactive or defunct.</PARA>
<PARA> While the introduction of the ACN may result in some incidental cost to Australian business, the national system of corporate regulation facilitated in part by the use of ACNs is expected to result, overall, in a considerable cost saving to business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator Boswell on the sale and lease back of a boiler and the sale of a veneer mill and some questions as to how that fitted or did not fit into the agreement that the Government had with the mill in Ravenshoe. I have this answer for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The financial advisers of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Price Waterhouse, Canberra, visited the APS Ravenshoe mill on 31 May 1990 in the course of the review of the assistance provided to the mill, which was initiated by the Department on 30 March 1990 as part of the ongoing evaluation of the structural adjustment package.</PARA>
<PARA> Price Waterhouse was advised on the day of its visit by the manager of the mill that he, the manager, had just been informed by the head office that the head office had sold to AGC Finance Co. and leased back a wood waste fire boiler which had been purchased by Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd with Commonwealth assistance. The cost of the boiler was approximately $412,000. The sale of the boiler to AGC was prior to the appointment of the receiver and managers.</PARA>
<PARA> A veneer hardwood timber plant was sold for approximately $425,000 prior to the appointment of the receiver and managers in April 1990. This plant was no longer required because the APS mill was being restructured from a hardwood operation to processing plantation timbers. The sale of this equipment was only advised to the Department in the receiver's and manager's letter of 19 September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> On 16 October 1990 the Minister referred to the Commonwealth Attorney-General the two reports received from the receivers and managers of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd concerning the company's use of Commonwealth loan and subsidy payments. This was in accordance with the Government's decision of 25 September 1990 that, if satisfactory clarification of expenditure of Commonwealth funds provided under the assistance agreement were not received, the matter would be referred to the Attorney-General to investigate what legal action should be taken with regard to any moneys not accounted for. As will be apparent from the above answer, the Government did not know of these sales beforehand and, accordingly, I did not give my permission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Macdonald, a couple of days ago in this chamber I tabled a very long answer which I thought covered all of the questions asked on the Ravenshoe Mill including those from Senator Macdonald, Senator O'Chee and Senator Boswell. I will go back and check whether anything was missed. It is a very long document and I thought it had covered all that Senator Macdonald had asked. If it has not, I will try to find out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am on my feet, in respect of the answer I tabled, the paragraph on the second page of the document which referred to the ownership structure of several companies as a complex corporate structure-this is a point that I think Senator O'Chee made in an adjournment contribution recently; I am not sure whether it was last night or the night before-was typed in error. The paragraph should have read: The Associated Plywood Sales Pty Ltd (APS) sawmill operates as a division of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, which was part of the Scotwood Street Ltd group of companies. National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd and the APS Sawmill at Ravenshoe use the business name Timbertech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do, just briefly. I point out to Senator Richardson that parts 7, 8 and 9 of question No. 141 have not been answered. They relate to whether the Government does accept that extended credit was given by business people in Ravenshoe to this mill because the creditors believed the company was being supported by the Government. Paragraph 9 asks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government accept that it has a moral if not legal obligation to reimburse creditors who extended credit on the understanding of the Government's intention?</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to question No. 142, paragraph 4 asks whether or not the Government would be prepared to make long term low interest loans or grants available to the people in the Ravenshoe area wishing to set up tourist industries and tourist businesses in that area. Paragraph 5 asks for specific information on what steps have been taken by the Government in accordance with its promises to commence reafforestation projects; what areas of land have been acquired; how many people have been employed and how long that will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make Senator Richardson aware of this matter in view of the comments he made in tabling the lengthy answer to which he referred. He suggested that I and my colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have politicised this matter in the way we have gone about it. I assure Senator Richardson that at all times I have been involved and interested in this matter only in an attempt to do something for the people of Ravenshoe who have lost so much. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Richardson: in the spirit of not making it political, on 18 July this year I wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, in what I thought was a very moderate letter, which gave credit where credit was due. I will quote one paragraph from that letter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of your Government's generous and widely publicised offers of assistance grants to the mill for retooling, the business people of Ravenshoe had no hesitation in extending credit to the company. They did this in the knowledge that your Government was funding the project and would obviously be monitoring the grant monies to ensure that the grant monies were spent for the stated purpose of your government's grants, that is to ensure that the mill remained viable and that consequently the town of Ravenshoe continued to exist. </PARA>
<PARA>In that letter I suggested that Mrs Kelly and the Government might make a one-off, ex gratia payment to cover the debts that these small businessmen had incurred in giving credit to the milling company and also to streamline contractors. I did not make that letter public. I did not issue any press releases in relation to that for many weeks, in the hope that I might get an answer from Mrs Kelly. I also said in my letter that I understood Mrs Kelly was sympathetic to the plight of these people and that she was going to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say-and I find it disgusting from a Minister-that that letter of 18= July 1990 has not yet received so much as a formal acknowledgment, let alone a letter giving the answers to my questions. I raised this matter in Estimates committees with Senator Richardson and, I think, Dr Turner. Dr Turner was horrified to hear that and promised he would get me a response to the letter. The Estimates committees were almost a month ago and I still have not got an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious matter to the people of Ravenshoe. The amounts of money involved-that is, the amounts that have been lost-are minute, minuscule, compared with the money that had been put aside for compensation at Ravenshoe, and that money has not yet been spent. I think there was about $75m allocated or said to be for use over a period of years for that compensation. Nowhere near that amount has yet been used. I ask the Government, on behalf of these people, to spend just a couple of hundred thousand dollars-a very small amount to the Government in terms of the Budget allocation, but a very large amount to the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA> There are small businessmen there who have lost something like $50,000 or $60,000. A business that has a usual profit of about $20,000 simply cannot afford a long term permanent loss of something like $50,000 or $60,000. The end result will be that the small businessman who has put his whole life's effort and work into his business will go bankrupt. He will lose his house and his car; his children will lose the pleasures that they had in that little town; and he will become yet another person on the dole queue. All this will happen simply because those people, in all good faith, extended credit to the company because they believed the Government was looking after it. I again plead with Senator Richardson to speak with Mrs Kelly to see whether something can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this should never be done as a precedent. I know that the Government is concerned and says, `If we do this here, when do we stop?', but I suggest that this is a particular one-off situation. It is a situation which would never have arisen if these people had not believed that the Government was propping up the mill. I keep saying that, but that is why they did it. I accept that the Government does not pay debts that are not payable because a company such as Associated Plywood Sales Pty Ltd goes into receivership. As a lawyer, I accept and understand that but, in this instance, one might say they were duped into giving credit because they thought the Government was there. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Richardson to plead with Mrs Kelly again that these moneys be given back as a one-off, ex gratia payment so that a number of small businessmen do not have to join dole queues simply because they did what they did in the expectation that they were doing the right thing. I would appreciate it if Senator Richardson could refer these questions to Mrs Kelly and ask for an answer. I ask her to deal with the matter very sympathetically.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add my voice to Senator Macdonald's in a plea to have compensation paid to these subcontractors and contractors, to people who have sold timber off their properties and to the timber workers themselves. I can recall, and I think Senator Richardson will be able to recall too, the day that we both flew to Cairns and-I think it was at the Pacific Hotel in the conference room-Senator Richardson, in front of a press conference, said that $75m compensation would be paid for World Heritage listing. We were going to see plantations springing up and we were going to see all sorts of magnificent tourism ventures coming forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now, two years down the track, the whole thing is in a mess, and I think Senator Richardson would agree with that. I am not blaming the Government in particular; well, I am blaming it because it has not monitored the money that it gave to the timber mill. As I said last night, Senator Richardson made a commitment on behalf of his Government, and he is a very senior Minister in that Government, that no person would be disadvantaged; no person would be worse off. We have now come to the conclusion that a great many people are now worse off. Millions of dollars have now gone from where they were supposed to go in Ravenshoe to re-equip and build a mill in Kyogle. They are very serious charges, and today Senator Richardson responded to a question that I asked yesterday saying that yes, the boiler and the veneer mill were sold and he did not give his permission. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has assured the Senate that while he was Minister as far as he could ascertain everything was done in accordance with the agreement set down between his Government and the mill. Today he makes an admission that an agreement was not stuck to. I do not want to draw any conclusions, but I do want to say, `Senator Richardson, you have a very serious obligation. In fact, your whole credibility is on the line'. It is no good abusing Senators O'Chee, Macdonald and myself for doing our duty. That is what we are elected to do, to come down here and point out inadequacies and things that are going wrong with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot wrong with Ravenshoe. The Minister's credibility is on the line; his Government took 2,500 jobs out, destroyed an industry that was worth $33m and made the promise of compensation. That compensation has not been delivered. The Government may have done everything that it thought possible to deliver it, but the compensation has not been delivered, the town now is in crisis and the mill never had a chance to exist because bits and pieces and money were being siphoned off that mill and sent down to rebuild, re-equip or establish another mill. While this was happening the Minister had his hand on the tiller and he let it happen. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, these are very serious charges. I hope the Minister will take back to Cabinet the request from this Senate that it honour its obligation and provide jobs, a future and security to those people in Ravenshoe now, and that he gets through Cabinet the continued operation of that mill to provide jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The questions that have been raised by Senator Macdonald and are unanswered by Senator Richardson go right to the heart of what is wrong with Ravenshoe, because, as a result of the actions of this Government, the people of Ravenshoe have been left in the lurch. The questions that Senator Macdonald raised concerned money owed to innocent, unsuspecting, unsecured creditors who blindly put their faith in Senator Richardson's assurance that nobody in Ravenshoe would be disadvantaged as a result of World Heritage listing. They believed, based on Senator Richardson's assurances, that the Government would back that mill all the way. They probably even took note of his press release in 1987-I believe it was-when he said, `We will spend $75m, or whatever it takes, to ensure that nobody suffers in Ravenshoe.' Unfortunately, the Government has not spent the money that it will take to ensure that nobody suffers in Ravenshoe, because $600,000 is owed to unsecured creditors who put their faith in the mill, who put their faith in the Government and who have been let down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has had ample time to answer the questions that Senator Macdonald has put to him. Senator Macdonald put those questions to Senator Richardson on 22 August, and since then 56 days have elapsed. Senator Richardson said just this afternoon that he was of the belief that the statement he tabled in Parliament on Tuesday answered Senator Macdonald's questions. Quite clearly it did not, because it did not make mention of the plight of the unsecured creditors. It did not pay any heed to Senator Macdonald's questions. Senator Richardson, if he had paid any attention to the answer he was tabling in Parliament, would have known that, but he obviously did not pay any attention to the answer he tabled in Parliament. We find an answer that, supposedly, was prepared with departmental assistance and has embarrassing typographical errors that alter the essence of the answer relating to the group of companies in question. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we now have to start wondering when Senator Richardson became aware of the reference of this matter by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). In the statement that Senator Richardson made today he said that the report of the receivers and managers was contained in a letter of 19 September 1990. He went on to say that on 16 October 1990 the matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department. That date, 16 October 1990, was Monday. </PARA>

In fact, in answer to the questions that I asked and Senator Boswell asked, Senator Richardson did not even mention the Attorney-General's Department. It was only after I had to table a series of embarrassing documents, and give a long dissertation on where the money went, that Senator Richardson could tell us that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have the sneaking suspicion that this matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department with the speed of a telephone call that may have been made from the lobby outside this chamber. If Senator Richardson knew, before I spoke, that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department, he would have told us; but he did not. I suspect the matter was not referred at all or, if the matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department some time between 19 September 1990 and 16 October 1990, it is very clear that Mrs Richardson-Mrs Kelly-did not bother to tell Senator Richardson.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that somebody tells the Minister what is going on because Mrs Kelly does not seem to be telling him what is going on. We are talking about a period of time from 19= September to 16 October. The other revealing thing about the answer that Senator Richardson has just tabled in Parliament today is this: He says that the reference of the matter to the Attorney-General's Department was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in accordance with the Government's decision of 25 September 1990 that, if satisfactory clarification of expenditure of Commonwealth funds provided under the assistance agreement were not received, the matter would be referred to the Attorney-General to investigate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Assuming the decision was made to take some action on this on 25 September, we still have this disturbing period of time between 25 September until sometime after three o'clock on 16 October when Senator Richardson saw fit to advise this Senate, to advise the Parliament of Australia, that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only three conclusions that can be drawn and I will not say which one I believe is correct but I will lay them on the table. One is that Senator Richardson either knew about the reference to the Attorney-General's Department and did not tell Parliament, or he did not know about the reference to the Attorney-General's Department because Mrs Kelly did not see fit to tell him, or maybe she did not trust him. The third possible inference is that absolutely nothing was done between the time of receipt of this report and the time when these documents were tabled in the Senate on Monday afternoon. Then, it was as a result of a hasty telephone call from maybe outside in the lobby here, or maybe from Mrs Kelly's office where she was watching it on television, or maybe from one of the Minister's staff who was watching in alarm in the ministerial suite. But one of those three things happened, and whichever one it was, it raises very serious allegations about the conduct of this Minister, about the conduct of this Government, about and the way it accounts to the people of Australia through this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that Senator Richardson says that he was not aware until the receivers' report of 19 September that $837,000 of plant and equipment was sold from out of that mill. He tells us that he was not aware of its happening, notwithstanding the fact that it occurred before the appointment of the receivers when he was the responsible Minister. He told this Parliament on 16 October that he was satisfied that all the conditions of the assistance agreement had been met. They included the conditions contained in clause 3 of the charge agreement that the assets of the company would not be disposed of without the approval of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, if Senator Richardson knew on 19 September when the letter was received that those assets had been disposed of, then when he said on 16 October that all of the conditions relating to the assistance agreement had been met, he must have been incorrect. I will just give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that that incorrect answer arose as a result of a good natured error. But other people would draw other inferences and they are right perhaps to do so. I will not do that but other people could. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers are quite clearly inconsistent, and we still have to ask, `How did $837,000 of plant and equipment get sold from that mill, get disposed of by that company when Senator Richardson as the responsible Minister and his Department were supposed to be overseeing the operations of the company?'. He said in his answer on Tuesday that his officers periodically telephoned the company to find out how the installation of the equipment required for retooling was going, and that statement that was also tabled on Tuesday said that periodical inspections were made. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, that was not sufficient. Quite clearly, the monitoring process put in place by the Minister and his Department failed to notice that $837,000 of plant and equipment had been sold by the mill. Even assuming that it would be reasonable to overlook the fact that the boiler had been sold and leased back and was therefore still on the premises, there is still the question of the $425,000 for the veneer mill which was sold and, I presume, left the premises. We are yet to find out, but I only assume that it left the premises.</PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask how the Minister's departmental officers, if those officers visited the place on a regular basis or even on an occasional basis, could have failed to notice that a veneer mill worth $425,000 was there on their last visit and when those officers visited again it was not there. It only took up half the factory. I suppose it is an oversight we could all make, is it not? I suppose when the officers visit the mill, they will not even bother to do a stocktake. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us recap on all of the things we have just discovered this afternoon. We have discovered, first and foremost, that Senator Richardson does not seem to be able to read a statement prepared, I assume, by Mrs Kelly and does not seem to be able to understand that in that statement there is no response to a question which was outstanding for in excess of 50 days in relation to innocent people, good people, in Ravenshoe and north Queensland who have lost together over $600,000 as a result of this Government's incompetence. We have seen Senator Richardson admit that the Government received a report on 19 September yet did not do anything about it until 16 October, when I raised the issue in Parliament and tabled the necessary documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald asked questions about it on 11 October and the Minister did not know about it then. We reach the conclusion that one of three things happened: either Senator Richardson knew about the report and did not tell Parliament; Senator Richardson did not know about the report because Mrs Kelly had not bothered to tell him; or the matter had not been referred to the Attorney-General's Department and was referred to that Department only as a result of the matters that I raised in Parliament. We have seen that Senator Richardson and his Department were wholly incapable of keeping track of where $830,000 worth of assets, including a veneer mill half the size of the building, disappeared. Senator Richardson does not seem to have been able to keep track of that. The Minister has this disturbing inconsistency in his answers that a report was received on 19 September. That is when the Minister became aware of the report, on 19 September. The Minister said on 16 October that he believed all of the terms and conditions of the assistance agreement must have been met, yet it is very clear that Senator Richardson must have had knowledge of the fact that the terms and conditions of the assistance agreement were not met because the result of a Government decision on 25 September 1990 was that if sufficient clarification were not received, the matter would be referred to the AttorneyGeneral's Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen the extraordinary financial incompetence of this Government in allowing $5.7m, perhaps, of money to leave Ravenshoe to flow directly or indirectly to Kyogle where a new mill was built, while the mill at Ravenshoe was still not properly retooled. We have seen, as a result of this Government's financial negligence, the people of Ravenshoe lose the money out of that town that was rightfully theirs by the labour and the credit they supplied to the mill, in good faith that this Government was going to support the mill all the way. We have seen the dreams of innocent, hardworking Queenslanders shattered by that Government and its negligence in dealing with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was up in Ravenshoe last a man came to me. He is owed $60,000 by the mill; he pays $1,000 a month for his business overdraft because he remains unpaid; and he faces losing his home, his business and everything he has worked for. What really gets him and me is that if he loses his business he will not be able to fulfil his dream to apprentice his son into his business. That will shatter his and his son's dreams. Senator Richardson and the Government do not seem overly perturbed because they are hiding behind a wholly inadequate assistance agreement and saying that the agreement is not between the Government and the people, but between the Government and the mill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already seen, as Senator Macdonald has said, that there is a very strong moral obligation on this Government to make good the money that the people of Ravenshoe have lost. </PARA>

I think Senator Richardson has a lot of explaining to do. If, when Senator Richardson gets up in a few minutes, he tries to blame me, Senator Boswell, Senator Macdonald or anybody else on this side who is genuinely interested in the people of Ravenshoe and in the future of their town, for the closure of the mill or for any failure in the commercial viability of that mill, he will be wholly wrong. The continued existence of that mill is dependent upon the Government's meeting its obligations, obligations made by Senator Richardson when he was sprouting on about $75m or `whatever it takes', when he was sprouting on about how nobody would suffer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of Senator Richardson's promises was that 12,000 hectares of pine plantation would be put in over a six-year period. Three years down the track we have not seen one of those trees planted, let alone 12,000 hectares. These are the things that are getting people on this side of the chamber and in Ravenshoe annoyed. The Minister should not try to blame us for any failure of the Government, the Department or himself to monitor the operations. He should not try to blame us for the mill's closing down, because we are not to blame. We did not make the decisions; the Government made them. Certainly Senator Richardson cannot blame us if the Government chooses to withdraw its commitment to support the mill and its offer of a grant. We cannot be blamed; it will be as a result of a decision of Mrs Kelly and the Cabinet. That is the truth; they are the facts; that is why people everywhere are getting annoyed at what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a damning list of facts which I think Senator Richardson has, to date, been wholly inadequate in answering. I believe he has an obligation to explain right now when he became aware of the reference to that matter, when it occurred, which of the three possible explanations that I have outlined is correct. Senator Richardson's performance during this whole shameful affair has been inadequate and his performance in answering the questions put to him by the people and the Parliament of Australia have also been wholly inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA> I have in front of me the answer that I have just read out to Senators O'Chee and Boswell and to the Senate at large. In reading that I pointed out that the first time that Price Waterhouse became aware of any of the problems to which Senator Boswell had referred yesterday was when they visited the mill on 31 May 1990 in the course of the review of the assistance provided to the mill, which the Department had initiated on 30 March and which was before the receiver-managers had even gone in. So before they had gone in the Department, as a normal part of the process of monitoring assistance given under that structural package, had asked Price Waterhouse to go in and have a further look. </PARA>
<PARA> When Price Waterhouse representatives went into the mill on the day of their visit they were advised by the manager that he had just been informed by his head office of the sale and lease back of the boiler. So far as the veneer timber plant was concerned, it was sold prior to the appointment of the receivers and managers in April-I am not sure at what date. I was not made aware of what was in the receiver-manager's report which Mrs Kelly got on 19 September on that day. It was the subject of a report to the Cabinet on 25 September. I was not made aware of it then either, because that was the day that I left for overseas and I was not at the Cabinet. Had I been at the Cabinet, I would have been in a position to have been made aware of the contents. But when I am out of the country it is a bit hard to be in two places at once, and I was not there. I do not apologise for not being there. It is just a fact that I was not. One wonders how I am supposed to know what happened at a Cabinet meeting that occurred when I was out of the country. So I did not know. </PARA>

<PARA> I have in the last week or however many days it is-I cannot put an exact moment on it-been made aware, and have come to the Senate and made the Senate aware of all I have been told about that report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, I will get to what he is doing in a moment. I said that I would. There is no problem with getting there. Just be patient, we will be there. When it comes to the question of some hasty call in the lobby to get the matter referred to the Attorney-General's Department, that is just nonsense. What has happened, as I understand it, is that since those reports have been received on whatever it was, the nineteenth and the twenty-fifth, if they are the right days, the Minister, Mrs Kelly, and her office and Department have been preparing advice for the Attorney-General's Department-he knew that it was coming over those couple of weeks-and it came on Monday. It would have got there whether we had been asked one question or no questions from people here, because those reports raise very serious matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would dearly love to have the opportunity to respond to some of the things that Senators O'Chee and Boswell have said about what is supposed to have gone on at that mill, and where the Commonwealth's money went. But I cannot, and I will not, for obvious reasons. We have already said that legal action may be taken as a result of what is in those two reports. That is why they have been referred to the Attorney-General. It would be irresponsible indeed of me, or Mrs Kelly, to respond directly to those allegations, so we have not. But I long for the day, frankly, Senator O'Chee, when I can. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I made to Senators O'Chee and Boswell and I seek to repeat is that at the time when we are negotiating with the receiver-manager about keeping this mill as an ongoing concern, negotiating with the receiver-manager about the further offer of government assistance to keep it in business, the raising of these matters does no one any good and can only harm the process. I accept that as a matter of course in this business one has to cop flak. I do not mind how long and how hard those opposite go at me, but I do mind when it will interfere with the process of delivering to the people of Ravenshoe all that we promised. That is what the Opposition is doing now. </PARA>
<PARA> Once those negotiations with the receiver-manager have been completed-and I hope that they can be successful; I am not conducting them but I sincerely hope they will be-and the Commonwealth's further assistance is accepted and the mill continues as a going concern, then Senator O'Chee or Senator Boswell can hack at me all they like. But any punt for a political scalp that they will never get is hardly worthwhile at a time when the people at Ravenshoe are looking to see whether the mill can be kept open. </PARA>
<PARA> We are negotiating this very day to try to make sure that that can happen. I do not want to do or say anything in this chamber that would put that process in jeopardy, and so I will not do so. I give up appealing to the National Party in Queensland to do anything that is sensible. Its record suggests that that is just not possible. But I appeal to all honourable senators to remember that it is not possible for Government Ministers to respond to matters which may be the subject of the Commonwealth taking legal action. It prejudices the rights not only of the Commonwealth but, more importantly-and I still believe in these rights passionately-the rights of those we may be taking action against. Therefore, I will not respond to any of those allegations. </PARA>

The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will, I am sure, be taking prompt action on this. Given that we received a first report on the nineteenth, a second report on the twenty-fifth and had that report, together with the thoughts of officers of the Department of the Attorney-General, on the sixteenth does not suggest tardiness. It suggests that we have been moving fairly quickly. I would hope that all honourable senators understand that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is apparent that at least parts of the second question are not answered. I accept that from what was read out and I will get those answers for the honourable senator tomorrow. I will take to Mrs Kelly the concerns that he has put forward about the people in Ravenshoe because I share those concerns. I am just not certain that it will be possible to address them. The main point made in the answer is that what has happened with those creditors is not as a result of World Heritage listing, but of what has occurred at the mill since.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no more grievous measure of a government's incompetence than the failure of that government to provide an environment in which young people can get jobs. This matter of public importance is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bleak job prospects facing thousands of Australian school leavers completing their secondary education this week resulting from the Hawke/Keating government's failed policy of reliance on excessively high interest rates which have had a disastrous impact on youth unemployment, pushing it up since February by more than one-third so that one in every five workers under 20 years old is now out of a job-the worst September figure for three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the statistics. I know that is not something the Government would be terribly attracted to, but let us look at the facts behind this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The raw figures-the original series, not mucked around with for seasonal adjustment or anything else-show that, instead of the usual fall in youth unemployment from the beginning of the year, this year there has been an increase. Every year there is a fall in youth unemployment, but not this year. This year it has gone up from January's 18.5 per cent to September's 19.7 per cent. Compare that with the youth unemployment figures of the alleged disaster years of the Fraser Government, particularly 1982, which we keep hearing about from those on the Government side. In the last year of the Fraser Government-this Government keeps referring to that period as a disaster-in exactly the same period, unemployment fell from 21.3 per cent in January to 18.7 per cent in September. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me stress that, on the raw figures, this September has a worse youth unemployment rate than the worst ever year under the Fraser Government. This is absolutely appalling. This trend clearly is under way before we see the worst impacts of this Government's disastrous high interest rate policies-according at least to the Budget. It has forecast for the current financial year a 32 per cent increase in unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the seasonally adjusted figures. These are the ones which statisticians would say are the fairer to look at. They show that so far this year-let us just take the figures from February; January and February have the same seasonally adjustment figures, so it is immaterial-there has been a one-third increase in the unemployment rate in Australia. That is a far faster rise than took place in any comparable period under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures, seasonally adjusted, for the same period in 1982 show there was about a 13 per cent increase in youth unemployment. The Australian Labor Party went off its face about that. Why are we not hearing the heroes of the Labor Party, who protested so violently at a 13 per cent increase in unemployment in the same period of 1982, complaining about this one-third increase in youth unemployment from 15.4 per cent in February to 20.8 per cent in September? Why do we not hear those cries of protest?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is now that the rate of youth unemployment is three times the rate of adult unemployment. Youth are in the firing line of this Government's economic policies. They are being bowled over in terms of jobs at an appalling rate. The young people who are in their final year at school, year 12, now preparing for their final examinations, have a bleak outlook under this Government. It is appalling that we have had so little comment from the Government. On the contrary, we have had some misleading information from the Government on this matter. Even if we look at the trend figures, we see a huge one-third rise. The trend figures-that is, the statistical trend figures put out by the Australian Statistician-generally tend to diminish the size of swings in official statistics; but not in this case. The trend to disaster is so large that there has now been an increase in unemployment for people aged 15 years to 19 years looking for full time work from 15.2 per cent to 20.4 per cent-in other words, a one-third increase. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, that nine-month rise this year is equal to the total rise in the trend figures for the whole of 1982, which, according to the Government, was a Fraser disaster year. If we are now doing worse than Fraser's disaster, what will the Government do about it? That is a real question. The Government does not apparently know about it; or, at least, it will not admit that it knows about it. It was only a few weeks ago that I asked Senator Richardson this question:</PARA>
<PARA>What level of youth unemployment-that is, among those between 15 and 19 years old-is incorporated in the Government's Budget forecast for unemployment benefit payments this financial year? What percentage of the 32 per cent budgeted rise in unemployment benefits is forecast to go to unemployed youth?</PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, the answer from Senator Richardson, as the responsible Minister-the Minister for Social Security-was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I do not know but I will find out. </PARA>
<PARA>When he found out, his answer was that he did not know. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that Budget estimates of unemployment and the number of unemployment beneficiaries are prepared by the Treasury, which does not give a breakdown by age group. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government apparently has no idea whatsoever of what youth employment will be this year. It is incredible. These are the worst possible figures we have seen for the rise in youth unemployment. Maybe I should not say that, as we will probably see worse figures in coming months. Yet, the Government does not know and apparently has no idea what is likely to happen to youth unemployment under its disastrous policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that the Government does not know what is happening because Senator Richardson, in response to my question about this growth in youth unemployment, which I raised on 11 September, replied-and I hope that it was an innocent misleading of the Parliament; no doubt it was, because I do not think Government senators do know:</PARA>
<PARA>This growth is easing at present and is consistent with Budget estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not extraordinary? He went on to say that, for example, between 3 August and 7 September the number of JSA-that is, job search allowance recipients-declined a little. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The increase in the number of people on unemployment benefit, including JSA, has been trending down over the last month. The increase in the last week ending 7 September was 1,200 compared with an average increase in the last month of 1,800 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>Trending down! There must have been a disaster in the last few weeks of September that the Government had no knowledge of because for the full month of September there was, in fact, an increase in both the seasonally adjusted and the raw figures. So it was trending down in the beginning of September. What happened at the end of September? Without any doubt at all, it does seem that this Government simply does not know what is happening with regard to youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson's response to me-it was a prepared response, delivered not at Question Time but a couple of days later-indicates quite clearly a monumental level of incompetence which, in effect, is a heartless refusal to recognise one of the great disasters that this Government has brought to the young people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no doubt that the Government has been able to generate those magic words `a consensus' in this area. There is a consensus that the Government has made a mess of it. The captains of industry, people such as Sir Arvi Parbo and Nobby Clark, and bodies such as the Confederation of Australian Industry clearly believe that the Government's economic policies have failed. In the left wing Senator Bruce Childs, Frank Walker and Peter Duncan have publicly stated that the Government, or certainly Mr Keating, has made a mess of it. The more moderate Labor leaders, such as Bob Carr in New South Wales and Rosemary Follett in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), believe that the Government has made a mess of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Archbishop Hollingworth clearly believes that Mr Hawke has made a mess of it, so much so that Mr Hawke has once again gone off his face and insulted the Archbishop, simply because the Archbishop had the hide to say that it was clear that child poverty was getting worse. In fact, he said that child poverty was probably now marginally worse because of the continued pressure on families of high mortgage rates and high rents. Of course, that was enough to enrage the Prime Minister because it struck home. Journalists as far apart in ideology as Ken Davidson and Terry McCrann are saying that the Government is totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in the 1950s and 1960s, we were able to resolve youth unemployment. It was not the serious matter that it is now. So there must be a response. There must be a way of resolving the problem. When we look at what is happening, we see that the simple way of resolving it is clear cut, apart from, of course, ending this Government's absurd reliance on high interest rates. Only a couple of months ago, we had Rosemary Follett, the Labor Leader in the ACT, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Youth unemployment in the ACT is a `disgrace' . . . More than 25 per cent of the territory's young people were without a job . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Only last month an article in the West Australian read:</PARA>
<PARA>Embattled employers are sacking young workers when they turn 18 as the economic recession bites in WA. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The WA Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Confederation of WA Industry say young, inexperienced workers are the biggest victims of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>A spokesman of the Commonwealth Employment Service said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unskilled school leavers would find it tough . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps we could associate that-although the Labor Party might not like this-with the fact that just a month before there was a press release revealing the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Hundreds of teenage workers in fast-food outlets have been granted pay rises of up to 62 per cent after a landmark decision in Western Australia's Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The union describes the increases as the biggest in the hospitality industry in Western Australia and possibly in the whole country. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government cannot pretend that there is no link between increasing wages, relative to other employees, for youth and the massively increasing level of youth unemployment. Of course, that was brought out in 1983 in the Bureau of Labour Market Research report, Youth Wages, Employment and the Workforce. It found out-this must have been embarrassing for the Government; it did nothing with the report and abandoned the body-the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . virtually all studies confirm that increases in youth wages relative to those of other groups decrease employment of youth. </PARA>
<PARA>As my former colleague John Hyde so rightly said:</PARA>
<PARA>This conspiracy against the young is, arguably, the strongest single indictment of the way we run Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the Government doing about it? It has had a failed community employment program, a disastrous Priority One program, and an Australian traineeship scheme which was supposed to have 75,000 people coming into it this year but the intake is expected to be 16,000. There has been non-stop failure. The Government and its Ministers must indicate that they have concern, have a plan of action and know what on earth is going on. Will the figures get worse? If the Government does not believe that they are going to get worse, can it explain why not? If they do get worse, what is the Government going to do about it? Until the school leavers of Australia have some coherent response to that, they have every reason to be terrified by this Government's policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a sad contribution to the debate. This afternoon we are talking about a problem that is of concern to the Government. It is sad because of the hypocrisy that has flowed from the Opposition in raising this issue in the way that it has been raised and with the contribution that we have just heard. It is raised at this moment because, in essence, all the Opposition seeks to do is cover up the grand exposure yesterday of the inadequacy of the Opposition in the area of social issues. It has been exposed as being totally inept in this area, as not applying itself and as not caring, but its spokesman comes in here today with a set of figures and a purely political argument, something that the people out there, especially those concerned, really do not want to hear. They do not want to know about petty politics in the Senate, and that is what they have got this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition comes in here pretending to care, to be concerned and to have a prescription for the future when it knows that it is totally inept and that the policies it puts forward will be even more damaging to the people it pretends to care about. Dr Hewson has been exposed as wanting to do away with not only the Department of Social Security but also the department of education-the two departments that most affect the people that we are talking about this afternoon and that most impact on youth. What sort of policy is that?</PARA>
<PARA> What we have at the moment and what we have seen this afternoon is nothing more than policy prescriptions emanating from economic bovver boys who are finding their way through political puberty. They are doing it very slowly. The economic theory is easy, but it should be put in a social context. If it is not in the economic model, it just does not rate with the Opposition at all. With this new Opposition policy direction, as Opposition members achieve political puberty, we are seeing the economics of rejecting people to a prejudicial scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of policy that the Australian people have to keep in mind when they listen to contributions such as the one we just heard. It is a policy of dismembering social infrastructure, reducing the sorts of kids that we are talking about to the scrap heap and to reliance on bush biscuits and Vegemite from the local sisters of charity. When one tosses in those sorts of policies with the Opposition's oft stated policy of deregulating the labour market for youth, what has one got? One might as well put the kids up the chimneys in the homes in Bellevue Hill. What does an overlay of the Opposition's general economic direction and an economic policy without a wages policy-we all know that it has no wages policy-lead to? It leads to a greater reliance on the policy of high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite should not come in here without a social policy, without an unemployment policy and without an economic policy and preach that they are concerned about children. We have seen what has happened in the past and we can see that the prescription for the future is not all that much different. We even see it exposed in the motion brought on for debate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the numbers. The motion refers to one in every five workers looking for a job-a cynical extraction from a pile of documents and a pile of figures. Full-time unemployment as a proportion of the teenage population has dropped from 12.4 per cent in April 1983 down to 7.5 per cent now. It is almost a 50 per cent reduction. That is an important figure which those on the other side choose to ignore. If they want to make a comparison with 1983, they should look at the real statistics and look at the context of what we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look further at the motion. It refers to the thousands of Australian school leavers completing their secondary education this week. I will be kind to Senator Michael Baume. I think what he means to say is that they might have finished classes this week. He is talking about year 12 students. They have not finished their exams and there is no way in the world they have finished their schooling this week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity that these policies did not apply in Senator Walters's time. This Government has been enormously successful at raising the level of participation of young people in education, especially in the later years of school education and tertiary education. We have almost doubled the number of people who stay at school until the school leaving age from a 36 per cent base in 1983 to over 60 per cent now, and it is still growing. There is nothing more important for a kid's future than to be able to get as much education as possible. The way in which these people develop their lives will be an enormous contribution to the social environment. Members of the Opposition should not come in here and say that this Government has no concern and has done nothing for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another major comparison. I know I have only a few minutes left. Whereas in 1983 these kids were put on the scrap heap with no recognition of their problems and no support, this Government has a number of programs in place to change that. With Austudy the Labor Government has made sure that people in low income families are not forced to leave school for economic reasons. For the people who left school early in order to get a job, our emphasis on training ensures that they have a decent career path, that they are not left with dead end jobs. For those who have become unemployed, we have introduced Jobstart. Rather than have them simply passively living on social security, active training measures ensure that these people are not trapped into a cycle of poverty as they were in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House understand the effect of unemployment on young people. We understand the lifestyle and culture that they fall into, and we are concerned and have put heaps of money into programs to ensure that these kids get mentally, if not physically, active. We have the social structure and we have applied ourselves to ensure that the forums, services and structures of government respond to the need and anticipate the need. We have integrated and developed the programs in various departments-the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in particular. These are the departments that those hypocrites on the other side, who come in here with crocodile tears, want to destroy. </PARA>

What they have to do, what their leader has to do, and what those intellectual midgets on that side of the House have to do, is respond to the problems of the 1980s and the 1990s into the next century. </PARA>

Brian Howe gave them some great advice yesterday: Forget the prejudices; forget the easy way out; do some hard work on social policy. Those opposite should try to bring it into their mental framework and should try to adapt their economic policy to the needs of this nation. They come in here preaching deregulation and bring on motions such as this-a total inconsistency. They leave the field open for the knee-jerk policies of prejudice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In the short time available to me, I intend to address particularly the Government's economic policies. My colleague Senator Robert Bell will then address the effects of that policy on our young people in greater detail. I will lead off by quoting from a document:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point in Australia's history there is an overwhelming need for realistic and practical policies which are grounded on an understanding of our circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a time for empty rhetoric or glib wonderful world solutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators have guessed it-the author is Mr Paul Keating. The quote is from his economic statement of February 1990. I should have paraphrased it and used the singular `a wonderful world solution' because, in effect, we have been confronted with a single monetary policy-high interest rates. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has so often reminded us, the objective is to get the overseas debt down. To do this we must lessen imports and increase exports and the only way to go is to have high interest rates. The people trying to buy homes and the people trying to run a small business had to pay for the Government's single policy to have high interest rates as the one blunt instrument in trying to get the debt down. To do that it felt that it had to throttle the whole economy. Now that the genie is well and truly out of the bottle and we are harvesting the effects of that policy with a deepening recession, the Government is desperately trying to get that genie back into the bottle. Unfortunately, it might have some problems. The community as a whole, particularly young people, are bearing the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me compare our interest rates for the last two or three years, which were hovering around an effective 20 per cent in most areas, to the interest rates that were obtaining in other countries. In the United States interest rates were 9 per cent; Switzerland, 6 per cent; Japan, 7 per cent; and Belgium, Canada, Denmark and France, 10 per cent. Approximately half of the interest rates that we had to contend with in Australia were all in the interests of the single item policy-to get the foreign debt down. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of that policy are now becoming apparent. Bankruptcies have risen by 12 per cent in the current year. Emergency relief applications have risen by 50 per cent, and unemployment has risen from 500,000 in September 1989 to 627,000 in September 1990. The unemployment level for those under 20 years is now at 20 per cent. As I said, my colleague Senator Robert Bell will deal with that in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has often stated that the Government is not pursuing a scorched earth monetary policy. If that is not a scorched earth policy, I wonder what is. The bad news is obviously only just beginning and it will continue to get worse. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has often stated that unemployment is the major cause of poverty. We are now seeing that trend harvesting greater poverty among children and the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw how the Prime Minister reacted yesterday when a respected community leader, Archbishop Hollingworth, drew his attention to the ill effects of the high interest rate policy. He reacted by making a personal attack. I believe that that sort of reaction from the Prime Minister is not worthy of his stature and it is certainly not worthy of the problems facing our community which we must address. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to the alternatives that the Government had available had it not subscribed so solidly to the deregulation policy, which is a policy shared by the Opposition parties. It is all very well for the Opposition to say that we should not have high interest rates, but it has not offered an alternative. In fact, it supported the Government in the early stages of that policy-until now when it becomes apparent that it is mistaken and that the community is paying for it. </PARA>
<PARA> But there was no suggestion, for instance, that we should slow down tariff reductions to protect our producers and employment in Australia and discourage imports by that measure. There was no suggestion, certainly by the Liberal Party, that we should review our anti-dumping provisions. Senator Boswell is obviously having a hard struggle in convincing his coalition partners that we need an inquiry into anti-dumping procedures. I wish him well. If he does not succeed, the Australian Democrats will pick up the cudgels and take some initiatives in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no suggestion that we should discourage overseas loans by Australian companies-that we should perhaps put a halt to borrowing large amounts for paper shuffling, unproductive take- overs. There has been no suggestion-and I am still waiting for an answer to my question several days ago to the Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button)-that we should increase the withholding tax on interest paid to overseas lenders. This is an easy method which does not affect Australian borrowers and Australian companies: it affects foreign lenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The withholding tax, which is now at 10 per cent-that is laughable-could easily be increased to 15 per cent, which is the rate normally set by reciprocal trade and financial agreements. But there are countries which have no such agreement with Australia and the withholding tax could easily be raised to a higher point. As a first step, I have suggested to the Government that it might like to remove the exemptions from the withholding tax which currently apply to debentures which are raised overseas. But there has been no response. The Government is not prepared-and, I regret to say, the Opposition is not prepared-to look at alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major area to look at is fiscal policy and raising tax revenue. The only fiscal policy trend that both the Government and the Opposition can look at is cutting community services in needy areas. They are not prepared to look at raising additional revenue. One could see that by the hubbub I caused yesterday when I suggested that it would be useful social policy to raise the tax rate for incomes above $100,000 to 60 per cent. That was an impossibility in their minds, yet that measure would have raised $600m. A wealth tax at one per cent on assets above $1m would raise $500m. But I know that would just about cause a revolution on the Opposition benches. What about an increased tax on tobacco, alcohol or woodchips?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -It was only this morning that once again we were told that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Government were out of touch with what is happening on the ground among the poor in our community. That was stated by Bruce MacKenzie, Senior Lecturer on Social Science at Deakin University. Again, we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister attacking the Most Rev. Peter Hollingworth, accusing him of economic ignorance because he dared to tell the truth regarding that section of the community that is rightly the responsibility of the church. If Archbishop Hollingworth has not the right to speak out about the increasing poverty of children in Australia, and his view that this is being escalated by the high interest rate policy of the Government, who on earth has? I quote from the Australian newspaper:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hawke ridiculed the Archbishop, saying he undoubtedly understood the Holy Trinity, but knew nothing of the `unholy trinity': wages, fiscal and monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>This outburst was the result of the Archbishop's statement that he stood by his comments that child poverty was getting worse. I would now like to quote from the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> The archbishop said that, since his celebrated clash with Mr Hawke in June, child poverty was probably now marginally worse because of the continued pressure on families from high mortgage rates and high rents. </PARA>
<PARA>This attack on Archbishop Hollingworth follows the Prime Minister's earlier abuse on him last June when Mr Hawke said of Archbishop Hollingworth's comments:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it's just an unchristian bloody statement . . . it's a grossly irresponsible bloody statement. </PARA>
<PARA>He told Archbishop Hollingworth:</PARA>
<PARA>You ought to be ashamed of yourself. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke's fury and indiscretions, to put it politely, are a result of his promise at the previous election that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. Of course he knows that not only has he not succeeded but also that Archbishop Hollingworth was right; child poverty is increasing because of the Prime Minister's deliberate policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening with youth unemployment. I have before me a report on teenagers in the labour market by Russell Ross. It is an analysis of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' data for the period between 1983 and 1988. The Government has been in power for the whole of that period. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence is that, despite the general improvement in the labour market, teenagers have fared very badly over the last five years . . . . The relative position of teenagers, i.e. those persons 15-19 years old, has deteriorated over this period. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to explain that between 1983 and 1988 the employment level of teenagers has gone down by 1.4 per cent. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Full-time employment among teenagers actually fell in absolute terms due to a decline in female employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Teenage female employment went down by 3.9 per cent. Female full time employment rose steadily until 1986 and then subsequently collapsed with the loss of 25,000 full time jobs in the final 24 months leading up to March 1988. There was a net loss of full time employment among teenage women over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to state further figures, which are really quite disastrous. But as the report says, this is only the tip of the iceberg, because any teenager who is employed for just a few hours a week is regarded as being employed. This of course creates the hidden unemployment of all those seeking a full time job. The hiding of those figures is just staggering. </PARA>
<PARA> That 1988 report is now several years old. We are all aware of what has happened in the interval-things have got much worse. Unemployment generally has increased, but teenage unemployment-that is, people aged between 15 and 19-is now a disaster. Teenage unemployment increased from 15.5 per cent in August 1988 to 16.5 per cent in August 1990. I have the latest figures-the September figures-before me, and they are even worse. One in every five 15- to 19-year-old is out of a job. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we saw an attack on Dr Hewson by Mr Keating. Mr Keating said that, because Dr Hewson wanted to save the costs of duplication incurred by the Federal departments so that more money could be spent on those in the social welfare area, he did not have a morsel of compassion. Yet the poverty-the Very Reverend Archbishop Hollingworth talks about it in the report I have just quoted from-plus the worsening figures I have quoted, are a direct result of the policies of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister</PARA>
<PARA> There is no use the Government trying to duck for cover on this issue; the direct blame is entirely at its feet. We have headlines saying, `Hawke Era Worst since World War I'. The Treasurer should read the Burdekin report entitled Our Homeless Children: Report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children. The Burdekin report told us that youth unemployment is the single most frequent factor associated with homelessness. The report gives the case of a homeless youth, James, a 19-year-old. James was presented to the inquiry on 2 September. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>He was not streetwise and needed a bed until he could find a job and get a place to live. He was exceptionally motivated and made every attempt to find work . . . However, we could not find accommodation for James outside Kings Cross because generally refuges do not accept people over the age of 18. As disillusionment with his failure to get work grew, James became more acquainted with the Cross, more acquainted with the street life and he began using drugs . . . On the 26th of the ninth, that is three and a half weeks after arriving on our doorstep, James left us to go to a squat. In three and a half weeks that highly motivated person was on the street using drugs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the net result of this Government's economic policies. If Mr Keating were to get out to look at those areas-go to the Cross and look at the places that the Burdekin inquiry members looked at; look at the places that members of my Committee looked at when reporting on homeless youth-he would understand the final result of his harsh policies. It is no use his saying that it is not the fault of government, as Senator Bolkus said today; Mr Keating has to get down to the street level and visit the areas to find out just what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bruce MacKenzie is quite right-the Government is out of touch with what is happening on the ground. All those welfare organisations that tell us that more and more people are coming to them seeking their help are also saying this to the Government, but it is not listening. It is the Treasurer and the Prime Minister who do not have a morsel of compassion for the unemployed youth. This is what this debate is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence, I will respond to that last comment by Senator Walters. This Government does have great compassion; it does care. It is unfortunately a side product of a capitalist economic system in which we live, and in which I accept we live, that, to some degree or other, there is always a level of unemployment. It has not mattered who has been in government in any Western democratic nation, over the last 100 years there have been varying degrees of unemployment, whether it has been a labour, liberal or conservative government in power. Whilst I certainly do not like unemployment-I have a vehement hatred of the consequences of that unemployment-it does not mean that this Government does not care and that it does not have a program to combat the evils of the effect of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation as outlined by previous speakers on the other side is not as grim as they would have us believe. Teenage unemployment has always been at a higher level than that of the rest of the labour market. There are good reasons for that. There is a far higher job mobility amongst younger persons; it is 24.5 per cent. That of adults is 19.1 per cent. In our society, there is also a tendency, in any economic recession or depression, for the principle of last on, first off to apply. This inevitably means that young persons are more adversely affected. Having said that, we do not excuse what is happening in our economic system. The important thing is to have the policies to respond to those particular problems. This Government has those policies. It has made the very best attempt it can to address the emerging problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a number of policies that the Hawke Labor Government has initiated in its 10 years. It is not a matter of simple, empty rhetoric, or of crying tears; it is a matter of doing what is needed to try to minimise the effects of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to a wide range of programs to assist people to obtain skills and employment. In recent years, many separate support arrangements have been consolidated into an integrated program, which recognises the different circumstances and needs of Australian job seekers and provides local labour markets. These programs include Jobstart. The Jobstart program helps disadvantaged job seekers to find work by providing wage subsidies to private sector workers. Despite strong employment growth since 1983, some groups in the labour market continue to find it difficult to gain and keep a job. Jobstart assists these disadvantaged people by providing subsidised work experience for up to 20 weeks. The 20-week subsidy rates depend on the job seeker's age and type of disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Needy and disadvantaged groups on the labour market include the long term unemployed, disabled people, overseas born job seekers who have English language difficulties or who experience cultural barriers in getting a job, Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders and sole parents. Since 1983 this Government, with Jobstart and other wage subsidy programs, has helped 434,000 people obtain jobs. In 1990-91, $72m has been allocated to Jobstart for an estimated 44,000 new places. </PARA>
<PARA> Jobtrain is another Federal Labor Government training initiative. It provides long term unemployed and disadvantaged job seekers with short term vocational training, closely linked to the needs of both the individual and the local job market. In 1991, funds for job training will be increased to $120.9m. </PARA>
<PARA> Newstart is a major initiative to help retain and re-employ people who are out of work for more than 12 months. The Government has allocated $85m for the next financial year to assist 43,999 persons under the Newstart program. All people aged 21 to 54 who have been unemployed for 12 months or more are eligible for Newstart. </PARA>
<PARA> Each year 40,000 intensive interviews are jointly carried out by the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security. About 190,000 specialist information packages have been provided over 12 months for people in the target group. The guidelines have been relaxed to allow certain short courses to be undertaken while unemployed people remain on unemployment benefits. There are active job placement and community awareness strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the jobs, education and training scheme-commonly known as JET-the Labor Government has a proud record of achievement in assisting sole parents. The JET scheme is one of the flagships of this strategy. It was established in 1989 to help sole parent pensioners obtain a job. Sole parents who want to take part in JET receive assistance including assessment of job barriers and prospects; referral to jobs; placement in training and education programs run by the Department of Employment, Education and Training; and child-care. A recent review of JET demonstrated a high level of appreciation for the program among sole parents. In 1990-91 12,000 people a year will be assisted by the program at an estimated cost of $19m. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerning our active employment strategy, in February 1990 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced the next logical step in completing the move towards an integrated active system to abolish the unemployment benefit and replace it with a payment system which more clearly projects the Government's labour market objectives both in name and in terms of structured links to labour market assistance, opportunity and client obligation. It is proposed to replace the unemployment benefit with a new active income support structure comprising two separate payments: a job search allowance for eligible unemployed people aged 18 years and over for up to 12 months; and a Newstart allowance for those aged 18 and over who are unemployed for 12 months or more.</PARA>
<PARA> All of the above initiatives which represent an integrated employment, education and training strategy will be under threat if the Federal portfolios of Social Security and Employment, Education and Training are abolished, as is advocated by those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) demonstrates a staggering level of stupidity in suggesting that these programs, to name a few, could be devolved to voluntary agencies, the States or Territories or, more likely, abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps our biggest achievement has been to obtain a greater employer commitment to training workers with a training guarantee. The training guarantee legislation which came into effect on 1 July requires employers, both private and public, with an annual payroll in excess of $200,000 to spend at least the equivalent of one per cent of payroll on structured training every year from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does have a clear direction in terms of targeting need and assistance to unemployed persons. It is simply not good enough to give persons who are unemployed money; they have to be given assistance and direction in obtaining job skills to secure jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast this with the policies of the Opposition. The Liberal-National Party response, as projected by the Leader of the Opposition, is to blame the bureaucracy for swallowing up money which should be going to the genuinely needy. His suggestion is that we devolve all this to the States. There seems to be a basic contradiction: we will end up having more State bureaucrats doing what one bureaucracy does at the present time. He does not explain where all the money is going to be found to employ the bureaucrats, but he probably does not have to because the reality is that the Opposition will not continue to fund the sorts of initiatives that this Government has commenced for unemployed persons. The Opposition's basic philosophy is: scrap all this sort of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition recently reaffirmed this in radio and television interviews. He said on the ABC PM radio program, `Do we really need Federal departments of social security, health and education?' I would say very strongly that we do need departments such as those departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came down here to listen to this debate thinking we were discussing a matter of public importance, and that I would hear contributions from either side-from the old parties-which might shed new light on this problem which, Senator Sherry has assured us, has been with us for some time; but I return to the first impression I had when reading the letter presenting the matter of public importance. My first question was: Is the Opposition really interested in youth unemployment or is it, as is transparently obvious here today, only a vehicle for the Opposition to tackle the Government's monetary policies? What we have seen and heard this afternoon has confirmed my first impression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was hoping, as perhaps Senator Sherry was too, to hear some alternatives from the Opposition. If it was genuinely interested, and genuinely thought that this would be a matter of public importance, I think we would have been given some alternatives. Senator Spindler, in his contribution, was stopped mid-stream by lack of time when he was wheeling out dozens of opportunities to act on this and achieve something useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter contains the accusation that the anxiety which the Opposition feels for Australian school leavers about their employment prospects is a result of the Hawke-Keating Government's failed policy of reliance on high interest rates. Yes, youth unemployment is a real problem and is a tragic waste of our young potential. Any figures-no matter where they come from-highlight the appalling number of young people who are without conventional work. </PARA>
<PARA> The contributions so far have described the problem and argued about statistics. This letter has attributed the problem to interest rates, and we have not heard anything else. The arguments that we have heard about statistics were comparing statistics and figures from Senator Michael Baume earlier-seasonally adjusted participation rates. We even had an argument about whether school finishes this week or on Christmas Day or something. I do not think that is the matter that should be discussed; it has nothing to do with it. In fact, there is a lot more to it than statistics. Rather than describe the problem-which is what the Opposition did-in an endless morass of statistics, I hoped that we could have had some strategy and alternative solutions; but we did not. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that interest rates are not the sole cause of youth unemployment. They are certainly influential. For example, they have an immediate impact on the building industry, which does take in a considerable amount of unskilled or semi-skilled labour. It is where young people are able to make a start in employment in many cases. But interest rates are not the start and end of it. The Government's so-called youth strategy is, in fact, a dismal failure. Part of that failure is that although we have a policy to increase school retention rates-and that has worked in a way, in that it has kept people at school-it should be recognised straight away that that, in fact, delays the time when unemployment might be reached. As has been recognised, in fact, it creates hidden unemployment. Because young people are still at school, they are not on the unemployment list, and that provides an addition to the unemployment rate eventually, unless training and work programs are also in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims to have-I have lost track of the last lot-the RED scheme, the CYSS scheme, the EPUY scheme, the CEP scheme, the Priority One scheme, the Jobstart scheme, the JET scheme, and the last thing we got was integrated active unemployment income support-I forget. It is ridiculous, and I think people who are involved in this area cannot fathom it either. Rather than come up with a lot of mumbo jumbo about titles, schemes and things, what this Government should be doing is providing a tangible, real alternative to the present muck-up. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler launched off into a group of policies which could lead to an improvement in our employment situation. I would hope that this Government, rather than be tangled up in debating the issue of the statistics and where they came from and which season they were adjusted to, would give some credence to what Senator Spindler offered. Perhaps we could then have a debate on the usefulness or otherwise of some of the suggestions the Democrats have been making for years. I would hope that these would not be buried in statistics and the argument about whether the statistics are accurate or not, but rather about whether the programs, whether the initiatives, might achieve the goals that should be shared by all Australians. It is frustrating to be a member of our Australian community and to see so much of what we could achieve tangled up in schemes and statistics which categorise people as being either employed or unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to challenge the definition of employed or unemployed. It is like suggesting that some people are worthy of support and other people need to be cut off, disregarded and thrown on the rubbish heap. To do that is to ignore the potential productivity that this country has. To do that is most unwise and we cannot continue to do it any longer. I would hope to see us follow some reforms such as slowing down the rate of our tariff reductions, reviewing our anti-dumping provisions, discouraging overseas loans for paper shuffling ventures, and subsequent repayments to overseas countries for totally unproductive ventures. I would like to see an increase in withholding tax on the payments made to overseas lenders. We could see some fiscal policy alternatives, especially raising revenue instead of just shuffling paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address some remarks to the motion moved by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. The response by the Government is to a report of the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals. That was a committee set up early last year and which reported to this Parliament at the end of November last year. I was a member of that Committee and I propose to make some comments largely in that capacity, rather than on behalf of the Opposition which of course has not had an opportunity of studying the response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the response is an important and a valuable one, because it does indicate a very wide measure of agreement between the Government and the recommendations of the Committee. The Committee had been asked in its terms of reference to determine principles which would govern the tenure of office that covers the wide area of appointment, conditions, term and length of appointments, salaries, and removal of appointees. So the principles would cover all those matters which were addressed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The pleasing thing about the response is that the Government has agreed, in most cases, with the recommendations of the Committee as to what the principles should be. The Committee did not propose any major statutory changes to existing Acts, although it suggested that consideration should be given to embodying the principles it laid down in an Act of Parliament. The Government does not agree with that but if agreement can be reached, which looks very likely as a result of the response of the Government, then perhaps resolutions could be agreed to in both Houses of Parliament about these principles, which I think would be sufficient. It would not be necessary to actually have an Act of Parliament which, of course, Parliament could itself amend at any later date. For that reason, as the Government points out, it is probably not a satisfactory way of handling the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The genesis of the establishment of this Joint Select Committee was the Government's decision not to reappoint the former Mr Justice Staples to the newly established Australian Industrial Relations Commission when it was re-established by legislation early last year. That Industrial Relations Commission was replacing the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of which Mr Justice Staples had been a member. His term had not expired at the time that the Commission was abolished. All the other deputy presidents of that former tribunal were reappointed to the new Industrial Relations Tribunal, except Mr Justice Staples. </PARA>
<PARA> It was that decision by the Government, and the controversy that was associated with it, which led both Houses of Parliament to set up this Committee. Its purpose was not to investigate the circumstances regarding the non-reappointment of Mr Staples but to lay down principles which should govern this situation. One of the principles that the Committee did indicate should be adopted was that where a tribunal is abolished and then restructured, all existing members of the tribunal should be reappointed to the replacing tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Committee did not support-in principle at all events-the fact that Mr Justice Staples was not reappointed. However, the Committee also went on to provide that where a tribunal is abolished and not replaced compensation should be paid to members of the tribunal who have lost their positions and for whom no alternative position is found. In giving effect to that, in regard to the situation of former Mr Justice Staples, the Committee recommended that the Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation for former Justice Staples in view of his non-reappointment to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has more or less agreed to the principles laid down, that where a tribunal is abolished and a person is not reappointed to it or where a tribunal is not replaced, the question of compensation could be considered, although it said that this:</PARA>
<PARA>should be decided in the circumstances of the particular case and having regard to such matters as-</PARA>
<PARA>- whether or not the office was remunerated-</PARA>
<PARA>of course, in this case Mr Justice Staples clearly was-</PARA>
<PARA>- the period of any unexpired term-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Staples had an unexpired term-</PARA>
<PARA>-other benefits and opportunities available to the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response says:</PARA>
<PARA>It would not be appropriate to provide for an automatic right to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA> It was with those matters in mind that the Committee recommended that there should be an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation. In other words, it may well have been that Mr Justice Staples had other means or other compensation available to him. The Committee was certainly not prepared to make a firm recommendation that it should pay compensation to him, only that it should establish an inquiry to do so. The Government has rejected that and has done so on the basis that there is provision in the new Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act which entitles former Justice Staples to a judicial pension. There is a specific provision to cover not his situation by name but the situation which had arisen in his case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that former Justice Staples does receive a pension. However, that does not mean that he has not suffered financial loss because he would have had further years in his office if it had not been abolished. A pension, of course, is not as high as his salary and other conditions that he would have enjoyed had he continued. A question also arises as to whether he has opportunities for mitigating that loss by going back to practice and so forth. Those are all matters that would have to be considered. The Government has decided that it does not propose to give any further consideration to that matter or have any inquiry about it. That is really the only issue of any great significance with which the Government disagrees with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that is an unfortunate decision on the part of the Government and that the Government ought to give some consideration to that matter. In view of the fact that it has agreed that the question of compensation does arise and should be decided in the circumstances of every particular case, it seems extraordinary that the Government has decided that there should be no such consideration given to the situation of former Justice Staples. </PARA>
<PARA> However, apart from that difference in all important respects the Government has agreed with the principles laid down by the Committee. I believe that, in view of the very great importance-indeed, the growing importance in recent years-of quasi-judicial tribunals, these principles are laid down in respect of such tribunals only, not all Commonwealth tribunals. It is only those tribunals that are equated in their importance and status to the judicial system. They are known as quasi-judicial for that reason. There are a number of these tribunals, the most important being the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There are a number of other such bodies, and no doubt Parliament will be creating other tribunals in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that there should be wide agreement within the Parliament and between the political parties about the status and the principles which should govern the status, terms of office, removal, et cetera, of the members of such tribunals. It is most important because of the need to attract people of the highest calibre to these tribunals. That is possible only if these people believe that they have protection from political interference and that they are looked at by the Parliament, though they are not judges, as performing work which is analogous to that of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not suggested that those people should be put on all fours with the judiciary. The Committee did not recommend that they should be given, in all cases, the same protection as judges have from removal because circumstances change from tribunal to tribunal and between different classes of members of such tribunals. It is not a simple matter to lay down detailed rules, but principles are important. The important thing about this response is that there is clearly wide agreement within the Parliament and between the Government and the Parliament on such an important matter as this. Apart from the qualification I have made in the case of former Justice Staples, the Opposition-and on a personal level, I-clearly welcome this response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This is an important issue. All of what Senator Durack said is very pertinent and, in my view, correct. Senator Durack was the one who, in effect, chaired the Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals. The way he chaired that Committee deserves the highest praise. I think the effect of that has been brought out in the response that the Government has given to the various matters raised by the Committee. Indeed, the only matter that the Government has not accepted is that there ought to be compensation for former Justice Staples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Durack said, that was directed not so much at whether or not Mr Justice Staples himself was a person who had been badly treated or otherwise, but rather at the principle that there ought to be on important tribunals a security of tenure so that the people who occupy those tribunals can do so without fear or favour and can proceed to their decision making untrammelled by any thought that they can be removed or that their tenure can be cut short.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important that that independence be assured. It was in that context that it was put that fair compensation ought be made as a means of ensuring that people's occupation of a tribunal could not be terminated lightly and that at least some cost-I think it is not a sufficient cost, of course; nevertheless it is some cost -could be imposed upon those who have the ability to appoint people to tribunals and on those who have the ability to set up tribunals and to abolish them. I think that was a part of ensuring some sort of sanction to see that that was properly done. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue I want to speak about is this: Members of tribunals and decision-making bodies must remember that it is essential that they function according to the standards appropriate to the high offices they occupy. I think, as Senator Durack said, there is some concern that in this case a person was shut out of the work which he had been appointed to undertake without a reason ever being given for his being so shut out. When the appearance, at least, of capriciousness in the appointment to work is present, I think it is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, quite rightly, said that there was not much it could do about it. I think that is absolutely correct, but I think the matter should not be set aside in Parliament and that Parliament ought to indicate that it hopes that the members and head of any tribunal should so conduct themselves that they act appropriately and are able to give to the community the service that the tribunal was set up to give and that the head of that tribunal was appointed to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in this instance pointing to any tribunal; I am simply talking about the general principle. As a matter of general principle, any tribunal and any head of a tribunal should always keep in mind the high task which they were appointed to perform. Although in this particular instance, as the Government says, there is nothing it could do about the situation, I think it is appropriate that those matters be pointed out. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>These two reports from the Auditor-General from the Australian National Audit Office are both important. I hope that the Senate and the wider community will give them the consideration they deserve. I wish to restrict my remarks today to the annual report of the Australian National Audit Office. Other honourable senators may wish to speak on the other report which is also, as I have said, an important report. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst, of course, we have not had access to this report for sufficient time to become familiar with its details, it would appear from my initial report that the Audit Office and the Auditor-General are to be congratulated on their performance last year, particularly in view of the uncertainty and the difficulties created for the office by the Government's inaction in a variety of important areas. I particularly welcome the added number of performance indicators which are available in this year's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of significant recommendations, particularly as they flowed through to acceptance by the auditee, are impressive. I especially welcome the $49m of estimated savings identified by efficiency audits. Within that $49m I draw particular attention to the potential savings of $40m identified by the Auditor-General in the area of administration of the Austudy program by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). That is a very significant saving indeed in administrative costs. It is an example, I believe, of the very considerable scope that there still remains within the area of government expenditure across all departments for a significant pruning of costs to induce a greater efficiency within government administration. The example of $40m in relation to DEET is a very noteworthy example. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence is also shown as having potential savings of $4.5m as a result of the audit of the Squirrel training helicopter, utilisation and maintenance. A $3m potential saving is identified in the area of the Department of Transport and Communications in respect of the administration of national broadcasting transmitting facilities. So they are some of the efficiency audit results that are recorded in this year's annual report and they bear, as I say, careful scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from the Auditor-General's foreword to his annual report this year that there are continuing tensions between the Audit Office and the Government over the appropriate role of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office. It is an indictment of the Government that the issues that I will mention today are substantially the same as those that were raised by my colleague Senator Michael Baume last year when discussing the Auditor-General's 1989 annual report. The Government has been dilatory and managerially incompetent in refusing to act more quickly on these important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Foremost among the Auditor-General's concerns is his view that the Australian National Audit Office should be established as a statutory authority. This matter has been raised many times in the past. It has been the subject of detailed consideration and reporting by the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts. It has been the subject of questioning by many senators, including myself, at Estimates committee hearings. I raised the matter again only last month to try to find out exactly when the Government might be making up its mind on this issue. I was told by Senator McMullan who was handling the Estimates committee hearings for the Government at that stage that reports and recommendations about this matter were with the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I understand that they had been there for some time and he could not give me a date on which we could see a decision coming out of the Treasurer's office. I think that is unfortunate. I welcome the fact that a decision is pending, but it is very important, as Senator Watson and I said in debate in the Senate yesterday, that the Treasurer make that decision quickly and that the decision is one in favour of the establishment of the Audit Office as a statutory body.</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Auditor-General, Mr Jacobs, made it clear at the recent Estimates hearings that he saw the issue of becoming a statutory authority as very important indeed in terms of attracting and keeping good staff. That point is reiterated in the Auditor-General's foreword to the 1990 annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> In this report the Auditor-General actually reiterates a statement he made in a report signed over a year ago that the Audit Office should be established as a statutory authority. We strongly agree with that. He also said that the Auditor-General should have improved ability over staff terms and conditions and over hiring and firing, while maintaining consistency with the Government's policies of public sector restraint. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Without this support, the ability of the Auditor-General to achieve efficiencies in the operation of the ANAO, while maintaining high professional auditing standards, would be substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the question of the ability to attract staff by offering private sector competitive terms and conditions of employment, the status of the Audit Office is also very important from the perspective of the independence of the Auditor-General. This issue needs to be given high priority given the importance of a strong and effective Audit Office in an effective democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General in his foreword to this annual report has also raised the erosion of the mandate of the AuditorGeneral. He suggests that it should be confirmed as covering the audit of Commonwealth undertakings of whatever legal form. I believe that is a very important recommendation and I know that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has reported upon it and has strongly endorsed that view. The whole question of public sector audit should be wide ranging and any restrictions on the Auditor-General's mandate in that sense is very unfortunate. There are now constraints on the Audit Office conducting efficiency audits on government business enterprises. That is yet another issue which the Government still has, I understand, under review. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that the Auditor-General supports the possible establishment of an audit committee of the Parliament. That, too, was another recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 296. That is a matter for the Parliament to decide, on which I hope we as a Parliament can express our views and take decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to mention in passing, as we dealt with the matter in debate here yesterday and my friend and colleague Senator Watson may wish to mention it again today, is the extraordinary situation whereby one of the two reviews of the Audit Office that have been undertaken in the past 12 months, namely the review by the Auditor-General of South Australia, Mr Tom Sheridan, has not been released by the Government. The report of the second review of the Audit Office undertaken in the past 12 months-namely, the report tabled yesterday of an efficiency audit of the Audit Office by the independent auditor, Mr Michael Sharpe-listed at least some of the recommendations of the Sheridan report and expressed support for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General in his report today again lists some of the recommendations and comments upon them in terms of his support or otherwise. It seems extraordinary that the Parliament is being fed bits and pieces of the report into the Audit Office by Mr Sheridan without the Government seeing fit, for whatever reason, to release that report. I think that it is about time the Government came clean on this. Certainly it should release the Sheridan report, but at the very least it should, as a matter of immediacy, say why the delay has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters are important to the Parliament. The Audit Office is a very important institution. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr John Taylor on his work as Auditor-General over the past two or three years. I think that he has made a very notable contribution to that position. He has followed the line of some illustrious predecessors and certainly loses nothing in comparison with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is a very strong supporter of the role of the Audit Office. We shall continue to be so and we will use this Parliament, wherever possible, to reinforce that and to expose any problems caused for the Office by the actions-or in this case at the moment the inactions-of the Government. I commend the report to all honourable senators and I hope that it receives wide attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity on the occasion of the tabling of the 1989-90 annual report of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) to comment briefly on some significant matters affecting the office of the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A feature of the report is the very large number of references to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am Deputy Chairman, and in particular to the findings of that Committee's report No. 296 Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament, which was tabled in April 1989. I would also like to refer to the close association that the Auditor-General has with committees of the Parliament, and especially the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He is an attender at all public hearings and makes a valuable contribution when required. </PARA>
<PARA> A major feature of the Auditor-General's report and concern is the question of mandate-the scope of the responsibilities in relation to the Auditor-General. The question of mandate is also referred to in the annual report in these words:</PARA>
<PARA>The mandate of the Auditor-General for Australia should be confirmed as covering the audit of Commonwealth undertakings of whatever legal form. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that this view is consistent with the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on government companies and their reporting requirements, which was tabled in 1989, and also of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also note that the New South Wales Public Accounts Committee makes similar recommendations in its 1990 report on the New South Wales Auditor-General's Office. I find it rather disturbing that as recently as last week, when we were debating the corporatisation of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL), I sought but was unable to obtain an assurance from the Government that the Auditor-General would be the auditor of this new corporation covering the CSL. This is somewhat disturbing. It is also disturbing that the Government has taken so long to respond to the Sheridan report-a report by the former Auditor-General of South Australia. My colleague Senator Short has drawn attention to this matter today. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to this matter previously on the tabling of the report of the independent auditor. I think it is quite atrocious that the Government has not only withheld this report for so long but has now allowed two significant reports to be tabled before this Parliament without the Cabinet releasing this report and further, without the Cabinet coming down with its recommendations on this report. That is quite atrocious and indicates some disrespect that this Government has for the office of Auditor-General and for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also quite atrocious that the Auditor-General has had to labour for years with insufficient funding from this Government. This raises the whole question of the independence of the Auditor-General and the need for him to have a very close association with the Parliament. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended a committee of the Parliament to act as the liaison between the Parliament and the Auditor-General. We must separate the Auditor-General's office, in terms of funding and accountability, from the Executive. He is responsible to the Parliament, as report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled Auditor-General: Ally of the people and the Parliament recommended. This must be preserved at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> I am therefore concerned about this question of independence. The Auditor-General is also concerned. In fact, the Auditor-General responded to our report No. 296 on 7 September 1989, in a document entitled `Auditor-General: Accountability, Independence and Objectivity'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the ANAO should be established as a statutory authority and that like Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the Auditor-General should have improved ability over staff terms and conditions, over the hiring and firing while maintaining consistency with the Government's policy of public sector restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>Another aspect of the inadequate funding is that the Auditor-General had to ration resources to the very important audit function of performance auditing. The Auditor-General mentions that a positive result of the efficiency audits he carried out during the year was the identification of a potential saving of $49m. Had the Australian AuditorGeneral been able to devote the same sorts of resources as the Canadian Auditor-General devotes to efficiency auditing, that potential saving in Australia would have run into hundreds of millions of dollars. It is a criticism of the Government and its short-sightedness that in the withholding of funds, which has prevented a more adequate efficiency audit coverage, the ANAO has been denied the opportunity of saving government money at such a critical time. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the opportunity of delivering to the Institute of Internal Auditors a paper on `Risk management within the public sector'. I would like to put on the public record that I congratulate that institute on lifting its professionalism. The Institute now provides a national education program, based on the international standards of the common body of knowledge, of uniform quality across Australia. In recent years the Auditor-General has been a frequent critic of the level of internal auditing within the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Several years ago the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was so concerned about the lack of recognition of internal audit in the public sector that it produced a special report. I am pleased, therefore, that the Institute of Internal Auditors has got together in a very meaningful way and is conducting national seminars and emphasising its professional responsibilities. In fact, there is now an Australian accreditation award based on an education program and an international accreditation which is similarly based. The aim is to improve professionalism within government internal auditors. Therefore, it is necessary to have some formal recognition of the Institute's education and accreditation program. An increase in professionalism and status of internal auditors should lead to increased productivity from auditors and ultimately from their clients, overall improvements in the public service, a decrease in adverse comment from the Australian National Audit Office and the maintenance of high levels of accountability. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Institute on its increased professionalism, on its awareness of the problems of the past and on its determination to rise above that criticism and to present its members as a highly professional group within the Australian public sector. I commend the Institute and its executive. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot let this opportunity pass without acknowledging the tremendous strains under which the staff of the Australian Audit Office have had to labour in recent years. During the current year there have been two significant reports: the report of the independent auditor on the Australian Audit Office, which I referred to a few days ago; the second was the report of Mr Tom Sheridan. It was suggested by Mr Sheridan that the Australian Audit Office should now be given the opportunity of settling down and getting on with many of the reforms that it is currently undertaking. Mr Michael Sharpe, the Independent Auditor on the other hand, differed slightly in that he suggested that there should be a further independent evaluation of the information technology that has required such a high investment of funds with the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the staff on the way in which they have adapted to change, have adapted to their new responsibilities and have accepted so graciously the recommendations of committees of Parliament. I believe this close association between the Auditor-General and the Parliament must be for the good of the Parliament and the people. Therefore, I would like to join with my colleague Senator Short in paying special tribute not only to the staff of the Audit Office but also to Mr John Taylor, its head, in charting a very positive course through what have been some very turbulent times for the AuditorGeneral of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Bank is probably the jewel in the crown of public business enterprise in Australia. It has a distinguished history as both a commercial bank and, prior to creation of the Reserve Bank of Australia, a central bank. For the financial year ended 30 June 1990 the bank group produced an operating profit after tax of $494m and the total assets of the group grew by over 10 per cent to more than $67 billion. The group has provided for a dividend of $160m. That is a direct injection into the Budget which can be spent on community services. It is well and truly a public utility owned by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The return on average equity was 13.21 per cent for the year and its value is at least $4 billion and possibly a lot higher. It is against this background that we must look at the Government's attempt to privatise this public utility which, as I said, is owned by the people of Australia. The acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria is tied to the proposed initiative to strengthen the national public financial sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet only a couple of days ago we had a report from the University of Melbourne, by Professor Davis, who has established and documented in a report supplied to the Victorian Government that the sale of the State Bank of Victoria is not necessary. His report has been queried by Treasury. However, I believe that it needs careful consideration. The whole debacle of trying to sell a public enterprise at national level because a public enterprise at State level has failed or is in danger of failing may turn out to be a furphy-a furphy that was grabbed very quickly by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to justify the satisfying of his ideological bent to privatise, that is, to sell at bottom bargain prices any public utilities that he can lay his hands on. </PARA>
<PARA> I set aside for the Government's consideration the issue of whether it is, in fact, necessary to acquire the State Bank of Victoria. I hope that the Victorian Government and Premier Joan Kirner will reconsider their position after careful study of that report from the University of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are a number of other issues that we should address in the context of the Government's attempt to privatise the bank. On 13 September, I had occasion to ask the Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate, Senator Button, what the Government would do about the community service obligations of the Commonwealth Bank, which are now being fulfilled, if the Government, in fact, privatised the bank to 30 per cent as proposed. The obligations include exemptions from fees for accounts operated by pensioners, other long term beneficiaries and people under 18. They include special banking packages for charities, free bank statements in braille for visually impaired customers, subsidised electronic banking for disabled customers and a social as well as commercial emphasis on lending decisions made by the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia. An extremely important aspect of this discussion is that it is now not fashionable to provide venture capital for our industry and for initiatives in the small business sector that could add to Australia's export income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister representing the Treasurer wiped this issue simply by saying that these community service obligations were being provided as a matter of commercial necessity rather than according to the principle of community service obligation. In other words, he was saying that they were only being offered to attract customers. I believe that he is downgrading the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, which is to serve the people of Australia first and foremost, in accordance with its charter. I believe that the Government should reconsider because, if it is really true that this is the principle that the Government intends to implement once the bank has been partially privatised, we are losing a very important aspect of the Commonwealth Bank as it is currently operating. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major aspect of the bank, which is the property of the people of Australia, currently in place is that it enables the community to exercise some check on the private banking sector. Unless we have that comparison and unless we have that window on the private sector to set standards and to assess the operations of the private banking sector, we will be even further removed. If the Government intends to regulate the financial sector, to tighten up the regulations governing the banking sector and, as we would propose, to extend those regulations to the non-banking sector as well, there might be some purpose in the policy of the Government. At the moment, unfortunately, we seem to be bent on a course of action which sells off to the private sector anything that is of value and leaves in the public sector anything that is losing money. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final point. I refer to a letter written by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to Mr Kevin Scott, Federal Secretary of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, on 21 February 1990-that is, before the polling day of the last Federal election. I quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I want to emphasise that my Government is not contemplating the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. We oppose not only the proposal put forward by the Opposition to sell the Bank but also question the economic and financial rationale on which they base their short-sighted propositions. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by the Prime Minister on 21 February 1990. Is it not surprising how quickly circumstances can change? This letter was written before the election. How much is an election promise worth? I can only say that I can sympathise with Mr John Scott, a Federal Labor member of parliament from South Australia, who was reported on 30 August, 1990 as saying that, as a result of the whole issue of the promise broken by the Prime Minister and the intent of the Government to sell off public utilities which are the property of the people as a whole, he is considering quitting the Australian Labor Party (ALP). I believe that that is a consideration that not only Mr Scott but also many other members of parliament on the ALP side should consider because very clearly that Party is no longer the Party of the people. It is no longer the Party that once had a light on the hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to make a few comments about the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank group. The Commonwealth Bank annual report makes very interesting reading, coming, as it does, on the heels of the speech of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Australian Institute of Bankers just a couple of days ago and also coming, of course, just a few weeks after the release of the Reserve Bank's annual report, which, as the Senate may recall, was-when one appropriately read between the lines as is normally required with the annual reports of the Reserve Bank-a damningly critical commentary on the economic performance of the Federal Government. The failure of the Government's economic policies expressed in Mr Bernie Fraser's speech to the Institute of Bankers two nights ago is echoed in the opening section of the report of the Commonwealth Bank group under the heading `Economic Environment'. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the current account deficit for 1989-90 remained at an unsustainable level, equal to around 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product. The inflation rate also remained unacceptably high, with the consumer price index rising by 7.7 per cent over the year to June quarter 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>It is impossible, particularly for a public, government-owned institution, to give a greater condemnation of the Government's economic mismanagement than this. The Commonwealth Bank is stating boldly that on the two items at the top of the Government's economic agenda- namely, inflation and debt-the Government has failed and has failed disastrously. The statement I have just quoted could not have been more unequivocal in its criticism of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The section of the report concerning the performance of the bank is also very carefully worded-I believe it bears further study than I have been able to give it in the brief amount of time that we have had access to the report-and who can blame the bank for that, given the recent spate of bank bashing by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I note that the bank states:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of high interest rates has intensified competition for both deposits and good quality lending opportunities, and this has kept pressure on interest margins. </PARA>
<PARA>That would seem to indicate-indeed it says so-that there has been pressure on interest margins. The return on all the performance measurement ratios-that is, the return on average equity, capital employed and average assets-is down in 1990 compared with the previous year. I hope that the Treasurer and the parliamentary inquiry dealing with bank margins, when it gets under way, will take all the information in this Commonwealth Banking Corporation report into account in their deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said from the day that the parliamentary inquiry into bank margins was announced that the inquiry will be nothing other than a farce. If the Government were really serious about looking at the issues contained in the terms of reference to the parliamentary committee inquiring into the banks it would have had a much wider ranging inquiry and would have made it an independent inquiry along the lines, perhaps, of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System or the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which led to the deregulation of the financial markets in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has said that it would welcome such a review. We think that it would not be inappropriate to do that as we are now getting down the track towards a decade after the opening up of the financial markets in this country. Many other nations reviewed their financial system at about that time after deregulation and we would be happy to do that and would be happy to see that done. We do not agree at all that the inquiry announced by the Government will in any way meet the needs in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, quite frankly this inquiry is a farce. It is a diversionary tactic to try to divert attention away from the Government's chronic mishandling of the economy, the chronic problems facing the economy and to try to put the pressure elsewhere as the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) do time and time again. When they get into trouble they say, `Gee, it is not our fault, it is someone else's fault; we will blame someone else'. That is exactly what they have been doing with their spate of bank bashing in recent times. If they were really serious about this being other than a bank bashing exercise, they would have instituted a meaningful inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> One other issue that I would like to focus on briefly today is the sale of the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank. This matter was the subject of Senator Spindler's remarks. I am sure it will come as no surprise to Senator Spindler that my comments will be diametrically opposed to the views that he put. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the Parliament the annual report devotes very little space to the details of the sale. I think that is unfortunate. It is particularly disappointing after the Department of the Treasury was so obstructionist in answering questions that I put to that Department on this issue in the recent Senate Estimates hearings. Unfortunately, too, the report says nothing about the progress or outcome of the due diligence review, which is currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth Bank officials who are looking into the books and behind the books of the State Bank. I understand the results of the review are supposed to be available by now. The fact that the merger is also said to depend, in the bank's terms, on `certain other conditions' is worrying. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the due diligence exercise being conducted, there are obviously some doubts in the financial community about whether the value of the State Bank will be anything like the $1.6 billion that was announced so triumphantly by the Treasurer and the Premier of Victoria, Joan Kirner, just a month or so ago when they saw this as the way to bail out Victoria which had been bankrupted by the policies of the Cain and Kirner governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's press, in the Australian, there is a report saying that Premier Kirner is confident on the sale of the State Bank of Victoria. The Victorian Opposition called on the State Government to make a full disclosure of any new developments concerning the proposed sale of the State Bank to the Commonwealth Bank. That call by my colleagues in the Victorian Opposition, particularly the Leader, Alan Brown, follows rumours that the Commonwealth Bank is attempting to renegotiate the terms of the sale. All that Mrs Kirner could say yesterday in the Parliament in Victoria was that she was confident that the original agreement would proceed as expected. That is obviously less than full certainty that the sale, firstly, will go through and, secondly, will go through at the price of $1.6 billion that was the subject of the press release and announcements by the Federal and State governments jointly just a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not come as any surprise that there are concerns about the true value of the State Bank. As long ago as 17 September in a very important article in the Melbourne Herald by Terry McCrann-I have seen no refutation by anyone of what Mr McCrann was saying-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Stand by for another State Bank disaster-the Commonwealth Bank wanting to cut its purchase price substantially. Perhaps by $500 million, perhaps even more. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to elaborate on the reasons why he had that view. It was a view that was based, importantly, on rumours running around the financial markets at the time. There has been no rebuttal of those rumours since then; indeed, my colleague in another place Mr Warwick Smith said publicly last week that he, too, has heard of fresh rumours in recent days along the lines of the McCrann statements of a month ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important indeed that the due diligence procedure be completed, that the public be told as soon as possible of the outcome of that review and that firm decisions be taken because many things are at stake, including the viability of the Commonwealth Bank; its position in the marketplace in Australia; the future of the State Bank of Victoria, of course; and, within that, the future for all Victorians who are now labouring under a public debt of no less than $33 billion-a figure that is almost unbelievable, but true. It is a debt that amounts to more than $7,500 thousand for every man, woman and child in Victoria. It is a debt that has accumulated almost entirely during the pathetic regime in terms of economic management-the disastrous regime-of the Cain Government now taken over, of course, by the Kirner Government. Let no-one think that that is a new broom sweeping clean because Joan Kirner was a senior member of the Cain Government for most of its period in office and, indeed, was the Deputy Premier in the year or so before she became the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to come back to is the fact that the Commonwealth Bank reports says that the merger-for want of a better word-is to depend on certain other conditions. I assume that the conditions it is referring to are those that were determined by Caucus on 28 August when it passed a resolution approving a merger of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria to be funded `by an injection of non-government equity'. There are some extraordinarily tight conditions imposed by the Caucus on this action and indeed any suggestion that this is a privatisation exercise is refuted immediately one reads the Caucus resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nonsense, in any event, to say that an injection of 30 per cent of private sector equity into a publicly owned institution constitutes privatisation. It quite blatantly does not. That is not what privatisation is about. Privatisation essentially is about putting the control and management of an institution in the hands of the private sector. This 30 per cent privatisation does not do that. It is merely a fundraising exercise that has been concocted to enable the Commonwealth to help bail out a bankrupt Labor State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> It was done, very interestingly, not long before the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Special Conference that was to look at, and did look at, the sale of Australian Airlines Ltd and the sale of 49 per cent equity in Qantas Airways Ltd. Quite obviously, Treasurer Keating wanted to get Premier Kirner's vote in support of those proposals at the ALP Special Conference, and indeed he succeeded. Premier Kirner did vote with the Government at that time and broke ranks with her own socialist left faction. It was a very important thing for both Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the conditions we see very clearly that this is not a privatisation exercise, nor is it regarded by the Labor Party as a privatisation exercise. Let me quote a few things from the resolution of the Federal Parliamentary Caucus of the Australian Labor Party of 28 August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The Caucus unequivocally rejects proposals to remove Government control of the CBA and to privatise the Commonwealth Bank . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Caucus said specifically-`unequivocally', to use its own words-that it was rejecting any notion that this was a privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Caucus endorses the imposition of the following conditions on the introduction of non-government equity:</PARA>
<PARA>And there are no fewer than 17 conditions imposed. I will not go through the whole 17, but let me quote just some of them briefly. The first condition reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government introduce to the Parliament legislation requiring majority government ownership and control of the Commonwealth Bank in perpetuity. </PARA>
<PARA>The second condition says, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> That the issue of non-government equity in the combined CBA-SBV entity be restricted to . . . 30 per cent of the issued capital . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The fourth condition says:</PARA>
<PARA> That other banks, including foreign banks, not be permitted to acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The fifth condition reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign portfolio interests be prevented from subscribing to shares. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, no foreign investment at all-not in one single share of the Commonwealth Bank; and other banks will not be permitted to acquire shares at all. Condition No. 10 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In framing the terms of this equity issue, special attention be given to ensure the subscription of superannuation funds, including those funds of trade union members and small investors.</PARA>
<PARA>It is London to a brick that there will be great pressure put on the bank by trade union superannuation funds to inject equity. The long term implications of that in terms of influence by the trade union movement into the operations of the bank should not be overlooked in any way. It is a very important condition. So also is condition No. 13:</PARA>
<PARA> Non-government equity will not be introduced to the subsidiaries of the bank . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there will be not one cent of private capital permitted in any of the subsidiaries of the Commonwealth Bank. Condition No. 14 says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Caucus recognises that the arrangements for this introduction of outside equity-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the 30 per cent for the bank as a whole-</PARA>
<PARA>will be made by the Commonwealth Bank Board on the approval of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, again it is the Government which will be determining and calling all the shots in relation to this funding proposal. That is all it is. It is a funding proposal designed to try to bail out the Government of Victoria. I seek leave to table the Caucus resolution. I did seek approval from the Minister responsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Those conditions are very strenuous and what better demonstration is needed of why such assets should not be owned by government. The sale of the State Bank of Victoria raises a whole host of questions. Many of those remain largely unanswered, despite the Opposition's attempts to get answers in all possible forums. Why was the Commonwealth Bank the successful bidder when it did not put in the highest bid for the bank? The Westpac Banking Corporation had a higher bid for the State Bank of Victoria than the Commonwealth Bank did. Is it true, as has been reported and as Senator Spindler pointed out, that there are reports that the Commonwealth Bank could have purchased the State Bank without any injection of private equity? Were there moves to hide the true financial position of the State Bank from potential bidders to ensure the political deal with the Commonwealth could go ahead? Again, there are no specific answers to that question. These and many other questions are on the public record. They have been asked before many times and still we do not have any answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say to the Government that the coalition will be monitoring very carefully the situation surrounding further developments on the sale of the State Bank of Victoria and indeed the specific proposals that the Government will bring to this Parliament in relation to the sale of the 30 per cent equity in the Commonwealth Bank. If those conditions that are in the Caucus resolution are included in the legislation, as Caucus has in fact demanded, I can foreshadow a very interesting debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we will hear much more of the Commonwealth Bank in the period ahead. If the 30 per cent sale of equity does go ahead, the annual report that is before us today will be the last of its kind in the sense of the bank being 100 per cent government owned. But, as I have said, it is not a privatisation proposal that is under way. It is really a mickey mouse funding proposal to bail out the bankrupt government of the State in which I reside. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Victorian, I know full well the burdens under which we, in Victoria, are labouring as a result of the Cain Government and the Kirner Government, overlaid of course by the overriding economic mismanagement that all Australians have encountered over the last 7 1/2 years under this Hawke Federal Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>At the outset, I express my appreciation for the support of the deputy leader of the delegation, former Senator David Hamer, DSC, a distinguished ex-serviceman and a great servant of this chamber. The delegation was strengthened also by the involvement of my colleague from Queensland, Senator Bryant Burns, the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the House of Representatives, Mr Tim Fischer, MP, Mr David Connolly, MP, and a further Queensland colleague, Mr Les Scott, MP. The delegation was assisted in an exemplary way by its Secretary, Mr Peter Gibson, MC. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to the printing section of the Department of the House of Representatives for printing the text and to the Senate printing section for its work in printing the cover and completing the binding of this report. It was an outstanding cooperative effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Anzac Day 1990 on the Gallipoli peninsula was indeed a unique national event. As the report makes clear, it is difficult to imagine a similar circumstance in which four generations of Australians would gather with some of the original participants to commemorate the activities 75 years earlier of one of those generations, activities which altered the course of national events and so profoundly shaped a nation's perceptions of itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation was to have been an official parliamentary delegation to Turkey, coinciding with the seventy-fifth anniversary commemoration of the landings at Gallipoli. Certain difficulties arose with the invitation, but these need not be canvassed in the Senate at this time. It transpired, with the active support of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Presiding Officers, that the delegation's main focus in Turkey was on the events on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report indicates, to have been present as 47 original Anzacs returned to Gallipoli and to their varied memories was both a singular honour and an experience of quite extraordinary dimensions. The Anzac tradition has spoken now for four generations of Australians of all cultural, religious, racial, socio-economic and political backgrounds. It epitomises what it means to be `Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation's participation in the commemoration activities began at about 5 p.m. on 24 April 1990 when the delegation boarded the motor vessel Samsun for the journey overnight down the Dardanelle from Istanbul to the Gallipoli peninsula. As guests of the Turkish Government, the delegation joined the Prime Minister's party, the New Zealand Governor-General's party and smaller groups from Canada, France and Germany. The Samsun left Istanbul just before dusk on 24 April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time 75 years ago, men of the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade, the covering force to land at dawn the following day, were also at sea, having sailed eastward from Lemnos Island earlier in the afternoon. As night fell, the thoughts of all on board travelled back to that time. What thoughts must have occupied the minds of those original Anzacs? Were they, in Binyon's words, going `with songs to the battle'? Were they, as John Masefield wrote the following year `those marvellous young men . . . the flower of this world's manhood', to die `as they had lived, owning no master on this earth'?</PARA>
<PARA> Was there truly Masefield's `gladness of exultation that their young courage was to be used, [as] they went like kings in a pageant to the imminent death'? Or were the original Anzacs, rather, nervously apprehensive at what was before them; individually uncertain about what the dawn would bring to each of them and how they would respond; and totally unaware of the significance of their imminent actions in shaping a young nation's perception of itself?</PARA>
<PARA> One of those Anzacs wrote to his wife and young daughter at this time 75 years ago as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We are on the eve of the landing on the peninsular . . . if I fall tomorrow morning, well, I will be one of the many brave fellows who have died trying to do their duty for God and country . . . if I had not come I would not be worthy of my name . . . I wonder what it will be like. </PARA>
<PARA>The author was Major J. W. Hamilton of the 6th Battalion, Second Australian Infantry Brigade. He was killed in action on the afternoon of that first Anzac Day near Lone Pine. </PARA>
<PARA> Anzac Day at Gallipoli in 1990 allowed this nation to pay tribute to what these men did and to what the men and women supporting them accomplished. The very geography of the peninsular and its fierce and forbidding countenance, particularly in the area of the Anzac landings, reinforced the perception of enormous difficulty. This was apparent to members of the delegation as dawn broke following the dawn service. </PARA>
<PARA> The perception was further reinforced when the delegation joined thousands of other Australians at the Lone Pine Memorial for the late morning commemorative service. It was an occasion of profound significance to share this time with, and to wonder at, the memories that must have flooded the minds of the 47 original Anzacs present. The report, in discussing Lone Pine, notes the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Here, at 5.30pm on 6 August 1915 began some of the bloodiest and most concentrated fighting faced by the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Here, in an area of less than two hectares, where Australia now paused to remember and reflect, more than 2,200 Australians died in four days. Seven Victoria Crosses were awarded at Lone Pine. It is understating the circumstances, but members of the Delegation shared with so many of their fellow Australians, here gathered, a sense of meaning of the inscription by Monash on the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne:</PARA>
<PARA> LET ALL MEN KNOW THAT THIS IS HOLY GROUND. THIS SHRINE ESTABLISHED IN THE HEARTS OF MEN AS ON THE SOLID EARTH COMMEMORATES A PEOPLE'S FORTITUDE AND SACRIFICE. YE THEREFORE THAT COME AFTER GIVE REMEMBRANCE. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the delegation, on Anzac Day and subsequently, had the opportunity to traverse the battlefields of Anzac in some detail. Time precludes a detailed description, but I would like to highlight for the Senate some snapshots. These were glimpses of the enormity of the sacrifice made by this nation and New Zealand as well as Turkey, Britain and France. At Anzac Cove is the epitaph to the Anzacs written by Kemal Mustapha Ataturk, the commander confronting the Anzacs on the landing who subsequently became the first president and revered founder of modern Turkey. In an inscription which symbolises some of the unique feeling that surmounted the bloodiness and bitterness of the fighting in 1915, and since, he wrote the following:</PARA>
<PARA>You, the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries, wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the delegation noted on a headstone at Lone Pine the following:</PARA>
<PARA>805 Private G.R. Yuill, 7th Battalion, Australian Infantry, 25 April 1915, age 19. Dear is the spot to me where my beloved son rests. My Anzac hero. Mother. </PARA>
<PARA>Other sentiments were observed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>To die for his country was so dear, but his young life was dearer. </PARA>
<PARA>Died the way he wished, to die for his country. </PARA>
<PARA>His last words `Goodbye Cobber God bless you'. </PARA>
<PARA>Who dies if England lives. </PARA>
<PARA>The report makes quite clear the delegation's enormous gratitude to all those involved in the success of the pilgrimage to Gallipoli in 1990. They are: The Australian Government for its active support and for its allocation of the necessary resources to effect such a complicated and difficult task; the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, his Department and its Gallipoli 1990 task force for their outstanding management in developing the plan to fruition and executing it flawlessly; the Turkish Government which could not have done more, in Ankara before and on the Gallipoli peninsula on Anzac day itself, to ensure that all aspects of the various commemorations were covered; the Returned Services League of Australia for its pivotal role in coordinating the arrangements for the dawn service and the Lone Pine service; the Australian Defence Force for its spectacular contribution to the administrative and logistics arrangements, and for its participation which ensured the ceremonial success and the deep symbolism of the occasion; and, most importantly, the World War I Veterans' Association which, through its patron Mr Bill Hall, was instrumental in conceiving the return pilgrimage and in convincing the then defence Minister of the need for active government support and involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The report stands alone as a small tribute to the men and women of an earlier Australia who together forged, through the mystique of Gallipoli, an ethos for this young country. This serves us as well today as it did in the blood, the dread, the privation, the horror, the misery, the squalor and the filth of war 75 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> To those surviving Anzacs and other veterans who made the pilgrimage, the nation has attempted to express its appreciation. For those who did not return from Gallipoli the report closes with the best possible tribute to the Anzacs of 75 years ago when it states:</PARA>
<PARA>THEY GAVE THEIR SHINING YOUTH, AND RAISED THEREBY VALOUR'S OWN MONUMENT WHICH SHALL NOT DIE. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to endorse the remarks made by Senator Colston in relation to the report on the visit of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the seventy-fifth commemoration of the landings at Gallipoli.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a member of the Australian-Turkey parliamentary group, for some time I have had an interest in our relationship with that country. At group meetings with the Turkish ambassador, Ergun Pelit, who plays a very constructive role in developing understanding and friendship between our countries, I have been given an opportunity to have some knowledge of Turkey and its people which engendered in me a keen desire to visit that country and experience first-hand contact with the Turkish people. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the opportunity to visit as part of a parliamentary delegation to attend the seventy-fifth commemoration of Gallipoli was doubling impacting on me. Much has been said of the battles that raged, of the sacrifice, bravery and valour shown by both sides of the conflict. Prime Minister Hawke enunciated very ably and with feeling the views of most Australians reflecting their pride in the Australians who fought at Gallipoli, and their continued remembrance of their sacrifice. He expressed sadness and regret at the loss of lives on both sides and impressed on those present the need to learn lessons from those experiences and to ensure that it never happens again. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been observed by many that the conflict was probably the last occasion on which chivalry was one of the standards of behaviour on both sides. The years which followed the end of the conflict could have been marred by bitterness and hatred-particularly by those who had been invaded-but this is not the case. The Turkish national leader, Ataturk, personified the Turkish people's attitude in his 1934 epitaph for the Anzacs. This quote has already been recorded by Senator Colston who preceded me in reporting the visit of this delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> Turkey is a fascinating country to which more Australians should travel. Istanbul is the most interesting city to which I have travelled and its people are friendly and helpful, with a degree of honesty which I have not experienced in other places. It should be noted that Turkey's role in the current Gulf crisis is to deny the use of oil pipeline facilities normally used by Iraq. This action is in conformity with United Nations decisions and at great cost to the Turkish economy and living standards. I commend them for it. I commit myself to continuing to build on our current friendship and cooperation in the future for our mutual benefit-a future based, amongst other things, on the mutual respect which was established during that conflict 75 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin my response to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report on Television Violence in Australia by commending the Tribunal on the quality of the reports it has issued over the past 14 years or so. This is particularly noteworthy in view of the lack of funding provided to the Tribunal by this Government. Once again, the Tribunal has produced a well-researched document which presents some sound recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Importantly, in the formulation of this report, the Tribunal was able to take submissions from over 1,000 individuals. The Australian Democrats believe that this type of public input is essential to ensure that the agenda does not become hijacked by those with vested interests. The large number of submissions is a clear indication of the level of concern there is in the community over televised violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats welcome the recommendations of this report but have several reservations which I would like to elaborate on in the short time available to me this evening. The report on page 15 recommends the implementation of a uniform industry code on television violence. It requests the Minister to draw up such a code to be subject to the approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I endorse the suitability of this process. The implementation of the code is then to be reviewed in the normal licence renewal processes at which stage, if the licensee's performance is lacking, enforcement can then be incorporated as a condition of the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report points out, this code will represent a formalisation and, hopefully, a strengthening of the procedures already in existence in the industry. One of the great benefits of a formalised code would be that it would clearly establish the guidelines industry should employ when dealing with the violent content of programs. Of particular concern to the Australian Democrats, and indeed of many who made submissions to the inquiry, is the handling of televised violence during periods in which children may be watching. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a sad fact of life that children spend more time watching television than they do at any other waking activity, including going to school or other activities with family and friends. Around 99 per cent of Australian houses have a television set and by the age of 18, the average child has watched around 20,000 hours of television, seen 18,000 murders and viewed 640,000 commercials. Children obviously have to be resilient little creatures to resist this and I think that we have an obligation to help them resist the sort of desensitisation that must accompany such exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> With the deregulation of advertising standards we saw that the amount of advertising during children's programs was significantly increased. If we are to consider a type of industry self-regulation with respect to televised violence, we must ensure that a similar occurrence not be allowed. Some of the programs currently being shown in children's viewing hours contain a worrying level of violence, and already children are turning up to pre-school with toys and weapons from their favourite television programs. If this situation is not closely monitored I believe it will lead to children continuing to accept violence as a normal part of life and, indeed, as an acceptable means to achieving ends and solving problems when we all know the importance of other forms of conflict resolution. Recommendation 13 of the report suggests that the report be forwarded to the Australian Education Council for it to consider ways of introducing a television studies program into our primary and secondary schools. I know that such a program already exists in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only hope that the Government takes this suggestion on board and allocates the necessary funding for this project. This is particularly important in view of the cutbacks in children's programming being forced on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television by the starving of funds it is subjected to. In conclusion, I agree we all have a responsibility in relation to the broadcasting of violent content on Australian television. This report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is a useful tool providing guidance to us all in accepting and acting on this responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It causes me a great deal of concern that we are still producing masses of reports on what is happening in research areas of Australia. The effort that is going to be necessary for Australia over the next decade is particularly important. Many of the traditional sources of Australia's income, particularly our export income, are now in peril as a result of various movements, various complaints and various international situations. So, it is all the more important that we develop new strengths. This is going to happen by better science and better research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government after seven years has achieved so little and has demonstrated in this area how well the old divide and conquer theory really can work. To further that, I can say that there are now nine departments that have research components. These are: Department of Administrative Services; Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories; Department of Community Services and Health; Department of Defence; Department of Employment, Education and Training; Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce; Department of Primary Industries and Energy; Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; and Department of Transport and Communications. </PARA>

<PARA> Concerning report No. 22, Government Funding of Academic and Related Research in Australia, I find it particularly interesting to note that the main findings, in an abbreviated form, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian government funding of academic and related research was low . . . in comparison with leading European nations and the US in 1987 . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There was a marked difference in the structure of research support between Australia and overseas countries in 1984-1987 . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable divergence existed in the funding priorities for different fields between Australia and the other countries. In the period under study, the levels of Australian investment in engineering and physical sciences in particular appeared to be very low in international terms. </PARA>
<PARA>What I want to know is: Who is that any news to? After 22 reports, I would have thought that we could have had something more productive than that as the main findings of a body such as the Australian Science and Technology Council.

We know that what we have is not working, we know that it is going to take quite a change to make scientific research do something for Australia in the next decade or two.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 gives effect to some of the changes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) that were announced in the Budget. In the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 we debated some other pharmacy related changes which were also announced in the Budget. Before turning my attention to the major provisions of this Bill, it is important to highlight the Government's thoroughly unprofessional approach to the implementation of its pharmaceutical related Budget proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within days of the Budget it was glaringly obvious that the $2.50 charge was going to cause financial hardship in particular for those pensioners who were very ill. Firstly, we had Cabinet Ministers arguing about whether this unintended financial hardship should be alleviated. Then the Government had the lack of commonsense to divide the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme between two separate Bills as well as announce that further changes would be included in a third Bill. Now, as we will find out as the debate goes on, it has promised an amendment in the Committee hearing. I want to put on the record that this Bill was late coming to the House of Representatives and it was late coming to the Senate. Because of the haste surrounding this Bill, the amendment will appear in yet another Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, it is plain stupidity to have one Bill setting up the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority while another gives effect to a Government-Guild agreement upon which the agenda of the Authority will be based. Why introduce a new minimum pricing policy in one Bill and new patient contribution and safety net provisions in another Bill? Members and senators are naturally finding it quite difficult in discussing these Bills informally to identify the Bill being referred to. Senator Crowley expressed her concern last night regarding this very point when she was speaking on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill and said that it was causing confusion in discussing it with clerks and with other members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the only reason for it. There is also confusion in the community. Pharmaceutical groups have made submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs that do not refer to the Bill in question. Who is to blame for this confusion? It is the Government. Rather than owning up and not getting its legislation in order, it resorts to baseless media propaganda, claiming the Opposition is thwarting the Budget proposals by delaying this Bill beyond its start-up date. I want to put on record that I found it quite inappropriate to read in the Age that this side of the chamber was going to be using the committee stage to delay the Bill. We have never had any intention of doing that. We have all the will in the world to make those committees work. </PARA>
<PARA> This disjointed approach to implementing the pharmaceutical changes which were announced in the Budget typifies the Government's ad hoc way of finding solutions to the increasing costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The two most important changes that will be brought about if this Bill is passed in the Senate will be the introduction of a $2.50 prescription charge for pensioners and the taking of pharmacy remuneration out of the hands of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to charge sickness beneficiaries and holders of the pensioner health benefit cards $2.50 per prescription is a complete turnaround from what it said before the election. I draw to the attention of honourable senators the July issue of the Age Pension News. Only today, Senator Richardson, in an answer at Question Time, talked about the value of this publication and said how wonderful it was for pensioners. It was wonderful for pensioners in July. The headline in the July 1989 edition was, `Government Guarantee: No Charges for Pensioners'. What did it say under the headline?</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has given an unconditional guarantee to age pensioners with pensioner health benefit cards that they will not be charged for medication they receive under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on this wonderful Age Pension News says:</PARA>
<PARA> Payment arrangements for pensioners using the PBS will not be changing and the Government has no plans to charge pensioners with a PHB card for drugs subsidised under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what pensioners were told in July. Time rolled on and in the December 1989 issue of Age Pension News, a smaller issue, pensioners were told, `Free medication to continue'. Honourable senators on the other side are hanging their heads in shame. This is what pensioners were told in December 1989: `Free medication to continue'. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners can rest assured that they will continue to get their medications free under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Since 1950, pensioners have received essential medication free under the scheme and this will continue.</PARA>
<PARA>These comments were not just confined to the Government's supposedly reassuring media propaganda campaign. It was the `Minister for pharmaceutical somersaults', who himself claimed last August:</PARA>
<PARA> But the sorts of things that have been put forward to offset the rising costs of the PBS, such as altering safety net provisions and making pensioners pay . . . I do not think solve the basic issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The same Minister must break out in a hot sweat, or at least embarrassment, every time he recalls the comment that he made. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that there are a lot of people who are currently being over concerned and frightened by what some pharmacists are saying. I think that is a concern because there are many people who are old and frail and who depend upon their pharmaceuticals for their health care and they are unnecessarily concerned. The reality is that many pharmacists have had posters in their windows that say `pensioners to pay-the Government's next step'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was condemning the pharmacists for scaring the pensioners. Well the pharmacists were right. The pharmacists' crystal balls were much more accurate than the Minister's crystal ball. So here we have pensioners being told in two issues of Age Pension News, those of July and December, that they are not going to pay for their medication and then in the Budget, less than a year later, that they will be paying for their medication. The hypocrisy of this Government has to be seen to be believed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party betrayed a group in our society which is quite understandably the least capable of coping with changes-on again, off again changes. No wonder pensioners are confused and feeling frightened. Before the election the Government repeatedly told them that it would not charge them for prescriptions and then it did exactly the opposite. To have Senator Cook sit there yesterday and say that the Government was going to stand by its election promises made me roar with laughter and must have made every pensioner in this country laugh. In the light of this complete turnaround I reckon we would have to go a long way to find any pensioners who still believe what this Government tells them. </PARA>
<PARA> Traits such as integrity and honesty are something that are very important to the elderly, but sadly these words have been deleted from the vocabulary and behaviour of the Government's dealings with its senior citizens. When people retire they are looking for some stability. What do they get from this Government? They do not get stability. They are looking for guarantees at last, not promises that are broken at the drop of a hat. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the announcement of the $2.50 pensioner charge in the Budget it has become very obvious that the Government gave no prior thought to how this initiative would be implemented. Almost daily we hear of the Government's latest cut and paste attempt to minimise the hardship caused by the implementation of this proposal. First we had Senator Richardson admitting that the social security phones were running hot about the imposition of this charge and something had to be done to compensate financially the chronically ill. Then we had Ministers Howe and Staples as well as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) telling Senator Richardson to forget his compensation proposal. Lo and behold, Labor's number-crunching right wing power broker won the battle and a joint press statement was issued announcing a $50 lump sum payment at the beginning of November. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Minister Howe was reportedly trying to convince the States not to apply the subsumed payment to people in State subsidised housing, even though the Government had not thought about how it was going to control nursing homes and had not thought through what sorts of amendments would be made to stop the nursing homes taking 87.5 per cent of the $2.50. That had not even crossed its mind. So at the same time as all this was going on, Minister Staples was claiming that he would ensure that nursing homes did not take 87.5 per cent of the $2.50 increase when it was subsumed in the pension in March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Then last night in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs committee stage of this Bill, Minister Richardson told us that the $2.50 will not be subsumed in the pension but will remain an additional payment that will be quarantined from the pension. I also know that it will not be able to be quarantined for people in special accommodation housing and other facilities in the States that are not Commonwealth funded. The Commonwealth's never ending toing-and-froing in regard to this matter has left pensioners not knowing whether they are Arthur or Martha and the Government's teething problems are not over with even now. As I mentioned, how will the Government ensure that the $2.50 pension supplement is not incorporated into the fixed percentage fees charged by non-government subsidised housing? The fact is, as I mentioned before, it cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question that should be asked here is why the Government has restricted the $50 lump sum payment to full-rate pensioners. Part-rate pensioners who are eligible for the pension health benefit card are just as likely to be chronically ill, but hardly any more able to cope with this costing position in the short term. Why is the same $50 lump sum payment being paid to single pensioners and pensioner couples? Surely married couples are twice as likely to be financially burdened by having to pay for multiple prescriptions within a short period. We keep getting the safety net argument from Senator Richardson, but it is irrelevant because this problem relates to the speed in which single and married pensioners will use the 52 pensions for which they are being compensated and not the level at which the safety net takes effect. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen to the sick pensioner who has not got the money to pay for a prescription, but who fronts up at a pharmacy urgently requiring treatment? I suppose he might as well wait for the money because he is going to be waiting a long time while the pharmacist rings a doctor to get a substitute drug, especially if the pharmacist cannot find the doctor. I suppose the pensioner will be able to sit there and wait until the doctor gets the substitution and his next $2.50 turns up. I guess he will have to wait about as long for both. Will the pensioner, upon realising that it is going to take some time to get the substitute or that he has not got the money for his or her prescription just not bother to obtain treatment?</PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners claims that increasing morbidity and mortality in the elderly will ensue from this $2.50 charge. This claim should not be rejected as being totally alarmist. There will be some older pensioners who, in fact, go without their medication because of the confusion, because of the fact that this has not been thought through. It is a valid argument that this $2.50 charge financially rewards pensioners who do not get scripts filled and fails to provide emergency relief for those who want and need a drug but simply cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been little consideration of how the Government's new minimum pricing policy will affect pensioners. As I said last night, the elderly are the biggest users of pharmaceuticals and they will be most affected by the decision to make the consumer pay the difference between the cheapest alternative and the drug prescribed. It will place an extra financial burden on pensioners especially as the extra amount paid for the more expensive drug will not count towards the safety net. I think many of them will opt for the more expensive drug, and may go without other things because they are familiar with that drug and also because they maybe too sick to stand and wait while the pharmacist gets the change. I am not sure that in six weeks we are going to be able to educate doctors to change their prescribing habits. </PARA>
<PARA> My concerns are not restricted just to the repercussions of this decision. There is growing evidence to suggest that this charge will not necessarily help stop the blow-out in the pharmaceutical budget. Given that I am of the opinion that these measures will not ensure that the cost of the PBS will not continue to grow, what else should be done? A paper prepared by the Australian Institute of Health, which is government-funded, found no evidence of hoarding and wasting of drugs by pensioners and that they might be more careful than other groups in the use of them. If this is correct, the $2.50 charge on pensioners appears to be addressing the wrong target. The Government seems to have refused to address overprescribing. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask why there is a problem of over prescribing in the community. The significant factor would be community attitudes to drug taking. If people go to the doctor there is an expectation that they will leave the surgery with a script, and if that does not happen it is felt that the doctors have not been doing their job. I believe that we need to change this attitude in the community. We need to change it by educating doctors, and I shall be interested to see whether the new vocational registration program has any effect; I do not believe it will. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to change practices in medical schools so that doctors address preventive measures and look at other ways of treating patients than necessarily prescribing pharmaceuticals. Doctors should feel that it is okay to see patients and send them away without a prescription. The community should be educated to the view that in many cases this is the right thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Doctors also rely heavily on information regarding new drugs and therapies from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. We all know the great effort that goes into that-in fact, $200m a year is put into this effort by the pharmaceutical companies in providing this information. I believe that many doctors rely too heavily on this information, but a number of doctors have told me that the Government does not ensure that doctors have as much objective information about the available drugs as is possible and about their relative costs that are brought to their attention. This is another area where the medical community should be much more aware of their social responsibility, and of the fact that they are dealing with taxpayers' money when they write prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Health promotion programs should also be directed to the area of prescription drugs so that the community is more aware of the dangers of drug interaction. We know-and there is evidence to suggest-that large numbers of admissions of older people to hospitals are as a result of drug interaction, which is based on over-prescribing by doctors. We were talking earlier about pensioners being frugal and looking after the way they deal with drugs, but many have been over- prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example involving a friend of mine's mother who was admitted in a state of dementia to a public hospital in Victoria. Her doctor was bulk-billing and was visiting the woman every week. She thought that it was wonderful to see him every week, but he would also visit a number of pensioners and prescribe drugs. After the woman was detoxified in the hospital, she went from being demented back to her normal state. Now, six years later, with a new doctor and better control of her drugs, at the age of 87 she is still living at home. But at the age of 81 she looked to me as though she was heading for a nursing home and a dementia unit. That was the result of drug interaction. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter that interests me in this regard. There is more information on drug packaging to people who give their dogs worm tablets than there is on packages containing drugs to be given to humans. An owner who obtains a treatment for a tiny dog will see on the packet that so many tablets should be prescribed for a dog of that size. If the dog is an Alsatian, the owner will know the amount of drugs to be given for that size of dog. But for a thin, small woman as against a large woman-I would not use any examples here, Madam Acting Deputy President, for the purposes of comparison-or a large man, no comparative dosage would be offered on the packaging. Therefore, there are problems in that regard. Diseases or disorders arise out of the drugs that are being taken, and then a further increase in the drug bill arises from having to deal with drug-induced illness. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also be making the community aware of the fact that the other problem of the overuse of drugs is antibiotic resistance. It seems to me that people in the community feel that if they have a cough or a cold they have to go and get antibiotics. The other day I was with a student who was on work experience and got a sore throat. She went to see one of my colleagues here in this House and he told her, `You don't need antibiotics. You need some aspirin-and make sure you have some early nights and stay in a constant temperature'. That was the sort of treatment we had when we were younger. People actually did some home nursing. The student was quite astonished. She said to me, `I think that I need antibiotics'. I said, `Have you been spitting anything green or coloured?'. She said that she had not and I said that the doctor was probably correct in assuming that she did not need antibiotics. But that is what members of the community are demanding of the medical profession, and that is something we must change. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also consider how changes in lifestyle may reduce reliance on drugs. I was speaking only today to a pharmacist in my State who gave me an example involving a lady in his rural community. The lady in question was grossly overweight and was being prescribed six types of tablets a day. A new doctor, who took great interest in community medicine and preventative medicine, took her over as a patient and put her on a weight loss program which was very successful. That lady is down to one tablet a day. The doctor told me that he could relate story after story, and he is a doctor who takes an interest in his patients. Some of these patients are now reducing their medication. That is what this community needs. It needs an effective health education program aimed at doctors, medical students, allied health professionals and the community. In the long run that will be the answer to reducing the acceleration of PBS costs which are within our control. </PARA>
<PARA> The $2.50 is another example of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) opening his mouth first and then being made aware of the adverse repercussions later. It is another example of this Minister-and we have seen this in nursing home legislation that he has put through-pulling a quick-fix solution out of the bag without really knowing whether his solution will have the effect that he desires. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major change that will be brought about by this Bill is that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will be required to give effect to agreements between the Government and any organisation that represents a majority of approved pharmacists. I would be interested if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (Senator McMullan) would say how often that could change if a group presents itself and has sufficient evidence that it represents a majority of pharmacists. I could see chaos occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 also stipulates that the Tribunal must cease any current inquiries in relation to areas which are covered by an agreement and cannot hold any further inquiries in relation to such areas. This clause renders the Tribunal redundant as an independent pharmacy remuneration decision-maker. Some of the Tribunal's recent decisions have not been well received by either the Government or the pharmacy profession, and I think most of us here in this chamber would agree. But it is a knee-jerk reaction by the Government to effectively do away with the Tribunal, as this Bill will do. When there is so much flak flying around about the Government's excessive intrusion into pharmacy, then it is surely far more sensible to maintain this independent body. Rather than making the Tribunal a mere rubber stamp the Government should direct its efforts towards improving the Tribunal's expertise and ensuring its impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Pharmacy Guild have come to an agreement about remuneration and restructuring which the Government is desperate to implement as soon as possible-hence the speed at which this Bill has been put through this House. There is not inconsiderate disquiet in pharmacy ranks about the contents of the agreement and the effects of the changes announced in the Budget. Those of us interested in this subject know that there is not inconsiderable disquiet, and evidence could be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence could be forthcoming, but to date I have not been given evidence which would unequivocally demonstrate that the agreement does not have the tacit support of the majority of the pharmacists. However, the need to implement one agreement does not warrant the destruction of the whole mechanism by which remuneration is decided. This is especially the case when the new mechanism leaves itself open to greater cries of government interference than before. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen what has happened to education. Only yesterday, we had universities close down. One thing that has happened in education, which I argued about in this place when the legislation was going through, is that when there is no independent body between a Minister and an industry, whatever that might be-whether it be higher education or pharmacy-there is great concern. When I was speaking on the education legislation I referred to a speech by Mr Barry Jones, the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, when he was talking about the textile, clothing and manufacturing industry and how it was to have an independent body. In fact, I quoted from his speech. That Minister was aware of the need to have an independent body. But here we have Minister Staples making impotent the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the long term these changes subject the pharmacy profession to the whim of government as never before. It also increases the likelihood that informed and impartial decision making will be constricted by conflict between the Government and pharmacists. As well-we have seen it happening now-there will be internal squabbling within peak pharmacy organisations. Both the Government and pharmacists will soon learn that sacking the umpire because they do not agree with his decision can mean that they have to start playing the game according to the rules of the jungle. </PARA>
<PARA> The demolition of the Tribunal, like the imposition of the $2.50 charge, is a bandaid which the Government hopes will provide a quick fix to the most immediately pressing pharmaceutical problems. As I said before, the Government has failed to properly think through the short and long term ramifications of either of these changes. Most importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that either of these changes will result in any significant improvement in either the cost or effectiveness of our pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats consider the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 to be particularly significant and one which will have a great and detrimental impact upon many Australians. As such, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill and to foreshadow the actions of the Australian Democrats as this legislation is put to the vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, this legislation amends a number of Acts and has a number of implications. I shall be dealing with those parts of the legislation which give effect to the Government's announcement in the Budget of changes in the level of patient contribution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), particularly the decision to start charging pensioners and beneficiaries $2.50 per prescription from 1 November. My colleague Senator Coulter will deal with those parts of the legislation that cover the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators are already aware of the contents of this legislation, and I trust that they are also aware of the great concern being expressed throughout the community at the prospect of the introduction of a $2.50 prescription charge, particularly for pensioners. Indeed, since this move was signalled by the Government in the Budget the Australian Democrats have received numerous letters and telephone calls from invalid and age pensioners as well as community groups and welfare organisations, all expressing their concern about this ill-considered proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Just how ill-considered the measure is can be clearly judged by the fact that it had to be significantly altered following its introduction to the House of Representatives when the Government realised that, contrary to its claims, the original proposal would adversely affect significant numbers of pensioners, particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The bright sparks that thought up this proposal then had to do a quick back flip, with the result that we now have a provision for the payment of advance pharmaceutical supplements. This is certainly a welcome recognition by the Government that it had not properly considered the effects of this Bill in the first place. But it still fails to address the serious concerns which the Democrats and many welfare and pensioner organisations have about the Bill. We believe the imposition of a $2.50 charge on pensioners for pharmaceutical benefits is poorly considered and ill-founded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been arguing for some time that there is some sort of massive blow-out in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which justifies higher consumer contribution. This is yet another example of the Government's using colourful rhetoric in its desire to obscure the facts. Yes, the PBS expenditure is escalated, and yes, it must of course be of concern to any government. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are a number of important points worth making. First, the claim of a blow-out needs to be critically examined. The Government likes to bandy around the figure of about $1.2 billion per year in PBS expenditure. On paper and in the mouths of Government Ministers and spokespersons this figure looks and sounds alarming. Add to it the claims of the Department of Community Services and Health that PBS expenditure will double by 1992 and we have a startling picture of uncontrolled, rapidly escalating costs. Is this the real picture?</PARA>
<PARA> Many very well-informed people who operate in the real world beyond this Government's limited horizons say that this is not the real picture and that the Government is basing its policies on the reform of the PBS on misinformation and totally inadequate data. For example, the pharmacy consultancy firm of Feros, Riley and Associates, which appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs when it examined the Bill, has monitored PBS expenditure for the past two years. It believes the actual expenditure over the next few years will be well below the projections of the Department of Community Services and Health. I think we also have to bring some critical factors to bear when looking at PBS expenditure. The term `blow-out' is vastly misleading. It implies a sudden, dramatic escalation in costs, whereas what has occurred is a significant but gradual increase over many years, an increase that can be quite adequately explained by inflation, the increasing size of our population and, most importantly, the increasing aged population. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a number of factors may be contributing to unnecessary expenditure beyond the role of consumers. Critical factors include: the role of doctors in dispensing drugs to pensioners; the role of promotional advertising relating to cost effective prescribing by doctors; the number and age range of pharmaceuticals available within the PBS; the role of pharmacists in dispensing drugs to pensioners and the lack of consumer awareness about pharmaceuticals in general, as Senator Patterson has already outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Government knows the true impact of these different factors on the PBS expenditure, and until it does, it has absolutely no justification for forcing pensioners and other consumers to bear the brunt of the Government's desire to reduce the cost of the PBS system. The Government's simplistic method of reducing the consumption of pharmaceuticals by raising consumer contributions is not supported by the available evidence. I can understand that it is tempting for the Government to take the view that drugs are subsidised, that there is some evidence of over-consumption, that there must be some sort of casual link between the two, and that, therefore, if it charges consumers more, the rate of consumption will fall. It all sounds very simple. But quite simply, it is not true. If this reasoning was correct, we would surely expect price rises to result in decreasing drug use. Clearly, that has not occurred, and the growth in drug use has continued steadily, despite a series of moves by various governments to increase consumer contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the demand for drugs does not fall with increasing prices. People do not suddenly start wanting prescriptions just because they are cheap. Price is quite simply not a decisive factor in the supply and consumption of pharmaceuticals. As Mr Ian McAuley, in his economic analysis of the PBS prepared for the Consumers' Health Forum, noted:</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, demand for drugs is largely outside the control of consumers or the control of the market price mechanisms. It has more to do with the prescribing practices of medical practitioners and with consumers' faith in drug based remedies more than with prices. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia in its submission to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Provider incentives have been generally reported to be more effective in altering health goods and service usage patterns than consumer copayments. Provider incentives are conspicuously absent from the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's move to introduce new patient contributions is not based on fact. It is merely part of the current fashion of seeing market-oriented solutions as the be all and end all, regardless of whether or not they do, in reality, provide a solution and with scant regard for the facts fitting their theories. The Royal Australian College of Practitioners expressed it in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The aim of Government to cut down the pharmaceutical cost to the community for drugs needed by pensioners may be theoretically laudable: the effect on the elderly, however, may well be medically disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is precisely the point. The Government does not know what the effects of this legislation will be on pensioners. It is gambling with the health and the lives of elderly, sick and disabled Australians. Further, even if PBS expenditure is $2 billion per year, this amounts to an expenditure of only $2 per Australian per week on pharmaceuticals-a lot less, I might add, than the country spends on cigarettes or alcohol every week. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do not know when the Department and the Government toss these figures around is how much in other health costs this expenditure may be actually saving; in other words, the Government has no idea at all of the cost effectiveness of this expenditure. Is it, in fact, keeping elderly persons and invalid pensioners out of hospital? Again, these facts are missing. Is it assisting them to continue their lives in their own homes rather than have them move into government subsidised hostels or nursing homes? Is it enabling them to contribute more productively to the community, such as through voluntary work, helping their families with child-care responsibilities, et cetera?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government simply does not know the answers to all these-and many more-questions about the cost-effectiveness of the PBS. It cannot tell us because it does not have the data, it does not have the information and it has not undertaken any analysis. It is precisely because of this lack of information that the Australian Democrats have repeatedly called for a full-scale inquiry into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and we continue to argue that such a review is long overdue and highly desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is grossly irresponsible of the Government and the Opposition, if they support this Bill, to proceed with a set of measures when they have absolutely no reliable data on which to base them and a great deal of extremely disturbing evidence about the possible consequences for a large proportion of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Aside from the fact that this Bill has sprung from an information vacuum, there are a number of other problems in the legislation. Some of these problems arise from a mistaken assumption that pensioners are all going to be in a position to actively protect their own interests and ensure they are not financially or medically disadvantaged. We believe it is pretty obvious that this will not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, any change in the rules of play affecting the elderly and the ill is likely to cause confusion. But it is not good enough to use this difficulty as an excuse and simply to shrug one's shoulders and say, `Oh well, any changes affecting elderly people will cause them confusion; it really can't be helped'. I think we have an obligation to minimise the potential trouble and confusion caused to older persons and we should, in fact, take even greater care when we introduce measures that affect these groups. Community and professional groups have expressed their views that confusion will indeed reign supreme as a result of this legislation and that many aged and invalid pensioners will be disadvantaged as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as having sat through the Minister's evidence to the Committee, I have to say that I am far from satisfied with the Government's proposals for an education program in relation to these changes. I think that only $3m a year will be spent. I do not believe that with that small amount of money this confusion will be greatly reduced at all, especially amongst the old, frail and isolated pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> With this Bill, we are in danger of introducing a two-tier pension system-a higher rate of pension for those who are fit and well and a lower rate for those who are ill and infirm. This point was made to the Committee by the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Society is concerned that this measure significantly reduces the equitableness of the PBS. Under this proposal, pensioners who are ill will be financially disadvantaged compared to pensioners who enjoy good health. Access to PBS drugs by those who need them most will be reduced. This seems to strike hard at the heart of the Scheme's oft stated social objective of access to subsidised pharmaceuticals according to need. </PARA>
<PARA>Other than these very fundamental problems, various other difficulties arise throughout this Bill and the Australian Democrats sought in the Committee to move some amendments that would at least reduce the impact of the legislation. I want to go through these in some detail because I think they demonstrate that the Government really does not understand how this Bill will impact upon pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, pensioners-especially those with a chronic condition-are likely to experience a reduction in their income due to the increased costs of medicines. It needs to be very clearly understood by this chamber that the additional $2.50 provided for does not allow for the increased costs a pensioner may have to pay if he is not prescribed the cheapest drug by his medical practitioner. Again, Senator Patterson went through this is some detail. The increased amount does not count towards the safety net. The safety net means that the pensioner will have to carry his card with him at all times when he wants medication. He will have to make sure that it is filled out properly, that he does not lose it or, indeed, that it is not stolen. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the advance payment arrangements also raise their own problems.  In reality, they will offer only limited protection to a small proportion of the pensioner population. The Government tells us that it introduced these moves to protect the chronically ill pensioners but, of course, it is simply not possible for the Government accurately to target such pensioners under its proposal and it has opted instead to target the poorest pensioners by restricting advances beyond the first payment to those pensioners who have liquid assets of less than only $1,000 and who earn less than $10 a week in non-pension income. </PARA>
<PARA> This move does assist in some way. But we believe that it is a paltry amount and in committee sought to have these amounts raised. It relies on pensioners themselves recognising that they are eligible for the additional advances and going through the process of making arrangements to secure such advances. This will be difficult, if not impossible, for those pensioners who are confused, frail, isolated in their own home or simply not in receipt of good, if any, advice. </PARA>
<PARA> It relies upon pensioners comprehending the nature of the advances and being able to exercise a choice about setting money aside for potential medical needs. As a number of groups have pointed out, many pensioners may forget what the extra amount was for and spend it on other items or may simply have other more pressing items on which they spend their $2.50. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation still fails to address the problem of multiple scripts being required at any one time. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners pointed out to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . pensioners will have great difficulty in paying $10.00 in one hit for 4 drugs (repeat prescriptions); the choice of either postponing, buying the necessary drugs or not buying them at all will undoubtedly occur. As a result, increasing morbidity and mortality in the elderly will ensue. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the pharmaceutical supplement was not to continue beyond March 1991 was of major concern to the Democrats. It became evident as the Committee hearings went on that in some cases a percentage of the $2.50 was already being taken in some private rental markets despite the fact that this measure does not even come in until 1 November. Therefore, one of the amendments that we moved sought to redress this to some extent and, in particular, hopefully quarantine the amount from the hands of State governments so that the full $2.50 will flow on to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to say that, though this move was defeated in the Committee by a combined vote of the Liberal and Labor senators, the Government has now taken this on board and will be moving an amendment later on in this session to another Bill to bring this into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has often been said during public discussion about these measures that they will reduce hoarding of pharmaceuticals by pensioners. Once again, I simply ask the Government: Where is the evidence? A 1986 survey by the Australian Institute of Health concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> No evidence of hoarding was found for either pensioners or any other group. If hoarding was significant then it seems that it should have appeared in 600 pensioner households. </PARA>
<PARA>The report actually goes on to say that pensioners waste fewer drugs than other drug users. But the most interesting conclusion the Australian Institute of Health reached in its survey of some 1,800 households was this:</PARA>
<PARA> If it is correct that persons with access to free drugs do not waste drugs-or if they do, at a rate no worse than people who pay for their drugs-then the imposition of user charges is unlikely to solve this `problem'. User charges would address the wrong target . . . if pensioners consume too many drugs then this is a problem of correcting prescribing practices. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to note that today I received-I stress that it is only three examples-the first examples that the Minister has provided of any overprescribing, where people received drugs in excess of their requirements. There has been no formal study that has proved that there is any large-scale overprescribing. I quote from one letter:</PARA>
<PARA> My aunt is not to blame. </PARA>
<PARA>She was 91 years of age. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> She is too old to be aware of the significance of getting prescriptions dispensed unnecessarily.  She merely accepts the prescription from her doctor and takes it to the chemist for dispensing. </PARA>
<PARA>With the Australian Institute of Health, we have an expert professional body saying that charging pensioners is not going to achieve the Government's aims. In fact, this Bill may actually promote hoarding as there is likely to be a tendency for pensioners to stockpile medicines once they reach the ceiling, the safety net. Pensioners have also indicated to me that hoarding will be encouraged as pensioners will be even more uncertain about future budgetary changes and may be more likely to stockpile their existing medications. As we heard before the Committee, there is government induced preprescribing going on now with a very large increase in the amount pensioners have obtained just in the last two months. </PARA>
<PARA> Another difficulty that has been the subject of much correspondence from pensioners is the fact that the supplement will be $2.50 for singles but only $1.25 per head for married couples. I must say that the continuing inequity between single and married pensioners is of particular concern to the Australian Democrats. I do not believe that in these times, when we give at least lip service to notions of equality, we can continue to see married couples as some sort of indivisible unit. Many pensioners have written to me pointing this out and arguing most convincingly that they will be individually, and as a couple, out of pocket because they both suffer from chronic illnesses with ongoing medication needs. If the Government is correct-if we do give it the benefit of the doubt just for a moment-and those pensioners who are well are going to be better off, those married pensioners are going to be only half as well off. Therefore, we say again that this is discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make a particular point about psychiatric patients. This group has been largely ignored in media and public discussion on these changes. These people were mentioned in several submissions before the Committee as being at particular risk because they may simply choose not to take medication if they are asked to pay for their prescriptions. Once again, we are talking about a group of pensioners who may lack the capacity to exercise judgment about these matters, and it is quite clear that these consumers are the ones most at risk under the new moves. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, a number of groups representing people with disabilities have also expressed their concern on behalf of people with intellectual disabilities who will experience similar problems under the proposed arrangements. As well, we have heard from voluntary organisations operating nursing homes and hostels which are worried about incompetent older and disabled people who will not be able to keep track of their affairs sufficiently to be able to apply for the advances or to keep a full tally of all the prescriptions they have to the point that they reach their free limit.</PARA>
<PARA> There is much more that I could say about this legislation. I doubt that any proposal put forward by this Government since it came to power has attracted so much criticism and concern from the community. I can only say again that it is highly irresponsible that this Government can proceed with a move that is based on conjecture, misinformation and a total lack of knowledge about the likely effects of its proposals on the health of pensioners. What the Government and probably the Opposition are doing is quite blatantly experimenting with the health, and possibly even the lives, of a number of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put on the record the Democrat's amendments that we moved unsuccessfully in the Committee. There were a total of 14 either direct amendments or requests. The amendments covered five areas. I have already mentioned the one on quarantining. Secondly, we tried to have raised the eligibility criteria for advance payments from $1,000 to $2,000 and earnings from $10 a week to $30 a week. We still consider these to be very low amounts, but at least it represented some improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> We also attempted to increase the married rate of supplement to $2.50 per person. Earlier I detailed why we did this. We attempted to extend the payment of supplements to all concessional beneficiaries under the new definitions. This would have extended the supplements to recipients of unemployment benefit. We believe that the Government is creating a third or fourth class of beneficiary by continuing to hit unemployment beneficiaries extremely hard and to now imply, through this legislation, that they still do not need any assistance when other pensioners will be getting assistance for medication. That is unacceptable to the Democrats. Another amendment-and Senator Coulter will speak on this-was to remove clause 9. I note, unfortunately, that none of the amendments was supported by the Liberal or Labor parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the main concern of this chamber must be the effect this legislation will have on the mental and physical health of aged and invalid pensioners. It is clear that, despite the safeguards the Government finally acknowledged were necessary, this proposal introduces an incentive for forgoing medication. This would be the case with any group in the population, but it is particularly so for aged and disabled persons who are frail, confused, non-ambulant or isolated. The Australian Democrats cannot and will not support such ill-founded legislation. I can only hope that the Opposition will agree that there is no evidence to support the need for this legislation and that, even if some money was going to be saved, it is far too high a price to pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Social Welfare (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 is a unique one. It is the first time, under the new Senate standing committee system, that the Selection of Bills Committee, with the support of the Senate, has recommended that a Bill be sent to the appropriate Senate standing committee before the second reading debate. The result of the actual inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I believe, is very positive. I say `actual inquiry' because it is separate from the conduct of the Committee and is a totally different matter. I will speak on that later. First of all, I will deal with the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill introduces for the first time payments by pensioners for those drugs on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). This is despite the promises that Senator Patterson referred to-promises made by the Government prior to the last election that no additional costs would be imposed for pharmaceutical benefits. The Government has said that this is purely and simply a cost cutting exercise. It claims that if pensioners are forced to pay $2.50 per prescription this will reduce the number of prescriptions that pensioners obtain and, therefore, will cut the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for the Government. We will have to wait and see whether this occurs. We will have to see whether the Government is right and whether pensioners will not take their prescriptions to pharmacists to be filled. We will have to wait and see what does happen as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To save pensioners being disadvantaged, the Government tells us that it intends to increase the pension by $2.50 a week, which it hopes will cover the cost of the average pension. The concern is that pensioners may decide not to present their prescriptions that are vital for their health because they either run out of money or have other priorities as to how they spend that $2.50. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist pensioners who require a number of drugs in the first few months, the Government has decided to give pensioners entitled to full pension a one-off lump sum of $50 and two other small lump sums at later dates. There will be a safety net so that once a pensioner uses the full entitlement in one year-that is, $130-all further PBS drugs will be free. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that the pharmacists will keep a record of the number and type of drugs the pensioner has bought so that when the pensioner reaches that safety net level, he or she will be able to apply for free drugs. The Government has decided to further save money by allowing only generic drugs to be prescribed for eligibility to that $2.50 benefit. Pensioners will have to change their usual brand of drugs for generic ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Mostly, there is very little difference between the chemical makeup of the generic drugs and non-generic drugs, but packaging, size and colour are vastly different. For an aged pensioner taking several drugs a day it can be very confusing. For instance, pensioners are used to taking the large blue one after breakfast, the small yellow one and the bigger green one with lunch and perhaps the small white one with tea. That is how it is described by the doctor; that is how it is described by the pharmacist. But now, if they are using the generic drugs, all the tablets will be white and all the same size. If they insist on using their usual brand, then they will have to pay the $2.50 plus the additional cost of that particular drug. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence was given to the Committee regarding the need for quarantining. Evidence was given to us that if the amount of $2.50 for the total pension was not quarantined, then State governments, nursing homes, et cetera, could use that $2.50 as a percentage of their usual accommodation costs to pensioners. The concern was that after 1 February 1990, when the $2.50 became part of the increase in pension, the purpose of the amount would soon be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Australian Democrats have shown their concern by putting forward an amendment in an attempt to rectify this. But we were told by the Government that this was not necessary. In our last meeting on Wednesday night we were told that the Government has decided to bring in amendments to a subsequent Bill to quarantine this amount. This we applaud. This is why I earlier said that the actual inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has been very positive. The evidence was given in front of the bureaucrats. The bureaucrats and the Minister heard the situation from the people who came and gave evidence along this line. They were able to get their views across very clearly. So the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) was able to change the legislation to have this $2.50 quarantined. </PARA>
<PARA> A list of people will be eligible under the scheme. I quote that list because most people think it applies only to aged pensioners. It applies to aged pensioners, invalid pensioners, people receiving a wife's pension, a carer's pension, a sole parent's pension, a widowed person's allowance, a sheltered employment allowance, a rehabilitation allowance, or a class B widow's pension. The rate of those pensions or allowances referred to in that list is not reduced on the basis of a person's income maintenance, income or property. An additional category to that list is people aged 60 and over who have been receiving unemployment benefits for at least six months. We all know the problems of those over 60 in being able to get a subsequent job. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also increases the maximum contribution by the general public from $11 to $15, again with a safety net, so that once a person has paid out $300 in any one year, all following prescriptive drugs will be free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to a major concern-the agreement between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government. To permit the Government to lower the remuneration to pharmacists and save itself money, the Government has given the pharmacists permission to overcharge a general client by up to $2. Should a drug cost $13-we had evidence before our Committee that the average drug costs roughly between $12 and $13-then the pharmacist will be permitted to charge an additional $2, making a total of $15. That, after all the abuse heaped on the head of the profession just over 12 months ago!</PARA>
<PARA> We all remember those headlines in the papers-`Government may be forced to legislate to stop drug rip-offs' and `Federal Government is looking at ways of changing legislation for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to prevent pharmacists overcharging for prescription drugs'. We then had the next one-`How chemists rip you off on prescriptions'. </PARA>
<PARA> In August last year the Federal Department of Community Services and Health launched an investigation into what is believed to be millions of dollars worth of overcharging by pharmacists. We now have the situation sanctioned by the Government. The Government is saying to the pharmacists, `You have a right to rip off the general public as far as the prescriptions are concerned. You can overcharge to the tune of $2 because, if you get that money in, we can pay you less as regards your prescription rate'. I have never quite believed that such hypocrisy by any Government could exist, but I guess this Government's hypocrisy is unlimited. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night on another piece of legislation I spoke at length about the closing down and amalgamation provisions of the Guild's agreement with the Government. Under this agreement, if a pharmacist has owned a pharmacy for, say, 16 years-and it does go up and down-then the Government, to encourage closures, will buy the pharmacist out. The Government would agree to pay the pharmacist $80,000-that is, if he or she owned it for 16 years. The Government, or rather the taxpayer, would pay half of that; the other half would go as a debt to the remaining pharmacists. The total buy outs could result in many millions of dollars. As I say, the taxpayer pays half and the remaining pharmacists pay the other half. </PARA>
<PARA> The method used to force the remaining pharmacists to pay that debt is 1c on every pharmaceutical benefits prescription written in the first year, 2c in the second year, 3c in the third year, 4c in the fourth year, et cetera, until the debt is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting of the New South Wales branch of the Pharmacy Guild on 16 October, just a few days ago, a motion was passed by about 90 votes to 10. I quote that motion:</PARA>
<PARA>The Annual General Meeting directs the State Branch President of the NSW Branch of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to advise the National President and ALL National Councillors that any Amalgamation / Closure package which is to be substantially FUNDED BY EVERY APPROVED PHARMACIST be removed from the current or any subsequent agreement between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and any other party. </PARA>
<PARA>Ninety people at the annual general meeting of the New South Wales branch of the Guild voted against that amalgamation-closure. That is only New South Wales, and I do not know how the other States view that, but I do know that by a very large majority the New South Wales branch opposes that part of the agreement. It was not just that motion; there were many motions. Another states:</PARA>
<PARA>This meeting rejects the statement from the H.I.C. that ALL Pharmacies from 1st February, 1991 will be required to submit NHS and Repat payments by way of C.T.S. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also motion G, and this, perhaps, is the most telling of all because it states:</PARA>
<PARA>We, members of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, N.S.W. Branch, present at the A.G.M., demand the resignation of the National Councillors who were in office at the time the original ``Heads of Agreement'' was prepared and presented publicly on 22nd July 1990, because this National Council herein referred to has failed to further and protect the interests of its members by presenting with the Commonwealth, a parallel submission to the P.B.R.T. for ratification. By so doing this same National Council has disadvantaged its members both financially and professionally. Consequently, the Members of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia present at the A.G.M. direct the Branch President, to institute this action within 5 days. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish I had time to read the other motions because it would be very clear to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, that there is great dissension between the members of the Guild. I believe the Guild has already been presented with more than enough signatures to hold a referendum. I do not believe the Government should go ahead with the agreement between the Guild and the Government until that referendum has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to clause 9 because that is the crux of the whole situation. Clause 9 requires the Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal to rubber-stamp any agreement between the Government and any organisation which represents the majority of approved pharmacists. At the moment, that is the Guild. What will happen after the referendum? Will it still be the Guild or will the Guild members-or hierarchy-be forced to go to another election?</PARA>
<PARA> We have been told there is to be a meeting tomorrow-and I would like to ask the Minister if he would verify that- between the Tribunal, the Guild and the Government, or between the Government and the Guild, for ratification. There are so many sections of that agreement which the New South Wales Branch, at least-as I say, I do not know how the other States fare-is totally opposed to, that I believe it would be wrong in the extreme if the Government went ahead with it under the present situation. As I say, the Guild has its problems. It has received more than enough signatures for that referendum. It should be held as quickly as possible, and the Government should insist upon knowing who it should be talking to-just which members of the Guild have the numbers. I believe it would be totally immoral of the Government, knowing the present situation within the Pharmacy Guild, to go ahead with this legislation, not knowing for sure that the majority of the membership backs it. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement between the Guild and the Government covers many issues. One section of that agreement the pharmacists really believed was binding was that part in which the Government promised not to introduce any further cost disadvantages for pharmacists without full consultation. Of course, we now know that that promise also was broken-not only the promise to the pensioners that their costs would not be increased, but also the promise to the Guild that any further costs would have full consultation before implementation. Of course, we know that the budgetary decisions now place tremendous cost disadvantage on the pharmacists. This is in the way of computers, black boxes, et cetera. Many Guild members believe that, because this promise was broken, the whole of the agreement should be scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no use the Government saying it was a Budget decision, and that it cannot consult over Budget decisions. It need not have been a Budget decision; it could have been a decision made by the Government after the Budget-after full consultation-if it wished to keep its side of the agreement. But no, the Government decided that it would not stick to its agreement and that it would force through these Bills which are presently before us for no other reason than that it knows that the Opposition will not oppose a Budget Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> My remaining concern is the fact that a file is kept on every pensioner. We asked many questions about this in the Committee. We know that a pensioner's name and number and the drug that is being used are kept in the file and will be passed on to the Government. We are told that all the privacy in the world will be maintained, but this is of remaining concern to the Opposition and we will be maintaining a close watch on the situation. I asked if the general public's prescribing would also be kept and passed on to the Government. I was told no, that while the pharmacists may collect the names of members of the general public and the drugs used, they would not be passing on that information to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I believe the actual inquiry undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee resulted in a sensible change being made by the Government, that of quarantining the $2.50. I only hope the Government will not rush through the signing of that agreement between the Guild and itself, which, I believe, it intends to do tomorrow. If it does, and the referendum results in the majority of pharmacists being opposed to that agreement, the Government will only be brewing trouble for itself. I urge the Minister to take note of my concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1990 is ill-conceived and unfair, and I believe it will not work. To the extent that it does work as the Government hopes it will, I believe it will cause more harm and trouble for the people on the receiving end of this legislation and, indeed, the Government itself. The Australian Democrats certainly will be voting against this legislation at the end of this second reading debate. I invite members of the Opposition, in view of the way in which they have adduced all the very good arguments as to why this legislation should not pass, to join with us in voting against this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If members of the Opposition are minded to vote for the legislation on the grounds that this is a money Bill or a Budget Bill, I reflect back to them their own arguments that the costs which are intended to be saved by this legislation will be spent elsewhere in the Government's Budget, that the Government will neither gain nor lose money and that, therefore, to vote against this legislation will not make one jot of difference to the budgetary outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the observation that we have several journalists in the press gallery and no doubt many others outside looking at television screens, I ask them to observe-given the arguments raised by the Opposition-the way in which the Opposition votes at the end of this second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum which the Government has provided says that the Bill seeks to reallocate-I emphasise `reallocate'-Commonwealth subsidies through the introduction of a charge of $2.50 for those pensioners who currently receive prescriptions for free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) with a protective safety net and a corresponding increase in pension payments of $2.50 for single pensioners and $1.25 for married pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate to observe the word `reallocate', because it is our contention that, except for the pitfalls in the legislation-I will mention those later on-which may indeed cause the overall cost to the Government to increase rather than decrease, even if this legislation works as intended it may well be that all that will happen will be a redistribution or a reallocation, to use the Government's word, from that money which appears in the PBS pile to the money which flows to pensioners through this alternative means of an addition to pension payments of $2.50 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost is further picked up, as several honourable senators have mentioned, through the initiation of a safety net of $130 a year, which corresponds to the $2.50 per week or one prescription per week. We believe that, as my colleague Senator Lees has stated and, indeed, as several members of the Opposition have already stated, this legislation is ill-conceived because it aims its cost impediment at the wrong people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is doctors who write prescriptions and pharmacists who dispense them. This would intrude into the system by placing an extra cost impediment on the recipient of the final drugs. It is very difficult to conceive precisely how that cost impediment will feed back to the doctor when he writes the prescription and whether it will cause him to write less prescriptions. When the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) came before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, in a hearing which I was able to attend briefly, he said that the estimates of savings were quite rubbery and that there was no clear indication that the Government would save any particular and precise amount. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an expectation, based, evidently, on unexplained foreign experience, that when a charge was put in the way of pensioners the number of prescriptions would fall. Quite clearly, it would depend upon the pensioner saying to the doctor, `What are you prescribing for me? Do you really need to prescribe that because I don't want to pay any more than I absolutely have to', and the pensioner, who has to pay the extra $2.50, prevailing on the doctor to prescribe fewer drugs. Presumably, the scheme will work to the extent that the pensioner is successful. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no really good evidence provided that doctors are overprescribing and that pensioners are receiving large numbers of drugs which are not absolutely essential for them. So it seems to the Democrats that the Bill is basically ill-conceived. It aims its impediment to cost increases at the wrong people. The impediment really needs to be aimed at doctors, if there is overprescribing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the hearing to which I referred to a moment ago and which I attended, the Minister pointed out that the Government was going to spend an extra $3m in an advertising campaign aimed at doctors. But when I asked the Minister whether he had any estimate of the amount being spent by pharmaceutical companies which, from my own personal experience, I know regularly visit doctors-they put a foot in the door and give doctors all sorts of lovely goodies and a great deal of very glossy literature, which perhaps does not influence older doctors so much who are more worldly wise in these matters but which certainly influences the prescribing habits of young doctors-he said that he believed that some $130m was spent by pharmaceutical companies to persuade doctors to prescribe the drugs of the company's choice. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to make the comparison between $3m and $130m and to suggest that the Government's amount is paltry-it is about 2 per cent of the amount being spent by drug companies. Again, certainly in my mind, it is doubtful that the little bit that is being done by this Government-which is aimed in the right direction-will be particularly effective. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned, as I think Senator Walters has pointed out, that there are a number of pensioners who are on non-generic drugs and that the safety net does nothing to pick up the difference between those non-generic drugs which may be more expensive and the generic drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> We are left with a situation in which if a doctor insisted, for very good reasons, on a non-generic drug being prescribed, an individual application would need to be made for special dispensation so that pensioner could get that particular drug for a reason that was laid out for him. Of course, that is a very expensive, time consuming process and it is doubtful whether it would apply to very many pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters has also pointed out the difficulties that may well arise when pensioners who are old and frail and are becoming somewhat mentally confused are changed from a non-generic drug to a generic drug. This can happen if, in some instances, the generic drug is different in shape or colour. Examples were given to the Committee of pensioners who had not taken a drug. In one instance it was thought that two tablets were identical and in other instances doses had been doubled up because the tablets appeared to be different. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not need to have very many instances of that sort, with the consequence of a patient spending time in hospital, for there to be a very considerable blow-out in the overall cost to government of the treatment of pensioners. Of course, the costs are not going to show up in the PBS. The PBS costs may indeed go down. But they will certainly show up somewhere else in the Government's costs for hospitalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> While on that subject I, and I think several other honourable senators, raised with the Minister the problem of psychiatric patients, specifically those patients who were suffering from schizophrenia. In my recent experience I know of two patients who went off medication and attempted suicide. It is well-known by anybody who has had anything to do with patients like this that these patients very often are extremely difficult to keep on medication. When they are well they feel they do not need it; when they are deluded they are not sufficiently psychiatrically able to judge that they do need their medication. To place a further impediment of $2.50 in the way of the continued medication of these patients may well lead to numbers of them finishing up in hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply point out again that the costs to the Government may well not appear in the PBS account but they will certainly appear elsewhere as a cost either to the Government or to the community somewhere. That is something which I believe the Government has not given sufficient consideration to. The charge for PBS prescriptions to pharmacists will also place a further considerable burden on pharmacists. I think that has been touched on by several of the previous speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists will need to report more carefully the number of prescriptions which have been filled so that the safety net conditions can be satisfied. Also, in cases in which a non-generic drug has been prescribed and the pensioner then reacts with some shock at the costs, the pharmacist can choose to ring the doctor and say, `Is it possible that I can dispense a non-generic drug as a substitute?'. I would point out that it is professionally totally improper for a pharmacist to make a substitution without consulting the doctor and so the pharmacist in those cases will be subject to a great deal more work. There will be, I understand, a $2 fee with which the pharmacist will be able to be recompensed under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Some pharmacist's practices have a very large number of pensioners, and particularly pensioners in nursing homes. This is so of the area in which I live and I think the pharmacist there would say that most of his clients are in nursing homes. He may well have a large number of those at least in the initial few months until those pensioners who are to be put on generic drugs have been transferred across. We believe that there are a number of issues involved in this $2.50 fee which places an unfair burden on pensioners, and we query whether the system will work as the Government evidently intends it to work, because it is aiming the feedback loop in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I want to address is the matter of clause 9. Today we have seen both the Government and the Opposition vote for the importation of scab labour to deal with those who exhibited no incompetence in a professional capacity but whose political views in relation to recompense for their labours was not acceptable to the Government. We saw a very unsavoury precedent created today when Government and Opposition voted that way in relation to allowing pilots into this country to fly our aircraft when we have a number of unemployed people in this country who are quite professionally capable of executing that task. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of clause 9, we see another potentially very serious precedent being created. It relates very much to the industrial relations legislation which we also have before the Senate at the present time. The industrial relations legislation will allow the unions to enter into arrangements, and the question of whether an individual who is a member of a union, or an individual or a group of individuals who are not members of the union, can intrude into the decision-making process before the Industrial Relations Tribunal is very much an issue which is fundamental to the whole process of democracy. This involves the rights of individuals-in the case of the industrial tribunals-to be heard in relation to their employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 says that the Tribunal-in this case the Remuneration Tribunal-must give effect to an agreement between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or another pharmacists organisation that represents the majority of approved pharmacists, and the Government. In other words, to use Senator Walters's terms, the hands of the Tribunal will be tied by clause 9. The first part of clause 9 begs a very important question: If the Government were to enter into an agreement with the Pharmacy Guild, how does it know and in what sense does the Pharmacy Guild represent a majority of pharmacists? Does it mean that, if 80 or 90 per cent of pharmacists are members of the Guild, automatically the Pharmacy Guild represents a majority of pharmacists? It might be in this particular instance in relation to this agreement that the Guild is quite out of step with its members, that it in no sense represents-I am not suggesting that it does but it may well be-the majority of its members. So, does the first part of clause 9 mean that it represents the pharmacists in a general sense, or does it mean that it represents pharmacists in this particular instance with respect to this particular agreement? Clause 9 is not clear on that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in any sense personally reflecting on the agreement here, because the agreement may or may not be a good agreement or a bad agreement. It may be the least agreement which the Guild could negotiate with the Government. The terms, while perhaps unsatisfactory to many pharmacists, may be the only agreement that could be achieved. I am not reflecting on that. I am reflecting on the fact that there may be one dissenting pharmacist in Australia or there may be a large number of dissenting pharmacists. There is evidence that there are a considerable number of pharmacists-I do not know whether it is a majority or not-who disagree with this agreement, but clause 9 freezes them out and they do not have an opportunity to be heard. Clause 9 goes on and says-it is not applicable in this case- that if the Tribunal has a matter under consideration and an agreement is reached, then even that process must be stopped and the Tribunal must give effect to the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Our very name, the Australian Democrats, means that one of our fundamental commitments is to democratic process, and clause 9 is not democratic. It is not democratic to freeze members out of a negotiation, to deny even the opportunity to be heard in an important matter such as a far-reaching agreement between the Government and the Guild which deals with complex matters of the mark-up charges, the fees for dispensing, the closure of pharmacies, and the remuneration of pharmacies that will be merged or closed. All those very important questions should properly be open to the submission of alternative evidence from one or any number of pharmacists who might disagree with that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that there is no substance to their argument; it may be that there is a substantial argument there. Whatever the objective substance of their argument, they have a right to be heard and clause 9 is like the vote which was taken earlier today; clause 9 is anti-democratic in the extreme. It is for that reason that the Democrats and the Opposition, I understand from what it has said, are strongly opposed to it. The Democrats are opposed to this legislation for a number of reasons. We are opposed because, as I said in my opening remarks, we believe it is unfair, we believe it is wrongly constructed and we believe it will not achieve the objectives for which it was ostensibly designed. With particular reference to clause 9, we believe it is extremely un- democratic. </PARA>

I am pleased that the senior members of the Department are present. My only regret is that Senator Richardson is absent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was particularly interested in the statements made by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, that one of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill was the problem of overprescribing. I have asked a number of people what they understood by the term `overprescribing'. All without exception said, `Doctors writing too many prescriptions', or words to that effect. I asked the question of Senator Richardson in committee-not once, not twice, but three times. I asked, firstly, for a definition of the term and, secondly, for the statistics to back up his statement that it was a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister undertook to get from the Department a written reply. The reply was illuminating in more ways than one. There was no answer to my question on the definition of overprescribing. The Department produced three examples of hoarding-I repeat, hoarding-by three or four patients. Two that they referred to as hoarding were classic cases of kleptomania, and diagrams and photographs of these particular examples were produced. </PARA>
<PARA> In one, the deceased patient was found to have 1,000 tablets of Brufen, 1,000 tablets of Naprosyn, 3,500 tablets of Indocid and 9,400 tablets of Tegretol. If ever there was a classic case of kleptomania, that is it. That is the overprescribing. Obviously, those patients were able to obtain those quantities by taking advantage of the bulk billing situation. Obviously, they had a health care card or they would never have been able to afford the acquisition of that quantity of drugs over any period of time unless they were psychologically or psychiatrically disturbed and had access to free drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no answer to my question on the definition of overprescribing. There were a couple of other examples and letters referring to the fact that a lot of unused drugs were found in the belongings of deceased people by relatives. There was a lot of anecdotal evidence as well. It does not seem to occur to the Department that it is human nature to hoard drugs if one is old and infirm. In some cases also the drug need be taken for only a short period until the temporary condition is relieved. I am sure that everyone here in this chamber in their homes will have a bottle with some unused tablets or antibiotics in it. </PARA>

<PARA>I can only presume that this is what the Minister is referring to when he talks about overprescribing. There can be no reliable statistics on how many prescriptions any one of us has written and certainly no notation of our age, unless of course the Minister's protestations about the confidentiality of information that is transmitted to the Health Insurance Commission from the pharmacist are incorrect. The other explanation is that there are many items obtainable under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which normally do not require prescriptions, such as the paracetamols and minor pain killers. Similarly, hypnotics and sedatives become available at heavily discounted prices under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Is it any wonder that pensioners avail themselves of this opportunity to obtain medication to relieve symptoms which they previously have put up with or, alternatively, have paid for themselves?</PARA>
<PARA> Overprescribing is a word used by the Department and the Minister to indulge themselves once again in doctor bashing and somehow try to make doctors take the blame for the blow-out in the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is a classic example of shooting the messenger when one is unhappy with the message. The word, no doubt, means what it says, but there are obviously no statistics available to support the contention. There is obviously hoarding and I understand that the Health Insurance Commission can demonstrate an almost doubling of prescription processing over the last month. I think we would all be surprised if this did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were faced with increasing costs of any necessity and we were given two months notice of a price increase, of course we would take steps to hoard that necessity or, as I heard it referred to, squirrel some away for future use. There will also be anecdotal evidence of incorrect prescribing, but again it can never be reliable or, for that matter, there can never be any statistics in this regard. One would need a doctor to check every prescription written by another doctor, and the mind can only boggle at the bureaucracy required. Let us once and for all, Minister and Department, drop the term overprescribing when discussing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to turn to the thrust of the legislation. I understand its purpose is to rein in the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which cost we all recognise is escalating dramatically. The projected cost for 1990-91 approaches $1,600m, but the projected saving by this Bill is $245m. I will confidently predict what will occur. Statistics will show a blow-out in the number of prescriptions written in the last two months prior to the introduction of the Bill. Then there will be a significant drop in the number of prescriptions written, followed by a gradual rise in the number written, and within 12 months we will be back to where we started. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the Minister that the level and accuracy of prescribing by Australian doctors is of an extremely high standard. The high standard of education of Australian medical students and peer review has produced a quality of doctor of the best ethical and professional standard. Within the Bill there is an allocation of $3m in the first year and then $2m to, I quote Senator Richardson:</PARA>
<PARA>Educate doctors on this Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and how they ought to react to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that I should inform the Minister, if he takes the trouble to listen, that every doctor I have ever known has been educated on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from before graduation, and I know how they react to it. More bureaucracy and more regulation is not the way to ensure greater compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that millions of dollars have been allocated to pharmacists to ring doctors and to suggest to them that a cheaper generic drug could be substituted for a brand name drug. The doctors, who obviously will spend the same amount of time replying, will be paid nothing. It would be interesting to collate the type of response that the majority of pharmacists will get to such suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to report that a very good relationship has been developed over many years between the pharmacy profession and my own, and at an individual level many friendships have been formed. The money spent on education, small as it is, would be better spent on education of the public in lifestyle. The `Life be in it' campaign is a good example. There have been greater improvements in health by changes in lifestyle-the cessation of smoking, weight reduction and exercise-than the use of the whole pharmacopoeia. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of a payment and the concept of an educational program based on pharmacists will have little, if any, effect. The whole scheme envisaged by the Bill is based on faulty premises. It is based, first, on the concept of over-prescribing-which does not exist; secondly, on the concept that a sum of $2m to $3m a year on education of doctors will lessen costs-it will not; thirdly, on the concept that introducing a $2.50 charge on pensioners and then a safety net will deter them taking prescribed medicines-it will not; and, finally, it is based on the reduction in the number of pharmacies-which will not affect the increasing number of people over the age of 60-and the increasing cost and consumption of pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the Bill will not be achieved. If anything could be described as bandaid legislation, this is it. In the short time I have been here I have realised why bureaucrats and politicians sometimes make stupid decisions. I now realise that their isolation from what goes on at the interface with the public leads to theoretical decisions which have no basis in reality. They are obviously unfettered by the constraints of knowledge or experience. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that none of the public witnesses or submissions were enthusiastically supporting the Bill. Guarded support came from the Pharmacy Guild, but I can also confidently predict that if one has an interest in this field one should follow the activities within the Pharmacy Guild in the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister and the Department are genuinely interested, as I am, in reducing the cost of the scheme, then surely they should listen to those who do have the knowledge and experience. I look forward to the next Liberal government when our policy will contain effective and lasting solutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to thank the Senate for what has been an interesting debate. I have to say that not much that has been said here this evening was not said at some point or other during the Committee proceedings. I note that when one looks at the contributions of all those who have spoken tonight that opposition tends to vary. The only Opposition speaker to really oppose the concept of what we are doing here this evening is Senator Herron, who says that the Government is unfettered by knowledge or experience. Neither are we fettered by the need for sectional pleading. We do not feel the need to defend our record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to hear what Senator Herron said in defence of doctors. The first point I wish to make is that at no stage in this exercise have I attempted any form of doctor bashing and I do not wish to do so. I have the greatest respect for the profession. That does not mean that, in common with any other profession, there are not from time to time improvements to be made. It does not mean that all members of the profession keep as up to date as they might with new developments in their field. Anything that the Government or doctors' associations themselves can do to assist in keeping those members up to date would no doubt have an effect in easing this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have heard Senator Herron's `confident predictions', all I can say is that I have no doubt his confidence will be eroded by time and result. In drafting what would always be a difficult and at times painful prescription for the ills of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the Government was mindful of the fact that overseas experience suggests that the introduction of some sort of price disincentive will have a profound effect on the usage of the scheme. One cannot imagine why Australia should be so uniquely endowed with wisdom that the reaction of Australians to this scheme will be different from reactions in other countries. I, for one, doubt very much that there will be the need for myself or for any other Government Minister in the course of the next few years to concede that Senator Herron was right. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope, however, that when he is shown to be wrong he will have the good grace to acknowledge it. But he will not hear doctor-bashing coming from me. I am not one who wishes to engage in it. That does not mean that I will not acknowledge at times things that I think the profession is not doing properly, just as from time to time I might have said it of lawyers or any other profession. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Lees said that this was a simplistic solution and ill-considered, and Senator Patterson talked of it in terms of a quick-fix. The question of what to do about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) has been around for many years. But I think that we would all concede that it is only since 1985 that a really serious blow-out in the costs has been occurring. If one looks at the history of the Federal Government, it probably is only in more recent years that this problem has come under the microscope. What can governments do but look at the experience overseas, after first acknowledging that we simply cannot leave the current situation as it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is just that at times when it comes to some senators and their interjections, it is difficult to restrain my natural ebullient self.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In talking to the rest of the Bill-and I will restrain myself-I refer to Senator Coulter's statement that the measure is aimed at the wrong people, that it should be doctors and not pensioners. That statement runs pretty contrary to the speech made by Senator Herron. The Government's aim is to secure that 15 per cent reduction in the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It will be attained by addressing both. There will be an attempt to make doctors aware of what we see as a difficult situation. We keep hearing about over-prescribing and Senator Herron's great objection to the term. The other term I saw in my brief for today was `inappropriate prescribing'. I am not sure that he would like either. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever one wants to call it, a problem exists. Some money will be spent in assisting doctors to overcome it. I would not dismiss the efforts of the Pharmacy Guild in the past few months during a very difficult time for it with a fairly evenly divided membership from all accounts but one which nonetheless came down in favour of supporting what the Government believes is a very necessary scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe, however, that anything in this Bill could be called a dangerous precedent. There is nothing in this Bill that will be anti-democratic. The fact that we have ensured that there will be compensation for all will mean that in the end no-one needs to be disadvantaged by what we have done. In fact, in what we are doing there is unequal advantage for people in that some will be more advantaged than others, but no-one will be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing a change to the scheme, as we have on this occasion, it is very hard to do it as well as we have. Far from it being ill considered and rushed through, I would have thought that great thought has been given to the scheme. That does not mean that we cannot acknowledge the need for change, as I did when dealing with the chronically ill. </PARA>
<PARA> There is never shame in admitting that something one has done or said might have been wrong; rather, I would see it as a strength. In response to all honourable senators' comments, there is no point in denying that this measure has not caused great heartache amongst many pensioners. As we have had an opportunity over the past few months to explain the measures, we have reduced the anxiety in the community very considerably and I am quite certain that, once the scheme is up and running, we can get rid of that anxiety entirely. </PARA>

Most importantly, as the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, acknowledged after the Budget, this part of the scheme is the right way to go.

It is a necessary social reform brought about without causing disadvantage to those who are on pensions. In the end that is the obligation of the Government and it has kept it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak for only a few minutes tonight in regard to the Parliamentary Education Office. On Monday the first meeting was held of the advisory committee that has been established by the Presiding Officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The advisory committee is made up of Mr Price, the Hon. Don Dobie, Mr Free and Senators Aulich, McLean and me. This is the first of what will be a useful succession of meetings of the parliamentary education advisory committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I need not tell the Senate that the Education Office was established after the release of the Senate's report entitled Education for Active Citizenship dated February 1989. The Education Office has had a very good beginning and has established a number of programs that are very worthy of this Parliament and that are serving the interests of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. These programs are bringing to the public at large, especially to young Australians, including school children, not only a knowledge about parliamentary matters but also an empowering of those young Australians to be fully aware of their own opportunities to make a contribution eventually as active citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a dispute between the Presiding Officers and the Government in regard to the Budget which touches upon a program that is vitally concerned with the Parliamentary Education Office. I refer to a $500,000 appropriation for the House of Representatives and a $500,000 appropriation for the Senate-$1m vital dollars for the schools visit program to enable young Australians, especially from distant States, to visit Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Students come from schools in the Northern Territory-Senator Collins nods-Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. Without the initiative that was begun last financial year to give subsidies to enable students to come from these more distant States, we will have an enormous drop in the number of tours. </PARA>
<PARA> To give some direct meaning to this problem to which I am drawing the Senate's attention, I have in front of me newsletter No. 11 of the Parliamentary Education Office, which was circulated this week subsequent to our advisory committee meeting on Monday. This newsletter sets out the education program bookings from mid-October to the end of November. Some seven pages of schools are listed as coming on particular days in that six-week period. </PARA>
<PARA>Only one of the schools on the list is from my State of South Australia. At any point during the period when there was money available to subsidise school visits, dozens of schools from South Australia took part. If I look at the list I find that there is only one school from Tasmania. There are hundreds of schools from New South Wales and Victoria, and if there were hundreds in the Australian Capital Territory--</PARA>

It is the major focal point of decisions that relate to the whole nation and it is important that the work of the Parliamentary Education Office, indeed the work of this Parliament, be displayed to all States equally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is essential that this chamber support our Presiding Officer and the Speaker of the House of Representatives in their submissions to the Government, especially the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), to ensure that the $1m program continues. I will watch this matter, as I am sure all of us on the advisory committee will. I believe that those involved in Estimates committees and those of us from the more remote States-people such as Senator Giles opposite, Senator Kernot from Queensland and Senator Vanstone from South Australia-will watch this and there will be trouble from the Senate if there is not approval by the beginning of the next calendar year for the continuation of the moneys to enable school visits to continue in the way that they have in this calendar year. I am glad to see the nodding heads of honourable senators in the chamber. We insist that the Government, especially the Minister for Finance, not only hear the very good arguments put by the Presiding Officers but also agree to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly tonight on a matter about which I intend to say more at a later time, but there are some matters which should be addressed tonight. Yesterday at about 7.20 p.m.-reasonably close to the adjournment debate-on behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (NCA), I tabled that Committee's report on Operation Ark, which included a qualifying or dissenting report signed by two senators and two members of the House of Representatives. I spoke very briefly to that report-I think with the indulgence of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, who was in the chamber at the time-simply to point out that the dissenting report was there and urge honourable senators to consider the qualifying statement, to consider very seriously the questions that arise from the matters raised therein and in particular to consider them in the light of what they might say about the operation of the NCA and the operation, for that matter, of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, and the relationship between the two. Those are very serious matters. At that point I sought leave to continue my remarks but concluded them for the evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some remarks have been made in the other place today in relation to the tabling of that report and the qualifying statement which deserve an immediate response. Mr Lindsay, the Chairman of the Committee, has indicated some dissatisfaction with the style of the qualifying report. He is entitled to have that view. As I understand it-I stand to be corrected if I have misread what he has said-his view is that in camera evidence ought never be put in a report without the approval of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> He is entitled to have the view that that is how things ought to be, but the point I want to raise this evening is that Mr Lindsay, in his remarks, referred to a report of what he describes as the Procedure Committee of the Senate of 2 May 1989 which in part dealt with this issue. He said that it was not able to agree on where the balance should be struck between the various considerations. We all know that there are good arguments on both sides on this matter. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It did, however, suggest certain guidelines be followed by senators who wished to refer in a dissenting report to evidence taken in camera. It recommended inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to list the recommendations, which I will not bother reading now. What my reading of and listening to his speech show-runless I have missed out on some parts of the `greens' or was not listening carefully to Mr Lindsay-is that he did not go on to make an additional point that I believe he should have made. As I see the structure of his speech at the moment, it was basically that he is of the view that in camera evidence ought never be used without the consent of the majority, and he refers to some guidelines in a Senate committee report to support that argument. What he does not go on to say is that those guidelines have not been adopted by the Senate. In fact, those guidelines have been sent back to that Committee, and one of the reasons those guidelines have gone back to the Committee is so that hopefully there will be some helpful suggestions or the guidelines will be amplified with respect to what course we should adopt where a senator or senators cannot get the approval of the majority to put some relevant in camera evidence in a Senate report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely obvious that a dissenting report does not agree with the majority and it ought therefore to be obvious that there is a high probability that the majority will not agree as to the relevance of certain in camera evidence being revealed. That is obvious. So the question that was raised, as I understand it by Senator Baume, is a very good one. What does one do? Does one say that the entitlement of the majority-that is, to include in camera evidence-should not be extended to a minority or individual senator? Have we reached the stage where Senate committees are run by the majority of numbers? Does that mean, therefore, that when Labor is in government what the Labor Caucus decides will be what the Senate committee decides at the time? Do we think that? Do honourable senators want to be in a position when the coalition is in government, which will not be too long, where force of numbers can deprive them of the privilege given to the majority of the committee, namely, when they think it appropriate to use in camera evidence?</PARA>
<PARA> This matter was not referred to by Mr Lindsay. To be perfectly fair, I have said that he has pointed out that it was difficult for the Committee to have a balance.  He has been fair in that respect and has pointed out the guidelines put forward. But I wonder why he did not give us the other information that the guidelines have not yet been adopted and have been sent back to the Committee. Was Mr Lindsay ignorant? One hesitates to come to that conclusion. Mr Lindsay is the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which is an important committee-all committees are important. I am loath to come to the conclusion that he is ignorant. What is my other alternative, Mr President? If Mr Lindsay was in full knowledge, did he know that this matter had been referred back and chose not to tell the House? Was he selective in what he told the House? Did he tell the House that some guidelines were put forward by a Senate committee and deliberately chose not to say that those guidelines had not been adopted and had been referred back? I do not know the answer. I do not draw any conclusion, but I am concerned about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, other matters can be referred to as a consequence of that tabling. I intend to continue my remarks about that. But that is all I wish to raise in relation to Mr Lindsay's statement in the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn to some remarks by Mr Melham, which I will have further things to say about at a later date. Mr Melham commences his speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>What happened last night in the Senate under the cover of darkness . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Somewhat melodramatic and somewhat wishing to imply, in my view, improper motives. He goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . was a cheap, grubby, political point scoring exercise-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Mr Melham is referring to the fact that the report was tabled last night or whether `cheap, grubby, political point scoring exercise' refers to his assessment of the qualifying statement. Quite frankly, I do not care which he was referring to. I just point out the tone with which Mr Melham commenced his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to give us some indication to what he was referring to by saying that this was a `cheap, grubby, political point scoring exercise'. In the normal course of events, it happens that committee reports are tabled in the Senate. It is not unusual for there to be a qualifying or dissenting report attached. Somehow, this has turned into a `cheap, grubby, political point scoring exercise'. Perhaps honourable senators are now not meant to have an alternative view. What does that say about what the community will think of this place?</PARA>
<PARA> We know how fed up the community is with major party politics; how it wants more independents to be in Parliament because it thinks that Parliament has turned into just a number crunching exercise between the two major political parties. We know that the Australian Democrats believe that they should be given the right to speak and accorded the rights that all others are. Somehow, the Government thinks that if it has the numbers, everyone else can just shut up. I do not agree with that view. I believe very strongly that each member here has an individual responsibility as a parliamentarian. Fortunately, we on this side of the chamber have the opportunity to make the choice as to whether our Party is right or wrong and vote according to how we think. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to Mr Melham. Mr Melham said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was unaware that the tabling was to take place last night . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That may be true about last night, but it was on the Senate red sheet all day yesterday. I have been informed that the Chairman of the Committee expected the report to be tabled at the appropriate time in the chamber. I have also been informed that the Chairman of the Committee was aware it was not done at that time. So I have no qualms at all in saying that it was, and still is, my view that the Chairman of the Committee knew that the report was being tabled yesterday. The fact that he may not have known that it was happening last night, as opposed to three o'clock or half past three or whenever it would have happened, is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Melham's remarks create the impression that the Chairman of the Committee did not know that the report was being tabled yesterday. I strongly refute that allegation, if that is what Mr Melham is trying to say. Perhaps Mr Melham is simply ignorant; I do not know. Having commenced his remarks about the Chairman of the Joint Committee, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>or, indeed, that there was a qualifying statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Melham may not have known that there was a qualifying statement; that would not surprise me one iota. But it is quite clear that the Chairman knew of my intention to put in a qualifying statement. If Mr Melham was not present at the appropriate time to learn that I intended putting in a qualifying statement, let Mr Melham tell the Parliament what he was doing at the appropriate time; that is his business. But do not let him go into the lower House and say that the Chairman of the Committee did not know there was a qualifying statement, when the Chairman of the Committee had been advised by me that I intended putting in a qualifying statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Did I go to the Chairman of the Committee 10 minutes before and say, `Here is my qualifying statement. Would you like to have a look at it and make a case for it not being put forward?'. No, I did not. I am not obliged to do so, and I have no intention of doing it if I think it is inappropriate on the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward, hopefully not in the next fortnight of sittings-I hope that someone draws these remarks to Mr Melham's attention-to a statement being put out by Mr Melham explaining his remarks. Of course, Mr Melham went on to make a few other remarks that can relate only to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Melham is a member of the House of Representatives and should be accorded the respect that all others members and senators are accorded in these chambers. It would be nice if these things were dealt with on a reciprocal basis. Mr Melham says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The first I knew of it was when I came back to my office after it was tabled in the Senate-which was, in my view, a gross discourtesy to other members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply say this: if I felt free to reveal all that happens in committee proceedings, I could give Mr Melham a very long lecture on what courtesy is in joint committees which would make very interesting reading. That is all I care to say about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Melham goes on to say a bit more. Apart from having admitted his own ignorance, I cannot be responsible for his not wanting to inquire as to when reports are being tabled; that is not my problem. And it is not my problem if Mr Melham is not in the appropriate place. I know that not everybody can attend meetings all the time. But to say that one does not know something and blame someone else for one's lack of knowledge is hardly a point to make. That is the inference that I take from Mr Melham's remarks. Okay, he thinks it is a gross discourtesy. I have made my remarks about that. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It was underhanded . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that here he is referring to my coming in last night and tabling this report, without going around and saying, `Mr Melham, please, can I do this? It was not done at the appropriate time of the day, so it's done a bit later, but do you mind?'. I am sorry if that is Mr Melham's view of what I should do. So I do not regard it as underhanded because I do not regard it as my responsibility to ask Mr Melham to do things that I am entitled to do. Nor do I regard it as deceitful. If I were doing something underhanded, I would do it in a way--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very hard to imagine my doing something of an underhanded nature. It is hard to try to imagine the circumstances. But one thing is immediately apparent to me, and that is that if something were underhanded it would not be on the Senate red sheet. Am I supposed to wave a flag to every honourable senator in this chamber? There are other members of the NCA Committee in this Senate; I presume they look at their red sheet. I just cannot be responsible for whether they discuss things with their lower House members. It is not my problem. But it is my problem if someone says that I have been underhanded in doing something that was on the red sheet all day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Melham then says that it was deceitful. I would like an explanation. I would like Mr Melham to get up again in the chamber to explain how I have been deceitful. I would be very interested to know. I would be particularly interested in how Mr Melham concludes that what happened was deceitful. For all I know, he is referring not just to me; perhaps he is saying there was some collusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister extended some courtesy to me. My understanding is that committee reports can be tabled at any time. The courtesy that I have referred to was to move a motion to take note of the report and speak very briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mean by that to say that Senator Collins was part of some deceitful, underhanded practice at all. I simply acknowledge the Minister's courtesy in giving me the rights that are accorded to every other senator in this place. I want to place on record that if what happened in the chamber last night was deceitful, underhanded and cheap political point-scoring, Senator Collins should not be dragged into this matter. I wonder who else can be? Perhaps it is the view that the Senate procedures, if they are followed, are underhanded and deceitful. I do not think that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA> I intend to make further remarks about those matters at another point. I also intend to make further remarks about the qualifying statement at another point. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to say that I noted with much interest the remarks made today by these two gentlemen. Given that there were some very serious questions raised in the qualifying statement and that it shows that the Committee had some conflicting evidence before it, and has decided not to pursue those matters, I would have thought that the Committee members who submitted the majority report would have some explanation to offer to Parliament about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that, if there is something wrong with the qualifying statement, up hill and down dale the Chairman and the other member of the Committee to speak on this matter would have addressed those remarks. I would have expected a bit of a blowtorch if the qualifying statement had made some ludicrous points. But there is silence. I do not expect that silence will last too long. It must be monumentally embarrassing for the Government to remain silent over this matter for ever and a day. But I would have thought that the two Government members who have chosen to speak on this matter would have said something about it. I intend to say something about it at a later stage. </PARA>

What happened in the Senate last night in terms of the tabling of the dissenting report was that contained in it was in camera evidence that should not have been incorporated in the report, should not have been tabled in the report and should not have been tabled in the Senate. In that being done, a fundamental breach of trust was involved, regardless of any advice that was given to honourable senators opposite. In a sense, it is a simple matter of decency. I really have no wish to approach this in a partisan manner, because the issue is too important in terms of the future working of Senate committees and joint committees such as the NCA committee. That really involves questions of honesty and whether or not people are prepared to be fair and reasonable in the way that they conduct themselves in the committee system. There is now a clear pattern of events in the behaviour of some members of the Opposition in the tabling of in camera evidence-in the selective release of in camera evidence-which does, and will, have an impact on the committee system of the Parliament as a whole. What happened last night was not the first time that in camera evidence has been tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Mr Lindsay has in no way been selective in the remarks he made in the House of Representatives late this afternoon. He has endeavoured to be fair and reasonable in conveying the terms of the Committee's deliberations and the sense of the Committee's report, and putting that report in context. He has endeavoured to be authoritative. He has not taken a simple paragraph or two out of context-out of the body of the evidence-and quoted it selectively. </PARA>
<PARA> How on earth can people make a judgment on the quality of a report, on the quality of a committee's deliberations and on the conclusions that have been drawn, if there is simply injected into a report a single paragraph or two of in camera evidence, without seeing the body of that evidence? That is a nonsense to suggest that that ought to occur in support of an argument. It sets the committee procedures back years. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with the committee on the NCA-I am relatively new to the Committee. It was a privilege to be elected to the Committee by the Federal parliamentary Labor Party, but the Senate should be aware of the political evolution that is occurring on that Committee. Not only senators on the Government side, but also Australian Democrat and independent senators and, indeed, I am sure, a number of senators within the Opposition's ranks would be interested to know that there appears to be a deliberate pattern of conduct designed to wreck the Committee's deliberations, to neuter it and to make it absolutely and utterly ineffective-in short, to make it unworkable and to defeat the very purpose for which the Parliament created the body. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you would know about a matter that is law within the New South Wales Labor Party. Jack Lang said when he was Premier in the 1930s, `If you don't have the numbers then you wreck the gathering', and that is what has been occurring. The Committee should be a very serious deliberative body. </PARA>

<PARA> In respect of the remarks of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) in House of Representatives, I must say I agree with him. I thought the dissenting was simple provincial point scoring-cheap and low grade. </PARA>
<PARA> Some in the Opposition approached the matters that were before the Committee with preconceived and predetermined notions. There is no doubt in my mind about that. They regarded the Committee as an invitation to a beheading and were determined to see that through regardless of any evidence that was given by any of the people-and the list was very extensive-called before the Committee. It was really Christmas in Cape Town. That was the form of justice that some opposite wanted to see unfold. My view is: justice predetermined is justice denied. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have a level playing field on the Committee in respect of the National Crime Authority. We understand that from this morning's meeting and the manner in which things unfolded then. No-one in the Government's ranks had been given what I would have thought was the elementary courtesy of a copy of the dissenting report in time to read it. The copy arrived in my office after the Senate had risen last night. That is discourtesy and it is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> But some in the Opposition have now made the position absolutely crystal clear in terms of the way they think the Committee should operate. I think that is a matter of regret. The simple fact of the matter for those honourable senators present and those who may be following the debate is that no courtesies were extended to the Government by some in the Opposition and, as a consequence, there is no good will. The Committee cannot work without good will on a two way basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The only conclusion to be drawn is that some in the Opposition lack the intellectual capacity to approach the issues. To show honourable senators how serious--</PARA>

<PARA> In terms of the sensitivity of material that comes before the Committee, honourable senators should be aware that those who serve on the Committee are given special safes in which material should be locked up, including in camera evidence. What is the point of having anything confidential? What is the point of securing any document, any material that comes before the Committee? What is the point of the Committee actually going in camera? What is the point of talking in terms of confidentiality and saying to witnesses that they may speak freely, that the material they place before the Committee, the evidence they give, will be before the Committee and will go no further? It is absolutely farcical, given what happened last night. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one will be prepared to give evidence before the NCA Committee in the future; no one will be prepared to come forward. Some who were involved in this charade last night knew precisely that that would be the impact. That not only applies to the Committee on the NCA; it applies to every committee that the Parliament forms. The impact of it is right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> To be fair to some people opposite, I have no doubt that will trouble some in the Opposition as much as it troubles people in the Government. What is the point if people are unable to come forward to contribute, to be part of the democratic process of giving evidence, in security of confidentiality? Everyone knows, given some of the committee work in this place over recent years, that a lot of invaluable material would have been lost if this kind of stupidity had gone on previously. So what we had last night was nothing short of a major assault on the Parliament's committee structures, on their procedures and on their effectiveness for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I will join the debate when matters are raised again, as I am sure other senators will want to do. I conclude by saying that what happened last night was stupid, retrograde and ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Hawke Labor Government is developing a habit of playing fast and loose with the privacy of the individual-and that is of great concern to many in the community. This habit has been made clear by its attempts to introduce the Australia Card, to extend the use of the tax file number beyond its specified use, and now by Australia Post's Selectmail service. On Monday, following extreme concern expressed to me by a constituent, I asked the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, who represents the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)-Senator Collins is in the chamber tonight-a question about Australia Post's new Selectmail service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Householders have recently received in their letterboxes a colour brochure-no doubt quite expensive to produce-advertising this new Selectmail service. Selectmail is a system whereby householders can complete and return to Australia Post the bottom part of the brochure after filling out their name, address, age, number in the household, number of children, as well as ticking various boxes to indicate that they would like to receive advertising information about various goods and services-for example, cars, beauty aids, clothing, kitchenware, business services, life insurance, toys and holidays, to name a few of the many items listed. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent expressed the view that this was a waste of money and that it would create more junk mail requiring disposal. However, the greatest concern to him was the potential invasion of privacy. The brochure describes the Selectmail service in some detail, including how it operates, and guarantees strict confidentiality. More than that, it specifically states:</PARA>
<PARA>Your name and address will go on to a confidential Selectmail list held by Australia Post which will not be recorded or copied by any suppliers of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>To follow up my constituent's concern, I contacted Australia Post to find out exactly how the system operates and, particularly, how the advertiser's or marketer's promotional material got into the system to be delivered to the householder. Does the advertiser or marketer forward the material to Australia Post, which then sends it to the people who it knows are interested in that item from the lists it has compiled from the completed and returned brochure tear-off section? No, Australia Post advised, the list of such people is rented to the advertiser-marketer. </PARA>
<PARA> This advice was obviously in conflict with the clear statement of confidentiality contained in the brochure. This prompted my question to Senator Collins, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard, along with Senator Collins' inadequate answer. I have already sought that from Senator Collins and, I assume, have his approval for incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. I ask whether the Minister is aware that Australia Post is distributing to householders a brochure advertising its new Selectmail service which claims as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Your name and address will go on to confidential Selectmail lists held by Australia Post which will not be recorded or copied by any suppliers of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>Does the obvious conflict between this claim and advice I received from Australia Post, that the Selectmail lists will be hired out to advertising agencies and other organisations wishing to use Selectmail services for the distribution of advertising material, reflect this Government's cavalier attitude to individual privacy as already revealed by the Australia Card and the tax file number?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Chapman's question is no, it does not represent anything of the sort. Australia Post does, in fact, operate as a list broker in the same way as a number of other organisations operate as list brokers in what has become the extremely competitive area of direct mail. Indeed, Australia Post operates a very sophisticated direct mail service that it can provide to customers on request, and, I must say, it does a very professional job.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. On Tuesday, Senator Collins provided a supplementary answer which I also seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time yesterday, Senator Chapman asked me a question on Australia Post's `Selectmail' service, and the brochure advertising the service which states that lists Australia Post establishes will not be recorded or copied by any supplier of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman expressed concern that Selectmail lists would be hired out to advertising agencies to facilitate the distribution of advertising material and that such a practice directly contravened the privacy of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> * As I explained yesterday, Australia Post operates as a list broker in the same way as other organisations in the area of direct mail. </PARA>
<PARA> * Regarding the new Selectmail service advertised in the brochure, Australia Post assures me that it has compiled lists from information provided by people who answered the questionnaire indicating what particular kinds of advertising mail they would like to receive. </PARA>
<PARA> * Australia Post complies with accepted industry list rental practices to ensure confidentiality of list details and to maintain the integrity of its lists. </PARA>
<PARA> * the conditions of rental are that renters do not view list details; copies of names and addresses are not made available to the renter; and the list is generally supplied to a mailing house which addresses and despatches the mailing packages supplied by the renter, and then returns the list to the owner. </PARA>
<PARA> * The mailing house must be a member of the Direct Marketing Association. </PARA>
<PARA> * The Selectmail lists will be held and managed on behalf of Australia Post by S.A. Database Pty Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> * I understand that the Selectmail project was discussed with representatives from the Privacy Commission. The Commission saw no problem, because the person gave written authority to Australia Post to put their name on particular lists, and because the lists are not made available to renters. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In summary, Senator Collins claims there is no invasion of privacy in the Selectmail system; firstly, because persons returning the tear-off had thereby given written authority to Australia Post to put their names on particular lists; secondly, because the conditions of rental are that renters do not view the list details which are subsequently returned to Australia Post; thirdly, because the list is generally-as Senator Collins described it-supplied to a mailing house which addresses and dispatches the mailing packages supplied by the renter. These claims do not stand up to scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taking this last point first, I note the Minister, no doubt advisedly, used the term `generally'. In other words, although in the current situation the actual mail-outs will be done by SA Database Pty Ltd, it is clear that this is not an absolute requirement for the operation of Selectmail. It is clear-as I was verbally advised by Australia Post at the outset-that provision of lists by Australia Post direct to marketers and advertisers, rather than mailing house intermediaries, is not absolutely excluded and could occur on another occasion. In any case, Senator Collins or his advisers are simply playing with words in distinguishing between a mailing house on the one hand and an advertiser or marketer on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> There is minimal difference in reality. But more importantly, the fact is that a mailing house is a third party which, on the basis of the information in the Selectmail brochure, a householder would not expect to be the recipient of his name or address or the other information he provides. The claim that the lists are not viewed is also no defence. To do the mail-out, names obviously go onto the mailing house's computer and are therefore accessible to third parties. Nor is the claim that the householder has given written authority for his name to go on the lists a defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am amazed that the Privacy Commission saw no privacy problem, apparently because of this authority. The fact is that a householder has given his name and address on the clear understanding, as any reasonable person would interpret the assurances in the brochure, that it will remain confidential to Australia Post and that no third party will have access to it. Therefore, the Minister's assurances of the maintenance of privacy are worthless. It is clear that householders are being misinformed by Australia Post in their Selectmail brochure. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post will be providing all those consumers' personal and private details to mailing houses which will be acting in a de facto role for the supplier of goods and services. It matters not one iota that these mailing houses are members of the Direct Marketing Association. The fact remains that any individual who returns an application form to Australia Post for inclusion on its Selectmail listings, will run the risk of having his privacy invaded when his details are made available to a range of organisations outside Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the wish of a householder I have no objections, but it may not be his wish and many people may be returning applications blissfully unaware that their personal details will be made available to third parties. This is simply not good enough. The Selectmail brochure should not give the false expectation of complete confidentiality to householders. Before further distribution to householders it should be withdrawn and amended to indicate the potential lack of privacy involved by the information being released to third parties. Then, at least, householders can choose whether or not to be involved in the system on a fair basis. It is quite simply time for this Government to stop playing fast and loose with people's privacy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a media release on 7 October 1990 I accused the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of misleading the Parliament. I made this accusation following receipt on 4 October of answers to questions I had asked of officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in the Senate Estimates Committee A on 21 September. These questions related to the decision by the Hawke Government to provide up to $125m to Victoria towards the construction of the Albert Park sports complex should Melbourne be successful in its bid to host the 1996 Olympic Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had asked these questions because of an answer that Hansard reported the Prime Minister as having given to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the House of Representatives on 13 September; because of a statement a few days prior to 13 September by Senator Peter Walsh, who was the Minister for Finance at the time the funding decision was taken; and because of an article by Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 September in which he pointed out several factual inaccuracies in the Prime Minister's answer in the House of Representatives on 13 September and in Mr Hawke's statements on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 7.30 Report on that same day, 13 September. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke, in his answer in the Parliament on 13 September, was reported by Hansard as saying that his Government's decision to provide the $125m:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was taken following the investigation of an interdepartmental committee made up of representatives of the Department of Finance and Australian Construction Services which reported on the Victorian estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>On the evening of that same day, 13 September, the Prime Minister said on the ABC's 7.30 Report:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat what I said in the Parliament. It was on the basis of what they, the IDC said, that we, Cabinet, were able to make the decision we did. </PARA>
<PARA>Before I proceed to develop this point there are two particular points to note about that 7.30 Report statement. The first is that Mr Hawke clearly believed-indeed, he said so-that he was repeating what he had said in the Parliament earlier that day. The second point to note is his words:</PARA>
<PARA>It was on the basis of what they, the IDC said, that we, Cabinet, were able to make the decision we did. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words clearly supported and indeed confirmed what Hansard reported him to have said in the House-namely, that the decision to provide the $125m was taken following the investigation by the IDC. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts relating to the Federal Government's decision to provide up to $125m for the Albert Park complex were set out in my press release of 7 October which I seek leave to table. I understand that I have Senator Collins's approval to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts were as follows: First, Cabinet took the decision to provide $125m to Victoria on 23 January 1990. Secondly, Cabinet's decision to establish an interdepartmental committee (IDC) to report to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on the estimates on the sporting complex was taken at the same time and in the same Cabinet decision on 23 January.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the funding decision was announced publicly by the Prime Minister without any qualifications on 28 January. Fourthly, the Prime Minister wrote to the Victorian Premier confirming the funding on 7 February. The interdepartmental committee that was established on 23 January met only twice, on 5 February and 3 April. It did not report to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories until 12 June. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, the then Victorian Premier, Mr Cain, refused to permit his officials to meet with the interdepartmental committee. Seventhly, one of my Senate Estimates questions to officials was:</PARA>
<PARA>Was the announcement of the Government's decision to provide the $125m made prior to or following the completion of the IDC's examination of the matter?</PARA>
<PARA>The written answer I received was:</PARA>
<PARA>There was never any expectation that the IDC would report prior to the announcement. </PARA>
<PARA>I said that these facts show conclusively that Prime Minister Hawke misled the Parliament on 13 September 1990 and that he also misled the Australian public on the 7.30 Report on the same evening. My comments were reported in the press the following day-Monday 8 October. Most press reports also carried a denial by a spokesman for the Prime Minister that Mr Hawke had misled the Parliament. However, by the middle of the same day, 8 October, the Prime Minister admitted that there had been an `inadvertent misstating' on his part and that he would clarify the true position when Parliament resumed the following day, 9 October. </PARA>
<PARA> Later on 8 October, however, he retracted this and said that he would not be making any such clarifying statement because Hansard had misreported him. The events following that are well known and I will not repeat them tonight other than to say that Hansard had, in fact, misreported the Prime Minister. Instead of him saying that the decision to provide the $125m grant was taken `following' the investigation of an IDC, the Prime Minister had actually said the decision was taken `subject to' an IDC reporting on the Victorian Government's estimates for the cost of the complex. </PARA>
<PARA> Hansard accepted full responsibility for the misreporting, despite some very strange circumstances, I must say, surrounding the incident. The Prime Minister claimed that the revelation that Hansard had misreported what he actually said cleared him from any charge of misleading the Parliament, although he has not to this day been able to square away his 7.30 Report statement. Because of the Hansard misreporting and other unexplained events-notably, whether the Prime Minister's office ever received the greens of his answer; Hansard says that they were dispatched to the office but never returned-the whole matter became covered in confusion. The press gallery swallowed the Prime Minister's protestations of innocence like sycophantic lambs, with the notable exception of Alan Ramsay, and Mr Hawke was painted as having escaped from the grave charge of misrepresenting the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> All this confusion was a smokescreen. The fact is that the Prime Minister did mislead Parliament on 13 September when he said that the Government's $125 million funding decision was subject to an interdepartmental committee reporting on Victorian estimates. The Cabinet decision of 23 January 1990, decision No. 13504, makes no reference whatsoever to the funding being subject to an IDC report. Indeed, it is totally clear from the document that the decision to fund the Albert Park complex was not subject to any qualification. Let me read the relevant operative paragraphs of Cabinet decision No. 13504. It starts off:</PARA>
<PARA>The Cabinet agreed that:-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the Commonwealth provide up to a maximum of $125 million in January 1990 prices (indexed by the consumer price index) on a dollar-for-dollar basis with the Victorian Government towards construction of the Albert Park Sports Complex should Melbourne be selected as the city to host the 1990 Olympic Games; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) an Inter-Departmental Committee(IDC), under the Chairmanship of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and comprising representatives from the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, Administrative Services, and Finance, be convened to report to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories by 16 February 1990, following discussions with Victorian officials, on estimates for the construction of the Albert Park Sports Complex. </PARA>
<PARA>I will leave a couple of the other paragraphs out because they are not relevant. The final paragraph of the Cabinet decision said:</PARA>
<PARA>(c) the announcement of Commonwealth financial assistance be made jointly by the Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria, with the text of the announcement to be settled by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Prime Minister and the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave, Mr President, to have the full Cabinet decision incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>2. The Cabinet also agreed that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Melbourne is selected as the city to host the 1996 Olympic Games, the Commonwealth will consider providing assistance and services of the type not readily available from other sources and which are normally Commonwealth Government functions, for example:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a 10-page document. I will just read a few relevant paragraphs from the report. Paragraph 5 of the report talks about the issues that the IDC was set up to look at. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The IDC met on two occasions. One of the main issues for members was to define the scope of the construction project. This was seen as having two aspects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to say what those two aspects were-namely, `defining the boundaries within which construction work associated with the facility was considered reasonable' and `deciding whether the term``construction'' was intended by the Government to cover all things necessary to equip the facility for the staging of the Olympic Games'. Paragraph 17 of the report said, under the sub-heading of cost estimates:</PARA>
<PARA>The ACS-</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Construction Services, part of the Department of Administrative Services-</PARA>
<PARA>advised that the information provided to date-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by the Victorian Government-</PARA>
<PARA>adequately clarified the scope of the project. It indicated which components were in the $249 million estimate. The estimates appeared reasonable for the work involved, even generous. It should, therefore, be possible to build a high class multi-sports facility without any budget overruns. </PARA>
<PARA>The following paragraph, paragraph 18, says:</PARA>
<PARA>IDC members noted that, under the terms of the Government decision, even if there were any cost overruns these would not be borne by the Commonwealth as the decision had committed the Commonwealth to a dollar-for-dollar contribution with the Victorian Government of up to a maximum of $125 million in January 1990 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 24 says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to providing up to a maximum of $125 million in January 1990 prices indexed by the Consumer Price Index(CPI). This commitment was confirmed in the Prime Minister's letters to the Victorian Premier of 7 February 1990 and 4 April 1990 which stated the Commonwealth would ``provide up to a maximum of $125 million in January 1990 prices''. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 28 of the report said-following the question of whether the IDC should try to get more information on the costings:</PARA>
<PARA>To seek more information would be playing at the margins of the project. </PARA>
<PARA>There is another sentence which is not terribly relevant. Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The IDC noted that a public commitment of up to a maximum of $125 million in January 1990 prices has been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Last Friday, 12 October, I applied to the Prime Minister under the Freedom of Information Act for copies of all documents pertaining to this matter, including correspondence, Cabinet decisions, memoranda, minutes and other material held by his office and/or department relating to any financial or other assistance by the Commonwealth in support of Melbourne's bid to host the Olympic Games or for the conduct of the Olympic Games had the bid been successful. I will await receipt of those documents with interest. However, given what I have revealed to the Senate tonight, including the precise wording of the Cabinet decision, it is simply not possible that those documents will do other than confirm my allegation that Prime Minister Hawke misled the Federal Parliament on 13 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no more serious parliamentary offence by any politician. The gravity of the offence is merely compounded by its committal by a leader of a government. I have to say, and I am sad to say it in this chamber, that precisely the same misrepresentation of the Parliament was made on the same day by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, who used the same words as the Prime Minister actually used in the Parliament. So not only did the Leader of the Government, the Prime Minister, mislead the House on 13 September, but so also did the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, mislead this Parliament on 13 September. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am sorry; there was a lady on it also. The conclusions, I suspect, notwithstanding my endeavours to be driven by absolute altruism and objectivity, may have been vaguely tainted, but by my philosophical approach to life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the same way, Senator Collins signed the majority report, which made no conclusion in respect, for instance, of the mining of uranium within Kakadu National Park, notwithstanding the fact that I know that in his heart and conscience, and deep in his decency, he has a strong view about it. But he made a very pragmatic, practical, realistic and reasonable determination as to how he could conduct himself at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Loosley referred-and I came in late and I had to scribble very quickly, as he was going through what was obviously a written statement-to confidentiality and trust. At the end of the day any committee of the Parliament will function to the extent that there is trust, confidentiality, but, most of all, good will. As I say this, let the Hansard note that Senator Loosley finds that a giggle.There has been in the decade I have been in this Parliament something of a downturn in the good will, cooperation and working of these committees. There was a time when we could approach issues, at least from the beginning of the reference, in a bipartisan way, when at least one would go through what one might describe as the deliberations in a respectable and responsible way before one drew one's conclusions. Sadly, this Government, in its inexorable, I suspect, path towards defeat, has become more contemptuous, more disrespectful and, might I say, more corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members of these committees see them as an organ, an instrument and an extension of the Government and the Executive, not as an intrinsic part of the Parliament. Need I observe that this Committee, in the short time I have been a member of it, epitomises that. If one wants to talk about trust, without breaking the confidences of the private procedures of the Committee, one can say that there has been an occasion when that particular Committee had to contemplate what I judge to be the most significant matter that can come before a committee. It took evidence over a period of weeks from a number of witnesses and in seeking to arrive at a conclusion--</PARA>

As some of us sought to work our way through the mountain of evidence taken over days of consideration, at the last hour on the last day, at the time of the last witness, I did little more than move a procedural motion that I, for my part at least, be allowed to review the Hansard, review the evidence, so as to allow me to arrive at a proper, reasoned and considered determination. I remind the House that this was in respect of what ultimately in my view is probably the paramount consideration that any Committee can contemplate. I was denied that opportunity. I was not allowed to read the Hansard before a decision was to be made in respect of that matter. Senator Loosley talks about good will and trust.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And courtesy. Senator Loosley went on to talk about the NCA being a unique committee, a committee of particular significance. To the extent that his words are limited to those phrases, he is partially right. What is important about the National Crime Authority Committee is its responsibility for accountability to this Parliament- perhaps more so than any other committee. That places a greater onus and responsibility on its members than on those members of most other committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then Senator Loosley talked about the taking of evidence in camera. I do not know what Senator Loosley thinks about the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. I seem to remember that he joined the cheer squad for the better part of its endeavours. In my view, that was not an improper position to take. As I recall, as a general rule of thumb principle, Mr Fitzgerald took the view that all of the evidence, as far as possible, subject to the certain and obvious qualifications, should be taken in public. Correct me if I am wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a simple view about committees of the Senate: all evidence ought to be on the public record and taken and published unless witnesses can satisfy the committee that, by being required to do so, they would be denied natural justice, their evidence would be hearsay, their evidence would compromise them or their evidence could compromise the Parliament, a committee of the Parliament or law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> They are, in general terms, the qualifications I place, at least-I trust not unreasonable qualifications. Evidence which is taken in camera can be released by a resolution of the majority of the committee or by the attachment to a report to the Parliament. Evidence may be required to be used to substantiate and justify the conclusions of the recommendations of the report, whether it be a majority or minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> The taking of in camera evidence can be a slick, crude and unattractive way of subjugating and suppressing evidence which ought to be on the public record and for the knowledge of the Parliament. The Australian Labor Party-and I make no judgment about it-has a view in respect of the committees of which I am a member, at least, that all evidence taken in camera ought to remain in camera.</PARA>
<PARA> Committees ought to take a very serious and responsible view about what evidence they take in camera. It is so easy for witnesses to come before a committee of the Parliament, plead to give evidence in camera, table documents in camera, cleanse themselves of their sins and their evils and those to whom they may refer, find themselves under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, thus far unamended, and be excluded from any accountability to any court, anybody or any parliament. That is why when we accept the taking of evidence in camera we have to be very careful about the judgments that we make. </PARA>

<PARA> A committee, of which I am a member, has invaluable evidence that will help the administration of sport in Australia and the administrative body of sport in Australia, and that intrinsically valuable evidence has been denied because of a blind principle about not disclosing in camera evidence.

His words wreak of a lack of understanding of committee procedures. In fact, he really contemplates and imagines that the preparation of minority reports ought to be a matter of deliberation by the majority of the Committee. Since Lionel Murphy was the father of many of these committees, it is a pity that the House of Representatives has never come to grips with how these committees function and are intended. It is a pity that those members in the House of Representatives who are members of these joint committees never seem to understand Standing Orders or the obligations, responsibilities and duties of a committee. I say that in a charitable way about Mr Lindsay, but it really seems to be true that those gentlemen are not clear about how we function.

When he was referring to a courtesy, he was referring to the fact that he had not actually been given the set of words that were used in the minority report. My definition of `courtesy' might be something different from that of Senator Loosley, but once it is resolved that there will be a minority report, that report, Mr President, as you would know better than almost anybody in this chamber, is the exclusive province of the minority report and nobody else. There was not intended to be anything sneaky or underhand; it was done in the normal way in which these matters are done.

There seems to be a view in the Labor Party that there ought to be no exposure of in camera evidence. It does beg some compelling questions; I have always acknowledged that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I suspect the reason that the response to the report thus far has been one of confusion is that the Government does not know how to come to grips with it. I am not one who would ever presume to allege that the Government members on the Committee are in any way driven by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), political motives, political expediency or future political ambitions. But if the conduct of those on the Government side persists, one could be very much seduced by the temptation of that thought. The way this Committee conducts itself in the future will very much determine whether that is an illusion or a reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the conflicting arguments in respect to in-camera evidence, we are all aware that the Procedure Committee examined this very question. It examined it as a result of a matter raised by Senator Zakharov after she had tabled in-camera evidence herself. </PARA>

<PARA> But the Committee found itself subject to conflicting arguments and unable to resolve them. It made the obvious point that when in camera evidence is given, there is a temptation on the part of the witnesses to believe that it will remain in camera, notwithstanding the fact that the qualifications are clearly pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> It went on to make the point that if minority reports are unable to expose in camera evidence where it is intrinsically related to the substance of the recommendations and the findings of the Committee, to so exclude it would be in fact to censor the minority report. In fact, it would leave the minority report naked of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> As I looked last night at the minority report and asked myself what it would represent in terms of substance and value if each part of it which included in camera evidence were removed, there would have been no minority report of consequence; no accountability to the Parliament; and nothing in it of fact and substance which would have allowed the Senate, the Parliament and the community to make value judgments about the integrity, conduct, value and workings of the National Crime Authority. That is what caused those of us who signed that report to sign it and have it contain the evidence that it did. There has been no allegation today by anybody who is responsible and well respected that the National Crime Authority has been compromised as a result of the evidence provided by the minority report. There has been bitching, whelping, complaining, yelling, whingeing and whining by members of the Government, or those in opposition to the minority report, that it does not satisfy them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I want very briefly to make a few remarks that I have been prompted to make by statements Senator Bolkus made today during the matter of public importance, when he alleged that Dr Hewson planned to kill off the Department of Social Security, which was, in fact, repeating the Australian Labor Party's total and disgraceful distortion of what Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, did say. This followed Mr Keating's totally false accusation in the other place that Dr Hewson was proposing that the Opposition turn over $40 billion in Federal outlays to voluntary welfare organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This pretty desperate and childish Labor attack on Dr Hewson was particularly disturbing-and it happened to coincide with another drubbing for the Labor Party in the polls. The most distinguished thing about this is that in no instance did either members of the Labor Party or the media report, in fact, what Dr Hewson actually said. I must say that, as an ex-journalist, I regret that some of my former colleagues do not at times maintain the standards which they generally keep up. In particular, I am very disappointed indeed that one of the Canberra press gallery-for whom I have a very high personal regard as well as a professional regard-Milton Cockburn, has fallen into what I believe to be an unfortunate error in this case. I mentioned to him that I planned to raise this, because, as I said, I have a high personal regard for him. </PARA>

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation this morning in its news, I think, said something like Dr Hewson was being criticised for his plans to do away with the Department for Social Security. Mr Cockburn, in his paper this morning, wrote an article under the heading: Keating flays Hewson over welfare slip. Journalists do not write headlines, but it does emerge fairly from the context of the article because, in it, Mr Cockburn uses the adjectival device, which I thought rested mainly with the Australian Financial Review, of creating an atmospheric about the article rather than reporting the facts:</PARA></TALK.START>

For the record, I plan to read those relevant sections of the transcript of the interview by Niki Savva of the Melbourne Herald Sun, in which it is quite clear that he does not support the proposition that he saw no need for the Department of Social Security-and certainly no support whatsoever for the proposition that Dr Hewson was proposing that the Opposition turn over $40 billion in Federal outlays to voluntary welfare agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The real news was that the Labor Party has got so desperate about its falling status that it will use any device, including dishonesty, to try to denigrate Dr Hewson. I will read relevant bits from the text of the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one of the real issues is at what level do you deliver these benefits? Do you need Commonwealth, State, Local Government Departments of all these things? And the answer is no. There is a massive amount of duplication. I haven't looked at it for a while, but how many Canberra-based and other bureaucrats are there dispensing benefits? What bureaucracy is there that is distributing the dollar of benefit in the end? And, when you look at the size of that bureaucracy, you know, the extent to which a lot of people who don't actually touch the dollar, don't actually meet first hand to hand, the person who receives the pension, you say to yourself, is all that really necessary? And the answer is, it is not. There is duplication at each of the three levels. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on later:</PARA>
<PARA>Some benefits are better distributed at different levels, or managed at different levels. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued on this topic:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the need to eliminate duplication. We are discussing some of those issues with State Liberal leaders right now . . . excess government, excess bureaucracy and a lot of money is wasted in that duplication. </PARA>
<PARA>Niki Savva asked:</PARA>
<PARA>So, you are not adverse to the idea, of say, abolishing the Federal Social Security Department and giving it to the States?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson did not in fact reply yes; nor did he reply no. He in fact replied with a lengthy discussion of whether or not one needed total duplication, but there is nothing in the transcript to justify the quote that he saw no need for the Department of Social Security. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm not saying that I want to put all the money down there to those organisations and say off you go. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues later:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a long way from that group-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the people at the coalface-</PARA>
<PARA>to a Canberra-based bureaucrat making social policy. And I think there is a lot of scope in there to distribute those benefits to those people. And, it may involve a larger role for those organisations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>like welfare agencies. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>That is a personal view, it is not a policy view. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . a lot of money goes out the door and doesn't hit the target. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the genuinely needy in Australia don't get enough. The pensioner trying to struggle on a pension in a city like Sydney or Melbourne today, the genuine pensioner, minimal assets and so on, is really feeling the pinch, as are other genuine welfare recipients, or other beneficiaries of social security . . . There is a better way and that is what we have got to work towards. </PARA>
<PARA>There should not have been any confusion remaining when people were reporting this in this morning's newspapers. Yesterday, 17 October, the text of an interview with Amanda Buckley of the Daily Telegraph Mirror, which was made on Tuesday, 16 October, was distributed in the gallery. In it Dr Hewson says:</PARA>
<PARA>some departments could well be abolished. I wasn't necessarily saying that we would abolish the Department of Social Security but I used social security as an example of saying, look, you're trying to provide welfare assistance to people. It seems to me that there is a lesser argument for having that activity concentrated in Canberra, so far from the coal face in terms of those who are, who you are trying to assist. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they are better able to make sure that the money hits the target than some Canberra bureaucrat. So that argues for phasing down the Canberra-based Department and either making it a State function or a local function or handing the money out perhaps a little bit more-</PARA>
<PARA>not entirely-</PARA>
<PARA>through those voluntary organisations or religious-based organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . you certainly don't want Federal, State and local divisions or departments which is what you've got unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA>Amanda Buckley said:</PARA>
<PARA>So on this, if we just have a look at the Social Security area. You're not speaking I suppose of sending pensions and allowances back to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA>No. You may still pay those from the Commonwealth level but they may be allocated at the local level and the State level. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a direct question:</PARA>
<PARA>You're not speaking I suppose of sending pensions and allowances back to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer was no. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>It really poses the question what level is the most appropriate to have these departments. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a clear transcript. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the things that the Premiers' Conference should decide, for example, is where those responsibilities should lie so that you can eliminate duplication.</PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing in those transcripts which justifies Mr Keating saying that Dr Hewson was proposing that the Opposition turn over $40 billion in Federal outlays to voluntary welfare agencies. That is just false. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely right, it is desperate drivel. There is nothing that supports the view in the Sydney Morning Herald of what Hewson says-whether he saw no need for the Department of Social Security. All I can say is that there is a basic principle here. If we want to knock down what someone says, we should put in quotes what that person has said so that we can knock it down honestly. When we fail to put it in quotes and when we misrepresent that person and then seek to knock it down in the public prints, we are doing our job badly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are much preoccupied in the Senate lately with matters relating to procedure changes to improve the efficiency with which we conduct business in this House. I was a member of the committee that developed the procedures that we are currently dealing with. Tonight's adjournment debate has been conclusive evidence of the overwhelming case that needs to be mounted for limiting debates on the adjournment to a maximum of 15 minutes. Senator Michael Baume demonstrated that one can very succinctly put a case in less than 15 minutes. Such a provision would certainly cut out the opportunity for members literally to talk about nothing for 30 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I rise briefly to speak is that my name got quite a mention in the adjournment debate tonight. I feel that a very short response is necessary. The question of in camera evidence was the most substantive issue tackled tonight. It is a very substantive issue for the Senate indeed. Senator Crichton-Browne made some prolonged reference to it in respect of me and the committee which I served on with him-the Senate Select Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which inquired into drugs in sport. It is a disturbing fact that no absolute guarantee can be given to any witness who gives in camera evidence before a Senate committee that that evidence will perpetually remain in camera. The drugs in sport committee routinely took evidence from witnesses who were clearly under the impression that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> That disturbed me to such an extent that we had a discussion at a private meeting of the Committee about the matter and I insisted that in future all witnesses to whom the Committee gave permission to give evidence in camera before the Committee should be provided with a written brief that explained precisely what the correct position was with in camera evidence so that they could then give that evidence under no illusion as to what might happen to it. The Clerk of the Senate drafted that statement and it was routinely handed to the many witnesses that that particular Committee took in camera evidence from. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that it is still the routine practice of the Senate for that statement on in camera evidence to be handed to and allowed to be read by witnesses before they give that evidence. Senator Crichton-Browne knows full well and accepts, I am sure, that despite all of the disturbing evidence that we took on that Committee as to the dreadful effects of anabolic steroids and other drugs, the drug that still remains the most abused drug in Australia is, of course, alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of in camera evidence is an important one. What Senator Crichton-Browne has ignored is very stark: there is one committee of this Parliament which is unique and there is one committee of the Parliament at which the status of in camera evidence takes a position unlike in camera evidence before any other committee, and that is the Joint Committee the National Crime Authority. There is no other committee of this Parliament which equips all its members with a safe in which to keep the material they are given as members of that Committee. The Joint Committee which oversights the operations of the National Crime Authority is in that position, where each individual member of the Committee is provided with a safe within which that material is contained. </PARA>
<PARA> But it goes further than that. There is, in respect of the members of that Committee, not only a requirement to keep that material secure in a safe, for obvious reasons; there is an absolute prohibition on members of that Committee even disclosing the material to members of their own staff. That is how severe the onus is. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say, with the greatest of respect to Senator Vanstone and any other senator, that there is no way at all that the status of in camera evidence given before that Committee can be compared with the in camera evidence given before any other committee of this Parliament. I know personally that the publication of the in camera evidence before that Joint Committee in a dissenting report last night has already caused the gravest concern in the law enforcement community and that that concern has already been expressed to members of that particular Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying, with the greatest of respect to Senator Vanstone, that I believe that the decision that the senator took to publish in camera evidence of that particular Committee, considering the absolute prohibition that applies to every member of the Committee to even disclose material to members of their own staff in their office, and the requirement to contain it within a safe which is provided to each member, was on her part a very grave error of judgment. That, I might add, is absolutely detached from what the material may have been. It could have been the most innocuous material-I know it was not, but it could have been-but the fact that any member of the Committee took the decision to publish in camera evidence from that particular Committee has caused the gravest concern in the law enforcement community and it was a grave error of judgment on the part of Senator Vanstone. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the Committee will debate the matter more substantively, and perhaps it may even be debated more substantively in the Senate. I believe that the Committee-and I will be surprised if it does not-will come to the conclusion that it cannot really perform very much more useful work, considering the extraordinary gravity of the task that they employ in terms of the evidence they take on that Committee, if any member of the Committee, either from the House of Representatives or the Senate, takes a decision in future to publish any of the in camera evidence that is placed before that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
