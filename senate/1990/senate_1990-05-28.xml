<PARA> 1. Australians believe in freedom and democracy for all people.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The annexation of the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to USSR is not recognised as lawful by Australia; these Baltic states were illegally occupied by USSR.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Lithuanians have suffered their own `Katyn massacres' after the infamous Stalin-Hitler pact of 1939.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Lithuania's restoration of independence of 11 March 1990, is a peaceful and democratic expression of the desires of the overwhelming majority of the peoples of Lithuania.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Australian Government should support the democratically elected Government of the Republic of Lithuania, headed by President V. Landsbergis. Australia should extend humanitarian aid to Lithuanian peoples and full recognition of the Lithuanian Government.</PARA>

<TITLE>Animal Patents</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate. The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would reduce biodiversity, compromise animal welfare, concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This notice is being moved because it is at the end of the time available for such action. The Committee's concerns relate to the provision for a strict liability offence, for a less than desirable form of search warrant, for a reversal of the usual onus of proof so that it now lies with the defendant, and with an instrument which includes more than 100 handwritten annotations without initials or other form of authentication. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the concerns of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES COMMITTEE</PARA>
<PARA>Goat Fibre Levy Collection Regulations</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1989 No. 386</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations provide that a search warrant ``may'' be in a form prescribed in a Schedule, rather than using a mandatory form. The Committee regards the authorisation of persons to enter private premises, in this case if necessary with assistance, by force and at any time of the day or night, as a serious matter which requires careful scrutiny. In this case the Committee was especially vigilant as the parent Act permits such warrants to be issued by a magistrate or justice of the peace. The Committee, together with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, usually prefers to see the safeguard of a warrant issued only by a judge or magistrate. The Committee appreciates, however, that in some remote areas where goat production occurs it may not be practicable for a judicial officer to issue warrants. This is all the more reason, therefore, for the additional safeguard of a mandatory form of an instrument which authorises what would otherwise be a serious breach of personal rights.</PARA>
<PARA>Juries (Amendment) Ordinance</PARA>
<PARA>A.C.T. Ordinance No. 61 of 1989</PARA>
<PARA>This instrument makes it an offence for an employer to penalise an employee who has been summoned for jury service. This provision, however, reverses the normal onus of proof which, of course, is on the prosecution. If the elements of the offence other than the reasons for the employer's action are proved, the onus of proving that a dismissal, injury or alteration of an employee's position to that employee's prejudice was not because the employee was summoned to serve as a juror is on the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee regards a reversal of the onus of proof as requiring detailed explanation. Such provisions have potential for serious breaches of personal liberties and are closely scrutinised by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Amendment)</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1990 No. 35</PARA>
<PARA>These Statutory Rules make it an offence for a person operating a vessel or hovercraft passing through specified areas of the Park to discharge more than 20 persons a day. The penalty was $5,000. There was no defence of reasonable excuse or any requirement of wilful intent in the provision, making it a strict liability offence. The Committee always questions strict liability offences and will accept them only in extraordinary circumstances and with great reluctance, as they are prima facie a breach of personal liberties.</PARA>
<PARA>In the present case, for example, it would appear there is no defence if the person operating the vessel or hovercraft discharges more than 20 people for reason of fire, shipwreck or other emergency.</PARA>
<PARA>Following previous correspondence with the Committee in connection with earlier amendments the Minister undertook to provide defences for other strict liability offences in the Regulations and the parent Act was amended to remove strict liability from certain offences provided in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas Defence Determination 1990/36</PARA>
<PARA>Defence Act 1903</PARA>
<PARA>This Determination had more than 100 hand written alterations to the printed copy with no initials or other apparent explanations of their authenticity.</PARA>
<PARA>Most protective notices of motion given by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee relate to the protection of personal rights and the provision of appropriate review of administrative decisions affecting individuals. This is an example, however, of such notice being given in respect of a breach of parliamentary propriety. Delegated legislation confers rights and imposes duties in the same way as Acts of Parliament and the standards which apply to executive law-making should not be less than the standards of Acts. Just as it would not be acceptable for an Act to have any, to say nothing of 100, unexplained additions, delegated legislation should not be made, tabled or supplied to the public unless it complies with these standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Harradine moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to provide for the President to read to the Senate, after Questions this day, a proposed matter of urgency and a letter of its withdrawal by Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA>I move that motion because, as I read standing order 75, it does not appear clear to me whether the President is required to read letters from honourable senators proposing urgency motions. I for one was doing some homework on this urgency motion. I rang the Government Whip's office to ask to be put on the speaker's list. I was told by the Government Whip that it had been withdrawn. I have wasted a little time and all of my homework has been for nought. </PARA>
<PARA> So that honourable senators may be clear as to what we are talking about, a letter was received by you, Mr President, this morning from Senator Coulter proposing the following urgency motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency, namely, that to conform to the goal of a sustainable national economy the Government should seek to stabilise the size of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, that is a very important question; it is one about which I have views. I congratulate Senator Coulter for raising it. I think it is an important question to be raised publicly. The problem is that now Senator Coulter has presumably written a letter withdrawing his motion, the Senate will not have an opportunity to discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA> The population control lobby will continue by backdoor methods to attempt to influence policy decisions without the matter coming before this chamber. I say very clearly that the bottom line of moves by the population control lobby is the violation of fundamental human rights-that is, the right of parents responsibly to make decisions affecting their intimate relationships in terms of the number of children that they have. It is a fundamental question of human rights. Of course, except for Senator Coulter, the population controllers are not prepared to have the debate out in the open. They prefer to write speeches for Ministers and include in them such comments as:</PARA>
<PARA> But the thing that worries me more than a little bit about sustainable development is that no-one seems to be against it. I am yet to meet anyone who says they are against it. A bit like apple pie and, until we realised the implications of accelerated population growth, motherhood. </PARA>
<PARA>This comment appeared in a speech of Senator Richardson in Melbourne last December. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we see last week? We saw a report of a proposal before the Federal Government to cut out family allowances for 12- to 16-year-olds. That has now been denied by Senator Robert Ray but was not immediately denied by Senator Richardson. So this sort of population control push will be responsible for the development of an anti-family, anti-child mentality and could allow future governments to get away with anti-child policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I have no intention at all of canvassing the motion put forward by Senator Coulter. However, I do congratulate his fellow Australian Democrats for influencing him in withdrawing that motion. I think that is very realistic on their part. They appreciate, as I do, that anyone who goes along the line is not only going down the track of violation of human rights and the development of an anti-child mentality in Australia, but also the promotion of a stagnant economy and national sterility. In conclusion, I hope--</PARA>

I asked: Has he been made aware of the concerns so he may take those concerns into consideration? He has answered that. I asked: How many people expressing a concern would be considered by the ABC to be a number that is worth taking notice of in accepting the request? He has not answered that. So two questions remain that Mr Hill has not answered, and those are the two main questions that I asked.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to respond to that interjection but I do not really want to prolong this matter for much longer. Perhaps I could just advise the Senate quickly of the background to this matter. I was the Minister in the chamber when this matter was raised. I wish to make one important point. When Senator Walters asked the question it was entirely unrelated to the Budget appropriations, but believing in the premise that a soft answer turneth away wrath, I was perfectly happy to accommodate Senator Walters and suggested that I would do so immediately. I got an answer to Senator Walters's questions within 48 hours. I had an initial answer within 48 hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walters was unhappy with the detail provided in that response. I see that she is nodding, so that is correct. I had a further conversation with Senator Walters on Thursday just outside the chamber relating to her dissatisfaction with the answer. I said that I understood that she was dissatisfied and that I would immediately instruct my office to get a complete answer to the question, which I did on Thursday night. I told Senator Walters that I would be in a position to provide it to her this week. Frankly, I thought that would have satisfied the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two further matters that Senator Walters has raised. The first is: How many complaints does the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) regard as being serious? The information that I have to that inquiry, not surprisingly, is each and every complaint. The ABC takes even a single complaint about programming matters seriously. That is the answer to that question. As to the question of objecting to the showing of this particular film, the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls,on Palm Sunday, that is very much a programming matter for the ABC. It is not a matter for the Government to direct the ABC on. It is an independent body which has its own control over programming matters. I hope that that particular situation would continue. With the greatest respect to Senator Walters, I have to say that having seen the program myself and having read the program notes-I have them in front of me--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the timing and the lack of sensitivity, I point out that the total number of complaints were something in the order of 100 plus nationwide. The details of them are in the paper document. I hope that the ABC will continue to adopt a view on matters, including religion, of actually provoking some sort of public debate and interest. It sets out to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would assume that the reason it broadcast the program on Palm Sunday was for that reason. With the greatest respect to Senator Walters, I have to say that in terms of testing the faith of Christians being forced-indeed no-one was forced-to sit in the comfort of their living room wrapped around a cup of tea and a lamington watching the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a program with which one may have disagreed, is a hell of a lot of an advance on being thrown to the lions, which is what happened 2,000 years ago. I have no doubt also in saying that probably if those particular conditions of testing the faith were around today I and a lot of other Christians would be running around at the point of a spear saying, `Jesus who?'. I have to say with the greatest of respect to Senator Walters that I treat her complaints seriously, as does the ABC. I do not personally take much issue with the decision that the ABC might have taken to broadcast on Palm Sunday a religious program, which is what it was, putting a point of view with which she may disagree. </PARA>

I do not think it is our position to debate what Christians think; it is not what I was putting forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I telephoned Mr Hill in response to the complaints I received from my constituents. Not one of the complaints related to the showing of the program. They asked whether he could put it off for a week and not show it on Palm Sunday. I thought that was a legitimate request and it was one I carried to him. The Minister said that I asked: How many people expressing concern with the ABC are considered to be serious? That was not the question I asked. I will read again my question from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>How many people expressing a concern would be considered by the ABC to be a number that is worth taking notice of and accepting the request?</PARA>
<PARA>This is a totally different question. I agree with Mr Hill, the ABC probably does accept every complaint as serious. But that was not the question I asked.</PARA>
<PARA> There are only two questions remaining. I did not ask only for the numbers from capital cities, although the capital city numbers are now 325 complaints to the switchboard and 49 written complaints. This is quite a large number, I would have thought. But that was not my request. I requested the total number. In his response Mr Hill said that summaries of them are always presented to him but he does not know what the numbers are. He said that where the issue is considered serious enough by senior management the Managing Director would be informed more frequently than weekly indications, sometimes on a daily basis. How many complaints generally came through? There are just these two questions outstanding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the first question asked by Senator Walters, I did not take the last particular sentence of her question to mean what obviously she does mean it to mean, that is: What is the number of complaints that the ABC would consider to be the level at which it would change a programming decision? The answer to that is that there is no magical number that the ABC would simply have laid down in procedure to trigger a decision to change a program. Perhaps the simplest way of answering that question completely for both the benefit of Senator Walters and for the information of all honourable senators would be to table the ABC's Editorial and Program Practices in Radio and Television. That contains a complete account of the prescribed procedure that the ABC lays down for handling complaints. I table the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to the last question, the question about the regional stations, which I did pursue-I think it is a reasonable one-there is no number readily available from all of the 72 regional stations around Australia which in many places have very small numbers of staff and in some an administrative staff of three or four. We have a very detailed account in the paper document of the complaints and compliments that were received at the major capital city stations. It was considered to be not reasonable under the circumstances to pursue at some cost to the ABC how many complaints were received by regional stations. That is the answer to the question about regional stations. Frankly, I think it is a reasonable one. It would seem to be beyond reasonable demand on the resources of the ABC to pursue, with the very small administrative staff that operate some of these offices in every regional station of the ABC in Australia, the number of complaints that were received about this particular program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to enter this debate but there are several matters that were recently raised by Senator Collins that I think demand a comment. Firstly, I would like to challenge the numbers because I think in one State alone there were certainly in excess of the number that has been mentioned Australia wide. Secondly, a great majority of people opposed the showing of this particular film on a very sensitive day in the Christian calendar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was the ABC's right to show this film at a general time, but its timing in showing a film that went right across the basic principles of Christianity on a day which had certain sensitivities in the Christian calendar, Palm Sunday, was somewhat abhorrent. I do not accept the arguments put forward by the ABC management in this regard. It is true that it got a few accolades. That is not to be unexpected for an organisation that appears to be increasingly motivated against the Christian ethic. Had it been the Moslem religion we would have seen some sort of an apology; we would not have seen that sort of film on such a particularly sensitive day. I leave that challenge with the Minister to answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frankly, having seen the program, I thought it was a very minor test of faith indeed. It has left my faith unshaken. With respect to testing the number of complaints, all I can do is accept what appears to me to be a detailed breakdown of complaints which deals not only with the complaints, but also with the compliments. A note which would be of relevance to senators from Tasmania says that the Hobart switchboard did notify the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's State representative that at the time there did appear to be `an organised campaign of phone-ins in Hobart on this issue'. Obviously, there was particular sensitivity about this issue in Tasmania. I note, and think it is proper to note, that the Hobart switchboard was sensible enough, in responding to what was clearly the largest number of complaints on a single issue-and the list indicates that very clearly; there were 100 complaints lodged in Hobart-to notify its State representative that there appeared to have been an organised phone-in on this issue, and to bring it to that person's attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like a copy of that document. The Minister has laid down the ABC policy regulations. The broadcasting policy in the explanatory notes says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To oversight the structure and application of broadcasting regulation which is responsive to current social and economic needs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal objective states:</PARA>
<PARA>To ensure, via appropriate public debate, that as many Australians as possible have equitable access to a national commercial and public broadcasting infrastructure that is competitive, commercially viable and sensitive to the social, cultural, educational and entertainment needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite what the ABC may think its rights are, I believe that, through the objectives set down in the explanatory notes, it has to become sensitive to the social, cultural, educational and entertainment needs of the community and to be responsive to the current social needs of the community. It is for that reason, because that is a stated objective, that I ask: What is the number of complaints coming forward to the ABC that it would consider so that it can be sensitive to social and cultural needs and be responsive to those needs? That is one question which I believe is legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA> I saw the program, and the subsequent program, and my request on behalf of my constituents was not that it not be shown, but that it be shown on any other day except Palm Sunday or, indeed, during that holy week. I am certainly not debating whether or not it should have been shown. I approached the ABC on behalf of my constituents. I am pointing out that the objectives of the ABC should be to be responsible, to be responsive and sensitive to the social needs of the community. Senator Watson has pointed out that had a program on the Moslem religion been shown, great sensitivity would have been shown by the ABC. As far as the Christian religion is concerned, I think Paddy McGuinness was pretty right in his article when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The screening by the ABC of a documentary the thrust of which was to deny the central tenet of the Christian faith at the beginning of the week of mourning leading to its celebration, the feast of the resurrection, was undoubtedly in bad taste. But it was more. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this timing was deliberately and gratuitously offensive, intended to wound the sensitivities of committed and believing Christians, however tolerant of public debate concerning the history and validity of their faith. </PARA>
<PARA> This kind of thing seems to be becoming more and more usual in an ABC which has been captured by the ignorant and silly products of the 1960s and '70s who are still stuck in the undergraduate delights of shocking the staid, the conservative, the respectable and the religious. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it could have been put better by anyone and I commend Paddy McGuinness on his article. I believe it is very accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> Two questions remain. If the ABC is going to abide by the objectives set down in the explanatory notes, I want to know what number, or, if there is not a magical number, what degree of complaint the ABC considers it should receive before it becomes responsive or sensitive to the social needs of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Knowles is probably right; he has been too busy elsewhere. David Hill knew on 10 April that I wanted that answer. He said he had better things to do than personally to ring around the 72 regional stations, and indeed, it would be a waste of taxpayers' money for him to do so. I would agree with him entirely. What a dreadful thing for the Managing Director to tell me that that is how the ABC is run. I would have thought that the ABC would have been run in a far more productive fashion, but if that is how our 9c each a day is expended, I would certainly suggest that things ought to be conducted in a different way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I still believe it is quite legitimate for me to ask how many complaints throughout Australia the ABC had in regard to that program. The Managing Director should be able to give me that figure from the 72 regional stations. It is not a figure that is difficult to get. Surely to heavens people in the outback who make a complaint should be allowed to know that that complaint reaches the ABC and is not ignored. The implication by the Minister today is that it would be too expensive and too difficult to get the number of complaints. If it is a fact that complaints from people in the bush are ignored because they do not happen to live in a capital city, I would be most surprised. I want the answer to these questions: how many complaints throughout Australia did the ABC get? At what stage does the ABC start taking note of public opinion and respond sensitively to the social needs of Australians?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am still clinging grimly to the biblical stricture that a soft answer turneth away wrath. I do feel, with the greatest respect, that the Committee has canvassed this issue to a point where we really should be getting on with something else. I do take seriously Senator Walters's complaints. I think I indicated that by the degree to which I went to get answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have answered Senator Walters's substantive question twice now but I will now answer it for the third time. There is no set number of complaints that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has laid down in its guidelines that would trigger a response from the ABC to cancel or alter a program. If, in accordance with Senator Walters's desires, the ABC did lay down a set number of complaints, I would have to say that personally I would start to wonder very seriously about the expertise of the management of the ABC. There is no magical number of complaints that triggers a situation where a program would actually be altered or deleted from the program. On every occasion the ABC would have to use its good judgment as to how it should respond. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of dealing with issues sensitively, I think that the ABC comprehensively does that. It also has an obligation not to deliver pap, and I hope that it continues to adopt a policy of delivering programs that provoke comment and debate in the community-provided they do not always end up in debate in the Senate in the final week. </PARA>
<PARA> But the question concerns the decision to broadcast this particular program on Palm Sunday. Senator Walters is entitled to her view on the matter. So are her constituents. She has clearly disagreed-and at length-with the ABC for its decision to broadcast the program on Palm Sunday, and I think she has had a very good opportunity to broadcast those concerns not just to the Committee but, since today the proceedings here are being broadcast, to the nation as well. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the regional stations are concerned, I cannot be more forthright than I have been already. The ABC did not have the resources in all of its regional stations around Australia to record the complaints made about this particular program and it would be unreasonable, in my view, to impost that duty on it. I think that the detailed list of complaints, compliments and requests for re-broadcasting of the program from the cities that have been nominated give a reasonable indication to Senator Walters of the depth of the complaint. As a senator, to want to go any further than this one would have to ask what I think is a very reasonable question at this time, that is, what at the end of the day is the object of pursuing the matter to this point? What is the object of this particular exercise?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) is anxious on his own terms to bring this debate to a close, but I think it is a matter of sufficient importance to analyse the answer he has provided to the Committee on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I regard it as smacking of casuistry to say that the ABC takes every complaint seriously, the inference being that one complaint is taken as seriously as 10,000. I do not think that that ought to be the case and I do not think that Senator Collins, in his simplistic manner, can brush it off by saying, `Of course, there cannot be a quantitative level above which you take it seriously and below which you do not'. Of course, that is right but that is a straw man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real question is: What circumstances and what level of complaints prompt the ABC to take action which it would not otherwise take in response to complaints?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Collins is going to trouble the Senate again, he might as well trouble us now, but I will give him the opportunity to deal with it later. It seems to me that that is an example of the ABC wanting to make its own in-house subjective judgments without telling the world what the objective criteria are. There have been a number of problems and complaints in the past about the ABC's method of processing complaints. The ABC is very determined to keep itself away from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT). It says that somehow it ought to have an additional licence and ought to be able to run material that somehow might go a bit further than that on the commercials, presumably on the basis that the people who watch the ABC are of more rigorous disposition than, or are not quite as sensitive as, those who watch the commercials, who need more protection. But, when pursued in the Estimates Committee hearing, David Hill, as I recall it, said that about 99.9 per cent of the ABC's standards complied with those of the ABT. I cannot see how in the present situation anyone can really justify that sort of fine distinction. Nonetheless, the ABC is determined to maintain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then it goes further and says that in a sense everything is serious and nothing is serious. I do not regard that as a satisfactory response. There ought to be guidelines and some way of informing the public at which point the ABC will take something seriously. We can say that is just a matter of judgment but that does not help me, because it is the length of the chancellor's foot. Whose judgment is it? Is it the local manager in Hobart? He says, `I got more complaints than anyone in the nation but they were organised so my advice to you is not to take that seriously'. If there were more complaints in Sydney people would say, `That is a bigger population so you can discount that'. If there were only 46 in Melbourne people would say, `That is an infinitesimal amount'. People can always disregard levels of complaints if they want to. Some 100,000 people might ring in but people can discount them all as organised or simply say, `This is just an issue of the moment and we do not regard it as an issue of national importance'. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, if people want to they can take a very small level of complaint seriously; if they want to they can take a very large number dismissively. That is why I say it is not good enough to say, `We take everything seriously; it is then a matter of judgment'. No-one in the public then knows whether anything is going to be taken seriously to the point of it causing a different response. If people ring up and are told, `Thank you very much, we will record your complaint', where does it go? Why bother in the first place? I am going to be discouraged from ever complaining if my understanding is that the ABC might or might not, if it is so minded on the day, do something because somebody thinks it is worth while. That is not very satisfactory to me and, I suspect, the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister ought to be less protective of the ABC and more concerned to establish some sort of system of guidelines in which the public can have some degree of confidence that the ABC ought to be allowed to maintain its independence from the ABT and provide some sort of serious reaction to community complaints instead of in effect treating itself as above the public and adhering to a standard which it regards as somehow better than that of the rest of the community or, conversely, that the rest of the community really does not understand what the ABC is on about. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Minister does that we will continue to get the sorts of complaints that Senator Walters gets and the views that many people around the countryside will express at least privately, and not through the media, which is probably the only venue that the Minister would take seriously. They do that because they have an acute sense of frustration and simply do not know what it will take to provoke the ABC ever to do something that might in fact be a mainstream view but a view it will dismiss because, in its judgment, it did not result in a sufficient level of complaints. I do not think that is good enough. </PARA>

<PARA> What happened instead was that I did not get a single question from an Opposition member relating to the $75m budget variation that was contained in the supplementary appropriations-not a single question. Instead, I got a long debate on a legitimate matter related to the programming of the ABC which had nothing-and still has nothing-whatever to do with the supplementary appropriations that we are now debating. In fact, because the matter has been raised again I feel some obligation-not a personal obligation but a professional obligation to David Hill-to point out the facts. </PARA>

Senator Alston got up at a late hour during the Estimates Committee hearing for no other reason than because he felt-I could see it written all over his face-the overwhelming need to do so. Once again, he slated the ABC and said that it dealt with public complaints with contempt. All of this is related to an alleged difficulty in getting answers from the ABC. But it was raised during consideration of the supplementary appropriations, of which the ABC did not have any. The fact is that the ABC, including its General Manager, has appeared regularly before Estimates committees and will do so again when it is required to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one very mild criticism of Senator Walters: perhaps it would have been more conducive to a proper debate-that is to actually have something before the Chair of this Committee that should be there-if Senator Walters had taken an opportunity that is entirely within her province, as I have certainly done it in the past, to have had a discussion with her Estimates Committee and through it, or through representatives from her side of the chamber on another Estimates committee, to have expressed her desire to have the senior executive of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, or, indeed, any other officer from any other government department, appear at an Estimates committee hearing at which he was, in fact, not required to do so because the ABC had no supplementary appropriations. Senator Walters did not do that and I have satisfied my inquiries that there was no formal request on the part of the Committee for the ABC to appear. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not reasonable-I get back to this dreadful business of being reasonable-for Senator Walters to assume that, because she as an individual senator had approached David Hill, and because David Hill knew about the matter as a result of her having talked to him on 10 April, he should have simply assumed that he was therefore required to appear at an Estimates committee meeting to consider supplementary estimates even though the ABC was not seeking any. That is not reasonable. What Senator Walters should have done-if I could be provoked into providing this mild criticism-if she considered this to be a matter of such great moment, was to have debated and raised the matter at a meeting of the appropriate Estimates committee and ensured that there was a committee request for David Hill to appear. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister at the Estimates Committee hearing responsible for this area, I said-this appears in the Hansard, and I recall saying it-that my attitude, generally, towards this kind of thing is that when a reasonable request is made directly to me to have an officer appear at an Estimates committee hearing I will try to accommodate that request if it is reasonable to do so. But I do not think it is reasonable, on this a broadcast day, for people who may be listening to the Senate proceedings today-the two or three men and their dogs who may be listening-to go away with the impression from this debate that the ABC was reluctant to appear, unhappy to appear or churlish in refusing to appear, which is the impression that has been created. The fact is that the ABC was not at the Estimates Committee hearing because it did not have any supplementary appropriations and it was not required to be there. There was no request either from me, as the Minister, or from the Committee that the ABC should be present because there was no reason why a request should have been made at the time. The ABC has always appeared, with its chief executive, at Estimates committees when it has been required by a committee to be at those Estimates committees, and it will continue to do that in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. The Minister has just said `I do'. If the Minister means by that smart alecky reply that it was because Mr Hill would then have had to answer questions, perhaps that is accurate, but I do not believe it is. I had indicated, as it states in the Hansard, that I had spoken to Mr Hill, to say that I would see him at Estimates and that I wanted to ask him certain questions which I gave him at that time. He indicated to me that he would be present. However, at the Estimates hearing I then said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I wanted to ask him questions at Estimates. He said, `Yes, Senator', and I took it from that that he had indicated he would be here. That is why I did not ask specifically for his attendance through the Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from the Hansard. Certainly I will never trust this procedure again and I will ask for his presence through the Secretary. But I had understood-because Mr Hill had told me so himself; he had said `Yes, Senator'-that Mr Hill would see me at the Estimates committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason I believe the Minister, very graciously, allowed me to ask those questions. But do not let us get sidetracked into saying that I had no right to ask those questions. I had asked Mr Hill to be present at the Estimates Committee hearing. He had assured me that he would be there. The Minister indicated that he would accommodate my questions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> These questions are not strictly relevant to the appropriations. I am anxious to accommodate Senator Walters. Let me accept her previous offer to accept them on notice. I will ensure that you are given answers. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that that was generous of the Minister but he is not the only Minister that does that. It has been done on many occasions previously. The Minister has berated me and said that I should have gone about it in a different way. But this was already explained in the Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had a chance to read it, but I did get a copy of ABC Editorial and Program Practices in Radio and Television. It says that the role of the ABC is to `contribute to the development of values within the community'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, and I must say I will be properly brought into line by the Chairman of future committees if I am stupid enough to attempt to genuinely accommodate a question which was totally out of order at that particular Estimates committee. I can recall my very first experience at Senate Estimates committees. I was appalled by the rafts and rafts of highly paid and very competent public servants swanning around in corridors in the old Parliament House. I still remember my first experience with Estimates where a particular group of individuals-four of them-from a particular section of a particular department who were last cab off the rank to be called, and who had waited in the corridor since 2 o'clock that afternoon, came before the Estimates Committee. I can remember discussing this with some Opposition senators on the night. This group sat down at the table and were not asked a single question, having been kept there for six hours. I know that that does not happen any more-or very rarely-because strenuous efforts have been made by senators and by officers of the Senate to better regulate the procedure of Estimates committees to ensure that that does not happen. But I know that it is very much on the mind-and this has been an object lesson, I am sure, that will perhaps accelerate the debate-to try to make Estimates committees more regulated, more meaningful, and more important to the Opposition in terms of its use of them, by making sure that what is debated at Estimates committees is relevant to the appropriations that are being debated by those committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I could indulge in a bit of self-criticism and criticism of the Chairman of the Committee on the night, Senator Crowley. It was probably my fault and Senator Crowley's fault that we did not in fact insist that the Senate Committee only discuss those matters for which there were appropriations-which is what we should have done. I stand condemned for that. The reason that I tried to give Senator Walters an abbreviated answer was to try, in the fourth consecutive week of the sitting of the Senate, in dealing with this matter which should not even be in here in this form because it is not elated to appropriations, to shortcircuit the answer. I did this by tabling the ABC Editorial and Program Practices in Radio and Television, in which the answers to Senator Walters's questions are contained. I must say that for someone who is taking such a passionate interest in how complaints are handled by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), I would have thought that she would have had this document memorised like holy writ. I am surprised she has not. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer Senator Walters to page 30 of this document. Not only does it deal with program complaints but, also, on the same page it deals with that vexed subject of religious programming. I must say it is very interesting that the ABC is being vilified for what one particular group of people takes great offence at in terms of the timing of the program, not its content. Senator Walters has been insistent that she was not saying that the program should not have been put to air; she is not into censorship in that sense. The complaint just concerned the insensitive timing. But I have not heard any commendation from Senator Walters for the excellent Christian programs that have been broadcast on the ABC, such as the Doogue programs, a number of which I have watched and thought were excellent. The ABC in fact has a very comprehensive programming schedule in religious programs, which is laid out at paragraph 7.12 on page 30, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC broadcasts a wider and more comprehensive range of programs dealing with religion than commercial broadcasters; its religious programs cover worship and devotion, explanation, analysis, debate and reports. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that has got something to do with the difficulty of getting sponsors for such programs. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Religion include Christianity, other traditional religions and new religious movements, as well as analysis and discussion of religious issues from non-religious points of view. </PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that the ABC continues to implement such a policy and is never deterred in putting to air programs that may attract a little bit of controversy. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC aims to explore developments in religion; it does not promote any particular theology or form of religious expression. </PARA>
<PARA>And in my view, neither should it. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the needs of Australian audiences, it is inevitable that Christianity attracts a major proportion of the ABC's attention; however, the ABC does not see its role to be that of necessarily reinforcing Christian values. Rather, the ABC attempts to reflect the liveliness of debate and concern which religious issues encourage. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it very difficult to imagine that any reasonable person could disagree with that as a programming ethic for the ABC's religious programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It then goes on-and I conclude on this point-to detail what happens when people complain about programs of the ABC. That is laid out exhaustively on pages 30 and 31 of this document. I refer Senator Walters and any other honourable senators to it rather than reading it all out into Hansard. </PARA>

The ABC would do itself a great service if it were to take complaints seriously to the point where it was prepared to collate them, and not simply-as it did in this instance, after Senator Walters had pursued the matter-come up with some statistics six weeks later. It should have in place a mechanism that allows those facts to be brought to the attention of the managing director or someone in a high position of authority straight after the event so that sensible judgments can be made about, in particular, what constitutes a sufficient level of complaints to take the matter further. That could be done in terms of quantitative levels or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply make the point that the ABC does not help its own case by effectively taking the view that it will decide in its own time, in its own place, whether it ought to be taking any further action. That is tantamount to saying that whether it gets one complaint or 10,000 complaints, it will make the decision. If that is the view it takes, it might as well not even know how many complaints it has. I suspect in many instances it does not and did not know on this occasion until some weeks later. I do not argue that the ABC is treating people with contempt. I simply say that it is doing itself a disservice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise one point only-that is to remind honourable senators of the legislation we passed in this place with regard to the new organisation of how complaints are handled. I am surprised at some of the comments of Senator Harradine, simply because the method by which complaints are handled in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is not a matter for the ABC, but for legislation. Indeed we had a very long debate in this place about how they would be handled. It is not an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. A separate community organisation has been established. It seeks, over time, new people to come on board. It is a shadowing organisation that was a matter of a very long debate in this place and a matter of amendment in this chamber as to how it would be set up to operate. It was strengthened when the legislation came here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find this debate somewhat strange because the organisation which we put in place is a very good one. I think it has operated very well.

<PARA> It is involved not only with complaints. It is a proactive organisation, not just simply a reactive organisation, and it is a body to which the ABC is required by legislation to give information. It is also a body which, by legislation, is required to advise the ABC on community attitudes. I have always thought that that is a far better way to go, so that the ABC can be monitored by that community organisation. If it is not working, then certainly the chamber ought to look at it. I take the view of Senator Walters and Senator Harradine, that it is not working. In that case, we ought to go back and look at the legislation. It is not simply a matter of the ABC; it is a matter of legislation passed and set in place by this chamber in which the community is given a role that it is not given with regard to any other licensee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was the Chairman of the Estimates Committee which tried to accommodate Senator Walters when she asked her question. In retrospect, I would have done the same thing. I point out something which has already been pointed out; that is, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was not seeking additional funds at these current Estimates committee hearings. Under those circumstances, it could have been quite easy to rule a question about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation out of order. But Senator Walters knows that that is not my style at Estimates committee hearings. If an honourable senator wants an answer to a question, I try, if at all possible, to accommodate that honourable senator. On this occasion, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, was of the same wont.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had the question and there was some concern that the answer might not be here in time. An answer was given but it was not satisfactory to Senator Walters. We passed the Supply Bills last Friday afternoon but the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, gave an undertaking that, if necessary, there would be a debate on the matter this morning. Further answers have been provided. Again, Senator Walters is not satisfied with the answers. I can understand what she is saying and why she is dissatisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> My earlier point was that, as Senator Collins said, when these other answers that Senator Walters was seeking were not available, it should have been the end of the matter. By that I meant that if the answers are not available, any further questions by Senator Walters will not make them available. Senator Walters can express her displeasure at the fact that they are not available-I think she has done so and she can do so again if she so wishes-but if we are to go any further than that, we will have to go beyond this Committee debate and do what Senator Macklin suggested-look at the particular legislation which the Corporation is bound to follow. We have probably gone as far as we can go this morning. It might be a good idea to try to conclude the debate now, or very shortly. </PARA>

Once we have the legislation for the Australian Sports Drug Agency passed through the Parliament-hopefully during the next session-I will be very confident that all sports will comply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an issue with which I have kept in close touch because I often make visits to South Australia. I had a discussion with the Premier only two or three nights ago about a number of issues affecting the South Australian economy. In answer to Senator Maguire's question, South Australia has had a significant reduction in unemployment, taking it from having the fifth lowest rate in 1989 to the third lowest in March and April this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The absolute number of persons unemployed in South Australia, seasonally adjusted, has fallen from 52,000 in April 1989 to 48,000 last month. South Australia's share of total national unemployment has fallen from 10.4 per cent in April 1989 to 9.3 per cent in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the important reasons for this are lead projects, such as the Australian Submarine Corporation and the Anzac ships, as well as other traditional manufacturing enterprises, such as the General Motors-Holden's plants in South Australia, which continue to contribute substantially to the health of the State's economy and provide a substantial boost to investment activity and future manufacturing capability for the State well into the next century. I should also point out that, in addition, housing starts have risen 3 per cent in South Australia in the last year, having been somewhat out of phase with national trends a year or two ago.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the last part of the question, `If not, why not?', the answer is no. And `Why not?'-because the suggestion comes from Senator Boswell. No intelligent commentators on the scene have really made that suggestion. Senator Boswell represents, if I might say so, something beyond the fringe in making the suggestion. Senator Boswell will be aware that the Australian Wool Corporation has been buying most of the Australian supply of wool for something in the order of 12 months, if not more. To suggest that as a result of recent wool sales the Wool Corporation is behaving in any different a manner from the manner in which it has behaved over the last 12 months is bordering on the ludicrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know why Senator Boswell addressed this question to me in my capacity as Minister representing the Treasurer, unless it is because of the nationwide concern about the minimal level of wool exports at the present time, which is of concern to all Ministers in the Government and particularly the Treasurer because of its impact on the current account. I do not know of any other reason why he would address the question to me except that I am in a position to deny what he describes as irresponsible speculation by the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Kerin.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin has been very diligent in the last week in making his views known to both the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The early reports we have received from our embassy-backed up by many of the widespread media reports-indicate that there was a very significant vote for the National League for Democracy. It also appears that the voter turnout was high, particularly in urban areas, but at this stage the situation in rural seats is such that virtually no results are available. I must also stress that the initial reports are very early, and are waiting further analysis by our embassy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If it becomes apparent that the NLD has won a majority of seats in the new constituent assembly, the Australian Government will certainly continue to urge the military regime, in line with its own promise that the election would be free and fair, to effect a transfer of power in accordance with the expressed wishes of the people of Myanmar for democratic rule.</PARA>
<PARA> The military regime's promise that the election would be free and fair has been seriously undermined by its suppression of political dissent and intimidation of political opponents to limit their participation in the election. It is particularly regrettable that the leader of the main opposition party-the National League for Democracy-is still under house arrest and was disqualified from standing in the election. The Australian Government will be paying close attention to the result of the election in Myanmar and expects the military regime to abide by its undertaking that military rule is an interim measure, pending a transfer of power to the democratic government to be formed as a result of the election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.

Does the Minister accept that these figures are accurate and, as stated in the OECD report, that Australia's funding for education is decreasing more rapidly than most other OECD countries? In view of the Government's stated policy of making Australia the clever country, will the Government increase education funding to a level commensurate with this goal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1185" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three parts to Senator Macklin's question. In respect of the first part as to whether I am aware of OECD figures, I say that I am.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in response to the second part of his question it should be acknowledged and recognised, as it is in the community, that international comparisons of education systems and expenditures are a public issue and will be for some time. Included in the debate are various claims and counterclaims about Australia's comparative position. The Government has cautioned-I think others have accepted the caution-about the validity of such comparisons for a range of reasons. There are, of course, particular problems relating to interpreting a particular country's statistics. In order to do so properly, one has to look at the particular education systems, the legislation involved and, of course, the social context in which the systems operate.</PARA>
<PARA> Those sorts of localised problems have immediate impact when applied to the definitions used by international bodies such as the OECD or the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). For instance, Australia, in trying to respond to the UNESCO and OECD questionnaires, sometimes has been forced to fit within the definitions which those organisations apply. We presume that other countries have similar sorts of problems. But we are forced to fit within those definitions because of the peculiarities of our educational, legislative and social context.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point to make about the OECD comparison is that the figures leave very little room for qualitative assessments, especially regarding the efficiency and output of the education systems. It may well be-and Senator Macklin might acknowledge this-that the Australian education system is relatively efficient in comparison with some systems overseas. We may be getting better value for our money, but one really cannot make a clear assessment of that on the basis of the raw figures produced by the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it should be acknowledged that these figures also show the comparison between money spent on education by both public and private institutions. When we break down the figures and focus on the figures relating, for instance, to public expenditure, we find that in Australia the bulk of education expenditure is in the public sector. Internationally, Australia compares quite well. Publicly we spend at levels which approach that of France and which are greater than that of Japan and the United States of America, which puts us in the high range in terms of public expenditure on education internationally.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the start, this issue has been the concern of public debate for some time. As a response to that and to see what further comparisons can be made on this level, the Department of Education, Employment and Training has commissioned a series of case studies to look at individual countries and to see whether appropriate comparisons can be made. Already there have been studies on the Unites States of America, Canada and Japan but, in the assessment of those studies, one has to take into account the different contextual situations which we find. Speaking indirectly on the point of Senator Macklin's third question, which relates to the Government's stated policy of making Australia the clever country, I think our record of public expenditure stands very well internationally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I take the Minister's point about the difficulty of international comparisons. The point I raised is that Australia's expenditure on education is decreasing more rapidly than that of other countries. If the Minister wishes to talk only about government expenditure, the OECD 1986-87 figures put us at 5.3 per cent. The latest available figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics put us at 4.9 per cent. In other words, we are still decreasing our level of education expenditure each year. Is the Government in this area not responsible for the decreasing level of expenditure on education? This does not stand with its stated policy at the last election of developing a `clever country'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To give a comprehensive answer to that point, I made the point earlier about the difficulty in making international comparisons. Senator Macklin then rightly went to comparisons within Australia. It is probably important to note three specific commitments of this Government over a short period in terms of education, particularly higher education, expenditure. For instance, by 1992 the Government will be spending something like $3.6 billion in the higher education area alone, which is $1.6 billion more than was spent in 1988. That in itself is a massive increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of higher education research, which cannot be divorced from education and from the ultimate target of making Australia a clever country, an extra $144m will be provided by 1992, with $1 billion to be allocated through the Australian Research Council over the next five years. That is a very strong commitment. Of course, $100m funding per year of cooperative research centres within the next five years is also a very strong commitment towards providing more funds and resources for the ultimate goal of raising education levels in this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain what the British Government has looked at in recent times, but it is clear that it is probably the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working group report that was released in the last couple of weeks. The IPCC process has been going on now for a couple of years and is quite crucial to what happens with the reaction of the whole world, not just Australia, on this question of global warming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole report from the International Panel on Climate Change will be available in July, so it can be discussed at length at the second world climate conference in November. The working group 1, which is assessing the science of the greenhouse effect and trying to advise on its likelihood and strength, met during May in the United Kingdom. It comprises some of the most eminent scientists around the world. Australia was represented by some people from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology, and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. We have been a particularly good contributor to this, especially since the Government's initiatives last year announced by the Prime Minister for increased funding for our greenhouse studies.</PARA>
<PARA> I will just go through a couple of the main points of the executive summary of that working group. First off, the IPCC has concluded that the greenhouse effect is real, contrary to the notions of Senator Stone and some others in this place over time. It believes that man-made emissions will certainly lead to a warming of the earth's surface. The rate of expected increase of global mean temperature during the next century will be about 0.3 degrees celsius per decade. That will be greater than has been seen over the previous 10,000 years. By the year 2025, global mean temperatures will have risen about one degree above the present value, and three degrees before the end of the next century, although regional changes will not mean that every area will be exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA> The sea level is expected to rise about 20 centimetres by the year 2030 and 65 centimetres by the end of the next century due to the expansion of the oceans and some melting of ice. Those predictions are not in line with some of the doomsday predictions of recent times; nonetheless, they would be very serious indeed for a whole range of communities around the world and would have serious implications for Australia as well.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to global warming over the last 100 years, the science is inconclusive, as far as the IPCC is concerned, to estimate how much of that has been due to man-made greenhouse gases. It is concluded that rapid changes in climate will change the composition of ecosystems; some will benefit, and some will not. I only hope that Australia can fare well in those regional changes.</PARA>
<PARA> The IPCC estimates that stabilising the atmospheric concentration of the really long-lived greenhouse gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons, carbon dioxide, or nitrous oxide, at present levels would require reductions in man-made emissions of 60 per cent. For methane it would be a 15 to 20 per cent reduction.</PARA>
<PARA> These are enormous figures. They give us some idea of just how big a problem the world has to wrestle with over the course of the next few years. Australia will continue its efforts at the IPCC and will be studying this report in some detail and, come the second world climate conference in November, I hope that Australia can put up the strongest position possible and urge upon the world a responsible attitude.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling may be referring to a number of incidents and reports. I think most recent reports indicate that there may be more people coming to Australia primarily through Cambodia, which is the location that Senator Tambling refers to. Those reports have been around for some little while. It is also fair, in the total context, to acknowledge that at least three boats from Cambodia have recently arrived in various locations in Indonesia. The Government's information is that there have been encouraging reports that people on these three particular boats may be transferred to the holding centre on Galang Island. The Australian Government would hope that, in the interests of life and safety, the Indonesian Government would hold these, and any such other arrivals, in its territory. As recently as 3 May, the Indonesian Foreign Minister announced that Indonesia would continue to accept Vietnamese asylum claimants. The Minister indicates that a distinction is not being made between the treatment of Vietnamese and Cambodians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government is well aware of the serious pressure on Indonesia from growing numbers of Indo-Chinese asylum claimants. The population has already soared to 11,000, including several hundred Cambodians. In recognition of these particular pressures, the Australian Government provided $1.5m to Indonesia in late March to upgrade its camp facilities on Galang. Since then, there have been a number of senior official exchanges between Australia and Indonesia about the transit of Cambodian boats. These discussions are, in fact, going on.</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the Cambodians themselves are expressing a determination to reach Australia. If this, then, is the case, it raises certain questions about their profile. To the extent that the Cambodians represent themselves as asylum seekers, the basis of their claim being a fear of their situation in their home country-asylum is essentially about flight to find a safe haven, not about shopping around for a preferred country in which to resettle-what they have done, in terms of getting to Australia, will obviously have to be taken into account.</PARA>

I think we all believe that the provision of electricity is an act of economic necessity. I did have a look at plans for the Tully-Millstream proposal in the middle of last year, and certainly the Queensland Electricity Commission has made a real effort to have the two endangered species concerned protected if the plan goes ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, there needs to be a proper assessment of the kind of effect it can have on values. To that end, prior to the election I had been speaking with the Premier of Queensland about the Queensland inquiry and its term of reference. If my memory serves me correctly, the Premier had agreed that an assessment would be done on the power needs of Queensland to see whether this dam was an necessity as well as assessing the kind of environmental damage it would have. The Commonwealth awaits the report from Queensland on those matters, and we will assess it when it gets here.</PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that in the World Heritage area nothing can take the place of this dimension without Commonwealth approval, and obviously the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, will be having a very great close look at that report from the Queensland Government when it comes in.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of projects on the drawing board within the World Heritage area. Whether it is 22 or not I am not sure, but I will find out. With regard to what we are doing about the management of the area, there was an agreement on funds and staffing which the Prime Minister announced during the campaign. That was the culmination of some negotiations that I had been having over the previous three months. As to what has happened since then between Mrs Kelly and the Queensland Government as regards the timing of the introduction of a new authority, I am not certain, but I will endeavour to let Senator Dunn know tomorrow. However, my feeling is that the authority will be up and running in a very short space of time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to say that I have just recently become aware, only a few minutes ago, of the use by the Western Australian Electoral Commission of the system of notional distribution of preferences for minor parties and independents for the election on the weekend-which, as has been made perfectly clear by Senator Crichton-Browne, we won. In the form that the distribution was used it gave a very clear and early outcome indication and also gave an indication of the swing quite early. I am not sure whether this was able to be used in Western Australia because of the actual application of its Electoral Act or because of administrative procedures, but it is obviously going to be an important consideration in terms of assessing the Western Australian exercise. It is an exercise which does appear to have been successful, to the extent that it gave a very clear and early indication of the result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objective in any electoral process is to ensure the good conduct of the ballot and to do so as efficiently as possible. I suppose the ultimate aim is to meet the interests and needs of the electorate. In that context I will draw to the attention of the Australian Electoral Commission the experience of the Western Australian Electoral Commission and its use of notional distribution and ask it to have a look at the way it is operating in Western Australia, and also to advise me whether such distribution is possible within the Electoral Act in Western Australia or within the Australian Electoral Act, or whether it may need legislative change to be adopted federally.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also say that before the Government will make any real assessment on this particular issue the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will, I anticipate, be looking at the election and all the problems in the way it was run-and, at the same time, at the efficiencies in the way it was run. I am sure that, given the degree of correspondence I have had on this particular issue and verbal representations, this will be one of the matters considered by the Joint Standing Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> In summation, it seems to have been a very useful and efficient exercise. We need to have a look at it through the appropriate mechanisms federally to see whether it can apply on a national level.</PARA>

This will give rise to a blending of the State and Commonwealth tribunals, a greater degree of flexibility between both and a cutting down of the shopping between Federal or State jurisdictions from the point of view of trying to develop leapfrogging patterns on awards.

What are the prospects of these two items maintaining their export levels in future months, particularly as the Government has now demolished the wool export market by speculating about and now promising a price fall? I refer the Minister to his recent remarks at question time that he hoped the downward trend in the deficit would continue. What exports will increase in coming months sufficient to offset the record level of income debits of $1.9m in April, mainly our interest bill, which is steadily rising?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a convention in this place against picking winners. Let me say that I am not in a position to say what export sectors will remain strong or strengthen when one has the degree of specific identification of those areas which is implicit in Senator Michael Baume's question. There is no reason why the metals exports should not continue strongly, looking at international prices.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just uranium; it is metals generally. I would hope that the wool performance, which is up $100m-not an enormous figure in terms of wool exports-would be considerably enhanced if the present contretemps between the Australian Wool Corporation and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So in both of those areas I would hope that that performance would continue. The performance in manufacturing exports has not been good since January, but it is still 11 per cent higher than in the three months to April compared with the same period in 1989, which in turn is encouraging. Having said that, I am not about the process of identifying particular areas of exports which are likely to be successful in terms of this year's aggregated current account figure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister, but I draw his attention to the fact that far from the April wool figure being a modest one in terms of total figures, as he claimed, in fact it represents something like a 40 per cent increase. It is the highest figure since last October for wool exports and I ask him whether he expects that figure to be maintained or not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be a 40 per cent increase on the previous month's performance, but in terms of the total wool exports out of this country it is a small amount. That is why I referred to the current floor price issue and the necessary resolution of that issue if we are to get back to the sort of performance in terms of wool exports which we have had in this country over a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is always a trap in these questions, if I might say so, to relate one month's figures to another and not look at the broader picture. For example, if one looks at the imports in this recent current account figure for the month of April, one sees that there was at least one large aircraft in the import figures and in the declining imports of something of the order of 13 per cent-as I recall it; I do not have the figures in front of me-that is important because that is a very big item on any Australian monthly import Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 May Senator Coulter asked a question about the Ozone Protection Act. I indicated at the time that I would be able to respond about the Act after checking with the Minister. The Act does two things: it enables the Government to adhere to the Montreal Protocol and it provides for bans on the manufacture and import of a number of products which use chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Schedule 4 of the Act invokes these bans, which go well beyond the Protocol. The ban on aerosols, for example, immediately reduced the use of CFCs in this country by 30 per cent. We can be proud of this achievement not only because we are one of the few countries that have done this, but also because it was done with the agreement of Australian industry. I am sure that Senator Coulter would be interested to hear that the corporations power of the Constitution have enabled these bans to be put into place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other arm of the Government's efforts to save the ozone layer is the national ozone protection strategy, developed with the States and Territories. The Act and the strategy together will see a 95 per cent reduction in the use of CFCs by 1995. Whilst the State governments have an important role in implementing the strategy, the Commonwealth is preparing regulations which implement various recommendations in this unique document. The drafting of these regulations is at an advanced stage and I expect them to be tabled during the next session. For Senator Coulter's interest, I have been informed that an Australian delegate at the recent meeting reviewing the Montreal Protocol commented that many countries are using the Australian strategy as a bible. Australia is the only English speaking country with such an advanced CFC phase-out strategy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased that this report Small Country: Big Science has come down. I am impressed with its great title and the great thought behind it, but I am afraid that it will not make much of a splash. After years of decline, this recommendation will not turn the corner. Science in Australia is still in a terrible mess and a terrible depression by comparison with the other countries with whom we do business. The proposition as put forward in this report is a very tiny step in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's actions in the last month or two have shown that it has at last realised that something needs to be done. But it really is very little in an area of such great importance. We had seven long years of Minister Jones doing all he could to win over his colleagues, but he was unsuccessful. It is fair to say that no Minister has ever tried so hard and got so little or been knocked back so often as Barry Jones was while he was Minister for Science. Seeding a project such as this will get us nowhere unless we follow it through with appropriate research and development. That is very difficult. I will read a short piece of a letter that appeared in the Bulletin of 28 November 1989. Under the heading `Why be a scientist?' a scientist wrote about the future for scientists in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government and BHP cannot understand why the ranks of scientists is depleted and continually in decline. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to talk about three graduates who were involved:</PARA>
<PARA>Scientist A. Honours degree. Offer 12-18 months tenure for each position-</PARA>
<PARA>these were the three positions available at the time-</PARA>
<PARA>Salary $17-19,000. </PARA>
<PARA>If we intend paying them that much, we will get as many scientists as we are currently getting. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Gardener outside the window, with no qualifications, was earning $24,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The same scientist, while waiting for his interview and hopeful position, was earning $30,000 as a brickie's labourer. The next scientist gave up in the end and became a teacher. The third scientist, with degrees in botany, zoology and geology, was offered positions with a salary level of $16,000 to $18,000 for a 12 to 18 month tenure only. In the meantime she worked in a secretarial office on a salary of $22,000. Is it any wonder that we have trouble getting scientists? None at all. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we treat our scientific industries? Again, I suppose the best way to see that is to look at what our competitors do. I have two comparisons regarding scientists in other countries. One comes from an article in Newsreview on 21 October 1989 entitled `W26 Trillion set aside to boost High-Tech Industries' in Korea. The Australian equivalent of 26 trillion won is about $38 billion. The Korean Government has decided that if Korea is to be competitive in the world, it has to gear up its industries. In the fields of microelectronics, mechatronics, new materials, fine chemicals, bioengineering, optics and aerospace, the Korean Government has decided that it will spend the equivalent of $38 billion-W26 trillion-on establishing those industries over a five-year period. What are we going to do?</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative is what Taiwan is doing. Taiwan has decided that if it is to proceed, it too will need to develop scientific industries. To assist in that, first there will be a five-year tax holiday once a company's profits start flowing. Money will be provided at rates lower than even the modest 9 per cent or 10 per cent charged on bank loans. There will be a cash award for new equipment development in the park. There will be no need for companies to spend valuable capital on land and buildings; these will be provided on a rental basis. Entrepreneurs with advanced technical qualifications, but who lack capital, will be able to use their experience and knowledge as collateral for up to 25 per cent of the loans. What do we do in such circumstances? We do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is necessary for our Government to follow up this report with another saying what will happen later, and a further one to say what research and development will be available to get up industries with qualified people who are able to settle in Australia and able to look at a future in the technical area for years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, Small Country-Big Science, makes certain recommendations in relation to the funding of what, by any standards, would be regarded as fundamental science-$2.7m to buy a portion of the synchroton light source in Japan and thus get access to that facility for our scientists; $3.75m for the ILL facility at Grenoble in France, which is 1.5 per cent of its annual operating budget; and finally, $1.98m for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research facility, the so-called CERN facility, in Geneva, Switzerland. While I accept entirely what Senator Archer said about the poor quality of funding which this Government has given to research, particularly fundamental research, I would like to emphasise that latter point. In this country we are still finding overemphasis on the so-called applied research, on those things which will be profitable in the short run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am reminded that we have just passed the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of penicillin. Some honourable senators may have heard on the Science Show last Saturday a recording made by Sir Howard Florey, a graduate of the Adelaide medical school, in which he recounted the details of that discovery in the early 1940s. He pointed out that the research team were not in any way attempting to help humanity; they were merely interested in a very intriguing phenomenon-namely, that certain substances made by moulds were able to inhibit the growth and survival of bacteria. The fact that that turned out to be incredibly valuable and produced a range of antibiotics which is probably the most widely used range of antibiotics in the world now was almost incidental. </PARA>
<PARA> What really drives science is the inquisitive nature of scientists to find out more about the world around us. In that sense, it is heartening to find the Australian Science and Technology Council recommending support for what, by any standards, would be regarded as fundamental science. In doing that, inevitably, one will come up with applications for that science, although that is not the thing which motivates the scientists in the first instance. On page 15 of the report we find a description of the ability to investigate, through some of these synchrotron techniques, the structure of partially stabilised zirconia and other ceramics, which have been developed by the Division of Materials, Science and Technology of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Melbourne. It is extremely useful in finding out something about the structure of these ceramics. Again, one finds that CSIRO has pursued research work on these ceramics because of their interesting physical property as ceramics. But quite incidentally, serendipitously, CSIRO has discovered that zirconia materials are extremely useful in the manufacture of fuel cells. It is depressing to find that having discovered that, there seems to be very little support from government for the further development of that very exciting research work. The fuel cell being developed by CSIRO would be capable of using gaseous fuels such as methane-substantially reducing greenhouse gases-would double the efficiency with which chemical energy is turned into electricity, and would substantially address many of the major problems that we face today. Yet CSIRO, looking for a mere $10m to $15m over the next six to seven years, cannot find that sort of money from this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few further remarks in relation to the second round of 3 per cent award negotiations which are currently before the Industrial Relations Commission. I think I have already pointed out that a number of substantial defects have been assessed by very many of the major players but, of course, these have not been recognised by the trade union movement or by the Government to date. In this context I quote one comment by Mr Eric Mayer of the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd which I think is particularly pertinent in this respect. In the Business Council of Australia Bulletin in November last year, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Across the board increases in occupational superannuation, including for employees already well covered, would make little sense. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet that is precisely what the Government is proposing to do at the present time. In other words, it is advocating arbitrary, automatic, across-the-board increases which simply ignore capacity to pay and are likely to result in employers scaling down where they already, in some instances, have very generous arrangements in place. We do not think that that serves anyone's purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply make clear our position regarding the current award-based superannuation schemes. The coalition is not against award-based superannuation but we do oppose, however, the totally arbitrary nature of across-the-board increases in superannuation payments as decided by the Industrial Relations Commission. We regard that as a denial of freedom of choice which has a particularly deleterious impact on small business. We oppose the second round of 3 per cent payments because we believe it would not fairly represent the circumstances and capacity of each individual enterprise and industry to pay, especially the 700,000 small businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We adhere to that view, and I now espouse the approach suggested by Mercer Campbell Cook and Knight, who are undoubtedly the experts in this field, being the world's largest employee benefits, compensation and human resource consultancy. Without doubt their view is listened to more than any other in the industry. The key recommendation that they have made states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that any award should simply specify the minimum superannuation benefit which must be provided by an employer for those covered by the award. Where the employer is already providing a benefit at or above this level, there will be no need to do anything more. This will ensure any second round concentrates on providing better benefits for those who currently have little or no superannuation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>That strikes me as eminently sensible and, I would have thought, unarguable logic-except that there is another agenda being pursued by the Government. It is well known that there have been several notorious comments made in this regard that have sent shivers down the spine of many who are seeking to achieve an equitable scheme. Mr Howe, the former Minister for Social Security, made it fairly clear what he had in mind when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The investment strategies of superannuation funds would be the political issue of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>This was given full force by the Treasurer's remarks to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Council. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the trade unions at any time are placed in a hostile political environment they will face it not only with their negotiating power in the labour market, they will face it being a significant controlling element in that $600 billion of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the projected savings for the year 2000. That makes it crystal clear that what the Treasurer and the Government have in mind is that superannuation will become the biggest political weapon of all. If that is to be the case, very strict constraints ought to be placed on the ability of the union movement in this respect. We deplore the approach of the Industrial Relations Commission of simply taking the view, as it did recently, that somehow it is not appropriate to allow control of these funds to be left in the private sector because that might somehow encourage market forces. We think that is the high watermark of our concerns because it clearly demonstrates that industry awards are likely to be used for political purposes and that there is a great deal of scope for abuse. We believe that there ought to be freedom of choice in this area. One hopes that the Government will recognise that quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly think that more employees should be invited to join the boards of superannuation funds. It is quite clear that whoever is in charge is going to exercise immense power. That power ought to be exercised democratically and not collegiately, as the ACTU would want to have it at present. There is tremendous potential for abuse and we believe that the remarks of Mr Keating and Mr Howe can only encourage the irresponsible elements to believe that this provides a political market opportunity rather than a responsible economic opportunity to properly control the funds of all workers. </PARA>
<PARA> We take the view that this package of Bills, including the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill, heralds a new era, but also provides a great many challenges, many of which have not been met by the present Government and which I suspect, for political reasons, will continue to be unmet. That will be a tragedy for Australia. We will continue to be one of those very few countries that are prepared to provide lump sums instead of pensions. Whilst we have that sort of irresponsibility prevailing it is quite unlikely that we are going to have the sorts of policies in place that this country needs. I will give one final example. The second reading speech which was recently circulated to replace the one that went out in November last says that the Government's view is that pensions and annuities should be encouraged. In November last it was said that they were to be the preferred form of benefits. This is a very significant change. I hope that the Government will recognise that it is going down the wrong track in that and a number of other areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a number of pieces of legislation in a cognate debate on superannuation which flow from Government decisions in the Budget last year to again change the superannuation structure in a number of areas but particularly in the Public Service. Superannuation has become, in Australia's understanding of retirement, a matter of high profile and it is receiving far more recognition than it has hitherto. This is probably because of Government decisions and the following through of those decisions by various industrial tribunals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal with superannuation as part of an overall wage package. Flowing from that is the 3 per cent productivity benefit. There has been an attempt by the Government to heighten recognition within the general community of superannuation being part of that overall wage package and that is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional operation of superannuation in Australia has been one of male-dominated, high income-dominated access. It was not considered that superannuation was part of the normal expectation of the ordinary worker in the Australian community. It was considered in many ways an additional perk for those on high incomes with everyone else in the community receiving their retirement income by way of a pension. There has been a change in this general view because of the Government's move with regard to the 3 per cent productivity benefit, but I do not believe that the debate has gone far enough. The anomalies that come from our historical treatment of retirement income have not been ironed out. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular packages in relation to the Public Service show how one group of people can be targeted and dealt with in a reasonably straightforward way because the Government holds all the reins. But even in these circumstances, upon retirement these people can be caught up in the general context. I will address my remarks to this general context first. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of view of people receiving a pension and looking at retirement incomes across the board would be to say that they are badly done by for a number of reasons, one being that it has taken so long for Australian to get the pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings for retirees existing solely on a pension, and that 30 per cent should have been reached a long time ago in keeping with many of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries with which we like to align ourselves. They would also point to the taxation treatment of superannuation and say that a vast amount of money is lost to revenue because it is taken by people on superannuation who get a significant benefit over and above those who exist only on a pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of view of people on superannuation would be that they have spend their entire working life-as have those on a pension-paying income tax and yet when they get to retirement they do not receive a pension. They have had to look after themselves while those other people have been able to rush off and spend their money as they worked and at the end of their working life draw their pension totally out of the taxation pool. </PARA>
<PARA> If we consider pensions as a percentage of income tax-here I refer not only to pensions paid to aged people but also those paid to those on veterans' pensions-we are looking at between 20 and 25 per cent of all income tax receipts being necessary to support the pension payout. In a way, people could say that 25 per cent of their income is spent on providing pensions, and yet because they are superannuants-because they have looked after themselves all their working lives-they do not get a pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that, depending on which perspective one takes-that of a pension or of a superannuant-both those groups feel badly done by and, in a sense, both of them are. We have allowed anomalies to develop. These are historical anomalies and I do not blame the Government for them. But the Government has been in office since 1983 and it does not seem any further advanced in getting a unified retirement scheme in place. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been various attempts-and I am pleased to see that in recent years the private sector has made a number of attempts of its own-to put forward a reasonable and unified retirement incomes proposition. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which was chaired by Senator Zakharov, put down on excellent report in this place in 1988 but, unfortunately, except for one or two of its recommendations, it was again politely ignored by the Government. There is some excellent material in that particular report, and some excellent arguments put forward. One of the Committee's proposals to which I would like to draw attention is the long term reform option for a two-tiered aged pension system, in which that Committee seeks to marry the two systems which are currently in operation. Of course, the Government in its last Budget made a number of propositions about the taxation treatment of superannuation. It may be heading towards a unified system but, if it is, the Government has not let either this Parliament or the community in on the secret. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not yet know where all of these changes are heading. I believe that the Government would be well served-as would the community-by setting out a longer term framework in which these various changes are taking place. The changes have been large, they have been continuous, and they have been massively disruptive to people who are trying to organise for their retirement; yet no-one in this community knows where they are going, how they are going to be integrated and where they will end up. I think it is reasonable to ask a Government which has been in office for so long to provide to the community a unified retirement policy. It ought to provide to the community a program of changes over time and the end goal that it hopes to reach. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying that it will be able to reach that within the term of this Parliament, the next, or even the one after, because changes to these areas will take a significant amount of time. Indeed, this particular report suggests that the minimum amount of time that would be necessary for such changes would be 10 years. I think that is certainly a minimum. I believe, in terms of the types of changes which would be necessary to marry these two systems together in any adequate way, that the minimum time needed would probably be more like 20 years. To undertake such a change is, in Australia's political context, very difficult. We have three-year parliamentary terms, and we have changes of government-we have not seen one for a little while, but probably at the next election we will see one of those. In those circumstances it is not very difficult for any government to ask, `How can we plan something for 20 years time?'</PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is an option, and it is for us now, in this first year of the new Parliament, to start a community debate, hopefully moving towards consensus between all political parties, on the broad outlines of the way we want to go. I think that the basis for this particular debate surely must be income support for the retired and the aged, which was the subject of the Senate Committee report brought down here in 1988. It is a very good basis for that particular debate to take place. Unfortunately, as I say, a vast amount of that work has either been politely ignored or, simply, totally ignored by the Government and its bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Government itself has not seen fit to table a program of how these things may be married together. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee's proposal, which I think is a good starting point, looks at the notion of the two-tiered system-that is, a universal pension payment. That universal pension payment would not be means tested and would be untaxed. It would be dealt with, as it were, as an entitlement payment arising out of taxation paid in over one's working life. That particular item would be the same for men and women; it would be based on the same retirement age and it would be a universal payment, paid to everyone regardless of their working history or circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be set-and I believe that the Australian community would want it to be set-at a level which enabled a person to live. It would not be generous-Australia would never be able to afford that; it would be nice if we could-but it would be a basic payment which would enable us to ensure that people would not be living in poverty, that they would have sufficient income to be able to eat and to clothe and house themselves in a way that our community expects. This community must never allow-though other communities with which we like to align ourselves have allowed it-any citizen to live in poverty. Unfortunately, we have done that. We have not significantly eroded the possibility of avoiding the worst excesses of countries such as the United States of America and Great Britain. We are in a far better position to deal with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee goes on to rehearse the notion that following on from that basic universal pension, set at a modest level to alleviate poverty-that would be the level of necessity, as it were-there would be a second top-up level, which would be a discretionary level, available from superannuation. That would be treated as a taxable level. It would be treated in a way that meant that, depending on how much one wished to put away through one's working life, one would be provided with the ability to maintain a standard of living commensurate with what one would wish. That would be a discretionary exercise-an exercise by which one would deny oneself a certain amount of one's income throughout one's working life in order to provide for the other end. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, to enable that to work the taxation treatment must be fair and reasonable. I believe-although it is not rehearsed in the Committee's report-that we have tended to treat this in a very odd fashion. We have looked at the taxation treatment when a person receives superannuation, and I believe that the taxation treatment of superannuation ought to apply when one is paying in, not when one is taking out. The reason for that is that one is in a far better position when one is working to afford to pay the tax than one is when one is retired. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, changes in taxation treatment over time impact very heavily on people who are in retirement, who are unable at that stage to rearrange their income to be able to deal with the changing taxation treatment. I think it is a far more equitable, a far more reasonable and, in fact, a far more humanly possible operation to deal with the taxation treatment of superannuation on the payment going in rather than the payment coming out. I believe if we did that, people heading towards retirement would be able to predict much better what it is they are heading towards and could make greater allowances-and would be enticed to make greater allowances-for their retirement. Of course, the taxation treatment we have opted for over the entire period in which we have been taxing superannuation-not only under this Government but also previous governments-is to look at it as a payment coming out rather than a payment going in. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem we are facing in terms of the integration of the retirement incomes systems is that we really have not addressed this area as an overall policy goal in this country and we have been left with the piecemeal exercise we are confronting today, not only in these pieces of legislation but also in other pieces of superannuation legislation which will be coming down in the Budget session and, indeed, which we had in the previous Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the exercise is one in which we have to do a lot of things in the taxation system to get people enticed into the exercise. A predictable marrying of the pension and superannuation and predictable taxation treatment would go a long way to putting to Australians that it is in their interests to look at the topping-up exercise so that they then would become responsible for the standard of living that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, from the point of view of the Medicare levy-which is able to be identified as a specific levy and which is then able to be linked via that specific levy to the outcome-if the community in general wishes for a better medical service, it can say, `We want a rise in that Medicare levy'. In other words, it cannot get something for nothing. The beauty of that is that the levy is directed quite specifically towards the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, we often receive a lot of letters dealing with the levy that was started in the late 1940s. It was eventually done away with as a levy in the 1950s and, in fact, legislated out of existence two or three years ago by this Parliament. A lot of people who write to us know when it came in but do not remember it going out. It would be very useful if that exercise were started again. It is not necessarily economically efficient-which is the reason we finally abolished it-but it is good from the point of view of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA> A pension levy specifically designated as such, at whatever level, says to the general community, `This is the amount of money that goes out of your pay-packets every week to provide for pensions'. Any government which did that now without regularising the end product would be doing what in Yes, Minister is called making a courageous decision. It certainly would direct the attention of the Australian population to the very large percentage of their weekly pay-packets which provides for the pension. Yet a very large number of people are ruled ineligible for a pension because they have made other arrangements or are compelled-as in this legislation, which makes it compulsory for public servants-to contribute more. </PARA>
<PARA> By failing to unify these systems we have given rise to an enormous amount of public concern that people are being short-changed, cheated, and compelled, as in the case of the Public Service, to contribute to something to which they are already contributing. They then lose out in benefits which other people receive and which their tax pays for. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension system in Australia has not been a funded one; I am not necessarily suggesting that it should be. But I believe that it could be a system whereby we are able to specify the amount that is required each year from income tax to be paid for the purposes of supporting whatever pension system we believe in. I do not think it is necessary to have a funded pension system. I do not subscribe to the doomsday demographic theory that we are about to become a country in which only people over 65 live and in which there will not be anyone around to pay for their pensions. A closer reading of the demographics shows that in about the year 2020 we will be slowly approaching a stage that Europe passed through about six or seven years ago. It has been able to cope; we will be able to cope. So I am not putting forward a doomsday theory. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the unrest, concern and enormous amount of noise in the retirement income area is due almost solely to the fact that the Government has failed to state where it wishes to head over time. What does the Government believe will be the retirement income policy situation in the next 10 to 20 years? Why has the Government failed to state this? I hope that the new Ministers, who have combined responsibility for this area, believe that it is part of their policy brief to say to Australians `In 10 or 20 years we believe this is where we'll be heading'. I freely acknowledge-and I believe that anybody who knows anything in this area has to acknowledge-that to change retirement income practices is massively complex and difficult, but that does not necessarily mean that we should not point towards where we want to go and where the various changes are heading. </PARA>
<PARA> Are the changes piecemeal? Is this whole exercise being driven by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and not by the responsible Ministers? What goes on in Cabinet? Who takes the submissions about every one of these changes? Do they come from the responsible Minister or are they simple a revenue measure? Is there a little group over in Treasury that runs all this policy? Does not the vast bureaucracy, which supports the responsible Ministers, have a fresh idea to put to the responsible Ministers about where we should be heading or what we should be doing? From the point of view of public debate, I believe that we need at least one of the responsible Ministers to take this thing by the neck and give it a good shake-to be willing to get out there and generate a public debate about this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not denying that it is matter for the Treasury. There are enormous financial implications in any change that takes place in this area. It is an extraordinarily costly area, and every change has massive implications for revenue and for the way taxation is dealt with. Obviously, the Treasury will have a very large input. But that is not all. We also have to look at policy. For example, in Singapore people pay a significant portion of their income to support their retirement. A number of years ago a policy decision was made to allow people to take out of that retirement income package a significant proportion on the proviso that that money be used now for housing. That is an interesting idea. It is an interesting policy. We could look at how the policy is developing in Singapore, at whether it is a good idea. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering our interest in Australia in and public support for housing as part of our lifestyle, to look at Singapore is an excellent idea. But we cannot do that because we do not have any government or anyone at all willing to stand up and say, `This is where I believe we should be going; this is the overall objective that we should be moving towards'. The private sector has started to do that. What is the Government's ultimate objective? Instead of outlining this, Bill after Bill comes into this place tinkering here, tinkering there, moving a bit of tax around, shoving this aside and changing that. From the point of view of public policy, it is unsatisfactory; from the point of view of retirees, it is totally unsatisfactory; from the point of view of those people who are trying to plan for their retirement, and who want to know where all of this is going and how they should decide, it is absolutely impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> When the statement was introduced by the Government in the Budget session last year, Senator Janine Haines indicated on behalf of the Australian Democrats that we would be supporting these changes. We do support them. We believe that the package deals with a problem area that had to be tackled. I think that the overall compromise that has been reached between the Government, the public sector unions, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other negotiating groups is a good one. There are elements within it which some groups are not happy with but in terms of the compromises that are necessary in any of these areas as an overall package I think that it hits the mark. Some significant benefits are provided for the public sector and, in terms of the difficulty that Australia is heading toward by way of public sector remuneration, the changes make eminent sense. </PARA>
<PARA> A popular Australian pastime is attacking the bureaucracy-that probably goes along with the popular pastime of attacking politicians-but if we are going to be able to provide a proper standard of advice to government, proper administration by government and proper accountability by government to the Parliament, we will have to have top quality people in our public sector. The public sector is out of kilter with the private sector. The difficulty in dealing with that matter has been borne in on all honourable senators over the last year and a half. I know that it would have been borne in on certain Ministers who have to try to negotiate their way around the current impasse. This superannuation exercise is part of the overall package that we now believe is necessary. The idea of income is not simply what income a person receives in his pay packet every second Thursday in the Public Service, but rather the total remuneration over a work period. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this has been a good exercise. Unfortunately it has one aspect that I think is taking us in the wrong direction, and that is the lump sum preference that certainly appears very strongly in this legislation. I have talked to individuals in the community about where they would prefer us to go and they have said that they prefer the lump sum payout. I am not saying that the Government is not taking on board what its clients are interested in. However, I am concerned, from the point of view of public policy, that we should be setting up a mechanism, suggesting that it might become a pacer, which is heading in direct contradiction to where we need to be going in terms of a unified policy structure. Whether people like it or not, the pension option is the only viable economic option for Australia in the long term. We cannot deal with a unified system which has as its first preference a lump sum payout. It is just not possible. It might be nice; it would be lovely if we could actually do it. But it is not economically feasible or possible to set down a unified system that has that as its major exercise. We constantly have to get out into the community and win the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the major issue I wish to raise in this second reading debate: unless there is in the Government's mind-hopefully this is shared with the electorate-a unified retirement income program that will require all of us to deal with this issue over time, then we cannot get out there and argue to the people why we need a pension option instead of a lump sum option. Unless the Government provides this as part of the public debate, I think we will lose constantly on this exercise in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed us on two grounds: firstly, the public policy option has not been articulated and debated; and, secondly, in this flagship, as it were, it has gone for the soft option-the lump sum. I think that will come back on us in the next 10 or 15 years and we will rue the day that we allowed this to occur. I do not think there is any other way of doing this at the moment because of the failure of the Government to win the rather broader public debate of the pension option. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will leave the contentious issue-I believe that there are very serious anomalies that should be corrected-until the arrival of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). In the meantime I ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), who is at the table, to pass on my remarks. The last time the Government introduced extensive amendments to superannuation schemes, it drew the lines of definition for superannuation funds, pooled superannuation trusts and approved deposit funds (ADFs) and imposed a set of conditions which were based on whether they were complying or non-complying funds. The level of compliance with those conditions exposes such schemes to certain levels of tax. We understood that the basic reasons for the underlying conditions would not change, but in the legislation before us today the Government introduces a new element of uncertainty that will fundamentally change the status, particularly of ADFs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments at that time also covered the entry to superannuation funds and withdrawals on retirement or early withdrawals. The position was either exempting or subjecting certain payments to various levels of tax. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC), which was the regulatory body, had the responsibility of formulating regulations to meet these new statutory obligations. We have no problem with that at all. After the last round of changes to the superannuation legislation and regulations about two years ago, I remind the Government that the Treasurer, Paul Keating stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Together, these changes complete the Government's review of superannuation tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> People can therefore plan for their retirement with complete certainty and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very clear statement to the Australian people. This is the finality, apart from finetuning. We have before us today something which goes well beyond finetuning so that, in spite of this, changes to superannuation laws continue unabated. So far there is no such thing as complete certainty or confidence in retirement planning. The sooner this Government settles on a retirement incomes policy for this country, the sooner the country will reap the benefits of such a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate today covers four Bills, the Superannuation Bill 1990, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Bill 1990 and the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill 1990. I think it is a pity that these Bills are being dealt with cognately. As Senator Macklin said, he ran out of time in dealing with the extensive changes that are being made. In the space of 30 minutes we are dealing with major changes to Commonwealth superannuation and to reasonable benefits legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Three of these Bills resulted from a review of the current Commonwealth superannuation scheme. The other Bill refers to reasonable benefit limits. The Superannuation Bill 1990 introduces a new Commonwealth superannuation scheme for most Commonwealth employees from 1 July 1990. While I support the principles on which this Bill is based-that is, that Commonwealth employees should have the same regulations and restrictions as the rest of the work force-I believe it is hypocritical of this Government to introduce lump sum superannuation arrangements for its own employees but at the same time promote pension-type schemes for the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Less than two years ago during the extensive parliamentary debate on superannuation Bills, Ministers repeatedly expressed their disgust at double dipping. By double dipping I am referring to the practice of lump sum payments being taken by retirees, they then spending their money, and at a later time taking a pension benefit from the Government. If the Government were not just giving lip service to the double dipping problem but instead wanted to address this situation, it would not have drafted this legislation which allows Commonwealth employees to take all benefits in a lump sum form and thus ignore the recommendations from the social security review unit and others. The Government is introducing legislation that runs counter to its philosophy and to what it said two years ago in trying to force the private sector into pension-type schemes, contrary to what the social security review unit and others said. That is quite hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government stands condemned on three counts for the way and the manner in which it has drafted this legislation. The social security review unit said that at least half of all the supportive benefits should emerge in pension form. We agree with that; it is quite reasonable. But no-the Government has chose the other route. We admit, however, that there is a generous conversion in the scheme for a lump sum to a pension. But the fundamental structure of the scheme is wrong because it is geared to a lump sum rather than a pension scheme. In other words, it is structured to the wrong goals. </PARA>
<PARA> While undoubtedly popular with the unions, the Government's approach goes against the thrust of what we refer to as a responsible retirement incomes policy which ought to promote increased reliance on a guaranteed stream of earnings in lieu of the aged pension. The Minister for Social Security would be acutely aware of the need to follow this dictum. </PARA>
<PARA> Public servants who have a second income and are in a position to make a higher contribution levy to the fund are also in some circumstances-and this is an anomaly because the Government is not treating everybody as equal-able to lift their contribution from 2 per cent to about 10 per cent and get a better benefit. What could be more inequitable than not to treat everybody in the Public Service on a like basis, simply because some are born with a silver spoon in their mouths and others are not so well off? Some people can get some extra benefits in the form of a retirement benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say, at this time, that I welcome the presence in the chamber of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, who has the ability to acknowledge some anomalies in this legislation and, hopefully, he will do something about them. It is wrong in principle that not all people are treated equitably. I endorse the amendment to be moved by my colleague Senator Alston that seeks to lift the minimum rate from 2 to 5 per cent. This amendment tends to ameliorate some of the criticism that I have put. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government to remove the iniquitous tax on superannuation contributions. Entry to a superannuation fund, in terms of payments coming from the employer, now attracts a tax of 15 per cent. If that were changed and the income of the fund were taxed, additional funds would be released for investment which this country desperately needs. This would also release thousands of people associated with the administration and collection of this money. Superannuation administration would be much more cost effective, provided that we adjusted the tax on the incomes of the funds. So what we are putting forward is a mechanism not to reduce the total tax collections but to make sure that this process is administratively much more cost-effective and efficient. This arrangement would certainly produce a simpler and fairer scheme which would make superannuation much more attractive and would increase the level of savings. </PARA>
<PARA> On a much more positive note, I am pleased to see that there will now be a major improvement in what we term resignation benefits, particularly in light of the fact that two-thirds of members of the current scheme receive no employer benefits because they resign before entitlement. I think this is quite iniquitous. Similarly, the aligning of the invalidity benefits more closely to age retirement benefits, plus the establishment of a Commonwealth Superannuation Board, will hopefully reduce the invalidity rates of the current scheme from their unacceptably high levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Invalidity rates for Commonwealth employees are presently five to 10 times that of the private sector. If this mechanism that we are putting in place today does not work, I appeal to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to ensure that the scheme receives further attention and further revision at an early opportunity. After all, one of the major selling planks of the new scheme is that it will cut out this high invalidity rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also approve of the substantial elimination of significant indirect discriminations against women under the present system. I note that the Minister for Finance has qualified the amount of elimination. I would also suggest that unless all discriminations are eliminated, female Commonwealth employees will not be in a fund that has the same regulations and restrictions as the rest of the work force, and the principle will not be met. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a matter raised by my colleague, David Connolly, who was the former Liberal shadow Minister for social security and retirement income. Commenting on womens' superannuation in the publication Securitas, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's attempt to overcome the major discrimination against women in regard to Superannuation is unlikely to be successful because it only covers women who work for at least 10 hours per week and does not offer proposals such as retirement savings accounts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators might recall that this was a proposal put forward by the Opposition, designed to encourage such women to move into superannuation. It provides a simple mechanism which will assist people in their retirement. In other words, the Government expects women, who are disadvantaged people in terms of the superannuation arrangements which currently exist, to use conventional methods of superannuation which have proved inadequate in the past. There have to be innovative changes. We have to recognise a situation where women can leave the work force after two or three years. At the present time, husbands do not receive tax deductions for contributing to their wives' superannuation in such circumstances. This is a matter that needs to be acknowledged. The only women who will benefit from the proposals that the Government is putting forward are those women with professional qualifications on a relatively high income. The vast majority of working women will gain nothing from Labor's alleged reforms. So women on low incomes-say of $15,000-certainly will be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 makes a number of changes to various superannuation Acts to reflect the changes associated with the proposed introduction of this new Commonwealth scheme. I note the comments made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to the effect that clause 39 contains numerous examples of sexist language and, in its view, this is inappropriate and, accordingly, the provisions should be redrafted. Again, the government of the day has failed to acknowledge the major recommendations of an important committee which has a majority of government members. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the amendment which will be moved by my colleague Senator Alston. Whilst welcoming the opening up of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust to competition and allowing it to compete in the open market by providing investment services, we have to limit the authority to the funds of Commonwealth, State and territorial bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to raise some major problems, commencing with proposed new section 15f of the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill. We have major problems in that superannuation funds are dealt with differently compared with approved deposit funds. It seems outrageous that a superannuation fund can be fined or receive a penalty of up to $15,000 yet an ADF does not attract that same penalty. Rather, an ADF's status can be changed from that of a complying fund to that of a non-complying fund and the people who would have been victims are beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Minister that the simple way is to have equality. If people are in a superannuation fund they must be subject to the same traumas as those who are in an ADF. Similarly, if the Government wants to put a $15,000 penalty on the superannuation company, why does the Government not apply that same penalty to the administrator of the ADF, the trustees of the ADF or the fund itself? But, for heaven's sake, do not take away its status. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government introduced this notion of complying and non-complying funds and ADFs two years ago, it gave us an assurance that there would be no fundamental change from the underlying conditions or status of these respective bodies, and there was a long debate about it. We need to be able to plan for people's future security and long-term operations, and here, less than two years on, the Government is introducing a destabilising element to the basic concept of complying and non-complying funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is so important that I will go through the relevant proposed new sections 15f, 15g and 15s just in case we do not have time later. We are quite prepared to delay the committee stage of this debate so that this matter can be examined and rectified. We are quite happy for the Government to bring the matter forward as its amendment. We should delay the committee stage of this debate so that the Government can take further advice to ensure that we deal fairly and equitably with all classes of people where they happen to invest in superannuation funds vis-a-vis ADFs. Honourable senators should not tell me that people have more opportunity to avoid the law, et cetera, in one as compared with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> We appeal to the Government to delay the committee stage of this debate in order that it can go back and discuss the matter with the ISC, the Taxation Office and others to ensure a better basis for inflicting a penalty than exists in this legislation. Honourable senators should not come back in two years and say, `It was an unintended consequence; we will adjust it by a miscellaneous statute law provision or something else', because in the meantime the Government will have done a lot of damage to a lot of people and a lot of funds. We have got to get it right, and we have got to do it now. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement is to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of amounts held by individual members at 15 April 1990, and the information is to be provided within such reasonable period after 1 July 1990 as is prescribed in such form as is approved in writing by the Commissioner. Penalties apply for failure to advise. So the industry is in the dark as to what and exactly when the information is to be supplied. For a life office, the penalty is $15,000 for failure to comply. The ADF will lose its concessional tax status and become a non-complying fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Under proposed new section 15g the payers of ETPs, which are eligible termination payments, and pensions are to provide certain information to the ISC within the lodgment period. Again, penalties apply for failure to advise. The penalty for failure for a life office is $3,000. It can go up to $15,000 under the Crimes Act. However, the failure of a superannuation fund or ADF to comply will make them non-complying, which is unduly harsh and unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> Under proposed new section 15s the excessive proportion of an annuity or pension can be commuted within one month after receiving advice from the ISC. So will the commutation be able to be made by life offices or the fund? The life offices are liable to a penalty of $15,000. Once again, the fund becomes non-complying. All members of a superannuation fund are penalised which, again, just seems quite unreasonable. Apply the penalty to administrators and trustees, but do not change the status from a complying to a non-complying fund, thus altering one of the essential tenets of this distinction which the Government introduced only two years ago and which was supposed to be fixed in concrete at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1967. I have already referred to some problems I have seen with the Bill in relation to reasonable benefits. We are not opposed to the thrust of what the Government is putting forward. In fact, we have just received some amendments. These amendments seem to be in order, except that we are a bit surprised at the wording in relation to the identity of a person. The word `or' is used instead of `and', but perhaps the Government will take that on board and give us the reason for that unusual distinction. So we basically support the Bill, with the reservations that I have put forward, together with the amendments that Senator Alston has moved in order to overcome some of the unusual or worst features of that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation and the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner previously restricted the benefits that could be provided by superannuation Bills, and the effect of this Bill will be the establishment on 1 July 1990 of reasonable benefit limits as to the amount of benefits a person is permitted to receive on a concessional tax basis. Previously, it was the maximum amount that could be paid out of a superannuation fund. So there is a fundamental shift, which appears reasonable to us. So with very limited exceptions, the reasonable benefit limits will apply to all concessional tax benefits regardless of whether those benefits are provided by public or private sector sources, whether they are provided by superannuation funds, roll-over funds or employers, and whether they are funded or unfunded. We are attracted to that, because everybody is being treated equitably. It is, therefore, all the more unusual to find the circumstances in proposed sections 15f, 15g and 15s when the Government is trying to get this sort of uniformity across the board and all the more surprising that the Government has come up with a lump sum scheme rather than a pension scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation funds will be permitted to pay out higher amounts of benefits provided that amounts in excess of the limits are included in a person's taxable income and are taxed at the appropriate marginal tax rate. So these changes are designed to redress the longstanding inequity of private sector superannuation benefits being subject to limits while public sector benefits were exempt-again, a commendable approach and one that is overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> So we support the Government's decision to calculate reasonable benefits limits on the basis of the highest average salary over any three years before retirement rather than the average of the last three years, because a person in those last three years might not necessarily be in his peak earning performance. In latter years he could be phasing down his responsibilities in the organisation with a view to somebody else taking over. I believe that this will encourage people to stay in the work force longer and gradually reduce their work commitments while at the same time giving the benefit of their experience rather than to retire in their mid-50s when they feel that their earning potential has peaked. </PARA>
<PARA> So providers of concessional tax benefits will be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of the prescribed details of benefits provided to individuals, and we have no objection to this. But we object to the penalties that apply in terms of the distinction between the different sorts of funds. I think that we have put a reasonable case to the Government to amend the legislation before it is too late and gets set in concrete and while the House of Representatives has time to consider this on Thursday or Friday and send it back to the Senate, at which time we will have a complete, tight package rather than the thing strung over for two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA> So the ISC will be required to determine the amount of the benefit paid to the person that is within the reasonable benefit limits and the amount of the benefit. There is no problem if any are in excess of the limits prescribed under the regulations. To assist the Commissioner to administer the limits effectively, the Bill proposes that, where a person is paid a benefit subject to the reasonable benefit limits, that person be permitted to provide his or her tax file number for forwarding to the Commissioner. There will be no compulsion to provide the tax file number, but where it is not provided the benefit will be reduced because there will be a requirement to deduct tax from the benefit at the top marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Provided the ISC is satisfied that such a requirement does not breach the principle of 1 (a) (i) in terms of the reference and does not unduly trespass on individual rights and liberties, the coalition basically supports the provisions within this Bill. In relation to the changeover from one system to another, the word `change' has already spread to many constituents who have made retirement plans under the previous law and now have to face another set of laws. In fact, many representations were made to my office. I believe that the Government's change of date from 15 August to 15 February is a welcome one and will satisfy a lot of people who had deferred their retirement and suddenly got caught with this date of 15 August, finding themselves up for additional tax. I am pleased that at least the Government recognises the strength of the representations that were made to it about the need to change this date, given the assurances that were previously made when people who delayed their retirement suddenly got caught as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the objective of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, in reforming the retirement income policy as per the four Bills that are before us today is to significantly increase the role that occupational superannuation plays in Australia's retirement income arrangements. That raises an interesting point. Whilst the pressure is being placed on moving savings away from banks and into life assurance offices, it does seem surprising to see the Treasurer's changing approach, for example, in disallowing the merger between National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The Government is forcing the mode of changing in Australia, which will eventually put a lot of pressure on mutual life offices because of their lack of a capital base and will tend to send the banks overseas for expansion rather than within the Australian area. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, superannuation has become another maze for a public to find its way through. We have a plethora of rules and regulations which has resulted in a system which is now so complicated that it is beyond the range of ordinary John Citizen to comprehend. Australians are increasingly being forced to rely on superannuation advice from the advisers within the market. In many cases they do not know until they retire, until it is too late to do anything about it. Unfortunately, these regular changes that we are having to superannuation legislation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson finished his speech by talking about what he regarded as the strategy behind this legislation. I commend him for that because the strategy behind it, although it involves change, is important. I want to deal with one or two of the issues that have been raised in speeches by Opposition senators in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Senator Macklin's qualification with regard to paragraph (c) of the amendment to the second reading motion moved by the Opposition, let me say that my present understanding is that there is no double standard in preferring pensions in the private sector and lump sum payments in the public sector. As I understand it, the majority of private sector schemes provide lump sums. What the Government is doing here is no different from what a very wide range of private sector schemes do. If what I have just said is incorrect in any way, I certainly hope I will get a note from the advisers on my left which tells me that I am wrong, but I do not think I am wrong. If that is so, the third paragraph is incorrect. Senator Macklin, who does not agree with paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Opposition's amendment, will be relieved of the burden that he currently has in respect of paragraph (c). </PARA>
<PARA> It has been claimed that the change in respect of the Commonwealth legislation to a lump sum scheme is inconsistent with a sensible retirement income policy. As I understand it, there has been a dramatic growth in deposits with approved deposit funds and annuities in recent years, which suggests that lump sums are considered an important vehicle in terms of making provision for retirement. Certainly, it is the Government's view that lump sums are a legitimate form of retirement benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The question one would ask rhetorically is: why should Commonwealth employees be denied the opportunity to take their benefits in a lump sum form, because lump sums give the employees much greater flexibility to arrange their affairs in a manner which suits their particular needs? The current pension scheme for Commonwealth employees means that the employee who supports parents, brothers, sisters or adult children cannot always make adequate provision for those dependants in the event of his or her death. Simply stated, a lump sum scheme will enable the Commonwealth to match the benefits being offered in the private sector, thereby enabling the Commonwealth to attract and retain competent staff. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the retention and attraction of competent staff to the Commonwealth Public Service, there is no doubt just from the public debate-certainly there is no doubt in my mind as a Minister-that that has been an enormously difficult task in the last few years because, amongst other things, of the very high salaries offered in the private sector, salaries which often go with so-called packages which include superannuation benefits. The Government's policy is to permit lump sums but to encourage pension benefits at the same time. This new scheme is consistent with that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the scheme has a very attractive pension option as well. The subsidy in the pension option for those retiring early is greater than the subsidy at older ages, thereby giving more encouragement or incentive to early retirees to take pensions. For example, if a member converts at least half of his or her benefit to a pension then he or she gets the advantage of the higher reasonable benefits limits that apply in such cases. The possibility of lump sums being dissipated has been incorporated into the costings of the current new schemes. Of course, the Government has had to be concerned about the question of costs-that there be no increase in net Commonwealth superannuation costs. The new arrangements meet this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme also enables members to contribute between 2 and 10 per cent of salary according to their financial circumstances from time to time. This was another issue raised in the course of the debate. The Opposition suggested that employees might contribute only at the minimum rate of 2 per cent of salary throughout their membership. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme design provides for a greater subsidy for the employer as the member increases his or her contribution. That is an inbuilt incentive in terms of the level of the employer contribution and an incentive to the employee to increase his or her contribution. This encourages members to increase their contribution when financial circumstances permit. It also enables those who leave the work force for a time, for example, women raising a family, to be able to achieve adequate benefits from shorter service. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be greater counselling under the new scheme which will advise members of the advantage of contributing more towards their retirement. This is considered purely as a supplementary mechanism. After all, it was Senator Watson who made the point that these things were difficult for people to understand. It is a very appropriate area for counselling, in addition to the various incentives which are built in to the system in terms of contribution levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators made remarks about expanding the charter of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. The Government considers that that is necessary. For example, a range of government business enterprises which currently have employees in the Commonwealth scheme are setting up their own schemes. Telecom Australia is the largest example, and it will be setting up its own scheme from 1 July 1990. Australia Post will also have its own scheme. The Trust will have to compete with the private sector for the investment of the schemes being set up by these government business enterprises. The Trust will face further competitive pressure in five years time when it loses its statutory monopoly over the Commonwealth scheme. The Trust needs a wider client base if it is to be able to meet this competition. Without the capacity of the Trust to compete for private sector funds it faces increased risks of managing a declining fund. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not in this area. A declining fund reduces the capacity to spread the risk and allocate assets optimally across sectors. If the Trust is restrained in its capacity to compete, as has been implicitly suggested by some contributors to the debate, and fund performance is worsened, there will be a direct adverse effect on the 100,000 employees expected to remain in the current scheme after the changes to which I referred a minute or two ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new Commonwealth scheme pays a guaranteed pre-defined benefit and any underperformance by the Trust will mean that taxpayers will have to pick up the extra cost. That is the reason for the need to expand the charter of the Trust and place it in a more competitive environment. If performance is adversely affected, subsequent broadening of the Trust charter may be too little, too late, and the damage may be irretrievable. Without mentioning specific examples, that is something which other governments in other jurisdictions, as it were, have found to their cost in recent years with some of their own schemes-not necessarily with superannuation schemes, but honourable senators will use their imagination and know what I mean. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Commonwealth superannuation scheme represents a significant step forward in superannuation for Commonwealth employees. It provides additional flexibility; it makes membership available to all Commonwealth employees; it makes an equitable contribution to the retirement of all employees according to their service in the Commonwealth; and, importantly, it puts Commonwealth employees on the same footing as their private sector and State counterparts. That seems to be a matter about which there is some misinformation leading to dispute as to the facts, but in the Government's view that is beyond doubt. Moreover, the proposed new scheme will cost the Australian taxpayer no more in net terms for existing employees than the current arrangements, with longer term savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Opposition senators deplored the Government's support for a second 3 per cent superannuation benefit-that is, of course, referred to in the second reading amendment-and claimed that the Government had double standards on lump sums and pensions. That is referred to in paragraph (c) of the second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to end with political point-scoring on these issues, but let me make the point that in all the years that the coalition was in government nothing was done to encourage the provision of superannuation for ordinary citizens in this community or to ensure that superannuation benefits were used for retirement. I guess the problems associated with a relatively ageing population have come into sharper focus in recent years. For anybody with any long term informed view of the matter, that knowledge was available at least a decade ago. Under the present Government the opportunity to receive superannuation has been made available to most members of the work force. The self-employed have been encouraged to make provision for their retirement and that encouragement has led to increased provision. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been mechanisms put in place to enable employees changing their jobs to preserve their superannuation benefits and these are being used for genuine retirement. Pension and annuity benefits have been encouraged without removing the free choice to take lump sums, which is something that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. Higher reasonable benefit limits have been made to apply where at least half of the benefits are taken as pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson raised what was, for me, a rather technical question about the higher reasonable benefit limits legislation and I will try to obtain an answer for him as soon as I can. I think there is an answer but perhaps I should not try to articulate it without help. I appreciate that it was a serious point. Finally, under this Government lump sum benefits are now taxed on a comparable basis to superannuation pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, while outwardly espousing pensions, still talks about removing the tax on lump sum payments. But there is equity in the superannuation pension treatment that has now been there for some time. So the Opposition talks about the ageing of the population, implies a need for greater superannuation coverage and criticises Government support for the next round of 3 per cent superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of the Opposition's second reading amendment, which talks about double standards, I think could be applied to paragraph (b) of its amendment as well. There will always be opposition from one quarter or another to benefits flowing to the work force. There is no opposition from thoughtful employers to benefits flowing to the work force in this way, rather than benefits which flow straight into the effects of the wages system on the levels of inflation which are, as the Opposition always points out, somewhat higher than we would like them to be in this country at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken longer than I normally would. I will try to obtain an answer to Senator Watson's particular questions relating to the fourth Bill. The Government rejects the second reading amendment because we do not think it is right. In terms of paragraphs (a) and (b) we do not think it is sensible. With respect to paragraph (c), we think it is wrong. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>Page 82, The Schedule, Part 3, Division 1, rule 3.1.2, Rate of contributions, leave out ``that is not less than 2 per cent, and not more than 10 per cent, of the fortnightly contribution salary applicable to the person. The member may'', insert:</PARA>

<PARA>The member may, subject to this rule,''. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential proposition is that the Government has previously had a Commonwealth superannuation scheme which provided for a minimum-and, indeed, a maximum-employee contribution of 5 per cent. We take the view that in certain circumstances that has been an arbitrary figure, but nonetheless it has been very desirable that there should be a significant minimum level of contribution on the part of employees. The rationale put forward for this more flexible approach, so described, is that representations are received from time to time by employees who argue that because of their present financial circumstances, it is somewhat difficult to maintain that level of contribution and therefore they ought to be given the opportunity to scale down in some circumstances and to scale up at a later time when it suits them. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) rightly pointed out, there is a built-in incentive to keep the contribution as high as possible because that will determine the level of support that it attracts from the employer. Nonetheless, if the overall objective is to come out at the end of the day with a reasonable figure of about $175,000-plus, it is necessary for the employee contribution to average at least 5 per cent over that employee's working life and, indeed, probably in combination with the employer contribution, to get up around the 12 or 13 per cent mark. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern is that if we allow people to contribute only 2 per cent, there will be an irresistible temptation to come down to that figure, because of the exigencies of life and what seems to be an immediate crisis, and once the crisis has passed there will still be reasons for staying at that lower level. People do not tend to review their superannuation contributions on a monthly or even yearly basis; they turn their minds to it very occasionally, fix on a percentage and leave it in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button and the Government might argue that there is plenty of scope for counselling, but I think it would be a very cost-ineffective way of doing business if we are going to have to contact 150,000 Commonwealth employees on a regular basis-in particular, those who have scaled down to something around the 2 or 3 per cent mark-and then call them in for an interview and try to persuade them that they ought to do the right thing by themselves and their families and go up a bit as circumstances dictate. All of that is very messy and likely to be ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> We take the view that the rate ought to be a minimum of 5 per cent. That has not worked a great degree of hardship, I would have thought, in the past under the present Commonwealth scheme. There may well be means by which the Public Service Union or others might be able to accommodate those who have genuine emergency situations, and maybe there should be scope in the legislation to countenance that sort of discretion. But to allow a blanket reduction to 2 per cent whenever people feel like it is inviting people to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we think there is a very real prospect, with this degree of flexibility, that people will not average the 5 per cent plus over their working lives but will simply take it in the form of a current wage increase. After all, this was the selling point to the Australian Council of Trade Unions in many respects-that if people were allowed to come down by the 3 per cent, then they would be much more attracted to it. Undoubtedly the attractiveness lies in that very proposition-that they will see the opportunity to reduce their payments, to therefore have more discretionary or disposable income in hand and, presumably, feel that they are somewhat better off in the short term. We all know how people's short term horizons tend to dominate the long term. There is no reason to imagine that this will be the grand exception simply because the Government or the Opposition might wish it to be otherwise. Human nature, I think, very much suggests that people will find all sorts of plausible reasons to justify contributing only that lesser figure. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore think that if people are on about a responsible retirement incomes policy in the public sector, when we have moved dramatically away from the former compulsion to taking at least a proportion as a pension, the very least we ought to be doing is retaining that compulsion in terms of a respectable minimum contribution. Accordingly we therefore move the amendment, which has been circulated in the name of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I had pointed that out before and I was not quite sure what the Opposition was up to, but that clarifies the situation. Basically we are trying to make a distinction in (a) and (b) between permanent and temporary. On that basis, that we are trying to draw that distinction between the permanent employees who are compelled to be part of the scheme and temporary employees who may elect to be part of the scheme, I believe that we need the flexibility in both areas. In fact, I think it is an interesting method and approach that does enable people at earlier stages of their employment to scale down their contribution because of mortgage payments, children's schooling fees and other costs that are likely to occur at the earlier stages of one's employment. But at the later stages of one's employment one obviously would want to scale it up. I think people will take the opportunity to vary their contribution over time. I think that they should. I think it is a very useful approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Basically Senator Alston is saying that if in fact we give people this particular option, they will go down to the 2 per cent with a bang, stay there and not move at all. That may happen, for a number of reasons. Then again, it may not. I suppose we have to look at this particular pie by eating it to see what occurs. Even if it pans out as Senator Alston has suggested, we have to be be careful as to whether or not in those circumstances people necessarily have made less contribution for their retirement. They may be contributing in other ways to their own retirement. It does not necessarily follow that because they are not in this scheme, they may not be seeking other types of investments. Those other investments may be more profitable for the person concerned. I believe that the higher amounts are likely to come in as soon as a person has a disposable income. The point mentioned by Senator Button in his contribution at the end of the second reading debate is important, which is that when a person actually raises his or her percentage, the Public Service-I do not know who the employer actually is; possibly the Public Service Commission or someone who is designated the employer--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will stay with that as I was on safe ground at that particular stage. The employer, in fact, then also raises the amount paid in. So there is a very real incentive for people to raise their contributions from 2 per cent to 5 per cent or possibly to 10 per cent once they have the disposable income to do so. I imagine that hitting the 10 per cent level is not likely to occur until well into a person's working life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also somewhat concerned in terms of the distinction drawn between permanent and temporary workers. Within the permanent exercise we have permanent part-time and permanent full-time employees. I am glad that the Opposition has not sought to make a distinction between full-time and part-time employees but only between permanent and temporary employees. In terms of the temporary category, we can have a temporary part-time or a temporary full-time employee. I would not wish, in any way, to seek to make a distinction between these people in terms of what they might be able to do. In fact, there has been an anomaly for a long period against temporary employees, particularly those who have been employed full time over a long period but as temporary employees. For example many people who are now at retiring age have never been able to get into a superannuation fund. I point, for example, to quite a number of the people who are engaged in the Commonwealth car pool. Many of those have only in recent times been able to come into any fund because, for some arcane reason within the Public Service, they have all been designated as temporary, despite the fact that they have been employed full-time-some of them have driven cars for 30 years. Hence, they are in a very real way disadvantaged at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we treat those temporary people in the same way, as though they had made an election to enter the scheme and the election had been accepted in terms of the rules set down in this particular scheme. They have been employed for over three months and I think we should welcome them into the scheme on exactly the same grounds as permanent employees. I think that by making a distinction between these two groups we could unwittingly put in the way of temporary employees some disincentive to so elect. I am certain this is no part of Senator Alston's argument as he did not raise this point at all and I do not think that Senator Alston wants to do that. Certainly by his remarks I took him as saying the opposite. But I am worried that that may occur. </PARA>
<PARA> But on the grounds that, firstly, I do not see a reason for making a distinction between permanent and temporary employees and I do not think that Senator Alston has spelt out a reason why we ought to make that distinction, and secondly, because there may be some disincentive put in the way of temporary people electing to come into the scheme, I think that we should give the proposition a chance to operate. At a later stage, if the take-up by those who are able to take it up is less than satisfactory, I am quite sure that the Government, in terms of its own monitoring, will look at it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this has probably been argued in terms of that total package that I spoke about during the second reading stage. I think it should be left that way and, in terms of consultations that I have had with the various unions, it is certainly very much their desire on behalf of their own members that it should be left that way. I think that they have good arguments to leave it there. I do not see the argument on the other side as compelling and, hence, I will not be supporting this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal briefly with a couple of remarks made by Senator Macklin. We distinguish between full-time and part-time employees on the basis that those in part-time employment may well have more pressures or more obligations placed upon them and may not be able to structure their contributions in the way that permanent employees are able to do. I will look at the arithmetic to demonstrate why we think that it is unlikely that, having gone down to the lower level, someone will turn around and go to the higher level. Average earnings I think are about $27,000, but let us say that someone is earning $30,000. The contribution of 2 per cent of that amount would be $12 a week. If it were to be 10 per cent, it would be $48 a week. There is a very significant difference between those two amounts and I find it difficult to imagine that anyone would voluntarily come to the judgment that he or she should turn around and contribute an extra $36 a week simply because, some years down the track, he or she might reap a greater benefit as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The overwhelming temptation is likely to be, as I suppose 90 per cent of the community find, that, as people's expenditure patterns exceed their incomes, at the best of times there is always a good reason why they are not able to save a bit more. We want to encourage savings and we want to do it in such a way as to ensure that people come out at the other end with a decent level of provision for their retirement. We believe that that gap is simply too great and that, as such, it is not likely to induce people, having fallen to the 2 per cent contribution rate, to raise it to anywhere near the 10 per cent at any particular time in their lives because there will always be a reason why they cannot afford to do it at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that $12 a week from salary of $30,000 is a fairly small contribution to make. Conversely, the gap between $12 a week and $48 a week can be quite significant. It certainly involves some level of sacrifice and, unless someone is persuaded to make that sacrifice, in a sense almost beyond their inclinations, it is highly unlikely that that person will do it voluntarily. That is why we think the Government has simply taken the easy way out. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to hear what Senator Macklin said in his closing comments about the unions being strongly opposed to it. The reason why the unions are strongly opposed to it is that by being part of the wage-tax trade-off and in exchange for their getting, thanks to this Government over the last seven years, a continually declining standard of living and, therefore, a reduction in their real wages, they will be able to pick up an extra 3 per cent virtually for nothing because the 5 per cent that they were previously contributing can now become 2 per cent. So if they are short of a quid or they want to somehow justify getting into this deal in the first place, this is the way they will do it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that they are very keen on the 2 per cent rate because that is the way they will go. That is what their employee members have been told they can do. It does not strike me that there is any built-in responsibility in that sort of proposition. If the overwhelming proportion of the public sector are permanent full time employees, they are the ones who will be scaling down and who will not be maintaining that necessary average over time. The part time employees-although I suppose their numbers are increasing-nonetheless constitute a relatively small proportion of the work force and we are prepared to allow them that additional flexibility because, by definition, they cannot predict their working patterns and the demands placed upon their incomes in the way that permanent full time employees can. But if we are expecting some measures of responsibility-in a sense, it is implicit in the minimum 2 per cent contribution rate that the Government expects them to have a certain level of responsibility for their futures-we do not see why that level of responsibility ought not to be one at which they will be able to come out at the other end with the sort of money that the Government says is necessary in the first place. </PARA>

I am not sure that we know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This scheme is designed to have some flexibility, and that flexibility is designed to be influenced by the incentives to which I referred to earlier in terms of the employer contribution. As Senator Macklin put it-I quite agree with him-people should live in a democracy, and the question is how guided it ought to be. As individuals, people will have the ability, particularly if they are low income earners, to adjust contributions to other financial commitments such as young families or mortgages at appropriate times in their lives. I would have thought that by and large, public servants, in spite of the somewhat derogatory remarks made about counselling earlier on, are in a better position to do this than most people in the private sector. I think superannuation has always been a consideration in public sector employment. Public sector employees are probably more aware and astute about the issues which concern their through-life incomes and superannuation than many in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> So the amendment is not acceptable. It is, in our view, too rigid and not justified by the arguments which have been put forward. </PARA>

<PARA>The undersigned contributors of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme hereby respectfully petition and request the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund to distribute a RESERVES of $428 million to contributors (including contributors who have resigned since the announcement of the 1988 review of the fund) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Actual payment of entitlement to contributors who have resigned since the announcement of the 1988 review. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Actual payment of entitlement to contributors who resign in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Notional distribution to all members transferring to the new fund as at 1st July 1990 for the purpose of calculating contributor equity holding in the fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The undersigned indicate that they deplore any attempt to:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Deprive contributors of rightful allocation of their funds. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Deprive resigning contributors of their former and rightful benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Those petitions are signed by quite a large number of people. They are petitions which were not addressed to the President and the Senate, but I think it is appropriate for them to be brought to the attention of the Committee at this stage. It does appear, as indicated in the letters that have been received by honourable senators, that there is quite a deal of concern about the proposed treatment of the reserve of $428m held back by the fund administrators from distribution to members on the division of the fund under the new arrangements proposed by the Government. A reserve of that magnitude has been set aside as:</PARA>
<PARA>a `cushion reserve' to artificially bolster the earning rate of the Fund in times when it is not as it should be. It could therefore be used to hide administrative ineptitude as well as raise the earning rate in time of economic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from the letter that was sent to me and I believe to some other senators:</PARA>
<PARA>The creation of the reserve has been at the expense of current members and will be used to benefit future members. The funds administrators have `robbed Peter to pay Paul'. This situation is clearly grossly inequitable. The reserve is currently approximately 8 per cent of the value of the members holding in the Fund. This means that some long standing members of the Fund could have a stake of between $6,000-$8,000 in the reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> This inequity will be exacerbated on the creation of the five new funds as spin-offs from the Main Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that the reserve will be distributed between the funds on a pro-rata basis. This will clearly be inequitable because each member's stake in the reserve is a unique sum attributable only to each member and will be a different unique sum for each individual-not an average struck by an all embracing averaging calculation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the reserve were to be transferred it would carry elements belonging to members of the old Fund. If a large number of older members chose to remain in the `old' Fund they would be subsidising the reserve amounts transferred to the `new' funds. </PARA>
<PARA>This, the elector says, is outright robbery. On the face of it, it does appear to be such. It appears to be utilising the contributions of people over many years, to their ultimate detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> I was wondering whether there is an answer which the Government may wish to place before the Committee at this stage. I assume that the Government is well aware of the concerns that have been expressed by persons who have petitioned the superannuation fund. I do hope that the Government might be able either now in the committee stage of this Bill, or indeed in the committee stage of subsequent Bills, to outline its view on the subject and to allay the concerns of those who have expressed them to a number of honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I can probably help Senator Harradine. The policy in respect of the reserve was reviewed in 1988. At that time private sector actuaries provided advice about the policy and the amount of reserve. Essentially, the reserve is used to stabilise the earning rate of the funds. If there is no reserve, either the earning rates swing markedly or investment is likely to take place far more conservatively which reduces members' benefits in the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is nothing abnormal about this occurring in the Commonwealth field. Large private sector funds have reserves. The reserve in respect of this Commonwealth scheme has existed either explicitly or implicitly for years.

<PARA> We take the view that there is no particular reason why the Trust ought to have that monopoly now. I have not heard advanced any plausible reasons why there might suddenly be some instability if it were exposed to competition. Indeed, that could be phased in if necessary. I am sure Senator Button could enlighten us as to all the good reasons why the trust needs a five-year break, but to allow it immediately to get into the business of investment and management advice across the board, public and private sectors, domestic and international, seems to us to be a very far-reaching extension of its powers of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, no good reason has been advanced for why the Trust should suddenly be regarded as having that sort of expertise. Undoubtedly, it would be on a learning curve and the justification supposedly is that it needs to have the opportunity to earn more moneys in these areas to compensate for the likely loss of business five years down the track. There are some assumptions built into each of those propositions. The first is that the trust will inevitably lose market share in five years time. I suppose that is overwhelmingly likely, but it does not follow that it will lose it on other than the merits. It is likely that it will lose it because there are better players around with a greater degree of competence and who will therefore be able to put together better deals. If that is the only reason why it will lose market share, it does not deserve any particular protection or special advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Trust is being offered by way of compensation is the ability to roam far and wide here and abroad. I would have thought that if we were interested in ensuring that people stick to their knitting, the last thing we would want to do is encourage a public sector instrumentality to go off and acquire instant expertise around the world. There is no particular reason to suggest that all those markets are not being properly served with the time. It smacks very much of the picking losers mentality which governments, both Federal and State, have adopted in recent times. The rationale of bodies like the Victorian Economic Development Corporation or the Victorian Investment Corporation Ltd, State government insurance offices or other comparable instrumentalities, is always that somehow they need to broaden their base, they need to get into general insurance, they need to try to make a quid on the side and that there is no reason why they ought to be discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent history suggests that there is a very good reason they ought to be discriminated against, if that is what it is. The reason is simply that they lack the competence. They are not exposed to the sorts of commercial pressures which will inevitably drive efficiency in the area.  No-one pretends that the private sector outcome is perfect every time. Of course, there will be failures for all sorts of good and bad reasons, but there is nothing like a bottom line to concentrate one's attention on the real issues. That simply does not apply in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that there was no logical justification for allowing a public sector instrumentality to get out and compete in the wide world unless it was simply to enable it to gain experience. If it then becomes simply another funds manager or investment adviser, we have to ask the question: why is it in the public sector at all? If we are going to be told that this is an interim proposal and that Senator Button for once-I suppose twice if we count the fairly small percentage for the Australian Industry Development Corporation-is about to have a win on the privatisation front, I would be very interested to hear about it, but I am sure we will not be given any such public rationale. Therefore, if we are talking about an instrumentality that will remain indefinitely in public hands I do not understand why it should be given that sort of free kick. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason to suggest that the market is being improperly served at the present time and there is no reason to suggest that those seeking advice will somehow be better off as a result of getting it from SFIT. Therefore, I would argue that it ought not to be going out into that arena at all; it ought to stick to its last. But certainly the felony ought not be compounded by giving it that five-year monopoly holiday at the same time as it has instant access to the rest of the world. We therefore take the view that a one-sided approach is being adopted and that it may be in everyone's best interests if the trust is simply restricted to what it has been doing for a considerable period of time; that is, maintaining its investment and managerial advice to the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> (5.17)-Senator Alston's comments were a wonderful mixture of `sticking to knitting', `staying with one's last', `compounding the felony' and `keeping a level playing field'. I will just stay with one of the analogies, that of the level playing field which, I must admit, I have never been too fond of, considering the fact that they are the ones that always get boggy and that some slope on the playing field is always highly desirable. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune to construct a playing field would know that one with a slope always has a slight advantage with respect to drainage. That is why teams change ends. So the idea of the level playing field has never attracted me much as an analogy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the propositions ought to be looked at; it is a serious point. I sought to discover what precise advantage the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust might have. It is an extraordinarily small one, all things considered. By and large, in terms of overseas equity and a number of other such items on which it may be seeking to give advice, the Trust would not have any advantage because all charges which would be applicable to a private fund would also be applicable to a government fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trust does have some advantages, certainly, with regard to domestic equities because of the stamp duty exemption with regard to a Commonwealth instrumentality. It remains to be seen whether this is the Government's intention or whether the Government has some other view with regard to this particular body. But the stamp duty exemptions which would apply with respect to domestic equity would have to be incredibly small, in any event. On any reasonable estimate, in the period to which we are referring we would not be looking to anything of very great moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A stamp duty exemption would apply when the investment fund gives advice on property. With regard to wholly owned property only-because it does not refer across to share mixes-it is possible that the Trust would be exempted from land tax. There would be the possibility of a stamp duty exemption in rural areas; of course, rural holdings are exempt from land tax. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, a very slight advantage is given to this fund in the way it operates, mainly stemming from a stamp duty exemption. But one has to take into account whether this exemption assists the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust to gain business. As a general rule, those types of exemptions would not be able to be transferred because the client's funds are managed on a discrete basis and hence would not get mixed up in the actual operation of the trust fund. So they would not, as it were, leap across the boundary from the trust fund to the clients' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the assumptions I have just made, the effect of the continuing exemption of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust performance really would be quite immaterial. On the basis of the calculations I have had made, less than 0.1 per cent effect on the rate of return would be based on the current level of funds under management. Consequently, a client would be highly unlikely to select this particular Trust as a fund manager on that basis. The selection of the Trust as a fund manager would be made on a far more substantial basis than that. If any of the funds in which I have money were to make a decision on that basis I would be very upset. One is looking for a far more substantial return. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another concern. Senator Alston's amendments attempt to exclude the fund from seeking this particular business. If it were another matter, Senator Alston and I could well have swapped sides. This could well be characterised as a deregulatory exercise, in which I am normally on the other side. Presumably, Senator Alston ought also to be in support of this deregulatory exercise. I do not support it because of the implications for the taxpayer. Under this new scheme, in relation to the payment of a defined benefit, any underperformance by the Trust represents an additional cost to the taxpayer. The Commonwealth is responsible for the difference between that defined benefit and the sum of the member's contribution plus interest earned thereon by the fund. I hope that that particular fund is a good investor. If it is, then the taxpayer ought to be happy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston referred to the fact that-as we know from the reading of the Bills and the previous exercise we went through here-government business entities will no longer be required to have regard to this Trust to manage their funds. I hope it is such a good fund that it will attract that business, but since many of those government instrumentalities are likely to offer less attractive propositions, it could very well be that it will not. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to be very careful about this exercise. We are moving from a monopolistic situation to a more open one. It is prudent to be conservative and to suggest that we have this additional ability and that we also have a screening off of the fund over the five years. We should allow this fund to operate. We should be prudent in the way we make these types of changes. I hope that at the end of the five years we will see a vigorous Trust which is well able to compete. Until that time I think it is prudent to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also prudent in terms of a reasonable proposition that I will put to Senator Alston: If this fund is out there in the real world that Senator Alston referred to in competition and seeking further income, then it will be in a far better position to engage in that more open market in five years time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is prudent that there be a transition from this type of fund. They have to develop expertise. I remind Senator Alston that they are up against some pretty formidable Australian performers. We are very lucky to have those very good performers-Australian owned mutual companies-that have done exceptionally well in the open marketplace, not only in Australia, where they have somewhat of a captive audience, but also overseas. To be able to compete against those formidable performers will require the acquisition of expertise. That expertise cannot be acquired at the end of five years; it has to be done over time. People have to build up confidence in the operation of the Trust. The Trust has to know what it is doing. Hopefully, when we get to the end of that five-year period this additional income support will have given it that edge so that it can compete. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the Government has operated in a very prudent fashion. It has been mindful of what we are dealing with and mindful of the fact that the taxpayer would have to pick up the bill if we were not doing it. I am not too sure that the trust fund will get too much business in the early years. I hope it does, but I think that the money that will come in will very much go to supporting that acquisition of expertise needed to put it in a position to compete against the private sector in a real way in five years time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to pejoratively put the view, as Senator Alston has. I think the Government has put a reasonable proposition before us. We are prepared to allow it to operate in the way it has been set down. The Government has been mindful of quite a number of factors. All in all, I think it is the best way to go. </PARA>

<PARA> It seems to me that the Government is saying, `We hope it will be able to learn sufficiently over the five-year period to be able to cope when it is exposed to competition down the track'. Implicit in that is the suggestion that it is not coping at the moment and that the beneficiaries in the funds are getting less of a good deal than they ought to be getting. On the merits, the Government would not expect the fund, with its present level of expertise, to be able to provide as good a result as the private funds, but hopefully in five years time, when it has been able to get out there and learn a bit more, it will be able to compete. That strikes me as being a pretty savage indictment of the benefits that will be achieved by all those who have no choice but to reside in the new and the old Commonwealth superannuation schemes. If that is the logic of the argument, it seems to me that those contributors ought to be entitled to get a good deal from day one as those in the government business enterprises (GBEs) presumably will be getting a better deal from day one. Therefore, it is an argument at different levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I throw in just one other matter on which I seek the Minister's comments. The second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Trust will be able to provide investment services on a fee for service basis, either discretely-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that is meant to be spelt `discretely'; if it is I presume it will be done very quietly, which is not the way business is normally attracted in a very competitive area-</PARA>
<PARA>or through unit trusts or other pooled arrangements, for as wide a range of domestic and overseas clients within the public and private sectors as is constitutionally possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister in relation to those last words whether legal advice has been obtained-that is, as to whether there is any constitutional doubt about the ability of this Parliament to provide for the extension of the powers of a public sector entity to give advice with respect to the management, the investment or the management of the investment of any funds or any funds held in trust for the benefit of any other person or body: in other words, absolutely everyone. Is it hinged on the corporations power or is it in some other way not a matter of doubt? It seems to me by including those words `as is constitutionally possible' that there is an implicit concession that there may not be constitutional power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond very briefly. I thought Senator Macklin dealt with most of the points and I certainly spoke on some of these points in my response to the second reading debate so I do not want to indulge in a common practice here of boring people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essential points to make include that, sure, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust will be exposed to further competitive pressures in five years time, when it loses its statutory monopoly over the Commonwealth scheme. As from 1 July, as I pointed out by way of interjection, Telecom Australia and Australia Post will have their own schemes and the Trust will have to compete immediately with the private sector for the investment of the schemes being set up by these government business enterprises (GBEs). </PARA>
<PARA> In that context the Trust needs a period if it is to be able to meet this competition. It needs to widen its claim base. In all fairness, it should be given the opportunity to widen its client base in the marketplace having regard to those circumstances which I have just described. We are putting the Trust on notice that in five years time it must have a capacity to compete for private sector funds, otherwise it will be faced with the risk of managing a declining fund. That is relevant not only to the management fund but also to taxpayers. Those are the main points I would like to make. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing unusual about the behaviour of the private sector in the marketplace. From Senator Alston's former incarnation of shadow Minister for communications he will recognise that a lot of people in the private sector come to Ministers-and undoubtedly Opposition spokesmen-and say something similar to, `Aussat ought to be privatised, but not yet. It should be made a profitable organisation by the Commonwealth before it is privatised'. I know that is not a good analogy in relation to the Trust but it is a precise example of the private sector saying, `Make this a golden cow before we have a look at it'. We are saying that the bronze calf-which is this particular Trust-should be protected intact and have the opportunity to improve and to widen its client base over a period of time, which we think is totally logical. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter to which I have to respond relates to whether legal advice has been obtained about the constitutional power in relation to the wide range of activities-one might call them advisory activities in a generic sense-which the Trust may embark upon. I am advised that legal advice has been obtained and that the provisions are drafted in accordance with that advice. If the Trust or any Commonwealth instrumentality of this kind wants to disallow these State government powers, it cannot be done by overruling, it has to be done by complementary State legislation. That is one aspect of the constitutional problem. On the basis of legal advice, one or two areas of proposed activities of the Trust might have to be tested in relation to private sector participation by the Trust. That is by no means certain. Senator Alston knows what legal opinions are like. As I understand it those areas are at the fringe. The Government will not accept the amendments for the reasons we have indicated on three occasions now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister about just one further matter: why are government business enterprise (GBE) employees to have the opportunity to get better deals than they might otherwise get under the Commonwealth scheme and, conversely, why should public sector employees be forced to a lesser entitlement if that is the likely outcome? One proceeds on the basis that whilst Telecom Australia and Australia Post might be GBEs, they are still in the public sector and this Government has no intention of privatising them. Therefore, Senator Button is talking about two classes of public sector employees. Presumably, there is likely to be a difference in terms of superannuation remuneration or there would be no need to have a separate scheme. Can the Minister please explain why this Government has been prepared to accede to the wishes of Telecom, in particular, which after all has about 85,000 employees, a fair proportion of whom are presently covered by the current scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I guess we can anticipate what will happen in respect of schemes established by Telecom Australia or Australia Post. But Senator Alston says that their employees are all Commonwealth employees, whether they be employed in the Commonwealth Public Service or whether they be employed by Telecom. There is a vast difference between them being employed in the Commonwealth Public Service and being employed in an organisation which the Government has decided ought to operate in a commercial environment. The honourable senator ought to know from his previous experience that the problems of Australia Post and Telecom in the past-certainly as they identify them-would be in saying to governments, `Let us operate commercially. Get the Government out of our hair'. It is not just a question of ownership: it is a question of direction and control and a capacity to operate in a commercial way. That is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> These are commercial enterprises and I cannot say what will happen. If they operate sensibly on a commercial basis, as I believe they have the capacity to do-and they have shown that capacity in some substantial areas of their activity in the last year or two-they will operate and they will establish good schemes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pursue a number of matters that were raised by Senator Harradine. I am concerned about unfairness in the treatment of public servants who have resigned since the review of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme first began. I also refer to the transfer of approximately $428m to the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. To what extent does the component of these reserves relate to current members' contributions? I think there is an inequity here. For example, Senator Button might recall that last year there was a hefty increase in the earnings rate for 1988-89 in respect of the personal contribution of members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, but only a portion of that was transferred to the individual member's benefit account. The excess has been transferred, I understand, to reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that there is a degree of inequity because approximately 4 or 5 per cent should stand to the credit of the continuing members, if that was the proportion of the profit of the continuing members. Some would have resigned a little earlier. It seems somewhat unfair that the full amount of the employee's contribution has not been transferred for the employee's future benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand a proportion of the employer's contribution going to the reserve, but I believe it is manifestly wrong that current members do not get the full entitlement of the transfer of that amount to their future benefit. I ask the Minister what proportion of the $400m-odd in reserves relates to current members as opposed to members who have resigned in the past. I can understand their willingness to transfer lost contributions to the new reserve: what I cannot accept is present members' current contributions actuarial reserve being transferred to the fund. </PARA>

The information these amendments are designed to provide will be used by the ISC in determining whether benefits are within the reasonable benefit limits. The present provisions appear not to be wide enough to allow the prescribing of all the information required for that purpose. I think the amendments are self-explanatory in the context of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I indicate that the Opposition does not oppose these amendments. We have had only a short period of time to look at them, but they seem to be of a technical nature. I take it that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is prepared to give the undertaking that he has apparently already given to Senator Watson in the context of this particular Bill, that he will come back to the Senate, having explored the possibilities of overcoming the apparent disparity between the penalties that attach to certain funds as opposed to approved deposit funds-penalties of $15,000 in one instance and categorisation as non-complying funds in another-which seems to be wholly disproportionate outcomes. I understand that the Minister is prepared to explore that matter further and to report back. On that basis we do not seek to have the committee stage of this Bill postponed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also raise two other matters in the context of clause 12 of the Bill-the regulations. Could the Minister indicate the current state of play in relation to those regulations, which, I understand, the Government believes will be published before 1 July? We seek an assurance in relation to the timetabling of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I turn to what is perhaps a more technical matter in relation to the regulations. I acknowledge the benefit of assistance I have had from certain advisers to the Government in this area. Nonetheless, I think it is important to put on the record what the understandings are likely to be. In relation to people under the age of 50 who are bona fide redundant-it is my understanding that there will be grandfathering in respect of those over the age of 50-the concern is that they will be treated as if they had remained in the work force. In other words, their highest average salary calculation will be indexed as though they had remained in the work force, whereas those people retiring after 1 July who are not bona fide redundant will simply have their nominal highest average salary taken to form the basis of the calculation. I seek that indication. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that. In respect of persons who are over the age of 55 but who have not yet retired and, therefore, do not have funds in a roll-over fund as at 1 July, the understanding that I have been given is that their reasonable benefit limit (RBL) will again be based on the indexed highest average salary without the requirement to satisfy the three tests that have been prescribed in order to qualify for indexation in other circumstances-in other words, a minimum of 10 hours a week by way of part-time employment, voluntary preservation to the age of 65 or a commitment to accept benefits wholly in the form of annuities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that understanding is correct, it would seem to me that the Government's regulations will go a considerable degree towards satisfying persons who would not have satisfied the previous two announcements of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). In other words, the announcement in the last Budget that people who had funds in a roll-over fund at August 1989 would have their entitlements indexed was regarded, with hindsight, as not sufficient because there were people who had retired at that date but who had not managed, at that date, to put their funds into a roll-over fund in the normal period of time, which I think is 90 days. That is why, during the election campaign, the Government extended that date to 15 February. </PARA>
<PARA> That is fine for people who had managed to retire and put their funds into a roll-over fund at that date. But if there are people who still have a bona fide intention to retire but who have not yet done so on the basis that they are awaiting the publication of the regulation, it would seem that equity requires them to be treated in the same manner. It is my understanding that the regulations will contain power which will enable them to be deemed exempt from the RBL legislation in special circumstances. Those special circumstances will embrace people who had a bona fide intention to retire prior to 15 August. If that assurance is forthcoming, I think a lot of the concerns in the community at the present time regarding the non-appearance of the regulations will certainly be assuaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) for the assurance on the matters that were raised by the Opposition. I refer to the great disparity in penalties between a superannuation fund and an approved deposit fund (ADF). I understand-and I think this needs to be put on the public record-that, rather than report progress and rather than the matter coming back at a later date, the Minister has indicated that he will come back at a later time, as expeditiously as possible, to look into the reasons for the particular wording that has been chosen that gives rise to what I refer to as an outrageous anomaly whereby a superannuation fund can be fined, effectively, $15,000 whereas the effect of the penalty on the beneficiaries of an ADF could run to half a million dollars. That is the nature of the anomaly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe a more satisfactory mechanism must be found than that which the Government advises at the present time-that there is a constitutional problem and it can control superannuation funds but not ADFs. If it was good enough to bring the ADFs within the ambit two years ago, I believe the Government must find a formula that provides a more equitable penalty between the categories of a superannuation fund and an ADF-type fund. It is quite outrageous to have such a difference in penalty so far as it affects the ultimate beneficiaries of either a superannuation fund or an ADF fund. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not wish to prolong the debate to pursue the issue. We accept the integrity of the Minister's remarks that he will consult those funds that are administered through the ADF mechanisms and, hopefully, seek a more equitable penalty regime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make only one comment on the point that Senator Watson has raised with regard to penalties. As honourable senators will remember, for some time my Party has sought regularisation of the whole notion of penalties across the board, in all legislation. We have been unsuccessful in this because in the past the Opposition has not supported us. I welcome its interest now in this matter. I believe that it relates not only to this legislation but to all legislation. As we have pointed out in the past, there are some extraordinary differences between amounts of time that appear in penalties, for example, and amounts of money. There is no connection between the two. In the past we have suggested that, if the amount of money is taken as the given, one can work out the amount of time by using the average wage or some other method.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only does disparity often exist between legislative penalties which seem to have been plucked out of the air or taken from previous Bills in this area but across legislation there are often massive anomalies. Under some legislation, although the damage to revenue can be quite small, there are massive penalties; under other legislation, the reverse is true. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Government said-I think it was Senator Button, in an exuberance of care for the Senate-that it proposed to look at penalties, not just with regard to one piece of legislation but with regard to the whole matter of penalties and legislation. That proposal disappeared without trace; it was never undertaken. This is a pity because, if honourable senators care to look, we find these types of problems constantly. Unfortunately, the Senate tends to concern itself solely with policy items. When it gets to the bit down the back, the penalties, it tends to leave it aside in the rush of having to deal with so much legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago I put forward a proposition that the Government ought to look at the whole matter of penalties and, possibly, even have a penalties Act to which all other Acts would have regard. That would be the most sensible way of dealing with this matter. The Government made a promise which it reneged on. In the new enthusiasm for cooperation, perhaps Senator Button may be able to jig a number of his colleagues along to try to get in place a regulatory regime with respect to penalties, not only with regard to this legislation but with regard to all legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating cognately two Bills, namely, the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990 and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990. As the Opposition has already advised in the other chamber, it does not intend to oppose these Bills; nor is it moving any amendments to either of them. However, that is not to say that we have no criticism of them. I will deal with some of those criticisms later. Let me say at the outset that Australia is rapidly becoming short of domestic supplies of crude oil. Petrol industry estimates suggest that Australia's self-sufficiency in liquid fuels is likely to be about 84 per cent of demand by next year and that this will rapidly decline within the next decade to 33 per cent. At the same time, we are using fuel at a far more rapid rate than predictions even a year ago would have suggested. While at present we are producing, or expected to produce in 1990, 507,000 barrels a day of oil and condensate, by the year 1999 this is predicted to drop to 167,000 barrels a day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian demand for liquid fuels is increasing. The implications that a growing shortage of domestic production will have on Australia's appalling balance of payments position are obvious. Given present indications and using present figures, the cost of petroleum imports will be about $5.6 billion a year by 1999. Therefore, it is patently apparent that Australia needs to increase and encourage more exploration. This needs to be done quickly. Every extra barrel of producible oil which is found can be regarded as an export equivalent of substantial value and, in the absence of any restraint in demand, may well put off for a short while, at least, Australia's total dependence on overseas supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, on strictly economic grounds, the legislation that we are debating today is of vital significance to Australia's future. The legislation has wider implications than just economic ones. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia, which was signed by the Federal Government in December last year. Nearly 20 years ago the Opposition-in fact Andrew Peacock-was instrumental in establishing negotiations that finally led, at the end of last year, to the forming of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is understandably complex, but essentially the intention is to clarify the arrangements made between Indonesia and Australia. It does so by establishing a zone of cooperation which in turn is divided into three areas: area A, area B and area C. Area A is the largest of the three. Basically, it is the area in the middle of the region under discussion for which Australia and Indonesia form the joint Australia-Indonesia authority created in this legislation and from which they will take 50:50 of the revenue flowing from exploration in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Area B is to the south, closer to Australia, and will be administered by Australia. The revenue split here will be 90 per cent to Australia and 10 per cent to Indonesia. Area C, to the north, will be under Indonesian control and the ratio will go the other way. </PARA>
<PARA> Also included in the legislation are a number of other formulas, ratios and percentages which apply in a given set of circumstances and into which I will not delve this evening. Suffice to say that, in essence, the legislation sets out three zones, smaller areas to the north and south of the main zone, essentially under the control of, and financially returnable to, their country of closest geography and a larger, mutual zone in the middle, which I am advised shows two very promising areas for exploration and for which Australia will have joint control with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> The area has, over the years, become known as the Timor Gap, so called first in 1972 because in the early negotiations it was the area the sovereignty of which Australia could not agree. The area of about 60,000 square kilometres remained a disputed area until the 1988 talks between Australia and Indonesia resolved the issue concerning petroleum exploration. Suffice to say, it is to Australia's great benefit that petroleum exploration can now be expanded in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> To date there is only one well recorded in the area. Flamingo One was sunk in 1961 and showed good results of oil and gas. Subsequent exploration has indicated a strong likelihood of oil deposits. Under this legislation a joint authority is to be established to administer area A. Over this will sit a ministerial council to oversee the administration. Australian nationals working in the zone will work to Australian taxation and criminal laws and Indonesian nationals will be covered by Indonesian laws. Negotiated arrangements have been made by which Indonesian citizens, while subject to Indonesian laws in respect of taxation and criminal offences, will, for all intents and purposes, be under Australian trade union arrangements and award payments. I ask: How does one organise a union picnic for workers in the middle of the ocean on an oil drilling rig? How does one negotiate wages on behalf of workers whose economy and pay scales are so vastly different from those of Australia without sowing the seeds of destruction of the Indonesian economy? There are obvious benefits to Indonesian nationals in this arrangement and given that the country has a population of some 175 million people and a gross domestic product of only $112.2 billion, there was an obvious need on the part of Australian union officials to ensure that Australian workers would not be forced out of the zone job market by demanding higher wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint authority will have split offices, with the notional headquarters in Jakarta and the technical support office based in Darwin. The coalition has already expressed some concern as to the desirability and feasibility of such an arrangement and as to its efficiency. However, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) did not choose to indicate as to how these arrangements for split offices came about and for what reason, other than equality, it was decided that the functions be so divided. There may be good and proper reasons why that course was taken and, if so, the coalition would like to know. In any event, if that is the arrangement, it is important that it be made to work. I guess it is fortunate that the fax machine and mobile phone are so technically advanced today as to make such international communications so easy. That notwithstanding, the difficulties arising from having joint executive directors located in two countries appear to me to be quite formidable. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern-again it is one the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), raised in the other place-was the restrictions placed on companies servicing this joint authority. The legislation proposes that companies wishing to provide services set up a separate entity so that they can operate. However, many companies involved are not multinational and the costs and administrative difficulties likely to be created by this will cause concern to many wishing to do business in this particular area. Admittedly there will be a number of varying tax regimes under which companies will operate in the various sectors, but it seems unnecessarily burdensome to small operators servicing the rigs and platforms in the region to force them to establish separate legal corporate structures. The Minister's response in the other place to the concerns of the Leader of the National Party in this area was to suggest that the matter was one between them and their advisers. I suggest that their advisers are likely to say precisely what the coalition has already said-that it is burdensome and so, clearly, it is a matter of take it or leave it. </PARA>
<PARA> Other concerns already expressed by the coalition relate to the breaches of environmental codes. Over the past year or so there have been a number of disturbingly major oil spills in international waterways and closer to shore, and so it is important that Australia does all in its power to ensure that companies that endanger the environment are fully accountable. Given the location of this area, sitting on top of Australia, and the obvious implications of any major oil spills in the region, it is an important issue which needs very close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister has already advised that the joint authority will have responsibility for ensuring all operators carry out their work in a safe and environmentally sound manner, and will also have the responsibility for undertaking environmental impact assessments of petroleum operations, based on regulations applicable under the Australian Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. I also note that the Minister in the other place will ensure that the annual report of the joint authority is tabled each year for information to give parliamentary accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of compensation to companies which had previously been granted exploration permits in the early 1970s and had them frozen subsequently in the mid-1970s and which, under this agreement, will lose them is not fully resolved. The Government has determined that the issue does not fall within the bounds of acquisition of property as defined in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. However, whether the company or companies involved also choose to interpret it that way remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, while there are some flaws and concerns within the legislation, the coalition overall recognises the need to have in place such an agreement so that exploration can proceed to mutual benefit and, accordingly, does not oppose the legislation. We are concerned as to how small companies will work within the requirements of the separate legal structure conditions; we are not convinced as to the practicalities of having joint executive heads located in two different countries; and we are not confident that the question of compensation to those companies whose permits for the area have been cancelled is yet resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, and by no means least, I wish to address some remarks to the complex East Timor sovereignty question. This is a separate matter to the legislation. Portugal remains the only member of the international community that does not recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and the Timor Gap, Australia having given de jure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty in 1985 although it detested the means by which it was incorporated. Portugal plans to mount a challenge in the International Court of Justice. It is up to the Australian Government to do what it can to reach an understanding in relation to helping provide for the removal of any legal challenge which might be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I advise that the Opposition consents to the passage of this legislation and will not be moving any amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) on these two pieces of legislation-the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990 and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990-states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>is to give effect to the treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of cooperation in an area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and northern Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia) Zone of Cooperation Bill is required to fulfil certain of our obligations under the treaty and in particular to enable the ministerial council and the joint authority to exercise the rights and responsibilities prescribed in relation to the exploration for, and exploitation of, petroleum resources in area A of the zone of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I wish to place very firmly on the record the Australian Democrats' vehement opposition to these pieces of legislation. Our opposition to the Bills stems from the history of the events in the entire region over the last 15 years. Honourable senators will recall that Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975. As a result of that invasion, over 200,000 East Timorese-a third of the population-died in the ensuing war. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' opposition to these Bills is based on the question of legality of any such treaty between Indonesia and Australia, particularly in so far as that treaty purports to affect the East Timorese. The Government has argued that signing the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia is a contribution to the East Timorese people in so far as the treaty will consolidate Australia's friendship with Indonesia and increase its leverage on behalf of East Timor. Quite frankly, I think these are most extraordinary self-serving contentions and they do not stand up to scrutiny. Indeed, a growing number of international lawyers have questioned the fundamental legality of this treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the treaty is illegal on the ground that Indonesia lacks legal title to the area containing the resources dealt with in the treaty. It is a fundamental principle of international law that an unlawful use of force can confer title to territory. This principle derives from the prohibition on the use of force, which is laid down in the United Nations (UN) charter. Article 2 (4), of the charter states:</PARA>
<PARA> All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Indonesia's illegal seizure of East Timor in 1975 was clearly such an unlawful use of force. Indeed, it has been regarded as such by the UN Security Council and the General Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> Under contemporary international law, there is a further fundamental principle that prohibits states from recognising as legal any territorial acquisition resulting from the use of force. The principle was re-affirmed in 1970 in a major General Assembly resolution-resolution 2625 made on 24 October 1970-entitled `Declaration on principles of international law concerning friendly relations and co-operation among states in accordance with the charter of the United Nations'. That resolution was adopted with the consent of all members of the UN at the time, including Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason this treaty is unlawful is that it violates the right of self-determination of the East Timorese people under international law. Before the invasion of East Timor, the people were under Portuguese colonial rule. Therefore, they had the right to self-determination, and the invasion was plainly a violation of that right. I refer to the declaration that I mentioned a moment ago. The declaration states:</PARA>
<PARA>The principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples constitutes a significant contribution to contemporary international law-</PARA>
<PARA>The declaration goes on to say that its effective application is of paramount importance for the promotion of friendly relations among states based on respect of the principle of sovereign equality. </PARA>
<PARA> Indonesia has claimed that the East Timorese people freely agreed to be part of Indonesia by means of a vote which, as honourable senators will remember, took place in the People's Assembly of East Timor shortly after the invasion-in fact, it took place the following year in 1976. That vote, as I think most honourable senators will agree-even those who may be supporting this Bill-was not an expression of self-determination of the East Timorese people. Although that right of self-determination was violated, that violation does not close off a continuing right to self-determination of those people. That it subsists and continues to subsist is highlighted by the fact that the UN General Assembly and UN Special Committee on Decolonisation continued to regard East Timor as a non-self-governing territory that has yet to realise self-determination. This treaty constitutes a violation of the East Timorese people's right to self-determination not only, unfortunately, by Indonesia but also by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Indonesia is concerned, this treaty is merely a reiteration of that state's unwarranted assertion of sovereignty over East Timor, which is inconsistent with the rights of people there. But, unfortunately, in so far as Australia is concerned, the treaty places it in breach of the duty to assist the realisation to self-determination which, of course, is a corollary of the right to self-determination itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The implication of the treaty for the East Timorese people's right to self-determination extends further than simply the two countries-that is, Australia and Indonesia-which signed it. Under the UN charter, the task of assisting non-self-governing peoples to achieve self-government is described as a sacred trust. This sacred trust is vested immediately in Portugal-the colonial power-and also, at a deeper level, in the UN as a whole. Again, this is reflected in the maintenance of East Timor on the General Assembly's and Decolonisation Committee's agenda and in the efforts of the Secretary-General to secure respect for the rights of the East Timorese. The treaty, therefore, is not purely a bilateral matter between Australia and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> This treaty violates a whole range of peremptory norms of international law. Although Indonesia, of course, has not been a party to the Vienna Convention, that convention is widely regarded as reflecting general international law. The prohibition of the use of force is well set out in the convention. The treaty, then, violates a whole range of accepted norms in international law. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to refer to the situation of Portugal. Portugal is the administering power and former colonial ruler of East Timor. Portugal has expressed its views and its possible future action with regard to what Australia has done in signing this treaty. A release dated 13 December 1989 from the Portuguese Embassy in Australia stated that `Portugal reserves itself the right to resort to all legal means it will consider as convenient to uphold the legitimate rights of the East Timorese'. In fact, the Portuguese Government argued that in signing the `provisional agreements' with Indonesia, Australia `disregards Portugal's capacity as the administering power of that non-self-governing territory and the exercise of the rights and obligations inherent to that capacity as recognised by the United Nations'. Furthermore, it argued that the signing of that agreement `interferes with and goes against the mediation efforts . . . exercised by the (UN) Secretary-General aiming at reaching a comprehensive settlement for that question as provided for by the General Assembly's resolution'. Other matters are also raised by the Portuguese. </PARA>
<PARA> This exercise is in violation of accepted norms of international law and of the rights of other countries which have a legitimate concern in this area. The most fundamental abuse that has taken place by the signing of this document is the abuse of the East Timorese people and of their right actually to have a form of government that they choose, not a form of government imposed on them by outside governments-imposed on them by Indonesia. This particular matter has for some time been imposed on them with the connivance of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish, after the suspension of the sitting for dinner, to refer to Australia's extraordinary hypocrisy in this matter with regard to the Baltic states, and to East Timor in particular. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was addressing the issue of the international law situation relating to the forcible seizure of territory, which, of course, occurred with regard to East Timor, and the denial of the rights of the East Timorese to undertake an act of self-determination. What I think is even more regrettable, if that could be said about this extraordinary situation, is the overriding of the fundamental human rights of the East Timorese. (Quorum formed) Neither the Government nor the Opposition are prepared to address the concerns about the fundamental rights of the East Timorese.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's argument that this treaty may help the East Timorese is particularly cynical. It is clear from the historical record that, in extending de jure recognition in 1979 to the Indonesian takeover, Australia was concerned primarily with opening ways for negotiation on the Timor Gap. It did this at the high point of the Timor conflict. In other words, Australia was not motivated by concern to help the East Timorese, but rather by expediting the exploration and exploitation of the vast resources of oil and gas that it knew lay beneath the Timor Gap. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, this major concession in 1979 did not contribute in any way to the amelioration of the human rights situation in East Timor. Systematic and gross abuses of human rights have continued since that time. As honourable senators are aware, in 1985 Amnesty International produced a major report on East Timor. I quote from the summary of that report:</PARA>
<PARA>The human rights situation in Indonesia and East Timor has not improved over the last year in spite of government promises of greater political openness. In East Timor more than 200 peaceful protesters and government critics were detained without charge for short periods and some were ill-treated or tortured. At least 20 people were reported to have been unlawfully executed by members of the Indonesian security forces in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>Those denials of basic human rights that have gone on over time, which have been ignored with regard to the signing of this treaty that has been said to be signed to assist the East Timorese, are nothing other than a blatant and open attempt at denying human rights to people in our region so that our coffers can be filled from the exploration of petroleum deposits in that region. If nothing else, surely this is a case of 30 pieces of silver. </PARA>
<PARA> The international situation with regard to the law is clear. I wish to quote from one other document that has been extremely influential with regard to the doctrine of forcible seizures of territory. It is particularly appropriate that we look at this document. It was published on 7 January 1932 by the United States Secretary of State, Henry Stimson. In a note despatched to the governments of China and Japan he said:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the present situation and of its rights and obligation therein, the American government deems it to be its duty to notify both the imperial Japanese Government and the Government of the Chinese Republic that it cannot admit the legality of any situation de facto nor does it intend to recognise any treaty or agreement entered into between those governments, or agents thereof, which may impair the treaty rights of the US or its citizens in China, including those which relate to the sovereignty, the independence, or the territorial or administrative integrity of the Republic of China, or to the international policy relative to China, commonly known as the open-door policy; and that it does not intend to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27, 1928, to which treaty both China and Japan, as well as the United States, are parties. </PARA>
<PARA>That particular note was hailed immediately as a major development in international law. On 11 March 1932 the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted a resolution by which the League condemned and refused to recognise any forcible seizure of territory by one state or another. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I mentioned that at this time is that there are many in Australia-I am amongst them-who have strongly supported the rights of the people of the Baltic states to independence. This Senate has supported those rights. But we are referring here to a situation of forcible seizure of territories over 50 years ago on the other side of the world. However, when it comes to the forcible seizure of territory 15 years ago in our part of the world, what do we do? We sweep it under the carpet. We have to ask why. If we compare the Baltic states and the East Timorese with regard to the last world war, honourable senators are very much aware of the enormous support given to Australia by the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that, in return for that type of support in the hour of our need, we are quite happy to sell them out for 30 pieces of silver? It is because there is money involved. There is no money involved with regard to the Baltic states, so we can wax lyrical, hold our hand on our breast and say, `That is fine, we support human rights'. But when it comes to the fact that our money is involved-that something that we want is involved-that is a totally different matter. </PARA>
<PARA> East Timor is a much smaller country with far less ability to look after itself and far less ability than the Baltic states to defend its rights. Why is it that this chamber waxes lyrical 50 years on, with regard to a very proper exercise, for those people to be independent, yet we are happy to sell out people who are our next door neighbours, and who inhabit a country which is amongst countries closest to our frontiers? There is only one reason why this chamber will pass this legislation tonight, that is, because we can see that there is a dollar in it for us. We are therefore prepared to swallow the exercise and to accept the violation of the rights of those people. We are happy to throw up our hands and say that nothing can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the situation 12 months ago and compare it to what occurred 35 years ago, in regard to the Baltic states it was quite proper for many people to ask, as in fact many people openly suggested, `Why go on with this? Why continue to defend the rights of people in the Baltic states to self-determination? It is hopeless, give up. Don't hold on to that principle'. Many people in Australia, thank God, held on to that principle. Many people in this chamber have spoken time and time again, year in, year out, to the Baltic Council about the need to hold on and to fight, no matter how hopeless the situation seemed. Somehow or other that principle is not extended to the East Timorese. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators who vote on the second reading of this Bill ought to ask themselves why it is that they are happy to hold on to a principle with regard to one group of people and believe that it should be sold out for money with regard to another group of people. I understand as, I think, everybody does, that it does not make a tidy line on the map, that it is in fact a difficult exercise. This is the problem with the rights to self-determination: it is not tidy and nobody has ever suggested that it was. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that East Timor is a small country. Two hundred thousand people have died in its war since 1975. That is three times the population of Kiribati, which Australia has always supported as an independent country. It is many times the population of Vanuatu, and an extraordinarily large number of times the population of Niue. All of these countries are in our region and all of them are independent sovereign nations, so it cannot have anything to do with that. Presumably, they are supported because there was no money in it for Australia and we could abide by the principle. But they are all in our region and they are all smaller than East Timor. Their situation is also untidy, but the people have the right to run their own lives and their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is a blot on this chamber that we should be voting tonight for these two pieces of legislation. What we have before us is a very clear violation of the international rights of those people. It could very well be that Portugal will in fact take this to the International Court of Justice. If it does so, I hope that Australia will argue as it has before the International Court on many occasions, particularly with regard to the French tests in the South Pacific. No action should take place while these matters are before the courts. I presume that Australia will continue with the argument that this Government supported before the International Court of Justice with regard to those tests-no further atomic tests should take place while Australia was bringing the action against France in that Court. If Portugal brings a case against Australia in that Court, we will abide by the same principle and we will in fact not implement the provisional requirements of this treaty and we will suspend the operation of the treaty while the case is being argued in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us hope that at least if we are happy to violate the principle with regard to the rights of the East Timorese people we will not also violate that rule to consistency before the International Court of Justice. Let us hope that at least there would be some shred of decency and that we would accept the Court's ability to rule on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I again ask honourable senators to think of what we are doing, why we are doing it and whether or not it is worthwhile selling out that very dear principle that Australia has supported so often with the blood of its own people. Should we now be happy to sacrifice other people, not for our territorial integrity or for our defence, but for a few dollars which have yet to be earned but which will be earned, every one of them, with the blood of the East Timorese people?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also oppose the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990. In doing so I support what Senator Macklin has said. If anything springs to mind on the topic of this piece of legislation it is the parallel with the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot in exchange for 30 pieces of silver, which Senator Macklin also alluded to. Today we are not talking about 30 pieces of silver but the betrayal of the 600,000 people of East Timor in exchange for 30 barrels of oil or whatever the potential of the area turns out to be. It is also savage irony that at a time when we rejoice over the moves towards independence by the Baltic states after almost 50 years of Soviet occupation the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) justifies this agreement with Indonesia over the Timor Gap as an unfortunate reality following Indonesia's occupation less than 15 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both of the main political parties have refused to recognise Soviet jurisdiction over the Baltic states. Yet they are partners in crime when it comes to the de jure recognition of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor since 1979. Our hopes of freedom for the Baltic states might have seemed futile given the totalitarian nature of the Soviet regime during the iron rule of Joseph Stalin and under subsequent leaders. Yet the situation has now changed in a way that none of us could have foreseen only a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade describe the situation in East Timor as irreversible if he is prepared to deny Soviet jurisdiction over the Baltic states? It is a question that ought to be answered by the members of the Opposition as well. In the last year we have welcomed the moves towards freedom and independence in eastern Europe and, less than two months ago, in Namibia. But the same concern for self-determination apparently does not apply to East Timor despite a historical debt to the people there who died during the Japanese occupation of the East Indies from 1942 to 1945 and in the process protected the lives of many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I get the impression that Australia's concern for human rights varies in proportion to the distance of the country concerned from our own shores-that is, increasing with distance when we should be equally if not more concerned about the human rights of our close neighbours. Certainly this applies to the situation in East Timor and West Papua, when compared to southern Africa or eastern Europe where we are very willing to defend the human rights of people whose rights are violated. I recognise that my opposition to this legislation will go by the board in the face of the bipartisan view of the two major parties on yet another issue, although I know that there are many people in both of these parties who, privately, would probably oppose this legislation if they dared to. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet it is important that the true character of what is being done be exposed and that opposition be registered by both the community and by individual parliamentarians, especially those of us who are committed parliamentarians for democracy in East Timor. This must be done not only for both moral and legal reasons but also as a way of sending a strong signal to Portugal that the issue is of concern in Australia and that it will have strong support from sections of the Parliament and the community should plans be proceeded with to challenge the legality of this treaty before the International Court of Justice either directly or indirectly through the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it could prove very embarrassing for Australia should Portugal pursue a legal option. Firstly, if the International Court decides that the treaty is illegal, both Australia and Indonesia will have to decide whether or not to ignore the ruling. Such a decision would theoretically place Australia in a dilemma as it has been one of the few states to have voluntarily declared that it accepts the jurisdiction of this Court. I doubt whether Australia's main consideration in recognising Indonesia's de jure claim to East Timor was so that we could get at the oil deposits in the Timor Gap area, but, given the run down of our other oil reserves, it is now obviously a major consideration, and not just for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The savage irony is that back in the 1970s we were always being told that there was no way that East Timor could be a viable independent state because it was not able to be economically independent. When we consider the potential resources in the Timor Gap, which optimistic forecasts have estimated could be twice those of Bass Strait, East Timor, far from being economically unviable, might in fact have the potential to be like Brunei or one of the Persian Gulf states-very small yet independent and economically successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the Minister's arguments when confronted with the illegality of Australia's position in terms of international law. It is a particularly sorry story in light of his own more radical youth and his legal qualifications. The fact remains that Portugal is still recognised by the United Nations as the administering power of East Timor. East Timor is still seen to be a non-self-governing territory by the United Nations, and Australia is alone among the industrialised countries in recognising the illegal annexation of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council are on record, numerous times, denouncing the annexation of East Timor as illegal. The illegality of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor breaches numerous aspects of international law-first and foremost article 2, paragraph 4 of the United Nations charter which prohibits the use of force in international relations. Also of interest is the 1970 declaration by the United Nations, the declaration of principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among states, adopted with the consent of all members of the United Nations, including Australia. It explicitly bars the recognition of territory that has been acquired by force. </PARA>
<PARA> So if we extrapolate that to this situation it means that Australia is barred from recognising Indonesia's illegal annexation of East Timor. Once again there is a savage irony in that, while we welcome the moves towards independence by the Baltic states after 50 years of military occupation, we always justified our denial of Soviet jurisdiction over these nations because they were originally occupied by force. What then is the difference between the situation in the Baltic states and that in East Timor?</PARA>
<PARA> The legality of this treaty is defended by the Australian Government on the ground that there is no binding legal obligation not to recognise the acquisition of territory acquired by force. This assertion is disputed by international lawyers such as Roger Clark, Professor of Law at Rutgers University in the United States, who argues that `Australia is under a legal obligation not to recognise Indonesia's acquisition of East Timor' and that its signing of this treaty breaches that duty. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently there is an opinion on the Timor Gap treaty by three renowned international lawyers of Corpus Christi College at the University of Cambridge-Vaughan Lowe, Susan Marks, and Robert McCorquodale. They argue that the treaty is invalid on the ground that Indonesia lacks title to the area containing the resources dealt with in the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to this argument, so I move on to their second argument-that the treaty is also unlawful because it violates the right of self-determination of the East Timorese people under international law. Before the Indonesian invasion, the East Timorese were a people under Portuguese colonial rule. They therefore had a right to self-determination. The invasion was plainly a violation of that right. Under the United Nations charter, the task of assisting non-self-government peoples to achieve self-government is described as a `sacred trust'. This sacred trust is vested immediately in Portugal, the colonial power, but also at a deeper level in the United Nations as a whole. We all have a collective responsibility. Again, this is reflected in the maintenance of East Timor on the General Assembly's Decolonisation Committee's agenda and in the efforts of the Secretary-General to secure respect for the rights of the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, this treaty is also invalid because it conflicts with a so-called peremptory norm, or possibly several peremptory norms, of international law. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that a treaty is void if it conflicts with a peremptory norm of international law; that is, a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be altered only by a subsequent norm of international law having the same character. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Indonesia is not a party to the Vienna Convention, the Convention is widely regarded as reflecting general international law. There is a general agreement that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory norm. In providing a means by which Indonesia will reap the benefits of an unlawful use of force, this treaty undermines, and hence conflicts with, the prohibition on the use of force, and is therefore void. </PARA>
<PARA> Further arguments could be advanced against the lawfulness of the treaty. For example, it may be that Indonesia is properly to be regarded as a belligerent occupant of East Timor, as Israel is regarded as a belligerent occupant of the West Bank. If this is the case, the treaty plainly goes beyond Indonesia's entitlement to deal with East Timor's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, the treaty could be unlawful because it is an attempt to usurp the East Timorese people's right of permanent sovereignty over the natural resources of East Timor. The right of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their natural resources was confirmed in 1962 in a widely supported resolution of the General Assembly which has since been accepted as indicative of general international law. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other aspect of this treaty which I believe should be considered today. It concerns potential damage to the environment once drilling gets under way in the Timor Gap. By exploiting the Timor Gap, the Government risks oil spills which will have massive environmental impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems in northern Australia, Timor and Indonesia. There is always a probability that an oil well will blow. Ever since the major spill at Santa Barbara, California, in 1969, oil drilling has resulted in spills. Even in the North Sea in Europe, where regulations are very tight, spills have repeatedly occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a major spill from either an oil drilling platform or a vessel, there is no known way to contain it in the open ocean. The major spills from the Exxon Valdez off Alaska and the Kharg 5 off Morocco last year proved that oil combatment equipment and technologies cannot cope. The loss of the bulk ore carrier Alexander P off North West Cape in March this year proves how treacherous our northern seas can be and the real risks posed by oil cargoes. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil platforms are not without their share of pollutants. The drilling mud used in boring is toxic, and chemical effluents and sewerage from rigs are discharged into the ocean, all of which severely impact on marine life in the vicinity of oil rigs. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the treaty does contain some environmental protection provisions, which of itself is an acknowledgement that drilling, extraction, transportation and other activities are potentially harmful to the environment. Hopefully, if drilling does go ahead, these issues will be treated seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to deal at any length with the issue of human rights in East Timor except to refer to the latest report on this concern by Amnesty International, dated January 1990. Recent media reports have all referred to the continuing sense of frustration by the people of East Timor and the representations being made on their behalf by the Roman Catholic Church, in particular Bishop Carlos Belo. </PARA>
<PARA> The human rights situation continues to be repressive, as Amnesty's report testifies. I am glad that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to raise with Indonesia violations of human rights. It is only sad that he then moves on to business as usual while the Indonesians continue with their repressive behaviour towards the people of East Timor, as, for example, after the visit of the Pope and the United States ambassador to Dili. </PARA>
<PARA> I would argue that while we once again commemorate the spirit of Anzac displayed by the Diggers at Gallipoli, we should not overlook the courage of the East Timorese who died fighting the Japanese alongside Australian troops between 1942 and 1945, and those young people who more recently had the courage to demonstrate for their right to self-determination at the time of the visits I have just referred to by the Pope and the United States ambassador. They too have had to pay the ultimate penalty and yet we choose to betray them by ratifying this treaty in order to satisfy our thirst for oil. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to quote the words of Jim Dunn who was Australian consul to Portuguese Timor from 1962 to 1964 and author of Timor: A People Betrayed. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia is the result of a policy remarkable only for its hypocrisy and opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA>After Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus and taken his 30 pieces of silver, he went out and hanged himself. I am not sure what the modern parallel to this act of remorse might be-and I am not suggesting that the Ministers responsible do likewise-but it is a sad day for Australia when this treaty is ratified and the people of East Timor are denied what is legitimately theirs because of an act of realpolitik by its large neighbours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to make a contribution to this debate, one which I would much prefer were not happening in this chamber. I point out that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in his second reading speech states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990 is to give effect to the `Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in in an area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of this Bill is required to fulfil certain of Australia's obligations under the treaty and in particular to enable the ministerial council and joint authority to exercise the rights and responsibilities prescribed in relation to exploration for, and exploitation of, petroleum resources in area A of the zone of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister says that the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill-the other Bill in this package-provides a series of amendments to legislation that would otherwise be inconsistent with certain provisions of the treaty. As has been made abundantly clear in this chamber already by my colleague Senator Macklin the Australian Democrats are vehemently opposed to these Bills. I, as a member of a group of parliamentarians for East Timor, want briefly to reiterate some of the history of the events of the whole region over the last 15 years which are the basis for our vehement opposition to this package of legislation. East Timorese, a third of the population, died in the war that followed. These people, as my colleague Senator Macklin pointed out, have a history of strong support for this nation in our hour of need. Our opposition to this legislation stems, firstly, from the illegality of the treaties between Australia and Indonesia, which were signed late last year. How can there be treaties when those people most directly affected were invaded and subsequently effectively disenfranchised from the whole negotiation process?</PARA>
<PARA> We see these treaties very much as the result of two countries who put prospective financial gain through oil exploration and exploitation royalties ahead of international concerns about international law, human rights, human life and, of course, the environmental dangers which Senator Vallentine referred to in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia and Indonesia agreed on their seabed boundaries to the south of Irian Jaya and West Timor in 1972. Demarcation of the 250 kilometre gap south of East Timor, however, has been a protracted process delayed first of all by Portugal's reluctance to cooperate and then, after that invasion of 1975 by Indonesia, by dispute between Jakarta and Canberra on where the boundaries should be drawn. As Senator Macklin has pointed out, now that the boundary has been drawn out, it is not even a tidy line on a map. </PARA>
<PARA> The treaty's achievement is that it provides a way around this dispute in the form of the zone of cooperation. In one stroke it has removed both a political irritant and a frustrating impediment to the resources development plans of two energy hungry governments and, of course-we must not forget this-a whole number of oil countries. All along Australia has been determined to get on with the exploitation of the Timor Gap for Australia's economic gain. This has been the clear objective since 1975 and has been a major determinant of Australia's East Timor policy all along, a policy with a rather magical cross-party approval-that is, the old parties in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia knew in the early 1970s from oil company research-research which was clearly made available to our Government-that the kelp structures in the area could hold massive reserves of oil. Negotiations between Jakarta and Canberra started in 1976 specifically on the area of the Gap-less than a year after that Indonesian invasion had occurred. Obviously, having manoeuvred for so long and so hard, any Australian government is not likely to surrender its stake in the Timor Gap willingly or readily. </PARA>
<PARA> The future really depends on whether Portugal wants to pursue the matter with Indonesia or Australia in the International Court of Justice. I point out that Portugal's Ambassador to Australia has stressed that Portugal has absolutely no colonial ambitions with respect to East Timor. With or without the court action by Portugal, there are signs that East Timor could return to the international agenda. The Australian Democrats welcome these signs. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations (UN) Decolonisation Committee meets in August in New York and will discuss East Timor. One can just imagine how, after this legislation, Australia will come out in that discussion. This is after the UN Commission for Human Rights Sub-Commission on Prevention of Minorities succeeded in putting East Timor back on the agenda for the forty-sixth session of the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva in April this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The church in East Timor has played a leading role in keeping the issue current. Perhaps the biblical references to forty pieces of silver made by Senator Macklin and Senator Vallentine are appropriate in that context. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, thirty. The church has played a leading role in keeping the issue current through Bishop Belo's letter to the UN Secretary-General last year reminding him that `we'-that is, the East Timorese people-`are dying as a people'. This is another case of genocide. The church is also playing a leading role in keeping the issue current by the visit of Pope John Paul II in late 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Around the world-this has already been referred to in this debate-there are momentous changes occurring with implications for East Timor for those of us who genuinely believe in human rights and justice around the world. In eastern Europe people are being given the change to exercise their right of self-determination and are being supported in this part of the world and even from this chamber. Another former colony in Namibia has also become a sovereign nation after being illegally occupied for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of East Timor and all advocates of basic human rights can point to these developments and ask why the East Timorese cannot exercise their rights of self-determination and why we here tonight are about to put another nail in the coffin of that self-determination?</PARA>
<PARA> It is a cruel irony that shortly after Australia and Indonesia sewed up a deal to exploit the oil reserves in the Timor Gap, the Dutch Government suspended a multimillion dollar aid package to Indonesia in protest at political executions. The four political prisoners involved were former bodyguards of the previous President of Indonesia accused of taking part in an abortive coup more than 20 years ago. There are reports that up to one million people were massacred in the months after the current President seized power. The recent spate of killings followed the student demonstrations for democratisation-their particular form of glasnost-last last year. The Democrats believe that the Australian Government's Timor Gap treaties are illegal and immoral. They are stained with the blood of hundreds of thousands of East Timorese. The Australian's Government's often stated concern for human rights has not been matched by its action in signing these treaties and effectively signing away the future wealth of an independent East Timor towards which I and many Australians and people all around the world will, I can assure this Government, continue to work. The Government has sold out. </PARA>
<PARA> On a final note, I would like to express regret that my reading of this debate in the other place has shown that no voice has been raised in that House by my colleagues who are members of the Parliamentarians for East Timor organisation of this Parliament. I challenge my Senate colleagues who belong to that organisation to participate in this debate. Thus far they have not. I regret that the founder of that organisation, Tony Lamb-although he is not in the Parliament any more-has to know that this has not happened. I visited the Amnesty International headquarters in London last year with Tony Lamb during an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference specifically to discuss East Timor with the brave people there who have been trying desperately to avoid the sort of thing we are seeing here now. I am absolutely positive that if the good members of this Senate were permitted, or took it upon themselves, to vote on these Bills as their hearts would urge them to do they would not be passed. I deeply regret that they probably will be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words during the second reading debate of the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990 and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990, which deal with petroleum exploration agreements with Indonesia. The main reason I want to say a few words, having listened to comments by Senator Macklin, Senator Vallentine and Senator Powell, is that some remarks should be made in response to some of their assertions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that concerns me about the tragedy of East Timor-I do not think anybody on either side of this chamber or in the minor parties would disagree with the description, `the tragedy of East Timor'-is that in 1975 the Portuguese, after nearly 400 years of colonial rule, suddenly decided because of internal problems in Portugal to withdraw immediately from East Timor, having made no preparation for independence, for self-government, or for training people to govern the territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Portuguese walked straight out and left the province in the grip of civil war between the Fretilin forces and other forces. A number of people, running into several thousands, were killed during that civil war. The Fretilin forces were successful in winning that civil war, and governed what we know as East Timor for a brief period. In relation to the Australian response at the time, one should not forget that the East Timor crisis occurred at the time of Australia's own constitutional crisis, when this chamber saw fit to delay and reject Supply. In that environment, the Whitlam Government of the day was obviously distracted, and I think people in Australia generally were distracted, from events occurring elsewhere in our region, even as close as East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most regrettable remarks ever made at that time was that made by Mr Doug Anthony, the Leader of the Country Party-I do not think it had been changed to the National Party of Australia by that time-who said that the coalition under no circumstances wanted to see a left wing neo-communist government in East Timor and that all action should be taken to stop that sort of government establishing itself so close to Australia. I believe that those were unfortunate remarks. They gave every encouragement to the Indonesian Government to take the action that it did. After a civil war had been fought in East Timor the Indonesians claimed, with some justification, that a number of refugees had fled from East Timor into their part of Timor and were a problem for them. In that context Australia was not able, in my view, to be as strong as it should have been at the time of the Indonesian invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 1979 that we got to the real crux of diplomacy in this matter, when the Fraser Government publicly declared its support for Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. The present Government, when it came to office in 1983, inherited a policy that in all senses would have been extremely difficult to overturn in view of the position already taken by the Fraser Government. We made it clear in 1985 that we did not support or condone the manner in which the East Timor province was incorporated into Indonesia. That has always been our position and I am sure that it will always be our position until there is a genuine act of self-determination for the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of human rights has been raised by previous speakers. The present Government, since 1983, has consistently raised issues of human rights in Indonesia even though it is our closest neighbour and ours is the most important diplomatic relationship of any other country and will be in the foreseeable future. We have raised, at considerable cost in aggravation to the Indonesian authorities, human rights abuses both generally within Indonesia and within East Timor. In the view of the Government-I think it is the correct position-it is better to have dialogue with the authorities and to convince them to reduce human rights abuses in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity in early 1989, as a member of a parliamentary delegation, to meet with Governor Carrascalao, Governor of East Timor and a full East Timorese, and to discuss these matters of East Timor. It was quite clear that the Indonesians are now making some genuine efforts to improve the position of the East Timorese people. We would not say that it is a position that has been achieved to our satisfaction, but certainly, compared with the events in the mid-1970s when a large number of East Timorese were either killed directly by the invading army or died in the subsequent events-in the occupation-there has been a significant improvement. The Australian Government has always argued that we should continue to lobby for those human rights in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> Even as late as February of this year when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, was in Indonesia, he raised with the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alatas, the issue of human rights in East Timor. Every time we raise it, we do not get any good marks or a good reception from the Indonesians because they believe that it is an interference in their internal affairs. But the Australian Government, in accordance with its human rights policy, will consistently raise those issues. I am certain that many members on all sides of the Parliament would support the Government in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to return to the role of Portugal. It has been suggested here in the debate that the Portuguese are considering taking the Australian Government to the International Court of Justice over this treaty. I have to say that if Portugal turns up in any international court and complains about this matter it will be one of the great hypocrisies of all time. Portugal for 500 years was one of the worst colonial powers in the world. Whether it was in East Timor, Mozambique, Angola or Portuguese Guinea in West Africa, in every case there was a civil war before the people got their independence because the Portuguese flatly refused to grant independence in a peaceful way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Portuguese stood against the tide of anti-colonialism that took place in the Third World after the Second World War and refused to concede independence in any way. As a result, in every one of Portugal's colonies in Africa and in East Timor tens of thousands of citizens lost their lives, fighting either directly against the Portuguese or in subsequent events because those countries did not have the infrastructure in place to be able to govern themselves and they descended into some sort of civil war. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Portuguese to suggest that they will go to the International Court of Justice and complain about Australia over the Timor Gap treaty is rank hypocrisy of the worst kind. It should be remembered in this chamber that the Portuguese are, without doubt, one of the bloodiest and worst colonial occupiers of any European power in history. Possibly only the Belgians in the Belgian Congo were more dreadful, more oppressive and more bloody in their rule than the Portuguese in their colonies. Anyone who tells me and this Government that we have to be concerned that Portugal will turn up at the International Court of Justice should be dismissed with hilarity. Portugal has no substance and no credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to mention something that may upset some of the earlier speakers from the Australian Democrats or the Independents about relations with Indonesia. It is all very well for people representing minor parties or single views to stand up and say `This is what we should do on this particular issue' and isolate it from everything else. A country cannot be governed, and relations with other countries cannot be governed, on the basis of an episodic view that every issue should be treated absolutely individually and that issues should not be linked to each other. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been interested, as some members in this chamber have, in supporting initiatives to get a peace settlement in Cambodia. There is no way we will get a peace settlement in Cambodia-get that poor unfortunate country to some peaceful settlement-without the involvement of the Association of South East Asian Nations countries. We may ignore the ASEAN countries, but they have a decisive say about the outcome of any Cambodian peace initiative. The country that has most say in the ASEAN bloc about getting a peace settlement in Cambodia is, in fact, Indonesia. It was the Indonesians who successfully started the Jakarta Informal Meeting talks that have been a very successful adjunct to the Australian Government's initiative to establish our own peace initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had dialogue with the Indonesians and they have come a long way from the position the ASEAN countries held only two or three years ago. We will not get a peace settlement in Cambodia without the active and constructive involvement of the Indonesian Government. It is going to be much harder to get that Cambodian peace settlement if at the same time we are kicking the Indonesians in the head over their East Timor policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a matter of balance. I know the purists do not like the idea of trading balances sometimes. I do not like it either, but that is the reality. It is all very well to claim that we have sold out East Timor. We have defended East Timor's human rights. We have raised the matter with the Indonesians ever since 1983, and we have consistently done so. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this Government is also concerned about the problems of the people of Cambodia. Quite correctly, we have decided that we should have dialogue with Indonesia not only about East Timor but also about Cambodia and a number of other issues. Before the Democrats and the Independent Senator Vallentine jump up and claim their purity on any issue and say that the rest of us, in the major parties, are not as concerned as them about the problems of East Timor, they should listen to my long list. When I tramped through the highlands of Eritrea with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front in its fight against Mengistu I did not see any Democrat. As the first Western politician to go to Burma after the coup I did not see any Democrat. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do not accuse them of being less pure than I am on those issues. We all know that the world is complex and that the issues are difficult. We will not resolve them be standing up, baring our chests and saying, `We are more concerned about human rights in East Timor than you are'. For every case that they tell me of, I will give them four others about which they have been silent. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Democrats and Senator Vallentine to consider that one cannot deal with diplomacy on the basis of simple sloganeering resolutions. One cannot get up here and tell individuals, `You have sold out'. Senator Powell recently made some remarks about Tony Lamb, who did more over a longer period on the issue of human rights for East Timor than any other member of this Federal Parliament. Yet, come the last election he may well have been re-elected if the Democrats had chosen to give him all their preferences for the seat of Deakin rather than only 50 per cent. So let us not be totally pure about who is right and who is wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Senate is debating two Bills-the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990 and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990. The first Bill, broadly put, incorporates the terms of the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an area between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia. The second Bill, broadly put, amends several Acts where it is necessary to give effect to the substantive clauses of the treaty. Those Acts relate to taxation, the operation of the joint development zone, criminal law and a number of other aspects of change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go to some of the comments made in this debate, I feel that I should say a couple of words about these treaties. In international relations they are significant not for the reasons that were the subject of a lot of the debate in this chamber-Senator Schacht's reply covered the remarks that the Government might make-but in terms of the significance of the two countries, Indonesia and Australia, which have a dispute as to where their seabed boundary is properly located. Those two countries, having pursued negotiations, have not been able to settle those negotiations. Australia has certainly not, in any sense, declined to do other than assert its right to where the boundary should be properly laid. Nonetheless, Indonesia and Australia are able to reconcile their differences by saying, `Until we can come to a conclusion about where the proper seabed boundaries might be we will declare the area in dispute. It is an area which we will write a treaty for so that we are able jointly to explore and develop'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are not too many cases internationally where there is a dispute about the boundary where an enlightened temporary outcome of this nature has been reached in order to provide some benefit to both contesting countries. I repeat that that in no sense is meant to indicate that Australia does anything other than continue to argue that the continental shelf should continue to be the right boundary. I also acknowledge that Indonesia would argue that the boundary is the 200-mile limit from its shores, but we argue that the continental shelf is the right boundary, and that is the case. Here we have a solution to the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why there is a great deal of attention to this issue is that the area in dispute-the Timor Sea-is regarded as resource rich. It is an area of geological fault that has provided entrapment for oil and gas reservoirs under the ocean floor which are currently producing oil and gas in commercial quantities. The geological knowledge we have of the area suggests that there may be large accumulations of oil or gas; indeed, in the feature of the geological formation, the kelp structure, it could be argued that there would be a vast quantity-up to a billion barrels-of oil, gas or sea water, whatever that structure may contain. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal of interest both in Indonesia and Australia in developing these potential energy resources. These Bills address that matter. They propose amendments to our various Acts which will be duplicated in Indonesia to enable a civilised structure of arrangement to be implemented with the necessary legal requirements for exploration and development of those reserves. I think that will be a very useful, positive and internationally a very noteworthy achievement once it has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks, and with my inclination merely to commend these Bills to the Senate, I am reminded that there have been a number of questions raised, in particular by Senator Brownhill, that perhaps I should take some moments to respond to. I understand that Senator Brownhill raised the question of whether the split of the joint authority between Jakarta and Darwin is efficient. Efficiency-I can see Senator Brownhill nodding assent-is the criterion that he applied. The arrangement for the joint authority-the Indonesian-Australian government authority that will oversee the management of this zone-is that it be located in Jakarta but, for want of a better term, its operational wing will be located in Darwin. That, I must say, recognises the interests of both countries. On the question of efficiency, I should say that the location of the joint authority in Jakarta and Darwin reflects the principles of equal benefits to both countries that this treaty espouses, and that concept permeates throughout the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the arrangements are practicable. The technical office of Darwin will deal with petroleum operations in area A. The majority of area A is likely to be serviced from Darwin, which seems better located than Jakarta to serve that area. Nevertheless, there will also be companies located in Indonesia. With the head office in Jakarta, contact with those companies will be provided and that will promote administrative efficiency. So, in terms of getting the operation in the zone right, proximity to the zone is an important consideration and Darwin wins on that criterion. The location of the administrative office in Indonesia is of considerable help in terms of the importance of the interest being shown in Indonesia by a number of Indonesian companies. So there is a neat break-up of responsibilities which reflects the interests of both countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I understand that Senator Brownhill said that the taxation regime that we have put down is complex and requires companies, including small businesses, to form separate companies to undertake work associated with petroleum operations in the area zone. That is not quite true. Only those companies holding petroleum production sharing contracts are required to form separate companies for each contract area. Companies providing goods and services in area A are not required to form separate companies. However, to the extent that they earn income directly from area A, they will need to lodge tax returns in Australia and Indonesia-they will be taxed 50 per cent in Australia and 50 per cent in Indonesia. On that basis, that probably explains more clearly how the tax regime is worked out. I recall reading the debate in the other place where a similar question was raised. I must say that the same answer applies in both cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, persistent question; persistent answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Brownhill proposed also that the issue of compensation to existing permit holders had not been resolved satisfactorily. I should say that, in my previous incarnation as the Minister for Resources, I think I comprehensively dealt with this matter. Let me just go back to the brief and once again put some of the salient features of the answer to this question on the record. The permits extending into area A are to be terminated only because this is an essential step in the implementation of an important international treaty. No special benefit is gained from that termination by the Commonwealth. The Government does not propose to compensate the permit holders unless the termination of permits within area A is found to be an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the Australian Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> An exploration permit is a right granted by Government to search for petroleum owned by the Crown-in effect, by Australia for Australians. Legal advice to the Government is that the termination of an exploration permit in these circumstances is not an acquisition of property. If there are further questions on this issue as we go through the committee stage, I will be pleased to deal with them in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, these are important Bills. They signify what I think, in terms of Australian-Indonesian relations, is a landmark treaty. They enable the contested area to be delimited and to have put in place a regime under which exploration can proceed and, should production be warranted from accumulations of oil and gas or minerals, for that matter, that might be found, in which the production can be proceeded with and the taxing regimes of both countries can be fairly and reasonably met. The criminal law that would apply for work carried out in this area has been worked out between the two countries as set out in the amendments, as have the industrial relations elements and other elements, including questions of environmental protection and so on, should there be exploration and production. On the basis of those observations, I commend these two Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990 was dealt with in the House of Representatives on 14 May when the Opposition moved a second reading amendment outlining our concerns with the Bill in its then form. Those concerns related to two things: firstly, that the capitalisation grant should not be capable of being used as start-up grants; and, secondly, that there was a possibility of double dipping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to those two issues specifically, the original Bill was not sufficiently clear in our view in providing that the capitalisation grants could not be used as start-up capital. Those grants, in our view, should not be able to be obtained for yarn production capacity that did not already exist in the industry. The Opposition sought an assurance that to receive a grant the applicant must be a producer of bountiable yarn and must have lodged a claim for bounty, and that the making of a capitalisation grant be limited to expected bounty receipts in respect of existing capacity. The Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, gave such an assurance. In respect of double dipping, under proposed new section 21f of the Bill the coalition is now satisfied that any debts arising out of unfilled obligations by the recipient of the grant to the Commonwealth are reasonably well covered, with the exception of the case of bankruptcy and sale which could result in double dipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition sought an assurance on this concerning control. Minister Beddall in the committee stage of the Bill accepted the validity of our concerns, as we had expressed them in our amendment and having introduced amendments stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has accepted the concern expressed by the Opposition that the Bill does not completely protect the Commonwealth from the possibility of having to outlay money for a capitalisation grant, and then, subsequently, having to outlay additional money for a legitimate bounty claim in respect of bountiable production for that which the grant was meant to disentitle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister accordingly introduced amendments to the Bill which are now incorporated into the legislation as it presently is before us. Thus the Opposition is not moving in the Senate the second reading amendment which was moved in the House of Representatives, and we are not so doing for two reasons. Firstly, as to the question of start-up capital, the Opposition is satisfied that the undertakings given by the Minister that this scheme will not-and, indeed, cannot-be used to supply start-up capital for new or expanded capacity will prevent any such abuse of the new system. Similarly, the Opposition accepts that the altered wording in the explanatory memorandum gives teeth to this undertaking. With regard to the question of double dipping, we consider that the amendments moved by the Minister, as set out now in the legislation before us, are successful in preventing double dipping and satisfy our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments moved by the Government in the other place ensure that ministerial control over identified essential assets is strengthened by the additional provision denying bounty entitlement to any subsequent owner who uses such identified assets to produce textile yarn. It is interesting, I think, to look at the Bill as it comes before us in terms of how the scheme was devised and, indeed, came to be presented. It seems to have arisen from a review of the textile yarn bounty administration, but that review could perhaps be called a review you have when you are not having a review. </PARA>
<PARA> The background is this. In a letter to the Chairman of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority dated 24 January 1989 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) sought the review of the textile yarn bounty administration, but made this extraordinary statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The review should not embrace assistance levels to yarn producers but should be restricted to an examination of yarn bounty administration. </PARA>
<PARA>The terms of reference of the review stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The review will exclude examination of programmed levels of assistance accorded yarn production under the TCF plan. </PARA>
<PARA>How one can make a proper assessment of the bounty scheme without considering the level of assistance to producers is not really clear but, as stated in a discussion paper by the Authority:</PARA>
<PARA>No effort was made by the Authority to review the merits of textile yarn bounties compared to some other possible forms of assistance or to consider varying the overall level of budgetary assistance accorded the yarn production sector as part of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the review was supposed to be submitted to the Minister by September 1989 but only a discussion paper was ever released and a final report has yet to be forthcoming. The discussion paper may very well have led to the drafting of the Bill which is before us, but one wonders whether the final report will ever be released. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion paper did, however, show up some quite interesting statistics. Firstly, it shows that bounty assistance to the industry generally amounted to some $250m in 1988-89, of which textile yarn bounties accounted for 35 per cent or $86.9m. Secondly, it shows that the annual nominal expenditure on textile yarn bounties has progressively increased from $23m in 1981-82 to $86.9m in 1988-89. Real outlays peaked in 1985-86 prior to the full effect of the 20 per cent Budget reduction on all bounties. Thus since 1981 the Commonwealth has outlaid a total of $588m in bounty assistance to the yarn sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority conducted a survey of 78 per cent of bounty claimants, representing some 97 per cent of total bounty outlays. Some 90 business reporting units, representing 121 registered factory premises, responded to the Authority's survey. Again, the findings were interesting. The survey found that 30 per cent of recipients received less than one per cent of the total value of the bounty-that is, 27 companies received less than $50,000 each-while 17 per cent of recipients received more than 81 per cent of all bounty, that is, 15 companies received over $1m each. </PARA>
<PARA> When the textile yarn industry is analysed by large manufacturing groups it is found that the five largest groups account for 72 per cent of the total bounty. Thus, although the discussion paper presented us with some interesting material, I think it is nonetheless important to comment upon the fact that, in the Minister's terms, the Authority was restricted to an examination of the administration of the bounty without ever looking at the comparative advantages of the method of assistance that was being given. So one can only conclude that perhaps the Bill as it is before us, that is for the capitalisation scheme, has grown out of discussions that have flowed from that discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA> One can also ask oneself whether or not this is to be a one-off venture. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill seems to make it clear that this need not necessarily be so. It was asked of the Minister in the House of Representatives whether the capitalisation grant concept would be extended beyond textile yarns. Mr Beddall replied that he was not aware of any plans to do so but that the option of capitalisation would undoubtedly be considered if this scheme proved successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The attraction of the Bill to the Opposition, and the reason that we are not opposing it, is that it offers three positive things. It offers an alternative assistance scheme for textile yarn producers which, in turn, will offer a reduced Commonwealth expenditure, accelerated restructuring of the industry and reduced dependence of the industry on Commonwealth assistance. That is the intent of the Bill and it was for those reasons that Mr McLachlan in the lower House said in his speech to the Bill that we do not oppose the thrust of the Bill if it does what it implies. So the concerns that were raised by the Opposition in those early stages dealing with those questions of double dipping and start-up capital have been adequately dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two other issues that may be important to deal with when we reach the committee stage of the Bill in order to follow up some of the questions that were asked of the Minister concerning undertakings that were given. I will do that when we proceed to that stage of the Bill. As I said, the Opposition is not opposing the Bill because we see that it offers those three important points: reduced Commonwealth expenditure, accelerated restructuring of the industry and the possibility of reduced dependence of the industry on Commonwealth assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990 and, as the previous speaker, Senator Bishop, has said, this Bill is not a particularly controversial one, and it has the support of the Australian Democrats. It seeks, very broadly, to amalgamate the bounty, which may be paid to textile yarn manufacturers over some years into the future, into a capitalisation one-off grant so that those textile manufacturers may be able to improve the manufacture or marketing of their products and become more efficient and, therefore, more cost effective in the manufacture of their products. In that respect, the Australian Democrats support this legislation and believe it is certainly a step in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It hardly needs to be said that in many areas of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry Australia desperately needs to gain a great deal more value added to its products. A very large amount of our wool clip is sold, as we hear all the time, in its raw state; a very small amount is processed. Similarly with the other products in this area, a large amount is exported without a great deal of value added. To the extent that these capitalisation grants will encourage the development of value added to build more efficient industries, they will very significantly improve the industry overall and improve Australia's position vis-a-vis other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of a bounty or the charging of a tariff does raise another interesting area which I think is somewhat vexed and which has not been particularly well handled by the Government, from a philosophical point of view. There has been a wish by the Government progressively to remove tariffs on the grounds that, in a very simplistic view, price is a sufficient measure of the efficiency of a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To shift ground just momentarily, I will use a recent example. I was in the Riverland during the last election and the citrus growers were particularly concerned about the progressive removal of tariffs from imported citrus juice from Brazil. They pointed out, and I believe quite rightly, that in Australia we have introduced a number of measures to protect workers in that industry and to protect the environment in the production of citrus and citrus juice. It is quite unfair to import product from another country which does not observe the same standards of occupational and environmental health. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be quite appropriate to structure a tariff or a bounty that properly reflected the costs borne by Australian industry when faced with that sort of competition, which does not suffer the same imposition of costs in relation to the protection of its workers or its environment. I make that point in passing because the textile industry in many of its applications has also exposed its workers to quite substantial risks-and I will mention one of those later on-in relation to cotton spinning and weaving. So when these costs are borne by Australian industry because we have imposed those sorts of controls, it is appropriate that it be protected from foreign competition if that competition does not meet the same standards of occupational and environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to allow the capitalisation of the bounty which will be payable to manufacturers in this area. To obtain a capitalisation grant it will be necessary for a manufacturer to prepare an application and for the application to be assessed. Then a grant may be made. The Bill sets out that one of the principal considerations is that the total cost of that capitalisation grant brought back to constant dollar terms is less than the bounty that would be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> One interesting feature of this Bill, which I found a little bit surprising, is that there may be many situations in which the amount of money required to upgrade a particular textile activity is substantially less than the amount of bounty which would be payable. There is no provision within this Bill for a continuation of the payment of a reduced bounty so that the total amount-that is, the capitalisation grant plus the bounty-finishes up as roughly the same amount of money. I can understand why that is done, but it may be-I just suggest that this may be the case-that some applications may be for larger amounts than are actually required on the grounds that the manufacturer in question may see it desirable to seek a larger grant than is absolutely necessary, simply to get the full value of the bounty which would otherwise be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the amendments which I will be moving will be circulated. As the Government has accepted those amendments, I would simply like to deal with them now to save time later on because I believe that they are not controversial. The Bill as it is before us is framed in such a way that the costs and other benefits are assessed within the industry alone. In other words, the benefits of the improvements in the manufacturing process which might arise as a result of a particular grant being given are assessed against the costs and if the benefits exceed the costs and the overall cost is less than the bounty that would be paid, presumably a grant may well be made. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the way cost-benefit analyses are often done, and often done to the detriment of the externalities which arise in manufacturing processes. This has been particularly true in a number of the textile industries. One may look back to the dark days when asbestos fibre, for instance, was being woven into fabrics. The consequence of that was a very large increase subsequently in lung diseases and lung cancer. Clearly, the cost of that in terms of human ill health, in terms of treating those people, should properly be borne by the industry that was responsible, the industry that initially sought to weave that asbestos fibre. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless honourable senators think that asbestos is an unusual example, I mention the disease called byssinosis which arises with those who are involved in cotton weaving and spinning, a disease which crippled many thousands of people in the United States because of the inhalation of small pieces of cotton fibre which produced a similar, chronic progressive fibrotic disease of the lung similar to that caused by asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA> If the changes in the technology which might arise as a consequence of one of these grants should, for instance, increase the amount of fibre in the air and, therefore, increase the risk to workers, increase the number of people who might subsequently suffer from these chronic fibrotic diseases, then, of course, those costs which economists like rather interestingly, to call externalities, should be internalised and those costs should be taken up in the assessment of the grant. We hope that with modern technology there will be an improvement not only in the cost efficiency of production but also in the quality of the air in factories where this activity is carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of externalities in relation to the environment in general would be in the case of the proposed wool scouring plant in the Albury-Wodonga region. This was proposed several years ago. Many people were concerned that the effluent from this wool scouring plant would eventually find its way into the upper reaches of the Murray River and lead to an increase in pollution similar to the sorts of pollution we saw last summer. That would be another example of quite a massive external cost, which would have to be borne somewhere else in the community should such a plant ever be established under those circumstances. Again, the size of that external cost would be dependent upon the nature of the wool scouring that was carried out. In other words, to some extent it would be dependent upon the particular technology chosen. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not take a great deal of imagination to understand why these external costs need to be internalised. In that way the overall costs and benefits to the community of this changing technology which might result from these capital grants would be assessed. Accordingly, I will be moving two amendments in the committee stage which relate to the content of the application by the proposer and also to the way in which that application will be assessed, so that both the occupational and the environmental health and safety aspects arising from the changes will be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government will accept those amendments. I do not wish to speak to them. I think they are adequately covered here. The Australian Democrats are very pleased that the Government has seen fit to accept them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990. I will develop the reasons why such a bounty is seen to be necessary and desirable at this stage. It is often said that Australia is non-competitive. Why is it said that Australians are inefficient when clearly in many cases that is not so? I wonder whether this is based simply on the international price. Is it based on the productivity per person per hour, or is there any element of national significance, value adding or allowing for special cases? What really constitutes efficiency under those circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Costs come under two headings. There are costs of production and social costs. Much of the first category is common wherever the goods are produced, while costs vary considerably from country to country and have nothing to do with efficiency and affect only a section of the overall economy. We have to check only a sample of our social costs to see what I mean. All of these have developed in highly prosperous bygone days. We now have them all and seem likely to retain them-whatever the cost in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> First, our cost of labour. It is not that our labour cost is the most expensive in the world. What becomes expensive is that only 77c of each dollar paid in labour goes into the cost of production. In 1986-87 for every dollar of labour costs paid by Australian manufacturers 77c were for time worked; 12c were paid in respect of leave, bonuses, termination and severance pay; and 11c for other costs such as payroll tax 4.3c, superannuation 2.8c, workers compensation 3.8c, fringe benefits 0.4c, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian labour costs are high in comparison with those of some of our competitors in this region. For instance, they are about 50 per cent higher than those in New Zealand and four times higher than those of Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. On an index basis where Australia is 100, the United Kingdom is 96, New Zealand is 65, Taiwan is 24, Singapore is 24, Korea is 23 and Hong Kong is 22. Those figures were compiled by the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics in March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when we look at this list, included in Australian production costs would be 20 working days holiday per year-or 30 days in many cases-10 working days cumulative paid sick leave per year, and 10 public holidays per year, which leaves us with a working year totalling 220 days at best, or 66 per cent of all of the days of the year. We have equal pay, higher junior rates, overtime, penalty rates, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, company tax, payroll tax, workers compensation insurance, superannuation, wages indexation, maternity leave-or, in some cases, paternity leave-child-care arrangements, and so on. I am not saying that I object to any of those and I am not saying that other places do not have a variety of them also, but I do ask whether other places have them all and whether we can afford them all, anyway. That is all part of the cost of everything we produce. Is that what we call a level playing field?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider how our producers get on competing with others when the value of our dollar is 76c, when interest rates are 17 per cent to 20 per cent and when inflation rates are 8 to 9 per cent-miles above those we must compete with on cost. The dollar value on a trade-weighted basis between June 1985 and March 1990 shows a fall of 8 per cent while comparison with the United States dollar shows an appreciation of 13 per cent-or in the wrong direction by 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of the Australian dollar has been propped up by high interest rates and has been necessitated by a chronic current account deficit and the consequential need to attract capital flow from overseas. Between June 1986 and March 1990, costs as measured by the respective rates of inflation rose in Japan by 2.3 per cent and in Australia by 33.2 per cent. Yet in the same period the dollar appreciated against the yen. The yen was 110.96 to the dollar in March 1986 and 118.79 to the dollar in March 1990. The adverse impact of this situation on Australian manufacturers competing against Japanese imports can be illustrated best in the following simple example. In June 1986 an Australian manufacturer produced an item for $100 and was able to compete in price terms with the Japanese production with a landing cost of $100 or 11,096 yen at the prevailing rate of exchange. Assuming prices move roughly in line with inflation, by March 1990 the cost of the item was $A133.20 or 11,351 Japanese yen. At the March 1990 rate of exchange that represents $A95.56, so the Japanese import is now almost 30 per cent cheaper than the previously similarly priced Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA> Who pays for this? It is the productive sector which pays. For those who are lucky enough to earn and spend on the one market, it does not matter. But for those with partly domestic and partly overseas involvement, there are huge problems which are getting worse. I have a schedule of declining Australian supply which shows what I wish to demonstrate. I seek leave to incorporate this schedule in Hansard. </PARA>

Had it been possible to hold down import penetration to the 1982-83 level of 15.7% of total imports, our 1988-89 import bill would have been some $4,000 million lower and our current account deficit, as a proportion of GDP, would have been cut from 5.2% to about 4.0% (the same level as it was in 1982-83). </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will not go through the whole schedule but I will just mention a couple of items from it. It shows that, as a percentage of the total imports in 1982-83 as against 1988-89, whereas we imported 15.7 per cent in the selected items in 1982-83, we are now importing 24.4 per cent-an increase of 55 per cent in that period. In 1988-89 the value of imports was about $11,500m. Had we controlled our figures, we would have saved $4,000m just by the extra goods that we are now importing. Simply closing down an Australian industry and buying from overseas will solve nothing in the long term but will create yet another crisis in the short term. As honourable senators realise, it will increase our imports, pump up our dollar value and interest rates even further, and encourage increased overseas ownership of Australian property and equity. Is that what we want?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why does the community at large expect the dollar-earning, internationally competing productive sector to bear all of this while the non-competing sector has very little concern about what those indices are? For anyone who is, say, a member of parliament, a baker, an accountant, a bricklayer, a grocer, a doctor, an optometrist, a taxi driver, a sharebroker, a banker, a clothier, a newsagent or a hairdresser, and with no competition from similar occupations in Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Spain, Brazil or wherever, there is no problem. But those who produce shoes, prepared foods, books, clothes, cars, crockery, electronics, et cetera, are in trouble through no fault of their own-through nothing that they have done but totally because of what Australian society at large has decided the productive sector will pay for. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who are not in that group, does it matter what are the rates of pay, the holidays, the fringe benefits, et cetera in any of those industries in other countries? Of course, it does not. But please think about this. Do those who are deciding how to cut back on industry and export promotion understand what other countries with which we compete very solidly do for their industries? In the Australian of 16 March there was an item about Taiwan. If one tries to get an industry started or to make one go in Taiwan, the articles states:</PARA>
<PARA> First, there will be a five-year tax holiday once a company's profits start flowing. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Government, which has pumped more than $US300 million . . . of its own money into the scheme, will make available through its Bank . . . money at rates lower than even the modest 9 or 10 per cent charged on bank loans here. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There also will be cash awards for new equipment developed in the park. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> None of the companies need spend valuable capital on land or buildings-these will be provided on a rental basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor will they have to build a warehouse-the Government will provide one in the park complete with full Customs services. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990, the companies in the park will together produce revenue of $US2.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1996 target is $US6 billion, almost all in the form of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>How are we competing with those sorts of things? In the Newsreview of 21 October 1989 an article about what Korea is doing states:</PARA>
<PARA> The government will pour 26 trillion won (about $38.81 billion) into fostering the seven frontier industries over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The high-tech industrial fields which it expects to lead the nation's economy in the 1990s are microelectronics, mechatronics, new materials, fine chemicals, bioengineering, optics and aerospace . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The country's share of the world high-tech market, 1.4 per cent as of 1987, is expected to grow to 2.3 per cent in 1994-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, an increase of over 50 per cent-</PARA>
<PARA>and to 3.2 per cent in 2000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is an increase of over 50 per cent. What are we doing? We just happen to be closing down industries right, left and centre. As they plan support and go on further and further up ahead, what are we doing? Is it not crazy that we cannot learn from the people who learnt so much from us? Where there is an Australian producer of goods that is in competition with overseas produced goods here in Australia, in any of those countries mentioned, or in third markets, suddenly our totally artificial position comes to light. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed an article in the Australian Financial Review of Monday, 21 May, about the present Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the economy generally, which stated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the state of the economy. Australia currently has:</PARA>
<PARA>* An inflation rate more than double the average of our major trading partners . . . </PARA>
<PARA>* The highest mortgage rates in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA>* Lending rates to business up to three times as high as those in most similar economies. </PARA>
<PARA>* Wage growth 1.5 to two times that of similar economies. </PARA>
<PARA>* One of the highest gross debt interest payments to export income ratios-over 20 per cent-outside of Latin America and Eastern Europe . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We talk about level playing fields. None of the people that we compete with have all these obstacles to contend with. They are all obstacles that we have created. These have not been inflicted on us by anybody. These are of our own making. Every time we go further up this track, the situation gets worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder we need tariffs? Is it any wonder we need bounties, duties, quotas or whatever? We need them only because we have made no effort to get our economy in order. We have fluffed along here, year after year, getting worse and worse, eliminating industry after industry, and what have we got to show for it now? We have just got the wrecks of the empty factories around Australia. We have been kidded that all this big debt we had was going into productive equipment. That is so much hoo-ha. It is not going into productive equipment. The latest figures that have come out demonstrate this clearly. The money that has come in might have gone into personal computers, but it has not gone into manufacturing equipment that is going to turn us around this corner.</PARA>
<PARA> We talk about level playing fields. Do not let us talk about level playing fields. Do not even expect that it is possible for Australian producers to even survive without some form of offsetting recompense for what the non-productive sector of Australia has done to them. It is time we woke up. It is time we made the Government acknowledge that our dollar value, in particular, and our interest and inflation rates are in the mess they are, and only then let all our primary and secondary producers get out and compete without any tariffs, bounties, quotas or artificial means. </PARA>
<PARA> What is wrong with the wool industry at the moment? Exactly the same thing. What is wrong with some of our other manufacturing industries that are closing down? Exactly the same thing. They cannot compete because the dollar's level is ridiculous and we know that it is ridiculous. We would not be talking about various levies on the wool industry if the price of wool and the value of the dollar were okay. Why do we not face up to what the real problem is and do something about that, instead of just fiddling around the edges and looking for a scapegoat amongst those things? I do not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a refugee from the so-called reconstructed textile industry, I cannot let an opportunity such as the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990 pass without comment. On one of the few occasions that I rise to speak on textile related issues, I do not have any substantive quarrel with the overall thrust of this Bill. I am seeking from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) some assurances as to the future application of a number of these provisions. I remind the Senate that it is part of a long overdue scheme to accelerate the restructuring of the textile industry and, I emphasise, the investment in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Archer very eloquently outlined tonight to the Senate the problems of and the movement out of this industry by a lot of good operators. We are becoming more and more reliant on imported products, which is placing increasing strains on the balance of payments. I agree wholeheartedly with the yarn bounty capitalisation scheme. It is a welcome additional option for the industry, but it has to be regarded as an additional option. </PARA>
<PARA> In my discussions with industry a number of minor reservations have been voiced. I intend to use this forum tonight to voice those concerns. I am also seeking assurances on behalf of the industry that some of these concerns will not ultimately be realised, either intentionally or unintentionally. I welcome the appearance in the chamber of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fear that holders of existing bounty arrangements could be prejudiced by the introduction of the scheme. It is hoped that all applicants will be treated in an even-handed manner and that existing bounty arrangements are not prejudiced by the introduction of the scheme. I am seeking the Minister's assurances on this and a number of other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that it is the Government's intention that the scheme will reflect such principles but, nevertheless, I believe that assurance in this chamber from the Minister responsible is still necessary. In particular, the principles involved are that this is a genuine additional option available to firms and that there will be no pressure placed on such officials to use this scheme if, in their judgment, they prefer to continue to utilise the annual bounty payment route in accordance with their entitlements under the current Bounty Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I have certain concerns about the application of bounties because it is a visible item in every year's Budget. It is one that the Treasury often feels is subject to some sort of red ink or black ink treatment. So with regard to the existing yarn bounty scheme, it is hoped that the introduction of the Bill under debate will be without prejudice to the continued operation of the scheme. In general, it is hoped that any amendment to the Yarn Bounty Act should not envisage the termination of the bounty scheme prior to 30 June 1995; nor should it prejudge what form and level of assistance will be accorded beyond 30 June 1995. I understand that the subject will be addressed in an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry and report well in advance of 1995. Perhaps the Minister could outline what he envisages from such a report.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also hoped that the criteria, procedures, et cetera, will be spelt out in a manner which will enable the scheme to be open to all bounty recipients to apply and will provide equitable treatment and consideration of the firm involved. As a consequence, the nature of the undertakings to be entered into by successful firms should be described adequately to ensure that the firms see at the outset what their obligations will be under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it is hoped that if an applicant decides not to accept a capitalisation grant offer ultimately put forward by the Government-that is, if the grant offered is less than sought or if the terms and conditions of the agreement are perceived to be unsatisfactory to the applicant-the firms' bounty entitlement under current legislation arrangements will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government listens to the concerns that I have raised so that this Bill may be of benefit to its fullest extent to all members of the textile industry. However, some minor adjustments are necessary to the Bill, as my colleagues have ably pointed out. In summary, the Bill should prevent the possibility of double dipping and the Bill should limit the grant to expected bounty receipts in respect of existing capacity. There is one other point that I would like to make. I quote from one of Senator Button's press releases:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the aims of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear industry plan is to encourage TCF firms to become internationally competitive during a period of industry restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat-`to become internationally competitive'. Only a few weeks ago in my home town of Launceston the Southern Garment Co. Pty Ltd announced its imminent closure. In fact, the date is very close-28 May. The reason is not the restructuring but rather, as the company manager stated, the state of the economy. The interest rates were too high on its borrowings. The banks were the only ones benefiting. So another 90 employees, another 90 families will be without part of their income as the result of the closure of another Tasmanian textile company. </PARA>
<PARA> The textiles, clothing and footwear industry plan has not accounted for such variables as interest rates and movements in the exchange rate, to which my colleague Senator Archer referred. The Australian dollar has dramatically appreciated since the plan was introduced. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has argued, correctly, that high interest rates will eventually reduce domestic demand and, hence, the demand for imports. However, this is only part of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of high interest rates has caused large changes in the relative prices of imports and their domestic substitutes. Our exchange rates are sensitive to interest rates because of the freedom of international capital flows. Thus, the Australian dollar appreciates and the competitiveness of our export industries decreases. It is not the restructuring of the industry that has caused the latest closure of the textile plant that I referred to earlier but rather, in this case, the present problem lies with the management, or lack of management, of the Australian economy. In other words, the Southern Garment Co., which employed over 90 people in Launceston, in a better economy not only may have survived, but certainly would have survived. It has gone from a thriving industry last year to an industry going out the back door, and possibly one that will have to relocate somewhere in Asia in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to economic literature-in particular, the Mundell-Fleming Model and the Asset Market Approach-which states that the outcome of higher interest rates actually worsens the current account. These theories support the probability that Australia is experiencing a policy induced recession to solve a current account and foreign debt problem which is, in large part, the result of the policy stance itself. I believe that this needs discussion and further review. Therefore, though I agree that the highly protected textile, clothing and footwear industry in Australia needs some restructuring, I believe that the Government should re-examine its overall economic policy to ensure that the economy is aiding Australian industry in the best interests of all concerned and is not acting to its detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, while I give wholehearted support to the Minister's proposal to encourage industry by all means possible to restructure so as to make itself not only locally but internationally competitive, I would like the Minister, on behalf of industry, to speak to the Treasurer of Australia to ensure that the tax legislation that he introduces supports the thrust of the proposals he is espousing in this Bill and industry at large. It is pointless for one Minister to espouse high principles and to encourage industries to restructure when down at the other end another Minister, the No. 2 in the Government, is putting forward legislation that is actually inhibiting industries restructuring by artificial tax laws that are so complex that they provide structures that are uncommercial, uncompetitive and restrictive, and that so defeat their purpose and intent as to nullify industry and group restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek assurances from the Minister in relation to the matters that I have raised on the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill. These assurances have been sought by industry. I also seek that the Minister speak with the Treasurer to ensure that the tax laws are so framed that they will encourage our purpose and intent, and fulfil the necessary criteria which will enable industry to restructure in order that it may be more internationally competitive. </PARA>

Senator Coulter has foreshadowed the only amendments that will be moved at the committee stage and, as indicated, the Government is prepared to accept them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to comment at large on points made in the debate by honourable senators. I did happen to listen to the extraordinarily flamboyant speech from Senator Archer, which contained some of the most specious arguments I have ever heard. Senator Archer drew attention to the fact that imports have grown since 1983. Senator Archer, the economy has grown too. Exports have grown-that is something that the honourable senator was not used to during the coalition's period in government. But by and large, since 1984 there has been, on average, a 3 3/4 to 4 per cent growth rate in the Australian economy. Inevitably, imports will grow in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the honourable senator's rhetoric about wrecks of factories and so on, in the last quarter of last year this country produced more goods and services than it ever has. Employment and manufacturing have increased substantially. These are facts which are not capable of being refuted by high flying rhetoric with dubious figures in support of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson sought assurance that the proposals in this legislation are a genuine additional option. Of course they are a genuine additional option. Nobody, under the bounty yarn legislation, is going to be forced to take the capitalisation route. That is not the proposal; it has never been the proposal of the Government; and it is not so now. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, I think honourable senators have commended the legislation which will enable those who seek to take advantage of it, according to the prescribed conditions and regulations, to improve the capital stock of their plants and that will assist with the process of becoming more internationally competitive. That is what the legislation is about and I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

Are there any arrangements or understandings that have been made between the Government or its agencies and the industry-either those currently in the industry or those whom somebody might have in mind; in other words, those potentially in the industry-with regard to capitalisation grants which have not been announced to the public?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the instigation of people who, after unsuccessfully exploring other avenues, came to my office for help, I have over the past several months been conducting an investigation into the operation of the Western Australian health and compensation systems. It appears that the systems are failing. They tend not to serve the interests of the injured people they are intended to protect and compensate; rather they sustain a vast industry of doctors, lawyers, investigators and others who derive considerable income from the sabotage of the legitimate claims of those injured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the system is failing in the area of prevention. It fails to inform people about the dangers and it fails to protect people from the negligence of others, such as employers. It fails also in the area of information. People are not adequately informed as to their rights, for example, with regard to safe working conditions, and about the compensation system. As a result, when people have been injured they are drawn into a system and they do not realise that they are entering a minefield in which there are very many traps and in which honesty for forthrightness can be rewarded by deceit and corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the system is failing in the area of treatment. Accounts of medical incompetence, unprofessionalism and malpractice are common, as are descriptions of how access to decent treatment is blocked by the combined workings of the existing legislation and the insurance industry. Thirdly, the system fails in the area of compensation. It legally allows people only an inadequate amount of compensation and it makes it difficult for them to obtain even that. </PARA>
<PARA> The ordeal of the individual begins with injury in work-related or motor vehicle accidents, or with the appearance of non-obvious conditions such as repetition strain injury (RSI) or soft tissue injuries, although people injured in other ways have recorded similar experiences with regard to the system. In one case a woman already suffering from RSI was refused an electric typewriter by her employer and when she purchased one for herself she was told that she was not allowed to bring it to work `in case it damaged the building'. Her employer, by the way, was the Western Australian Police Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been shown over and over again that industry incurs high costs as a result of poor treatment of workers and unsafe work practices. These costs, in their turn, in the form of compensation and higher insurance premiums, staff replacement, low productivity due to hours lost and low employee morale, outweigh the cost of investment in top level workplace safety. It is equally obvious that many employees do not take the matter of their own safety at work seriously enough, so there are faults on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a community perception that RSI is a non-disease, either invented by malingerers or of psychological origin, and is purely an Australian phenomenon unknown in comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent research shows that RSI is a very real condition and has very real physical causes, although these are not what they were once thought to be. It is also clear that there have been and continue to be epidemics of RSI in comparable countries, including Japan, the United States of America and Europe. Comparable data are not easy to compile because in different countries rather different terminology is used to name this condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Australian Medical Journal of September 1987 declared the RSI epidemic to be over. Worksafe Australia's new action priorities do not include RSI and the Australian Public Service no longer publishes statistics on it. The negative public, medical and institutional attitude to RSI sufferers has certainly increased their difficulties and diminished their sense of self-worth. This was surely encouraged in May 1987 when the then Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, made a spirited attack on workers who claimed to have repetitive strain injury, some of whom he labelled malingerers. It seems to me that, rather than setting out to defame citizens, governments should set out to warn them of the potential danger and assist them to stand up for their rights. Otherwise, people will continue to be unnecessarily injured. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that it is true that measures have been taken in a number of industries to guard against RSI, and I also recognise that there will always be a small minority of individuals who will attempt to exploit a compensation system to their advantage. But we do not operate our home and contents insurance policy on the assumption that every Australian who takes out a policy intends to set fire to their home with a view to making a fraudulent claim and we cannot operate our workers compensation system on the assumption that every claimant is setting out to defraud the system. It is, in fact, a reversal of the onus of proof. </PARA>
<PARA> RSI is a condition one contracts only as a result of working hard and fast under considerable stress for very long periods. Once injury has occurred or a condition such as RSI has manifested itself, the individual finds herself becoming involved in a huge complex system whose working she does not understand and against whose many failings she cannot protect herself. There is at present no mechanism whereby injured people are automatically fed an overview of the health and compensation system in all its medical, legal and insurance aspects, or information about their rights or lists of advisory or support organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The injured person's first natural step is to consult her general practitioner (GP). If a GP decides a specialist is needed, the referral can be quite arbitrary and the patient can bounce around between the GP, physiotherapist and specialist for quite some time before striking some appropriate treatment. Some patients find themselves treated quite roughly, as if they were objects, or treated as inferiors. Commonly there is a reluctance or refusal to inform the patient what is happening, accompanied by an intimidatingly superior attitude or a demeaningly patronising one. </PARA>
<PARA> Patients who refuse to accept a sufficiently submissive role have reported to me that they were called malingerers or orthopaedic actresses to their faces and reduced to tears by being shouted at and told to get out of the doctor's office. One was even dismissed as a patient, regardless of the seriousness of her condition, for the sin of having openly sought a second opinion. Or again the patient may be treated as a class enemy of the medical profession. Thus, in one case a doctor privately stated that in effect one of his colleagues had been guilty of malpractice but he would never say so in public, and in another a doctor did not tell a patient the nature of her condition because it would have indicated malpractice on the part of a colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, many injured workers feel that they have been treated as income fodder because under the Western Australian Workers' Compensation and Assistance Act 1981 a certain amount, presently around about $16,000, is guaranteed for medical costs. Many claimants are convinced that they are over-serviced and referred unnecessarily from colleague to colleague and specialist to specialist for expensive consultations and tests until this limit is reached; then quite suddenly the medical profession loses interest in them. </PARA>
<PARA> Some doctors put the patient at risk without her knowledge. It appears to be common, for example, for doctors in effect to experiment on patients by trying drugs out one after the other, including new drugs or drugs banned in other countries, without informing the patient that this is what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, at present in Australia it is not mandatory to report adverse reactions to drugs. It is estimated that perhaps only 2 per cent of adverse reactions are in fact reported to the adverse drugs reactions advisory committee. It is also common for doctors to fail to obtain the informed consent of patients for procedures they plan to carry out, either by failing to give them virtually any information or by misinforming them about possible side effects or discomfort. One woman, for example, was told that a certain operation was so simple and minor that she would be able to drive herself home immediately; but afterwards she could not walk, let alone drive, for three days. </PARA>
<PARA> Another woman agreed to three little injections and was perturbed upon arriving at the hospital to find herself being prepared for theatre. The doctor would not tell her that what he had injected epidurally was Depo-medrol, about which I have had plenty to say in the past. This, of course, is a drug which the manufacturers and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee warn should not be used epidurally. She was also not warned that, as has been described in medical journals, one of the possible side effects is the incurable condition arachnoiditis which, in fact, this patient subsequently contracted. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be perhaps something very serious missing within the education system of doctors, such as an insufficient emphasis on ethics and of patients' rights in particular. Displays of assertiveness, defiance or anger have been known to be interpreted by doctors, in reports to insurers, as signs of `psychological instability' which in turn can be and are used to deny the reality of an injury. Under section 64 of the Western Australian Workers Compensation and Assistance Act refusal to submit to treatment can result in suspension of compensation. I will read section 64 of this Act for the information of the Senate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a worker has given notice of a disability he shall, if so required by the employer, submit himself for examination by a medical practitioner provided and paid by the employer, and, if he, without reasonable excuse, proof of which is on him, refuses to submit himself to such an examination, or in any way obstructs it, his right to compensation, and to take or prosecute any proceeding under this Act shall be suspended until such an examination has taken place, and shall cease unless he submits himself for examination within one month after being required to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>People who claim compensation for permanent and total incapacity find that insurers or employers will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid even a limited liability. The legal way to deny compensation is to show either that a person's condition is not connected with the compensable situation or is not real. Once that is done the employer or insurer can, under section 1 of the Act, suspend compensation and force the claimant into a fight with the Workers Compensation Board which, generally, she will lose. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noticed in passing that the idea of defrauding the compensation system is as mythical as the myth of the unreality of RSI because, from what I have learned, no sane person would enter the system that I am describing to make money, especially as large pay-outs are remarkably uncommon. After some years of battle and extraordinary trauma the average claimant receives an award of between only $10,000 and $25,000 and, on the whole, loses money and assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it is common for employers and insurers to place claimants under surveillance, hoping to catch them performing activities which they should not be able to perform. They do this by trying to catch them on videotapes which can then be shown to doctors or judges. These tapes are often obtained illegally. They commonly involve acts of trespass and gross invasion of people's privacy. Video film is reported to have been shot through people's bedroom windows at night using infra-red equipment. At other times surveillance is carried out quite overtly and intrusively with a view to intimidating the claimant into dropping the claim or settling out of court for a trifling amount. </PARA>
<PARA> One doctor has told me that such vid- eotapes are often shown to doctors, firstly, so as to discredit the claimant in the doctor's eyes before the patient has even seen him and, secondly, in order to intimidate the doctor into reserving any pro-patient opinion that he might be inclined to, lest he be laughed out of court because of the contrary evidence on the videotape. This same doctor describes one case in which the videotape shown in court was proved to be not even of the person concerned-it was somebody else who had attended that person's house to give her a hand. In another case, a claimant lost her case on the basis of a 20-second videotape which she, too, asserted to be false. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of cases recently publicised in Perth newspapers. I will quote one from the Daily News of 22 May. A person said:</PARA>
<PARA> I had private investigators come to the front door and follow me to the shops. We were also harassed by debt collectors and doctors demanding payment for their services. The insurer sent me to a psychiatrist who said I was not crazy and I was ordered to have a brain scan. They also ordered a pathology test, which I later learnt was for sexually transmittable diseases. They sent me to doctors for assessment and, if there was a good report they didn't want it. They'd send me to another. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that gives the Senate some examples of how insurers and employers have been willing to use dirty tricks and break privacy laws to obtain information.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to quote from a statement of a man who had worked in the protective services branch of Telecom Australia. I would say that, from what he has said, that branch would seem to need some investigation. This man states that he and other Telecom employees and private investigators hired by Telecom have secretly surveilled hundreds of compensation recipients. Also, people are set up by having their car tyres let down or having rubbish thrown into their gardens to see how they would react-presumably, whether they would do actions which they say they cannot do. He states that people's pay is stopped to make them come into Telecom's office where they are covertly filmed, that eavesdropping devices are left inside claimant's homes-effectively bugging them-and that he has been directed by his superior in Telecom to use whatever methods are necessary to get the desired results, even when it was transparently obvious that the claimant was genuinely injured. All this I have in writing as a statement from this person. </PARA>
<PARA> He further states that many claimants have had what is known as a C-CASS run on their homes, which is a procedure whereby a print-out can be made of all numbers dialled from a telephone service in the home. He himself was instructed, when he worked for the branch, to gain access to claimants' bank accounts. He has overheard discussions on how to go about discrediting two doctors who had been sympathetic to repetitive strain injury (RSI) claimants, and he has heard claimants regularly referred to by their case managers as `slimeballs' and other names. </PARA>
<PARA> He concludes in this statement by saying `the mere act of lodging a compensation claim' appears to be `justification enough for claimants to be surveilled, filmed, followed, photographed, set up, vilified and have their private lives laid bare'. I can only say that such flagrantly undemocratic behaviour should not be tolerated in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Very commonly, a medical basis for denying compensation is sought in any one of several forms. When applying for compensation, the injured person must sign a form giving the employer or insurer the right to see any medical reports on him. Many people do not understand that this includes reports which may predate the actual injury by years. If the records show a previous injury or natural condition, this may be seized upon to explain the current problem, or it may be claimed that a subsequent, non-compensable injury is the sole cause of the problem. One man who injured his neck at work and was awarded compensation had, four years later, to undergo minor surgery on one toe. A few days later, his neck problem flared up-as it occasionally did-and the insurer immediately suspended compensation, claiming the neck problem was a product of the toe surgery. That is really drawing a long bow. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sometimes claimed that claimants' problems are psychological in nature. This is particularly effective in cases of soft tissue injury and RSI, as there is still debate over their precise nature. Especially in the case of RSI, the slightest suggestion of a psychological condition can tip an already biased doctor, insurer or judge against the claimant. Details of private life, such as financial and marital problems, are commonly used to bolster such suggestions and smart claimants quickly learn to deny ever having argued with their spouses or bet on the Melbourne Cup. Should suffering, frustrated, understandably stressed claimants overstate their claims, express anger, exhibit inconsistency or behave in less than a perfectly rational way, they may find this represented in a doctor's report as a sign of instability, unreliability, and therefore dishonesty. When claimants, after long periods of pain, unemployment and frustration understandably become depressed, doctors often portray the depression as the cause rather than the effect of their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> To obtain one of these medical opinions as the basis for suspending compensation, employers and insurers use a process known among the claimants as `doctor shopping'. Acting under section 64 of the Act, which I previously read, this involves sending the patient to see one doctor after another until one is found who is prepared to give the necessary negative judgment. Thus, seven doctors, as has happened, may declare someone unfit for work and genuinely injured, but if the eighth disagrees compensation is immediately suspended under section 64. One woman reports being blatantly told by the State Government Insurance Commission (SGIC) that it would send her to one doctor after another until they found one who would agree to say that nothing was wrong with her. One such report is enough to suspend compensation and force the claimant to fight for reinstatement. No weight is given to expertise or familiarity with the case, and the opinions of the doctors who have previously opposed the insurers' and employers' desired assessment are simply disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a variation of doctor shopping which involves the use of a pet doctor. Again and again the same few names crop up of doctors who consistently provide insurers with reports unfavourable to claimants. The reasons for such collusions are not mysterious. For those found reliable by insurance companies, there is a steady flow of business because all the higher rates are applicable in insurance cases. Again, a doctor has verified to me that `There are a number of older doctors who sustain their incomes by providing opinions for insurance companies and consequently approach the claimant with a negative attitude.'</PARA>
<PARA> One of these names comes up so consistently that I have been urged by many claimants and by other doctors to name him in the Senate. Since there is now the right of reply, I shall do so. A large proportion of the many RSI sufferers who have been in contact with my office-and they number now about 80-have mentioned Dr P. Ingram Cromack as being the doctor responsible for ceasing their compensation payments or putting them in jeopardy. But again, in the final analysis, the practice of doctor shopping is underpinned by sections 64 and 65 of the State Act which not only do not serve the community's best interests, but occasionally even place people at the mercy of criminals. A doctor sexually assaulted one claimant, then threatened to report her as needing psychiatric help if she charged him. She did not charge him. </PARA>
<PARA> Once compensation has been denied the claimant's only recourse is to legal action. But although the law is supposedly the very backbone of our democratic society, access to it is reserved, certainly in Western Australia, for the most part-to put it bluntly-for the wealthy. A claimant who seeks to use the courts to obtain justice commonly experiences a similar range of problems as she has by this time experienced with the medical profession. It must be clear by now that sections at least of the legislation can work against the rights and interests of the genuine claimant. </PARA>
<PARA> Until December 1986 it was possible to make a total liability claim against the employer for the full amount one would have earned over the rest of one's working life, but at that time the Act was amended in unusual haste. The amendments completed their passage through the State Parliament just nine days after they were introduced and without being normally gazetted as to limit total liability awards to just $50,000. A large number of asbestosis claims suddenly began to surface at that very same time. In Ben Hill's book, Blue Murder, which is the story of the blue asbestos mine at Wittenoom in Western Australia, Robert Vojakaovic, President of the Asbestos Diseases Society (Inc) of Australia reports how some time earlier he had sought an interview with the then Australian Premier, Brian Burke, in which he planned to ask him to look again for crucial State Government records of the Wittenoom mine. I quote briefly from this book:</PARA>
<PARA> `As soon as I walked into his office, he jumped to his feet and shouted at me ``you are trying to bankrupt this State, and I won't let you''. What he was talking about was the compensation we were fighting for-the State Government Insurance Office was the liability insurer at Wittenoom, and Burke was terrified they would end up picking up the bill for millions and millions of dollars. I calmed him down, and proposed a deal to him: either a Royal Commission, at which everything would have to come out, or find those missing documents so that we could use them in our court cases against CSR. He saw the sense of that, and told the public servants to go and have another look.' . . . eventually, piece by piece, page by page, week by week, from filing cabinets and warehouses all over the city, and in Kalgoorlie and Karratha, the bureaucracy yielded up its secrets-and it suddenly became clear why they had fought so hard to prevent them becoming public. The Wittenoom Papers reveal a story of bureaucratic incompetence and inertia almost unrivalled in Australian political history . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I could continue. Regardless of precisely why the legislation was amended in 1986, it was made full use of in a variety of cases. One person made a large total liability claim against her employer, the Western Australian Education Department-that is, the State-and it was due to go to trial just before the date the amendments were passed. The Western Australian Crown Law Department's lawyers acting on behalf of the State delayed the trial, by such tactics as quite simply failing to turn up, to attend meetings, until the amendments had been passed. </PARA>

After listening to 25 3/4 minutes of Senator Jenkins's speech, I draw your attention to the fact that, contrary to standing order 187, it appears that Senator Jenkins has read 25 3/4 minutes of her speech.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am moving to my conclusion, Mr President. Between October 1988 and April 1989 SGIC payments to doctors dropped by about 60 per cent, as reported by the Sunday Times of 16 April last year. It was about this time that the huge losses of the Western Australian Government in the petrochemical plant fiasco were coming to light. Given the conviction of Tony Lloyd from SGIC in January of this year for carrying out questionable instructions from the State Government, it is clear that such influence is in fact far more than possible. Today, Australian Associated Press reported that the case against Tony Lloyd, also former Managing Director of Rothwells Ltd, was quashed because of a misdirection of the trial jury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, the workers' compensation and motor vehicle insurance schemes were established to protect the hurt and the injured. Those systems, at least as they operate in Western Australia, have been diverted from their true purpose. They often act like a cancer which preys upon people. The systems that were set up to protect and compensate people do not sufficiently do that. At the same time, a whole army of doctors, paramedics, lawyers, insurers and even government-if government can make a profit on workers' compensation via its agency, the State Government Insurance Commission-seem to benefit rather than those who should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Senator Jenkins's very long speech, she raised a number of allegations of mistreatment, which, if they were true-I cannot judge-would be a cause for concern. Many honourable senators would have had similar concerns raised with them about people in workers' compensation and similar situations. It is the right of an honourable senator to raise those matters in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we ought to note two things about the matter before the Senate adjourns. Firstly, in terms of this Senate it is fundamentally a State Government matter that was raised and action on it is its responsibility. That does not make the matter inappropriate to raise but it is important to put that on the record. Secondly, I want to say, without in any way commenting on the accuracy of the allegations, that honourable senators need to be careful in the use of parliamentary privilege when they name people in relation to allegations. It may be absolutely accurate and it is a right of honourable senators to use the chamber in that way. But I think we ought to put on the record also that parliamentary privilege is something we all cherish and, therefore, it needs to be used carefully and not abused. I have noted the comments. </PARA>
