<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> That the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act, 1988 includes legislation, Part III-Changes to Non-Government Schools and New Non-Government Schools, designed to inhibit the establishment, growth and development of these schools in Australia by the imposition of restrictive provisions in the areas of funding, enrolments and approval criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should: reconsider the application and implications of this legislation in the light of justice, equity and freedom of choice for parents and have the unfair sections (Section 8 (2), 8 (15) and (11)) repealed.</PARA>

<TITLE>Animal Patents</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would reduce biodiversity, compromise animal welfare, concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more;</PARA>
<PARA>2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of the supplementary answers that were provided to the Committee-in fact, one in particular-related to various Audit reports to do with the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the operation of the office of DEET in Darwin. The question that I put on notice at page D51 asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What reports on the investigations into the alleged misuse of public money (through DEET Darwin) have been conducted? Can details be made available to the committee?</PARA>
<PARA>The actual answer that was tendered I can describe only as something out of Yes, Minister. I will read the answer that was given:</PARA>
<PARA>Following receipt of allegations some of which were anonymous and therefore difficult to pursue, the Department's Central Office recently conducted an initial investigation into the possible misuse of running cost funds some 1-2 years ago in the Darwin Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The resulting report recommended certain changes in the approach to financial administration in the Darwin Office and that the actions of a few individuals be the subject of further investigation. In accordance with standard Service-wide procedures a senior officer has been ordered under the Public Service Act to formally conduct that further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the initial report contains unconfirmed allegations, and personal details of individuals-some of whom are no longer public servants-and formal action is proceeding, it would be inappropriate to release details to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> That answer only heightens my desire to go further in asking questions. Initially it said, `Following receipt of allegations'. When were those allegations tendered? It then says, `The Department's Central Office recently conducted'. I ask when that happened in a date form. It says that the resulting report made recommendations. When was that report tabled-in more specific detail? Then it refers to `further investigation'. When did that further investigation start? When will it report? Has it already reported? What were the results? The point is made that it would be `inappropriate' to give further information to the Committee. When would it be appropriate? What formal action is now taking place? It is certainly just a Yes, Minister answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the last part of Senator Tambling's question, I think it is best to say that investigations are continuing and, as we have had in one or two other areas in this particular Committee-and Senator Tambling has been quite cooperative in those areas-one could prejudice the sorts of investigations that are continuing. Having said that in respect of the last part of Senator Tambling's questions, I am advised that in respect of the earlier questions there are a couple of answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I would prefer to do is defer answering those questions fully until later on this morning when we can check the details. I could, for instance, give him an answer to the question about when the investigations were conducted. The answer is late April or early May. With respect to when the allegations were first made, at this stage I could not give him a precise answer. If we can just defer those questions, I will take on board the point Senator Tambling makes that the answers have not been as precise as he would have liked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will take that pointer, given the assurance from the Minister that the information will be provided. I would also ask him to clarify his point that some of this detail may prejudice other actions. I would like to know what actions it could prejudice and what specific charges are being laid against individuals that could, therefore, be prejudiced by releasing some of this information. Are court cases proceeding, or are disciplinary actions taking place against departmental officers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have received answers with regard to the questions that were put. I have in my hand Streetwize comic No. 18. We have now received copies of some dozen earlier editions of this publication. The answer that is given is that the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) has spent $146,000 on Streetwize comic No. 18, of which $125,000 was paid in this financial year. The total moneys provided from DEET to the Streetwize comic series in the 1989-90 year was $209,756. But it is not clear what has been spent over recent years on Streetwize comics. What has been DEET's contribution for the whole series?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would surmise that if one of the issues, No. 18, cost $146,000, then the whole series would cost over $1m. Maybe the contribution of the Department of Employment, Education and Training is as substantial as that. Whatever the amount of public money that has been given to this publication, it is not at all clear to me who the members of Streetwize are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have an answer here that a national steering committee operates which comprises members of Streetwize and officers from the departments of Employment, Education and Training, Community Services and Health, Attorney-General's, Primary Industries and Energy, and Justice and Community Affairs, and from the Electoral Commission and the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, and others on an ad hoc basis. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that there was a pre-existing publication that was produced by a group called Streetwize and that they have gained the endorsement and very substantial resources of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and some cooperation from representatives of many departments of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the nature of Streetwize was before it gained this very substantial support from the Commonwealth. Could I have an answer as to how Streetwize originated? Is it an incorporated body? Is it a private body? Is it a cooperative? Is it a publisher? What is the nature of Streetwize?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague's question demands a lot of detail. At the outset I must say that in my previous portfolio, consumer affairs, I had the opportunity to use Streetwize as a mechanism to get information to young people. I found it extremely useful and important. I do not purport that this answer will be comprehensive because, as Senator Teague knows, we received no notice of the question. Any part that I have not answered this morning I will provide at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Streetwize comics began in mid-1984 as an initiative of Sydney legal education workers. I am told that the Redfern Legal Centre was vitally involved. A production team of two artists and two writer-researchers was employed and five years later 16 comics have been produced with more in production. Streetwize has also produced a number of special comics targeted at adults: Jailwise-AIDS education for prisoners; Top-up Money for Kids-Family Allowance Supplement for remote Aboriginal communities; and A Place for Us-the promotion of community health centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially the comics were distributed free to young people in youth refuges, youth centres and institutions throughout New South Wales. Distribution throughout government agencies and schools followed. Specially adapted State editions were then distributed through separate Streetwize projects set up in each State. Linking up the State projects has provided a national network for the comics. The first comic to be simultaneously distributed in all States was Social Security Rights and Benefits, No. 9 of the series. From comic No. 12 onwards all have been produced for national distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Streetwize concept has been successful. It has also taken root in England where health authorities are currently distributing 45,000 copies of a United Kingdom edition of the Streetwize AIDS comic in the Midlands. Canada and New Zealand have also adopted our ideas and now have their own Streetwize style youth information projects. Streetwize has also conducted a number of comic skills workshops in Sydney and Alice Springs working with young Aboriginal artists to develop and produce Centre comics and Shelter Me, a housing comic for the Tangentyere Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of funders and supporters is massive. Nationally it includes: the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET); the Department of Social Security; the Department of Primary Industries and Energy; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse; community employment program; the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health; Office of Youth Affairs; Bureau of Consumer Affairs; Office of the Status of Women; and the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. In New South Wales it includes: The Law Foundation of New South Wales; the New South Wales Department of Health; the New South Wales International Youth Year; the Drug and Alcohol Authority of New South Wales; and the Anti-Discrimination Board. In Victoria it includes: the Youth Affairs Division; the Department of Labour; the Health Department; the Law Foundation of Victoria; and the Victorian Commission for Equal Opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia it includes: the Legal Services Commission; South Australian Health Commission; Law Foundation of South Australia; South Australian Commission for Equal Opportunities; and the South Australian Electoral Department. In Western Australia it includes the Health Department of Western Australia and the Law Society of Western Australia Public Purposes Trust Fund. In Tasmania it includes the Law Foundation of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Department for Community Welfare. In the Australian Capital Territory it includes the ACT Health Authority and the AIDS Action Council of the ACT Inc., and in the Northern Territory it involves the Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very successful concept and one, which I did no know until this morning, has taken off internationally. It is a successful mechanism for conveying information to target groups and has been seen by the legal profession as being a useful mechanism for providing information for those groups. DEET rarely pays for the total amount of a production. That is obvious from the Streetwize funders and supporters which I have just referred to. Per edition comic prices range from $100,000 to $160,000. I cannot give a total all-up figure. That would not be within DEET's capacity. I will take on notice the question of whether a company runs Streetwize, whether it is incorporated or whether it is a collective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be interested in the answers to those questions that have not been answered so far. In a paper that was given to me at 10 o'clock this morning-about 20 minutes ago-there is a statement that the committee of officers of various departments both agree on the scheduling of the topics to be covered and reviews the broad content. Streetwize authors develop the detail and style of the text to best communicate the message to the target audience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For a few minutes I will look at the question of broad content on the one hand that is seen to be the responsibility of officers of the departments, and on the other hand to look at detail and style which is seen to be the responsibility of the Streetwize authors. In differentiating these two parts, I note that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and the Government entirely endorse the 18 comics that have been produced, endorse the mechanism that has been put in place and endorse the spending of this amount of taxpayers' money. I can assume from the Minister's statements that he not only endorses the broad content but also is entirely happy with the detail, style and message. </PARA>
<PARA> I outline briefly to the Committee one article that caught my attention in comic No. 18. It is all about the last Federal election and the encouragement for young people to enrol if they are older than age 17 and then to vote. I have no difficulty with encouraging all Australians to gain their rights by enrolling, by voting and by being as informed as possible in order to exercise their vote in their own best interests and in the best interests of the whole country. Those principles are unexceptionable. In this exercise I am sure there have been such good intentions by the Government and by the Australian Electoral Commission. In answer to a question asked about the Department of Administrative Services estimates yesterday I learned that $20,000 of the Electoral Commission's money went into comic No. 18 for an article which I will outline. </PARA>
<PARA> My difficulty is not with the concept of speaking in the vocabulary of a particular minority group of young Australians. In this Parliament I was once responsible, with other honourable senators, for a national language policy. I acknowledge the importance of recognising the language that all of us have, whether it is a language other that English or whether it is a subset of English. I also acknowledge that other countries have had degrees of success with this style of presentation to a particular vocabulary group. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to what disturbs me about this particular article. In the first picture in the comic we have a young Australian male pushing his way disrespectfully into, what I presume to be, a post office to get his enrolment form. Then there is a diagram where Tarzan-like he goes with his enrolment form back to his home. The caption says, `Where your family lives' and it depicts a couple of gorillas, one of whom is smoking a pipe. Then underneath it shows a great big black hole with a caption, `Where you were born'. It also shows a series of snow-capped mountain peaks with the caption, `Where you enrolled before'. Maybe, all of this--</PARA>

In the first two frames is an impression of disrespect for the notion of where people once lived, whether it matters, where their family lives, where they were born-all of this parodied. Even a person coming to get the form is parodied as going in to the post office with something less than courtesy to get an enrolment form. It then goes on to show a television with a gaping, teeth-like screen, with a hand reaching out of the television set to a young Australian and the caption:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Hello fellow Australians . . .Let's be friends! Shake your hand! Kiss your baby?</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is saying not to trust the political process, the department or anybody-that they are all going to set the voters up and take them down. In the fourth frame it states:</PARA>
<PARA>When an election is called you have 7 days to enrol before the list of names (rolls) are closed!</PARA>
<PARA>The television set is going wild with excitement about enrolling. </PARA>
<PARA> The next frame is a parody of a politician standing up over a poster which says to `vote 1' for him. He is saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Free pizza for the long term unemployed! All yuppies have to go to the toilet upside down. </PARA>
<PARA>Underneath it states:</PARA>
<PARA>It's up to you to decide who to vote for-your vote is secret. </PARA>

<PARA>The next drawing is of all sorts of grinning politicians or political party advocates and one has an elbow in another one's face. All of them are thrusting forward pieces of paper telling people how they should vote. The young Australian goes through them all and says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe it is a donkey. So the cartoon goes on. Along the top of the polling booths are written the words `scratch', `scrawl', `scratch', `scritch', `scratch'. This gives the impression that it does not matter too much what one writes on the ballot paper. It is a derogatory description. It is a parody of what people are doing in exercising their vote in polling booths. Underneath the drawing, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sometimes people organise protest votes and put a sticker or something on the ballot paper-</PARA>
<PARA>And in great, bold letters-</PARA>
<PARA> That's OK!</PARA>
<PARA>It is as though it is saying that it is all right if, as a result of reading this article, people go into a post office; slam open the door; demand an enrolment form; make some rude remark to their family on returning home; show a direct distancing from responsible television announcements from the Australian Electoral Commission; hear various political spokesmen but send them up and regard them all as dishonest because of all the ironies of this comic; see a competition in how-to-vote cards and believe that politicians are not interested in the voter but only in their own smile or good fortune; then, on coming into the polling booth, regard not only themselves but others as just scritching and scrawling rather than exercising their responsible vote on election day; and then put across their ballot form a protest such as, `Go .... . .... It is as though the comic is saying that that degree of participation in the polling booth at a general election is okay. This comic can come out a matter of weeks before an election and be distributed much more than usual, with more taxpayers' money spent on that process than usual. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the last caption it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Goodnight and good luck voters!</PARA>
<PARA>It is as though it is saying that young Australians will not achieve very much by putting this little protest on a ballot form; that it will not be taken very seriously by anybody, and it wishes good luck to them. Frankly, this is not a set of attitudes that I and colleagues who have spoken to me wish to reinforce amongst young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> If the themes of this story, circulated to thousands of young Australians, had been carefully examined and considered by the Electoral Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, I would be surprised if they would have endorsed this kind of parody of what it means for young Australians to exercise their votes as citizens of this country.

<PARA> I will not bore the Committee by going over the 17 or 18 other comics which are about sex, drugs, pollution of Sydney's beaches, sex discrimination, homosexuality, mistreatment in a place of employment and so on. I do not doubt that all of these subjects are important in terms of information going to all Australians so that they are aware of what is truthful and what it is in their interests to know in order to avoid the trampling of their rights or the endangering of their lives as far as some of the health issues are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I am two-thirds in agreement with the principle of this communication. I agree that it is essential to understand the vocabulary of a minority group of Australians, and I agree that it is important to raise a certain range of topics-such as those I have seen. But the vital area which I am not convinced about, which my colleagues who have spoken to me are not convinced about-and I put it to the Minister and to this Committee that the majority of Australians would not be convinced about it-is the style of presenting a caricature that reinforces antisocial and other negative attitudes among the young Australians to whom these publications are directed. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore again bring this to the attention of the Government, the departments I have named, the Electoral Commission and, indeed, the State bodies that have been mentioned, and ask that they re-examine this third part of the overall basis of this publication and satisfy themselves that this is not having a counterproductive effect. Yes, certainly, it is in a language style that is received by the group; yes, certainly, it raises some important topics; but it fails actually to communicate the messages that, presumably, are intended because of the overemphasis on reinforcing negative attitudes. These negative attitudes are not going to serve Australians well and are not going to serve individuals well in the way in which they exercise their right to vote and their right to make decisions in their personal lives in the areas that have been addressed by these comics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I draw your attention to an answer that was circulated, presumably by the Minister this morning, which I have only just received in my office. The question which I put on notice and which has now been answered related to the circulation and distribution of the comics. I think that the answer given gives Senator Walters the access to discuss this matter. The answer is, firstly, that Streetwize targets disadvantaged young people through youth refuges, youth access centres and street workers and, as appropriate, through relevant government agencies, technical and further education institutions, colleges of advanced education and schools. Secondly, DEET distributes Streetwize through youth access centres and Commonwealth Employment Service offices. Distribution is not electorate-based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe that it is totally accepted that the Department handles all of the distribution of the comic, and that it is appropriate for Senator Walters to raise the question that she is seeking to raise with regard to the same comics that were distributed to all of us this morning in answer to these questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister may not be aware that in this particular comic the first couple of pages talk about drugs. It is all in cartoon form. It does not at any stage suggest that `shooting up' is not a good thing. What it says, only, is that a new needle should be used-but not in that language. It shows someone caught short without a new needle, but who must have the drugs, how to clean a needle successfully. There is not a word about not using the drugs, just a very explicit description of how to clean a needle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comic then goes on to sex. This is for school kids. I ask the Minister for the age of the children. I gather that the Minister will get the age that is being targeted within the schools. When dealing with sex, the comic is extremely explicit and uses the sort of language that you will not allow Hansard to print, Mr Chairman. I would not use it in this chamber. It makes it very clear that condoms should be used at all times. There are very explicit depictions of how to use condoms and how to use them successfully. They are very explicit depictions. I might show you the comic, Mr Chairman; I am sure you would be interested in seeing the nature of the stuff being put to young children, being put to our school children. </PARA>
<PARA> The edition also has the cops arrive at a very rough party where the language is appalling, everyone is drunk and a considerable amount of sexual activity takes place. It goes on through all this till we reach the homosexual side and two young lads go off to have a homosexual relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying to the Minister is that if the Department of Education, or the Department of Community Services and Health-I do not care which it is-sends this stuff around to the children in schools, the children reading this cannot help but say, `Oh, well, if the Department of Education is not saying it's bad to take drugs, but only that you've got to use a clean needle, then it's not so bad to be shooting up as long as you have the clean needles.' The school children may then say, `Okay, we can have the sorts of parties that are depicted in this comic and there is nothing much wrong with it'. A young girl is shown as refusing to have sex because the bloke has not brought his condoms. She says, `Well, aren't you a lucky boy, I have'. When she hands a handful to him, he says, `So many?'. She says, `Well, we may need 'em. Come on, this is fun.' Then we have the description of how to use the condoms. This is being distributed to school children by the Department of Education or the Department of Health. I do not believe that the majority of school children have sex with anyone at a party. I do not believe that the majority of children in our schools are doing that. I want to know what excuse the Department could possibly have for conveying the impression that that is what is going on and that it is perfectly all right for it to be going on so long as you take along a packet of condoms. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the latter editions, I believe that the Minister ought to find out just whether, as he claimed a little while ago, these Streetwize comics are successful. Successful in doing what? I would be very interested to know what evaluation has been done such that he has come out very clearly to say that the comics have proved successful. Has any evaluation been done on these Streetwize comics? I am very interested in his comment `Obviously, there has' and in the type of evaluation. I wait for the Minister's response to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go on to answer the question Senator Walters raised. Evaluations are conducted on each of the comics and we will get the evaluations that are available to us for the Committee and Senator Walters. An evaluation component is part of every comic project. It is important that in assessing the value of the comics we have access to those particular evaluations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of why I would say that these comics are important-and I think I can go to edition No. 15, which is the one Senator Walters raised-I will just recite to the Committee a number of endorsements that were given to edition No. 15 to indicate that the mechanism, the manner of communicating this information, has been recognised as being important. Obviously we do not anticipate that we can be totally successful. For instance, a New South Wales project team in its final report of a survey on AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and their effects on youth services had this to say about Streetwize No. 15:</PARA>
<PARA>Streetwise comics were considered as the most appropriate way of reaching young people in relation to AIDS and STDs. Streetwise comics were the overwhelming choice of 90 per cent of agencies. They were seen as being innovative, youth-focused and hooked into an overall youth culture that personified disadvantaged young people. </PARA>
<PARA>We have an endorsement from Sister Sue Metcalfe from the East Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service, who says:</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to applaud your streetwise comic No. 7 . . . it provides a refreshing educational format that few teenagers can ignore. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of No. 7, we also had an international endorsement from the Nottingham University evaluation of the pilot version of Streetwize No. 7, once again touching on the same issues:</PARA>
<PARA>Young people had a 10 per cent better retention of information after reading Streetwise comics than Health Department pamphlets, posters and publications. </PARA>
<PARA>I am saying that, no matter how we may not be tuned into the language or to the messages of Streetwize, there is obviously a problem out there in terms of AIDS and alerting and educating people to the dangers of it. Both nationally and internationally, the mechanism of this particular comic book approach has been one that has been recognised as useful and productive. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of whom the comics were distributed to, particularly No. 8 and No. 15, no-one can say with certainty whether they were actually distributed to children, young children, older children or whatever. We have to recognise that kids do get into sex. I will obtain full information for Senator Walters and inform the Committee whether this particular edition was distributed in any way to schools and, if so, to children of what age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak as a teacher of some 20 years experience, until changing my occupation a few months ago. I have quite a bit of experience with the minority group to whom these magazines are targeted. This is a particularly at-risk group that ordinary, everyday teaching does not reach. At best, they are fringe dwellers in the education system. They come and go, and frequently they go, virtually permanently. The only way we can get anything across to them is to attract their attention and to motivate them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been a very successful means of getting them to at least look at these issues. Otherwise, the only form of getting any information across to them is to sit them down in whatever their location is and make them read through pamphlets. They are quite happy to read these comics. They pass them round among friends. From my experience in South Australia, that is often how these magazines get into schools-they are not actively distributed within the schools but are brought in and discussed by this minority of school students. Frequently those teenagers that, I guess, other senators would describe as ordinary teenagers are not interested in them, but they are certainly very well read amongst the target group, and I believe they are very successful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the issues that were raised in the Minister's earlier reply and by Senator Lees need to be addressed in the context of the answer that was given to the questions I raised in the Committee in which I sought details of the circulation and distribution. The answer that was given was, firstly, that they were distributed as appropriate through relevant government agencies, technical and further education colleges, colleges of advanced education and schools and, secondly, that they were distributed through youth access centres and Commonwealth Employment Service offices. I can quite appreciate that there are particular and very necessary target groups that have to be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As both Senator Teague and Senator Walters have pointed out, much of the editorial content of these magazines is very questionable by normal and routine community standards. I have had electoral representations from parents who have had these comics brought to their attention-usually brought home by children who are not in the target groups but in the younger age groups that need not necessarily be exposed either to the issues or to the foul language and graphic descriptions in many areas of unacceptable sexual, drug and alcohol related activities by many groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to ascertain whether the Government has some form of policy with regard to the distribution to ensure that it is reaching only specific target groups and, in the area of school distributions, how it is then ensured that children who do not need the information do not receive it. We all know that peer pressure works two ways: as Senator Lees has pointed out, it can be an educative tool for many of the disadvantaged groups, but for a particular group in those adolescent years it can also work adversely by making unacceptable behaviour appear to be routine and normal. As I have said, I have certainly had electoral representations from parents who find the presentation of much of the content reaching those particular groups very offensive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers the Minister is giving me refer to target groups. Senator Lees has said that the ordinary teenager would not be interested in reading these magazines. I doubt that very much. If healthy 15- or 16-year-old girls or boys were handed this magazine, I do not believe for a minute that they would not thumb through it and read it. Of course they would be interested in it. There is something wrong with them if they are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I am making is: do these magazines go into the schools generally or are they targeted at a very small, high-risk minority group, as Senator Lees has said? The opening page talks about drugs and mentions that there has to be a clean needle and explains how to clean a needle if there is no clean needle available. If these magazines are targeted at a very small, high-risk minority, at least one child should be depicted refusing drugs altogether. This has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Department of Employment, Education and Training on about by allowing these magazines to go to small fringe at-risk groups without depicting one child refusing to take drugs? The whole lot of them were on drugs. The only concern is that they must have a clean needle. Senator Bolkus might care to throw off at me and say that I am Victorian or mid-Victorian. If that is the case, I say that the Minister is more in line or in touch with that small fringe at-risk group than I am. </PARA>

That is not an evaluation, nor is it an evaluation to ask teachers, `How did this go down in school?'. Evaluation is whether a project was successful or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am asking the Minister to find out what true evaluation has been done by an outside, independent authority, over what period and what the result of that evaluation was. Did magazine No. 15 result in a reduction in drug taking and of only clean needles being used if drugs are taken? It was the Minister, not me, who said that an evaluation has been done. I want the details of a proper evaluation of the success rate. The Minister said that the magazine in question was an old one. I presume it has been evaluated. I presume the Minister knows whether it has resulted in what the Department was aiming to get across-whatever that happened to be, I am not sure. I hope the Minister will be able to come back to me with something substantial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the unanswered questions relates to school groups visiting this Parliament House. Through the Department of Employment, Education and Training, arrangements are made to subsidise some of the cost of a group of students travelling, particularly from distant States, to visit this building. At the time the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, put in place these new arrangements-I think on 4 October last year-there was a lot of controversy because the money was available only through the House of Representatives. On 6 October the President of the Senate stated in this chamber:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I received a submission from the Parliamentary Education Office that it was the obvious office to pay the subsidy and administer the scheme with a view to offering these students the opportunity to take part in a parliamentary education program. The Speaker was unable to agree that the Parliamentary Education Office should be the office administering this scheme and paying the subsidy. He preferred that the Sergeant-at-Arms administer the scheme. I do not agree. </PARA>
<PARA> I am of the view that the Parliamentary Education Office, as the specifically mandated office in the Parliament for parliamentary education purposes, should be administering the scheme. The Speaker and the Minister have therefore decided that initially the Sergeant-at-Arms should administer the scheme. I do not believe that the members are directly going to receive the cheque to pay the subsidy. I am still checking that fact. </PARA>
<PARA>The answers given in the Estimates are still inadequate and no doubt further answers will be given. It is my view-and I believe that the more this matter is discussed it will be the wider chamber view-that this scheme ought to continue in terms of meeting some of the costs of school groups, particularly those from distant States, but that there ought to be an efficient and single administration. As the President has reported to this chamber, that ought to be the Education Office of this Parliament-not the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Sergeant-at-Arms or the Usher of the Black Rod. There needs to be one reform that will consolidate the standing of the Education Office in this Parliament for this to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> With Senator Patterson, Senator McLean and some others I took part in a Senate inquiry which looked at the rights of citizenship. We considered the encouragement that ought to be given to Australians, including young Australians, so they know that they have access to decision makers at the local government, State government and Federal government levels. As a result of our report stressing the importance of enhancing the information about citizenship that is provided to Australians, the Education Office of this Parliament was established, but as yet the office has been unable to find a secure place within the structure of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Education Office could well be placed as a discrete unit associated with the Parliamentary Library and therefore under the general supervision of the elected members of the Library Committee. At the moment the Education Office does not come under any scrutiny by elected members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, other than the Presiding Officers. I see this as a temporary position. I believe that the Education Office, like all the other departments and activities in this building, should find a place such as the Library where there is a Library Committee of elected members which is chaired by a Presiding Officer. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Education Office is given that kind of stability and scrutiny, I believe that it ought to administer the parliamentary education scheme. Whilst administering the subsidies that are provided by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, it should also supervise the education information that is given in this building-involving, wherever possible, the relevant members and senators associated with any school group that visits the building-and at the same time make arrangements for seating in the galleries and the morning or afternoon tea that is provided in discussion in the usual way. I put that proposition forward for further discussion over the coming months. I do so in response to the questions that have been only partly answered in the Estimates Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to question No. 22. I note that an answer has been given to my question concerning the profile of Chinese students in Australia over the past five years. It is clear that in 1989 some 13,000 Chinese students were present in this country for study on a subsidised basis, or paying full fees, undertaking higher education, technical and further education, secondary education, English language education or special studies. The numbers have been increasing in all of those categories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Due to the pressure of time in this debate, I will not expand upon the meaning of the numbers that I have just been given. But I note that there has been a rapid expansion over the last five years in the number of students from the People's Republic of China in this country. I happen to believe that Australia can make an important contribution to all of the countries in our region by accepting overseas students, especially on a full fee paying basis that does not draw upon the taxpayers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I underline that there are many of us who see that we have a positive role to play with regard to assisting students from China. However, not only because of the massacre that occurred in Tiananmen Square last June, and all of its continuing implications for the students who were then in this country-and for other persons in China wishing to become students in this country-but also because this Government had not thought through carefully its policies with regard to the types of students who could most successfully take the studies in the various categories that I have mentioned, there have been serious problems regarding the numbers and the success of Chinese students undertaking these courses in Australia. Perhaps there is some degree of remedy in the guidelines that were announced last October, and perhaps there will be remedies on the other front following the Government's consideration of the immigration status of students, in doubt since last June. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that this chamber will be watching most carefully the decisions of the Government regarding the Chinese student program in this country. We want to see that the program is successful and that it serves the broad purpose of bipartisan support in this country and in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one other matter relating to a question that we skipped over-unanswered question No. 5, concerning objective measures of outcomes of Dawkins's reforms. There was a general answer made available yesterday as to the means that we all have to evaluate reform by the Labor Government in higher education over the last few years. One of those reforms was the establishment of the higher education contribution scheme (HECS)-colloquially known as the graduate tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that included in the papers which I have received, since the Estimates Committee is the report entitled The Impact of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) Evaluations and Investigations Program. The authors are Frances Robertson, Judith Sloan, and Neil Bardsley. It is a publication of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Included with this summary document were two more empirical publications-one a study in Victoria by the same authors, and another in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly wish to note that the findings of this two-part inquiry, based upon samples in Victoria and Western Australia, are of very considerable importance. I note that in a survey, those who did not enrol were asked what factors had led them not to be enrolled in higher education, and only a quite small minority regarded the HEC scheme as being very important in determining their non-enrolment, not proceeding with their undergraduate degree, or not enrolling in post-graduate studies. The figures that are given here are 2 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Page 23 of the report concludes that there is a greater deterrent from the introduction of HECS amongst post-graduate students. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion I want to explore, only briefly now but at various points in the months ahead, is that the present number of students exempt from HECS, which this Government has established at only 18,000, ought to be expanded, particularly with regard to post-graduate students. Before the last election the Opposition put forward the view that 85,000 students should be exempt from the user-pay element-whether HECS or an up-front fee. I believe that the document before us demonstrates that we are losing the potential of many bright graduating students from contributing more to this country through gaining experience in post-graduate study. Indeed, in some particular areas of post-graduate specialisation there is a serious shortfall in the numbers of students who are enrolling. </PARA>
<PARA> One way to address indeed, give encouragement to, enrolment in critical areas such as post-graduate work in engineering, in mathematics, in some areas of science, and even in some applied areas such as languages, is to extend exemption from HECS to a group of students. One way of responding to this evaluation of HECS would be to extend the number of students exempt, particularly at the post-graduate level. There is reference to external students. There is also a recognition that a knee-jerk reaction from some students would be to find in a new government program a scapegoat as the reason they did not continue with their studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking all that into account, it is actually heartening, I believe, to see that a majority of students do not dissent from a student contribution to the cost of their education. At the moment, HECS is levied at about 20 per cent of the cost of undertaking a higher education course-that is, the taxpayer provides 80 per cent of the cost and the student undertaking the course 20 per cent. The Opposition was wanting to bring in a more comprehensive user pay element but, at the same time, reduce it to 12 per cent of the overall cost. To that extent, there was a common element in Government and Opposition that there be now entrenched a user pay element in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> This was disputed by some representatives of independent parties and the Democrats, who still have the view that there ought to be a zero user pay element for higher education, that students ought not to pay anything at all with regard to their studies. However, this report shows-a view that I have put forward on a number of occasions publicly in the last six months-that a majority of students accept that they ought to pay a proportion of the costs of their studies. In fact, even in this survey that had a 45 per cent return bias towards those who were more troubled by HECS, it was clear that over half of the sample agreed that students should pay something towards their higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that issue is now settled in Australia, and in answer to my questions then about evaluating reforms over the last two years the forwarding of this document is significant. I believe that it is now clearly established that a large majority of students and overwhelming numbers of representatives in the Parliament recognise that about 12 to 20 per cent of the cost of higher education ought to be borne by the student through one mechanism or another. I would like to introduce a number of other ways of evaluating HECS into debates in this chamber in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in regard to the reforms that have been outlined by this Government, colloquially called the Dawkins reforms, I note that a clear answer has not so far been given by the Government with regard to a proposition that there be a charter of academic freedoms. If the Minister has anything to add at this point, I would be grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is now my assumption, and the Opposition's assumption, that the Government will not proceed with this concept that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, so crudely put forward without proper consultation and without any careful preparation, and which has now fallen flat on its face-and that is, the so-called charter of academic freedoms. Once one begins to enumerate the actual freedoms in our higher education institutions, one will end up by limiting those freedoms, in the same way that once there is a Bill of Rights, if ever anything was still to be debated in this Parliament, one would end up by putting in concrete and enumerating those rights in a way that detracts from the rights of Australian citizens. That is why this side of the House is opposed to a Bill of Rights and opposed to a charter of academic freedoms. We are in favour of enhancing people's rights and this profession's freedoms, and I would like to hear the assurance of the Minister, if he can give it, that this mistake of many made by the present Government in higher education will in fact now, because it has been so discredited, not be proceeded with. </PARA>

<PARA> I understand that the Government and the Bureau have a target of having material ready for a major national forum in November this year. For that forum to best succeed I believe that the material ought to be widely distributed and be begun to be evaluated ahead of that time. It is clear that, given various statements over the last six weeks, there will be and there ought to be a major immigration debate in this country. We should ask the following questions: What should be the size and what should be the shape of immigration in this country? What are the benefits of immigration? We have already had a most careful inquiry which has considered these questions, the FitzGerald Commission to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which produced a major report. I and the Opposition have welcomed the findings of that report and have been critical of the Government over the past 18 months to the extent that it has not implemented a number of the FitzGerald Commission's findings. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also been directly critical of the Government in that with frequent changes of immigration policy, with an inadequate response to the FitzGerald report, with too hasty an implementation of the important legislative and regulatory changes last year, the Australian public still remains confused about the important area of immigration. It will be essential over the next four and five months that we see in this country the regaining of popular confidence in immigration and immigration procedures. Therefore, the work of the Bureau has a special significance. It is highly strategic that there be a maximising of information so that all those who want to be involved in this public and parliamentary debate have the facts available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from experience that in an area that can be as controversial as immigration there are dangers of all sorts of hares running down burrows, of all sorts of issues arising that cloud the debate and take it away from a sensible informed basis. In order for that not to happen, I put to the Government that in the next six months additional resources should be given to the Bureau so that its work can be completed in a timely fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even more briefly, I am appalled at the failure of the Government and the Department to answer questions in this area. Where there have been answers given it appears that the Department does not have an informed population policy. That is, the Government has not given to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs a policy with regard to the population of Australia. This is another reason why there is a failure of public confidence in this Government in areas of immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We may well ask in an Estimates committee: what is the Government's population policy? That is, should we over the coming 30 years have an explicit goal as to what the Australian population ought to be? What kind of age profile should we be trying to achieve, given that there will be a definite ageing of the present population? What kind of expectations do we have of the size of families over the coming decades? Will there be two or three children per family? What kind of encouragements ought we to give to Australians to think through their individual family numbers and the wider community implications of families with two, three or four children?</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the immigration selection procedures, the Opposition, along the lines of the FitzGerald inquiry, has been pressing for younger, well qualified, skilled migrants to take a larger proportion of the 140,000 places currently available under the immigration program. In part, one of the arguments for this is not only the direct economic benefit to this country through such changing of priorities, but also that the immigration to this country of persons of a younger age will help to give a more even balance to the age of the total population of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to touch upon a number of the elements that ought to be referred to in the intersection of population policy and immigration policy. However, when we ask questions of this Government as to its population policy, we find it does not have one; it has nothing to say. It does not have a carefully determined approach to these matters. When the Department of Immigration is determining its own policy decisions, when it is evaluating its programs, whilst it admirably has explicit objectives, with regard to the various programs of the Department, that it ought to give consideration to Australia's overall population policy, the Department is not informed. The Department has not been given direction with regard to Australia's population policy. Yet there are resources in our demographic departments in universities. There are all manner of groups in the community that have views about this, yet we have not seen any statement of Government policy with regard to population. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to this Committee that we have a gaping vacuum, an enormous lapse in the failure of this Government to address the matter. I believe that not only would the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs be well served by this becoming explicit during the debates over the next few months but also that all of the procedures of government would be informed by the establishment of an explicit population policy for this country after full consultation with every element of the Australian public that would want to contribute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose at the outset I should say that we on this side of the Parliament are looking forward to the forthcoming election that Senator Teague is running for. After that we might come back to some rational time constraints in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague made a point about optimum best population for Australia. For the sake of comprehensiveness and decency in this debate, let us acknowledge that no past government has actually put a figure on a final outcome. Unless I am totally wrong, I do not think even any political party has a particular figure that it puts forward as the optimum population for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is extensive literature on what might be an optimum or best population for Australia; there is also literature on what may very well be a sustainable population on an indefinite basis. The key conclusion that that literature, the parties and governments have come to is, basically, that no single figure is meaningful. I would have thought that Senator Teague, with his experience in this area, probably would have understood that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Any estimate, of course, depends on a whole range of factors. It depends on the quality of life involving the choices that the population makes about the consumption of water and other resources; it depends on the geographic distribution of people, effort expended on environmental management and so on; it depends on future technological developments; and it depends on the future discovery of non-renewable resources and the like. To actually put a figure on the best or the optimum population for Australia is basically something that no government, past or present, no party, past or present, has done. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, research is going on. It is very easy to seek the short and simple answer. A consultant's report, entitled The Physical Limitations to Population Growth in Australia, to the inquiry conducted by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, known as the CAAIP inquiry, provides a very useful overview on a range of issues and the wide range of figures suggested for Australia. It also provides an overview of the literature that is available, and it might be worthwhile going into that. Of course, the Government understands generally that research can be done on many aspects which affect decisions on the appropriate rate of population levels. The Bureau of Immigration Research has identified this as one of its priority research areas leading up to the National Outlook Conference to be held late this year. As Senator Teague might know, we have also initiated discussions with the Commission for the Future on the development of a joint research program. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole range of interrelated issues are involved. Senator Teague raised two points which dealt basically with youth and skills in our migration program. The short answer is that at the moment we have a higher level of skills coming into this country than at any time since figures have been kept. We have a points test which provides great emphasis on youth. In fact, the highest number of points to enter Australia can be attained if one is between the ages of 18 and 24 years. The Opposition should acknowledge that Government policy in these two areas-that is, the recognition of the need for skills and the recognition of the need to emphasise youth-is geared in the direction which Opposition senators claim they want it to be geared and has been effective in achieving those objectives. I apologise for not saying earlier that I have a copy of the BIR Bulletin, issue No. 1, April 1990. For the sake of decency, I will ask someone to take it around to Senator Teague. </PARA>

I am sure that is not what Senator Teague meant when questioning Senator Bolkus. As the Minister quite rightly said in his reply, it is impossible to forecast at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this exercise were being done a hundred years ago, one could have said, `Well, maybe 10 million is the most'. But who is to know? As the Minister said, what other renewable resources will be discovered. Who is to know what other inventions will be developed by human intelligence? Who could have forecast some 30 years ago that the copper industry, which looked as though it was going to be in very short supply of copper, would now be in great difficulty? I suppose that the test of the scarcity of any commodity is its price. If one has a look at a range of minerals, and indeed of food, one will see that their price is at rock bottom. There are plenty of resources and food; it is the distribution of them which is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with what the Minister said. The idea of sustainable population growth is really a nonsense if one thinks of it in those terms. I do not think Senator Teague was asking the Government to determine a population policy, one element of which would be: what is the maximum desirable population for Australia? I do not think that was what he was getting at. I presume he was thinking about something which, I think, was raised by Senator Olsen in his maiden speech when he indicated that the migration flow is going largely to the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne. I seem to recall Senator Olsen saying that South Australia certainly did not receive its fair share of migrants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Chapman said, only about half of its share. I would like to know the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs' policy in regard to the distribution throughout Australia of intending migrants or migrants. I would also like to know its view-and, I suppose, what the Government's view is-on the question of decentralisation. Senator Olsen also raised that question in his maiden speech. I know that these population-type issues are addressed but we would like to hear more about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must make a point here: I acknowledge the very valuable work that the Department has done over many years on analysing population patterns, age patterns and specifically, the likely age patterns by the year 2015, given current trends. This work is very useful. Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the Department for its work in these fields. Much of its work is very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know what the Government's policy is in respect of the dispersion of migrants throughout Australia. I know that the Government will probably say, `You cannot make fish of one and fowl of the other'. The Government cannot say to the migrants coming into the country, `You have to go to this particular place and that particular State and you have to stay there for the rest of your life'. Of course, that would make them second-class citizens. But if jobs available in decentralised areas are made attractive, then there will be a flow of migrants and other people to those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia suffers the same problem as many other countries, including less developed countries, in that there is a drift to the cities. Why? Because that is where the money goes. Senator Olsen said-and I agree-that there is a great need in Australia for policies on decentralisation, financial incentives and so on to be accelerated so that industries and economic activity in the less developed areas can be developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course not. Essentially, the Government tries to decentralise through the immigration program by working out a system whereby extra points are given to those in the categories where this policy can be made to work. Particularly in the case of concessional family members, extra points are given depending on where the sponsors live. I believe that each State government has the capacity to designate extra points for particular areas. If people are sponsored by people living in particular areas within that State then they can get extra points. That is applied in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. I gather that Tasmania and South Australia do not have designated areas that would attract extra points. There is a bent in the policy towards trying to achieve that outcome. But, as Senator Harradine quite rightly said, going further might be trying to achieve the impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond very briefly to the two statements of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). I am not involved in any personal election that might in any way colour my contribution to this committee debate. I raise this matter because I am concerned that the Department for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has given an answer that the Government does not have an explicit population policy, even though it is one of the Department's objectives to take that into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I welcome all that has been said by Senator Harradine, who gave a rather glowing account of the `valuable answer given by the Minister two speeches ago', in my view the Minister misunderstood that when we in the Opposition are asking about an explicit population policy, we are not asking for a one-line answer as to what the population size ought to be in 30 years time. That is only one element that no doubt even then would have parameters and be stated in the context of a description of where it is envisaged that Australia is going over the next generation or two. What I have in mind is a White Paper-a careful statement of fact, a careful statement of options and a careful statement of the implications for Australia's population that would flow from the various compositions of immigration over a 10- or 20-year period, and all the other factors that lead domestically to the shape of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that we do not have an explicit White Paper on all of the parameters that go to the description of what I call a comprehensive population policy. We had something approaching this 10 years ago when Mr MacKellar was Minister for Immigration and when Professor Zubrzycki was chairman of a major immigration and population advisory committee to the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that in a copy of the Bureau's research bulletin that has just been given to me two of the papers address the question of population policy. For instance, the very first one mentioned on page 27 in the outline of various projects and publications is `Population Policy Options: Dr Christabel Young'. Another states `Australia's population trends and prospects'. These are valuable projects, but I am looking for a White Paper on population-a comprehensive statement of the facts, the options and government policy and for that to be determined in a consultative way. Of course, the discursive list that the Minister referred to contained elements. But all the Minister could do was give a list of some of the factors and make the odd disparaging remarks about an over-zealous calling for defining to the third decimal point some population that we might be aspiring to in 30 years time. I am not interested in those superficial observations; I am interested in a comprehensive population policy arrived at on the basis of consultation. I am not now looking for the Minister's response; I would like to move on to another matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the sake of comprehensiveness I should very briefly respond to Senator Teague's particular point. In terms of explicit population policy and immigration policy there is either the short term outlook, which focuses in terms of direction, or the long term outlook, which focuses on final outcome. We should all recognise that there is a short term policy in place with emphasis on a mixture of youth, skills, business and family reunion. We should recognise that it is geared very much towards meeting the needs of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the long term, I will not go through the list of reports I mentioned earlier. I stress the point that a White Paper is one thing. The Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies was quite instrumental and useful in canvassing the issues, but even in that process a wide range of population outcomes and migration levels was canvassed by different members of that Committee. I think Senator Teague recognises that the outlook conference, which he focused on quite often as well last week in the Estimates Committee, has been quite pivotal in bringing together all strains of thought on this particular issue and allowing people to get together and take stock of where we are going. That will probably be a good starting point for the sort of discussion and documents that Senator Teague is looking for. </PARA>

I am seeking from the Minister some indication of the timetable on this particular matter.

<PARA> I can confirm that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) will be writing to Senator Tambling very shortly in response to the matters he raised with us. Further than that, all I can really say is that it has been necessary to consult with those undertaking the investigation in the Territory. That consultation has not as yet been completed in terms of responding to Senator Tambling, and it is not intended to provide the specific information sought until it is confirmed that the release of information will not compromise the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of whether I can say one thing about one person who may or may not be involved, and not make comment on the others, I think it is probably proper that I make absolutely no judgment on any person who may be involved in this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise the issue of an answer that was given to me in relation to one of the questions at the Estimates Committee hearing relating to the annual cost resources, et cetera, required to handle fishing incursions through Broome and northern Australia. I raise this matter, as I have done in a number of Estimates committees, with regard to various departments because obviously the matter is now very serious. As the answer that has been circulated to me would indicate-it has a `No. 13' on the top of the page-over the last two financial years and for the nine months to 30 April 1990 it is obvious that the number of Indonesian fishermen apprehended is a matter of great concern. In the year 1987-88 there were a total of 274, in the year 1988-89 there were 487 and in the 10-month period to 30 April 1990 there were 175.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What concerns me with regard to the answer given relates to the particular basis on which the costings of these resources have been worked out. The answer details numbers according to State-either Northern Territory, Western Australia or Queensland-of fishermen apprehended in each situation requiring repatriation or deportation, then a cost aspect put against each State division, and then a further column relates to the resources that were required to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot ascertain any consistency in the financial basis on which this matter has been put down. For example, in 1987-88 in the Northern Territory the number of fishermen apprehended was 17. The cost is shown as $2,040, requiring eight hours of resources. Therefore I would presume, just doing some ordinary mathematics, that the cost per hour was $255. If we apply that same formula across the subsequent two financial years shown, the figure was $271 per hour in 1988-89 but suddenly leapfrogs in the current financial year to some $594. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, if we look at the figure for Western Australia, where there is obviously a different departmental basis for working out the costings-a formula that is appropriated to what is called staff days-the cost in 1987-88 was $10,866, in 1988-89 it was $9,619 and in the current financial year it is only about half that, $4,833. Similarly the figure varies from minor figures that are also shown in the last two financial years for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to be that the allocation of finances on this form of budgeting, which shows no consistency, has not been developed in a way that we can put any credibility on or rely on. Similarly, I have the opinion that the total cost shown for each of the three years-only $164,040 in 1987-88; the decrease, despite an almost doubling in the numbers, in 1988-89 to $144,277; and in the current 10-month period again back up to $137,806 for 175 apprehensions-just belies any form of assessment as to how those figures have been arrived at or whether in fact they are a true representation of the information that I sought in the original question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an easy answer to this. I think Senator Tambling asked for actual cost resources required to handle fishermen incursions. What he has in the column under costs is the actual costs involved, costs expended for accommodation, sending people back or whatever. There would be no consistency there because they come and go from different places and in different ways and are kept for different lengths of time. That is why Senator Tambling will not find any easy formula to apply in terms of the number of fishermen and the cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resources within the Department that have been necessary to attend to the tasks involved are extra. They also vary according to the way that people come in, the numbers that come in, the groups in which they come and so on. So there is great difficulty there to apply formulae in respect to resources. What I think Senator Tambling might have been expecting, and what he has not got, is the actual cost of those resources to the Department. We can try to come back to him with further figures making an assessment of the cost of resources as well as the extra costs that are indicated in the answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer. It does clear up the basis upon which the answer was provided. It is obvious that the column headed `Cost' really contains incidental costs that are associated with the program and certainly does not give a financial assessment of the resources that have obviously been applied. I was looking for a more globally oriented figure that indicates the total cost to the Department of administering this particular program. In light of the media reports of the last few days relating to fishermen coming across to Australia from northern waters, and the fact that Indo-Chinese refugee migration looks like descending upon us in rather large numbers, it will be very important to ascertain that the resources of the Department needed to serve northern Australia will, in fact, be adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. With reference to those answers, an analysis of the figures provided in them leads one to draw a number of conclusions which I believe require urgent action by the Government in relation to the business migration program. Among the reasons stated for the Government's introduction of the accreditation system for that program was the Government's desire to increase the intake of business migrants to Australia and also to speed up the processing of business migration program applications. The Government stated that this latter goal was desirable in itself, and that it would also help to achieve the first goal concerning an increased intake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the answer provided to me to question No. 7, which shows the median finalisation processing times for the five stations about which I asked-Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Athens and Damascus-it can be seen that those finalisation times range from five months to 18 months. That clearly shows that the goal of speeding up the processing of business migration applications has not been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> This impression is reinforced particularly when one looks at the figures for Hong Kong, where one can see that the outstanding number of applications is now 23 per cent greater than it was six months ago. As I understand it, when the accreditation processing system was introduced, the time taken to finalise applications was expected to be reduced to about three months. In fact, looking at these figures we see that the processing time seems to be about the same as it was under the old system. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the figures for the Hong Kong station, the conclusion can be drawn that the clear reason for this is the Government's inadequate provision of resources to that station. The resources at the Hong Kong station are inadequate to deal, in a timely manner, with the number of applications that are being received. That is demonstrated by the fact that it takes seven months to bring business migration applications to finalisation in Hong Kong and, as I mentioned a few moments ago, the backlog of applications is increasing. The provision of resources to Hong Kong is also inadequate when one looks at the revenue generated in Hong Kong by the fees charged for business migration program applications. The introduction of an annual fee, a lodgment fee and a greatly increased application fee which accompanied the establishment of accreditation was justified on the grounds of the user pays principle. As such, I believe that the introduction of and increase in such fees is quite defensible. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when one looks at the situation in Hong Kong, one sees that it is clear that the user is paying through the nose in terms of the service being provided. If one looks at the rate of applications over the last six months, one can see that they are generating some $3 3/4m in revenue per annum-taking six-monthly figures and converting them to a yearly basis. But if one looks at the answer to question No. 4, one sees that it is clear that the cost of resources being provided are on a per annum basis in order to process those applications and is only $500,000. Therefore, there is a clear obligation on the Government, both morally and in order to ensure the efficient management of the programs substantially to increase the number of people and associated resources available in order to process business migration program applications in Hong Kong. If resources were matched to revenue, that station's current resources could be multiplied seven times and, indeed, on the figures provided, that station could therefore get finalisation of processing time down to one month. The original goal of three months could be met by little more than doubling the present resources and that would clearly be achievable, having regard to the massive revenue that is being derived from fees charged at that station. </PARA>
<PARA> A perusal of the figures shows that, in Hong Kong, for each Australian average staffing level there is a finalisation of nearly three business migration program applications per day. By comparison, in Singapore the figure is 2.3. In Kuala Lumpur, only 1.12 applications are processed per staffing level per day and in Athens and Damascus it is even worse, with 0.82 per day and 0.62 per day respectively. In other words, Hong Kong, with about 2 3/4 times the number of staff working on the business migration program as Kuala Lumpur has, is finalising nearly seven times the number of applications. That means that the officers at the Hong Kong station are working more than twice as hard as those at Kuala Lumpur or, at least, are certainly more than twice as productive. This fact further reinforces the justification for a substantial increase in the resources being applied to the business migration program in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA> From my own experience in assisting business migrants between 1984 and 1987, combined with my consulting experience in organisational structure and work practice, I believe that about three cases being finalised by an Australian officer per day is a reasonable achievement. Certainly the Hong Kong station is achieving that but, as I said earlier, it is falling further and further behind with regard to total finalisation time because of the increasing backlog of applications. I therefore ask the Minister to state in his response why more resources are not being provided in Hong Kong, especially in view of the massive surplus of revenue being generated at that station. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the Singapore station, one can see that it is slightly under-achieving with regard to the number of finalisations per Australian officer per day. From that, one can conclude that an improvement in productivity is required. But an increase in resources is also justified for Singapore, because applications there are currently generating about $74,000 on an annual basis, but the personnel servicing the program are costing only about $41,000. It is certainly unacceptable that finalisation of processing takes about eight months in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Kuala Lumpur at five months has the shortest time for finalisation of processing of all the stations about which I sought information, a vast improvement should also occur there. I have already highlighted the poor performance of Kuala Lumpur when it is compared to Hong Kong. It is also poor when compared to Singapore. Kuala Lumpur has more than four times more staff than Singapore has in relation to the business migration program, according to the answers that have been provided to me, but the Kuala Lumpur station is finalising only twice the number of applications per week. So Australian officers there should nearly treble the number of applications that they are finalising per officer per day. That suggests that the Kuala Lumpur station is not operating in the way in which the Government intended under the accreditation system. There is also some scope for an increase in resources provided to Kuala Lumpur, with applications there generating $225,000 a year, and staffing costing only $185,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the performance at both the Athens and Damascus stations should improve by some three to four times with their existing resources. At Athens there is a slight shortfall as regards fee income compared with the cost of processing resources provided, while at Damascus there is a slight surplus. So, in effect, in monetary terms they balance each other out. Those resources are finalising much less than one case per Australian officer per day. That is reflected in processing finalisation times of 18 months for Athens and 14 months for Damascus. </PARA>
<PARA> So I again ask the Minister to ensure that adequate resources are provided where they are obviously required in stations such as Hong Kong, and where that justification is reinforced on the basis of the fees being earned at those stations. Will the Minister also ensure that productivity improves at those stations which are shown not to be performing adequately? Can we get finalisation times for business migration program applications down to no more than three months?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to make is that Senator Chapman makes a pretty fundamental mistake in comparing apples with pears and in drawing the conclusions he then does out of that. For instance, the situation in Athens, where the median processing time is 18 months, cannot be compared to a situation anywhere else because Athens, I am informed, processes applications out of the Gulf area. Quite often, officers are waiting an extraordinary length of time before correspondence is returned, before the processes take place from the end of those who are making application. The Gulf does present all sorts of different problems and, accordingly, one will find that the median processing time in a place such as Athens is something like 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that in respect of most of the posts, one could say that they do have regional problems; some may not. The basic point I make is that Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Athens and any of those posts cannot be compared on a very simple formula. Making comparisons on that basis is something that should not be done because of those local circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Kong Kong was mentioned as a special case, and I go to answers to sub-part questions 8 and 9, the number of outstanding applications in each place listed six months ago and listed now. It is interesting to note that one of the problems we do have with Hong Kong is that quite often the visa is not readily taken up after approval. For instance, in respect of the applications listed now, there are 1,721 currently in the pipeline; of those, 647 are in what is called stage 3. That is something like 37 per cent. That is basically people we are waiting on to come in and pick up their visas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told there are also circumstances where people are asking for extensions, and that drags out the median processing time as well. That is not to say that Hong Kong is not receiving attention from the Government. It is quite apparent that not only Australia but other countries also are getting interest from Hong Kong. The workload levels in Hong Kong across all categories, including the business migration program, and the processing times are under ongoing review. As I said, some of the figures showing an increased case load are caused by those collecting the visas dragging their feet after the processing and approval of the applications. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that is not a full response. The Government recognises, as part of its ongoing review, that staffing needs should be given attention. Following a visit to Hong Kong last month by a senior departmental officer, it has been decided in principle to increase the staffing levels in that particular post. The additional Australian-based staff resources should be in place by, I am told, August-September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> So the two points I make in response to Senator Chapman's intervention are, firstly, do not compare posts and expect a very simple formula to apply to them all; and, secondly, yes, Hong Kong is being given attention. There are particular reasons there why stage 3 is at a high level, but the Government is responding to the needs and will have mechanisms in place later this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest I raise today is the need for Australian Capital Territory prisoners to have their own gaol in Canberra. This issue is particularly pertinent now because on 1 July responsibility for all criminal law will be passed to the Australian Capital Territory legislature. The Australian Capital Territory does not have a prison. All sentenced Australian Capital Territory prisoners are transferred to New South Wales to serve their sentences. The number of people convicted in the ACT and serving sentences in New South Wales currently stands in the eighties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the ACT Government is going to do about its prisoners has been an ongoing source of controversy. The death of Kirran Alistair Sen in early April has reactivated this debate. Mr Sen, a mentally ill ACT man, hanged himself in his cell after being sent to Goulburn gaol. In sentencing Mr Sen, Justice John Kelly said that an ACT solution would have been best but was simply not available. I believe that wide ranging community discussion needs to occur on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The current situation is not a satisfactory one for the residents of the Australian Capital Territory. An ACT citizen sentenced to a term of imprisonment could end up in any gaol in the State of New South Wales. The debate for a prison in the ACT began in earnest in 1984 when the Deputy Chairman of the Human Rights Commission argued that the construction of a prison in the ACT was justified. In 1985 the Vinson inquiry into ACT welfare systems recommended the establishment of a medium to low security prison. </PARA>
<PARA> In report No. 44 on sentencing, the Law Reform Commission recommended that a prison system be established in the ACT. The Commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure that the welfare needs of ACT prisoners are adequately met. The commissioner in charge, Mr George Zdenkowski, said that the Commission's opinion that the ACT had been relying too heavily on New South Wales to care for its prisoners was shared by Canberra prisoners and their families and by almost all ACT judges, magistrates, police and welfare officials interviewed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> My own interest in this matter arises in part from experiences of one of my constituents, Mr Ray O'Shannassy. Mr O'Shannassy, the prisoner whose transport difficulties I raised in the Senate two years ago, has not been returned to Canberra. Mr O'Shannassy was released from Goulburn gaol on 24 January 1984 and given a rail voucher by prison authorities. He exchanged this for a train and seat ticket at the Goulburn railway station. When he boarded the train he found the seat allocated to him was occupied. His attempts to have the train conductor and the station master secure him a seat were unsuccessful. Mr O'Shannassy's attempts to secure alternative transport to Canberra by sitting in the station master's office and later the Rail Superintendent's Office failed. In the course of Mr O'Shannassy's 3 3/4 year campaign to get operating a safe system to return prisoners to Canberra, he has been arrested hundreds of times at consider- able cost to the state. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I raised this matter in the Senate on 16 March 1988, the voucher system has been amended but it still does not ensure the safe, prompt return of Canberra prisoners. It is these problems associated with the return of prisoners to the ACT that led me to the conclusion that the Australian Capital Territory needs its own gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT now has a greater population than the Northern Territory and a population not significantly smaller than the whole of Tasmania. A community of this size should care for all its people including those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge for the ACT legislature is that a Territory facing up to the responsibility of looking after itself should also look after its own prisoners. Canberra has no control over the conditions of its prisoners and no influence over programs, classifications and overseeing the term of the sentences imposed by the courts. This can lead to particular hardship in retraining and employment prospects of released prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Canberra must face up to the fact that they lack involvement in the life of the prisoners they will eventually have back as members of the community. This leads to severe disadvantages for both the community and the released prisoner. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 10 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that the penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners, the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation. A government committed to a humanitarian approach to incarceration should have an intimate approach to a prisoner's rehabilitation and adjustment to community life on release. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an approach is not possible in Canberra with the current practice of sending prisoners to New South Wales. Sending Australian Capital Territory prisoners to another State to serve their sentence under the control of a regime that has no accountability to the ACT community strips the community and the prisoner of their democratic rights to a say in how that system operates. I believe that the size of Canberra, the problem associated with the return of prisoners, and the responsibility of the Canberra community to play a role in the rehabilitation of its prisoners, warrants the provision of prison facilities in the Territory. What every person in Canberra must face is that Canberra's convicted citizens have been put into the New South Wales prison system. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis in the New South Wales prison system is well known and is growing worse daily. For many decades the state of prisons in New South Wales was scandalous. Efforts by concerned citizens in New South Wales in publicising the brutality of prison life led to the Nagle royal commission which reported to the Parliament in 1978. The Wran Labor Government implemented many of the recommendations of the Nagle royal commission. The establishment of a corrective services commission led to greater community involvement in prison administration. Gaols became more accessible to the public; educational programs were developed, and efforts were made to return prisoners more quickly into the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The climate of New South Wales prisons has deteriorated in recent years. We have seen the Greiner Government under Minister Yabsley institute a series of retrograde steps. Firstly, there has been the abolition of the Corrective Services Commission and its replacement with a single director. This has dealt a heavy blow to community involvement in prison administration. Secondly, the production of gaol magazines has ended with the stated reason being that the Minister wanted to show who was boss. Thirdly, contact visits have been greatly reduced. Fourthly, inducements encouraging prisoners to take educational courses have been withdrawn and the remission system has ended. Fifthly, the Government has signalled its intention to reopen the notorious Endeavour House at Tamworth, with the announcement that spartan conditions will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Life in the New South Wales prison system has always been grim. The current changes being implemented are designed to crush all hope. We can anticipate that some prisoners will externalise their frustrations and anger in violent riots. Others will internalise their rage. According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald last year, the suicide rate in New South Wales prisons was four to five times greater than the rate in England and Wales. With overcrowding getting worse and prison policies harsher in New South Wales, the crisis there can only result in more deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> Those responsible for Australian Capital Territory prisoners can no longer ignore the trends that are developing in New South Wales. The present policies being practised in New South Wales fly in the face of humane strategies to rehabilitate prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> At Australia's first international congress on corrective services, held in Sydney in 1989 and attended by 749 delegates from 36 nations, Ms Mary Tuck, head of the Research and Planning Unit, Home Office, London, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The treatment of offenders to genuinely reduce recidivism is likely to be found in ways of dealing with offenders that encourage their relationship with a living community. </PARA>
<PARA>How can the ACT apply such strategies when it abandons its prisoners to another State away from their own community? This is the human side to the need for the ACT to have its own gaol. Apart from inflicting prisoners on an inadequate and overcrowded gaol system in New South Wales, there is the problem of distance from home and family which makes visits difficult and expensive, remembering that these prisoners can be sent to any gaol in New South Wales. Canberra offenders are put at a greater disadvantage than prisoners of other States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1984 the Australian Institute of Criminology issued a report which found that all ACT prisoners serving sentences in New South Wales were in favour of an ACT prison. Cost has been noted as a significant aspect of this debate. I have some figures from 1987-they are not recent-which show that to house the ACT prisoners who were then being held in New South Wales prisons would cost more than $6m a year with capital costs of more than $10m. This is compared with the $2.4m in payments to New South Wales in 1986-87 for the care of ACT offenders. There is no question that this poses a difficult problem for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend to have the answers as to how the financing of a Canberra gaol should occur. However, Canberra cannot continue to rely on New South Wales to take its prisoners. To do so is to ignore the reality that the current system is completely inadequate. It is time to take the difficult decision and put in place proper planning to allow for the funding of a Territory gaol. The Law Reform Commission report on sentencing points out that the cost should not be the prime consideration. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW system has often been criticised for its inadequate facilities and resources. The prisons there are overcrowded and antiquated. The alternative to humane containment in the Australian Capital Territory is worth pursuing even though it is likely to involve greater Federal expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise these matters because, with the attainment of self-government, all Canberra people and their government can face the fact that a goal in Canberra is long overdue. To those critics who claim that a gaol will result in more offenders ending up there, I say that will surely depend on those determining the form that sentences ought to take. The alternative is to continue the present policy of banishing ACT offenders into New South Wales. Surely such archaic methods, popular in eighteenth century Britain, should now be abandoned in the Australian Capital Territory and its prisoners kept within its own community. </PARA>
<PARA> I received a great deal of additional material on the decline of standards and morale in New South Wales gaols. At the same time, Mrs Chadwick, the Minister, has plunged the juvenile system into chaos in New South Wales. I will detail these facts in a subsequent speech. Obviously, it is something that is of great concern and only emphasises the points that I have made. </PARA>

It is my intention to return to the bank issue with a vengeance. During that period I have placed before the Senate for the consideration of honourable senators, examples of what I have no alternative but to accept as evidence of malpractice and corrupt practice in banking. I now have in the vicinity of 350 such cases and I have tabled, for honourable senators' deliberation and consideration, somewhat in excess of 80 case studies ranging across all major banks in his country, concerning millionaires to battlers and drawn from all States of the Commonwealth. It is now my intention to seek leave to table a further four case studies. I will continue to do so whilst ever I believe that it is to the advantage of both constituents and honourable senators in their deliberation of these serious allegations. I seek leave to table four affidavits and associated documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The documents that I have just tabled concern one Maurie Turland, who is in dispute with the Advance Bank; Jeffrey Leddin, who is in dispute with the National Australia Bank; Cecilia Joyce Milverton, who is in dispute with the Commonwealth Trading Bank; and Mr Owen Stolpe, who is in dispute with the Commonwealth Trading Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The outcome of this process of tabling documents has been interesting. I believe that the community is now tremendously interested in the allegations contained in the documents I have tabled. Most honourable senators, I think, read the cover article in the Bulletin of May 1989 called `Why the Banks are Bastards'. It was as a result of that very potent article that I received literally hundreds-if not thousands-of phone calls. My staff and I have literally spent thousands of hours considering and deliberating over these cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators are aware of the fact that twice I have called for a Senate inquiry into banking practice in this country. My proposal was debated in this chamber and was defeated on both occasions by the combined vote of Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that even the affairs of the last two or three days have drawn attention to the fact that banking, as a phenomenon process in this community, is a matter to which Australians must direct a maximum of attention, not only for economic reasons but also for social reasons-specifically of justice and injustice. There are record levels of indebtedness; record levels of bankruptcy. I have been arguing in this place for 18 months that some of these cases are the result of bank malpractice and indeed bank corrupt practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighteen months ago when I tabled the first three case studies it was suggested in the debate that these matters would be best resolved in the courts. After approximately 15 months I would like now to return to those three cases and to see what those constituents have experienced at the hands of the courts and the banks in that time. I particularly draw the attention of the media to what I am offering in this place today because I believe it will be a very potent statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1988 an article titled `Fraud Investigation in Nowra' appeared in the Coastal Life magazine which is published in Nowra. As a result of that article customers of the Commonwealth Bank made complaints to me about the conduct of the bank. At that time I tabled affidavits and other material in this place relating to those complaints. Those were the first three cases which I cited and for which I tabled evidence and other associated documents. </PARA>
<PARA> In a prepared statement the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Don Sanders, said that the affidavits tabled by me, `do not justify allegations of corruption against the Commonwealth Bank'. Mr Sanders went on to say that action had been taken by the bank `to protect its position in circumstances where the borrowers had not met payment commitments'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of subsequent events I now propose to revisit those cases believing that they show that the bank was corrupt in the action taken against its customers. In one case, that of Mighty Chef Products, the bank purported to appoint receivers to the assets and undertakings of the company. I now seek leave to table a case history and a statutory declaration of Mr Wilfred Taylor made on 5 May 1990, and exhibits thereto. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

I call upon the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs for New South Wales to initiate an investigation with a view to laying criminal charges in relation to this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In another case, and a very important one in my view-that of Tony Rigg-the bank obtained a summary judgment against Mr Rigg. I seek leave to table a case history and copies of the supporting documentary evidence. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I thank the Senate. The fact is that a bank officer manipulated an account and another officer committed perjury. What that means is that these bank officers have indeed perverted the course of justice. In addition, Mr Don Sanders, the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, wrote a letter incorporating palpable falsehoods. The letter was sent to me. It was incorporated in Hansard and quoted and relied upon by the Chief Justice of New South Wales when dismissing Mr Rigg's appeal. I call upon the Attorney-General for New South Wales to initiate investigations with a view to laying criminal charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on the first occasion I raised the matter of a possible Senate bank inquiry that letter was not tabled or incorporated by me in this place but was incorporated by then Senator John Stone, I believe, at the request of Mr Don Sanders. I am convinced that that letter contained palpable falsehoods. By its being so tabled and incorporated in Hansard the Senate was misled, as was the Australian public because, by virtue of its being incorporated and tabled, it was made public property. </PARA>
<PARA> In the third case-that of Huon Valley Springs-the bank attempted to bankrupt the proprietress of the company. I seek leave once again to table a case history-affidavits of Miss Donna Batiste, sworn on 22 July 1988 and 15 September 1988, and exhibits thereto, and the judgment of Mr Justice Burchett handed down in the Federal Court on 27 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The fact is that the bank breached a written undertaking not to proceed to bankrupt Miss Batiste. In his judgment dismissing the petition for bankruptcy, His Honour made a scathing attack on the officers of the bank. I call upon the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, who is present in the chamber, to initiate an investigation with a view to laying criminal charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By tabling these case histories, which have been prepared for me by legal advisers, I am attempting to place before the Senate for its serious consideration-and indeed that of Senator Tate as the Minister for Justice, the media and the people of Australia-what I am convinced are provable cases of fraud, corruption and perjury in relation to three of the 80-odd case studies I have tabled in this place and only three of more than 300 cases that I now have before me. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in each of these cases there was blatant corruption by bank officers. That corruption related to action taken by the bank. It is now open to Mr Don Sanders, the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, to make further denial of corruption. In the coming session of Parliament I will once again call for a Senate inquiry into banking. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last 18 months I have been deliberately pursuing a strategy by which I have been appealing to honourable senators to examine the circumstances of individuals. On the two occasions that I have appealed to the Senate to place these circumstances before a special Senate inquiry that request has been denied, which is obviously the privilege of the majority of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be shifting strategies in the next few months and when we return to this place in the next session. I will, by and large, shift my focus away from case studies to what I believe are actions provable within boardrooms of banks. I will be tabling documents which emanate from the boardrooms of banks which I believe will reveal that in the context of deregulated banking there has been a significant and real shift away from the fundamental fiduciary relationship by which the interests of clients should be considered equal to the interests of the banker. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that inherent in the current wave of foreclosures and record bankruptcies-that is all over the front pages of newspapers of this country today-one ingredient is malpractice and corrupt practice. From the first occasion on which I addressed the question in this place I have outlined variations on themes by which banks are able to deliberately manipulate-I believe I have tabled evidence here today that they have-strong, healthy, viable businesses to bankruptcy, for reasons which are not yet known to us or to the clients. </PARA>
<PARA> The three cases that I have cited today are all of businesses which at the time of these difficulties beginning were very healthy and viable and it was for those reasons that the banks advanced large sums of money to them. If banks do not make judgments when they advance large sums of money they are defective in one of their fundamental processes of counselling and deciding which businesses should be financed by their depositors' and shareholders' moneys. The fact that we have a record wave of bankruptcies cannot be blamed totally on the Government of this country but upon the attitude and ethos of banking which prevails. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate can be assured that whilst ever I am convinced that malpractice and corrupt practice is present I will raise this issue again and again. I seek leave to table a press release that I put out today summarising my speech in the chamber. </PARA>

There is no other coherent reason for Mr Keating's denial of the very basis of his rationalising and restructuring of the financial system about which he has boasted over the last seven years. What he has done has reversed that process. It is not simply me saying that: we can look through today's press. The Sydney Morning Herald, on page 1, says, `The free market has had its day'. The Australian Financial Review's editorial is highly critical of Mr Keating's actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that what Mr Keating has done has not only reversed the process but also has created massive uncertainty within the business community about what the rules are. The onus was on Mr Keating to establish the need to change the rules. He had to establish a clear need for the banning of this merger. The onus was on him; it remains on him, and he has done absolutely nothing. He has failed totally to provide any coherent reason for this intervention-this gross, governmental, `big brother knows best' intervention-in this marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no particular brief for either the ANZ or the National Mutual. On the contrary, I could well claim-and some people have claimed-that at times National Mutual has chosen to lie down as a lamb with the lion, and at the moment it has been severely bitten. I have no special brief for National Mutual. I have no views about whether a merger would be in the best interests of National Mutual policyholders or ANZ shareholders. In fact, the market seemed to indicate that ANZ shareholders did not like it very much. But it was up to the people in the marketplace, the people affected, to determine whether or not it was an appropriate merger. Instead of that happening-instead of the free market dictating what happened-that great dictator Mr Keating came in, because Mr Keating's gut feeling was that perhaps it should not go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of what advice he was relying is interesting. Clearly, he was not relying on economic advice because, as we understand it, there were no objections on policy or principle grounds from the major sources of economic advice to the Government. Mr Keating has yet to explain why his gut has greater significance than the economic advisers that this Government pays a very large amount to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have, however, some comment from Professor Baxt, the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. Professor Baxt's response was perhaps even more curious than Mr Keating's. Maybe he is trying to help Mr Keating out of an intolerable position. Mr Baxt admits that the banned ANZ Bank-National Mutual merger would not have been in breach of the Trade Practices Act, but should still have been vetoed. On AM this morning he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Trade Practices Act a merger of this kind to breach the Act would have to create a dominant player. </PARA>
<PARA>The intriguing part of Professor Baxt's extraordinary remarks is this:</PARA>
<PARA>The merger in our view-</PARA>
<PARA>this merger-</PARA>
<PARA>would not have created a dominant player as defined by the law. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there was nothing wrong-even from Professor Baxt, who is trying to justify Mr Keating's actions-with this merger in terms of creating a dominant player. It is self-evident that this merger would not have created a dominant player. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see from a list in this morning's Australian dealing with market share that the merger of ANZ and National Mutual would have meant that it would have had only 14.2 per cent of Australian banking business and only 12.6 per cent of its superannuation business. So Professor Baxt is obviously right: it would not have created a dominant player as defined by the law and, therefore, there can be no objection on anything other than political grounds to this merger. It is not illegal; it is not improper; and it does not create a dominant force in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> What then is Mr Keating's reason for making this decision? Mr Keating's reason is a simple one. He is fighting for the leadership of the Labor Party-it seems in the very near future-when Mr Hawke either steps aside or is pushed aside by a Treasurer, a Deputy Prime Minister, who is clearly, in all his actions, desperate for that position. While Mr Hawke has been ill we have seen the extraordinary way Mr Keating has dressed down Senator Button, thrown his weight around all over the place, and now is dictating to the free market in Australia what new rules should emerge as a result of his gut. </PARA>
<PARA> What intrigued me about Professor Baxt's comment `The merger in our view would not have created a dominant player as defined by the law' was that he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But what might happen later down the road is the next merger or the one after that would have created that position of dominance. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Baxt said:</PARA>
<PARA>What would you say to these people? Sorry, we've got to stop you, but we didn't stop the other two. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an old saying `if pigs could fly'. Professor Baxt is saying that something that is proper, reasonable, fits all the requirements of the law and does not create a dominant position must not be allowed to go ahead because maybe some other players in that free market might decide to get together and use that as some sort of precedent. That also is utter garbage. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Baxt really should try a bit harder in his desperation to support Mr Keating in his intolerable position. If one looks at the next biggest players one sees that they would be the Westpac Banking Corporation and the AMP Society. If they merged, their total control of the banking business would be 17 per cent-only 17 per cent of the total market-and only 20 per cent of the superannuation business. Neither of those are dominant market positions by any criteria. If later on some of those bigger merged groups merge with each other, there is a case on the merits of the issue for Professor Baxt to take this incredible-in this context, supportive-role of supporting the Treasurer's impossible position. At the moment there is no justification, and nor can there be, either for Mr Keating's assertion or Professor Baxt's quaint support for him. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue is that what the blocking of this merger does is diminish competition. That is the extraordinary situation. This Government has created an extraordinary environment in which it is encouraging saving through the process of superannuation while at the same time it is diminishing the benefit of saving through the banking system. In other words, banks may well be simply protecting their position by moving in this way into life insurance companies or organisations. The same may be true the other way around, because many of these life insurance bodies, such as the National Mutual, have such an enormous scope for expansion into superannuation, because of the changed tax laws and others, that they have stretched their capital base. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is in the best interests of those covered by superannuation and those who are customers of the banks. Yet there is no evidence whatsoever that the people who receive the benefit of bank loans, or loans from superannuation companies, would have their source of lending so cut that it would be an offensive concentration of power. The figures show quite clearly that there would be no dominant player. Professor Baxt admits that. </PARA>
<PARA> But to what extent will this decision, as I said, diminish competition? I can reveal that very simply. The National Mutual has been so busy pursuing this new business that the Government has thrust its way-and, I might say, it is one of the reasons I said that the National Mutual may well have been the lamb lying down with the lion-that it has stretched its capital limits. In other words, I cannot continue to compete as effectively with the market leader, which leads it by quite a way-the AMP Society-if it is not given the advantage of the capital backing that the merger with the ANZ would have given it. In other words, what this does is limit competition to prevent the market leader-the AMP-being more hotly pursued by the National Mutual. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Government is even aware of that. I doubt it. I do not think that that was one of the elements that went into Mr Keating's gut for him to get that feeling. But we do not know what went into Mr Keating's gut. We do not know why he reversed the clear indication that the market had that he was in favour of the free market. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be rules, particularly in the banking and finance system, relating to the strength and security of the deposits there. That is why people in the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Reserve Bank closely guard the institutions in that area to make certain that people's money is not lost. Those are the only rules we need. We do not need and cannot afford an interventionist Treasurer with the arrogance of Mr Keating messing up this market. The signals that that gives to overseas investors in Australia is absolutely disastrous. We need a clear set of rules, not ad hoc gut feelings from the Treasurer. We need certainty in the marketplace. We want to know what the Government's policy is. We cannot have a situation in which massive damage may well be done both to the shareholders of the ANZ and the policyholders of the National Mutual by this Treasurer's unthinking, irrational intervention in this area. This Parliament must not sit idly by and allow this arrogant Treasurer to interfere in the free marketplace in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about a public scandal of a most serious nature. According to the studies conducted by the Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia Inc., which has its headquarters in Perth, Western Australia, there has been a major and ongoing cover-up by Australian government departments and industry of a very serious public health risk-a health risk which has already claimed thousands of innocent lives; a health risk which will claim many thousands more; and a health risk which is entirely preventable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disease I speak of is indiscriminate in whom it strikes. However, our children are its favoured victims. The asbestos diseases epidemic now taking place in Australia is the result of past events. But the seeds of future asbestos diseases continue to be sown throughout Australia and they will cause even more deaths well into the twenty-first century, as has been well documented. </PARA>
<PARA> The causes are the many products and building materials made out of asbestos that have found their way into hundreds of government, commercial and residential buildings and schools. The widespread presence of asbestos fibres in the environment means that the asbestos disaster is not just about occupational health and the bad fortune of those who worked at the CSR Ltd asbestos mine at Wittenoom or for James Hardie Industries Ltd at Baryulgil, or the waterside workers who loaded and unloaded the asbestos fibres, or the building workers and tradesmen, et cetera. It can also be said that the asbestos tragedy was spread into the general community, claiming innocent lives by the thousands. </PARA>
<PARA> Already these painful and invariably fatal asbestos-caused diseases claim more lives each year now than AIDS, and yet no government or corporate funds are allocated to developing public awareness of the risk. Almost no funds are made available for associated medical research, and yet during this decade alone more than $3 billion will be spent on medical and social welfare costs for the afflicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The research which is currently being carried out in Western Australia by Drs Robinson and Musk and others at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital is funded, sparingly for the most part, by the Western Australian State Government. This really should be and is a Federal responsibility. We are unfortunate in Western Australia that, because of the Wittenoom situation, our State is the best laboratory in the world for research into asbestos-related diseases and indeed pressures are currently being put on Western Australia from other countries for more research to be done. There was a recent visit by a delegation from the United Kingdom in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The enormous dollar cost to the Australian community does not include the lost productivity of the sick, let alone compensate for the suffering or the agony of the families affected by the disease. These facts alone are damning-damning of the Federal and State governments which have in the main deliberately ignored this carnage. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the real scandal is that our governments and industry have created these problems and now provide misinformation to the public at large. The entire issue has been the subject of a massive cover-up and those responsible are guilty of heinous neglect. I talk of the millions of tonnes of lethal asbestos which have been widely distributed and are still being imported and used throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> All asbestos is a serious health hazard. Every man, woman and child is at risk simply by living or working near the asbestos. The problem begins when microscopic fibres are released into the air and can be breathed into the lungs or ingested. In Australia there are 1 3/4 million houses and hundreds of thousands of schools and factories with asbestos roofs, insulation, walls and fences. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike other more progressive countries, no uniform standards are adopted in Australia for handling asbestos. No education or awareness programs exist in Australia to safeguard the community at large. In fact, many government departments answer public inquiries with an answer that asbestos products represent no significant risk to the community. This is grossly untrue and mere wishful thinking as is evidenced by research teams around the world and the appalling death rate escalation caused by exposure to asbestos fibres. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians are potentially at risk of developing a fatal asbestos-related disease. Those most susceptible to exposure are children. There is no safe threshold of inhalation of asbestos fibres. It needs only one single, small fibre which cannot be seen by the eye. The September 1984 edition of the Medical Journal of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Random autopsies in Melbourne routinely show 50,000 asbestos fibres in every gram of lung tissue of people who have never worked with the material. It is even found in the lungs of newborn babies. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from the Health and Safety Commission of the United States of America:</PARA>
<PARA> The risk of mesothelioma is very much higher when exposure occurs early in life. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated that by the turn of the century at least 12,000 to 16,000 Australians will have died of asbestos-related diseases. The average citizen in the United States has substantially less exposure to asbestos fibres than Australian citizens, yet an estimated 250,000 Americans will die of asbestos-related diseases by the end of this century. West German research carried out in 1979 by Professor Spurny of the Fraunhafer Institute shows that fibres released into the atmosphere from asbestos cement products have shown from 200 to 1,200 fibres per cubic metre of air. </PARA>
<PARA> What is not generally known is that one-third of the asbestos-caused deaths represent persons without any occupational exposure to asbestos. The facts are well known and no action is taken. Why is this so? It is simply because acknowledgment of the asbestos hazards could result in massive damage claims and maintenance bills for government and industry. Far better to pretend the problem does not exist at all is the response from Federal government and the industry moguls. </PARA>
<PARA> This deliberate avoidance of responsibility is at the least a complete betrayal of public trust. We know all about that in Western Australia with the Wittenoom example. Now, as a result of years of neglect, the problem is compounding and becoming a major threat to the whole community in health and economic terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent research results from Kawachi General Hospital in Japan show that asbestos fibres cause not only fatal lung diseases through inhalation but also substantial death of heart muscle through ingestion. There are solutions available. We must recognise the problem and accept responsibility for dealing with it. We must have a uniform regulatory system for asbestos containment throughout Australia. We must have public education programs so that people can protect themselves and their families. We must ensure that those professions working with asbestos products do so to safe standards, at least to the Worksafe Australia standard, and failure to do so must meet with tough penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's largest asbestos removal companies, G. S. McMahon, was recently caught dumping dangerous asbestos on the roadside of a Sydney suburb. There is no excuse for further neglect in this matter. Unless we are successful in solving the asbestos problem, the regulations and the enforcement agencies are likely to be quite incapable of effectively controlling worker and community exposure to other less known but equally ubiquitous carcinogenic substances. Today asbestos, tomorrow what else?</PARA>
<PARA> The asbestos issue is clearly a test of our resolve to control the increasing number of insidious materials to which workers and the community are being unnecessarily exposed. The Australian Democrats are very concerned at the widespread presence of asbestos fibres in the environment and its consequences to the community. Therefore, I can promise the Senate and the Australian people that the Democrats will pursue all avenues open to them to rectify this sad situation by working through the community and Federal and State parliaments in conjunction with the Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of my colleague Senator Michael Baume in raising what is clearly the most significant issue on the political agenda at the present time, and that is the extraordinary decision of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to reject the proposed merger between the Australian and New Zealand Banking Corporation Ltd and the National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd. I think that what is being said almost universally in the press today is that the real reasons have yet to be revealed. That is a matter of considerable concern to all thinking Australians because in many ways it heralds a fundamentally different approach to the regulation of excessive concentrations of economic power in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of the day I think that the real explanation is more likely to lie in the fact that someone is in hospital having an operation and someone else has decided to flex his biceps. If that is the case, it seems to be part of a pattern that has been developing in recent days to move right away from the generally free market approach that had been espoused by this Government, and the Treasurer in particular, to somehow appease the left wing of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and to appeal to those populist sentiments in the community so that Mr Keating's power base is able to be broadened accordingly. Tom Burton wrote in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> Suddenly Federal Cabinet has dumped its free-market rhetoric and wrapped itself in the flag of nationalism and interventionism. </PARA>
<PARA>According to other commentators, the Federal Cabinet was not even consulted on the issue, but otherwise I think the assessment is generally correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Tom Burton then went on to detail some other examples, including the equally extraordinary decision to limit the level of foreign ownership in broadcasting to 20 per cent, despite the fact that for the last nine years there has not been a problem in relation to holding companies. There has been essentially passive investment. The logic of this new approach, which no doubt will be characterised as a movement away from globalisation-in other words, going against the world trend, against the moves that are now in place to fragment the Glass-Steagall arrangements which have operated in the United States for the last 60 years-must be the rejection of the mega-com concept whereby significant sections of the ALP have been pushing for a gigantic monopolistic merger of Telecom Australia, Aussat Pty Ltd and the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Michael Baume correctly pointed out, we are not talking about a monopoly here. At the conclusion of the merger arrangement, ANZ and National Mutual would have had market shares of no more than 14.2 per cent of deposit-taking intermediaries compared with Westpac's 16.4 per cent; 12.6 per cent of funds managed, compared with AMP's 15 per cent, and 13.5 per cent of the total, compared with Westpac's 11.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the decision was not taken on anti-competitive grounds per se. There has to be some other reason. The community and, indeed, the participants in this merger, in which they have no doubt invested an enormous amount of time, money and effort, are entitled to a full and frank explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the commentators have generally described the issue today highlights I think what may well be a reversion back to the 1940s and 1950s, as Dr John Hewson described it in his press release of yesterday. As I think Mr Will Bailey said in a very anguished press release yesterday, the analogy with the Australian automotive industry under McEwen is too close for comfort. What we have now is a situation in which the competitive and prudential rules are being changed with little notice. This provides neither a stable investment environment nor a reliable base for the planning of industry strategy. That is a damning indictment of the Treasurer's so-called rationalist approach to freeing up the commercial sector. If we are not concerned about excessive levels of concentration I would like to know what we are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> I found the Treasurer's press release quite mystifying because, on one view of it, he seemed to be saying that we are not opposed to the life insurance industry and the banking industry getting together-indeed we do not have a problem if we are talking about life offices taking over banks-but somehow in this instance we have a problem with banks taking over life offices. We all know that there can be reverse takeovers, so I do not know what his attitude would be if somehow a friendly arrangement came about, and it has already been foreshadowed, whereby the National Mutual happened to be the offeror. Would he somehow regard that as more acceptable?</PARA>
<PARA> If he is concerned to somehow artificially set in concrete the current arrangements in market shares, what view is he going to take of those smaller banks, such as the Challenge Bank and the Advance Bank, that presumably have been eyed by larger predators for quite some time? Does he take the view, for example, that Westpac ought to be allowed to acquire those two smaller banks and thereby end up with greater market share than the ANZ-greater market share than this merged entity would constitute, and thereby still be consistent in saying that this was against the national interest? It would be an extraordinary outcome to condemn something like a 14 per cent market share and at the same time condone something that is likely to exceed that by a number of percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> It does seem, once again, that we are owed a real explanation. If the Treasurer thinks that somehow we are going to be able to construct oligopoly capitalism, as it has been described this morning, by simply indicating where the Government is going to intervene, what deals it likes and what deals it does not like and what view it takes of levels of market share, we are going to have the most interventionist government in history. The Treasurer owes the community an explanation. We are entitled to an explanation as to where the boundary lines ought to be drawn. Are they to be drawn at 14 per cent or 20 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA> What constitutes an excessive concentration of market power? After all, the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) had no objection to this deal in terms of the provisions of its own Act. The most that has happened today, as Senator Michael Baume pointed out, is that Professor Baxt, the Chairman of the TPC, has taken it upon himself to simply go further and say, `Well, although my Act would not preclude this deal, and I am not obliged to intervene, I nonetheless will pass a value judgment for whatever political purpose that might serve'. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of gratuitous intervention does us all a great disservice because it does not give us any indication of where the proper boundaries ought to be and where the Treasurer expects the rationalisation that will inevitably occur to come to a proper level. I think it is a classic example of canutism. The Treasurer is quite clearly trying to hold the line in the short term in the hope that he will get brownie points from some of his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have been reminded on more than one occasion by those on the other side, bad economics is bad politics. If that is the case, I am sure the chickens will come home to roost because the more that we attempt to somehow turn back the clock and keep those limits frozen, the more we are going to be out of sync with the rest of the world, the less competitive we are going to be, and the fewer market opportunities there are going to be for any such significant entities to operate efficiently in the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that National Mutual does have a capital-raising problem, and it may well be that it will have no option other than to become a listed company. That may be one outcome. I think the Treasurer ought to explain whether that is what he regards as a desirable outcome. There is no doubt that--</PARA>

By what divine right does the Treasurer have the power to decide that somehow that is a more efficient outcome than a judgment made by two players in the market who, presumably, have assessed the economies of scale and the benefits that will derive no doubt from bringing together the mammoth asset base of each of them? It is described, I think, as a $130 billion merger. To that extent there must be significant economies that can flow from such a rationalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Treasurer owes the community an explanation. A laissez faire approach has been taken in the past to much greater mergers, particularly that of Coles-Myer, and News Ltd's takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd. Those are classic examples. If one stands back at that point when the levels of concentration are clearly much higher than they are in this instance, one has a very big consistency problem, as Will Bailey rightly points out. </PARA>

The strategy of Mr Keating's drive for the top to replace his flaccid friend is becoming clear. I think that a grab for the traditional heartland of the Labor Party by jettisoning the long term requirements of structural change in favour of short time popularism is hardly the proper economic solution for the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great tragedy of all this is that somehow we are going to have to put up with the Treasurer's agenda in the short term simply because it suits his present political purposes. The press release that he put out is contradictory. It does not explain what the appropriate balance is thought to be; it does not explain why there has been a fundamental move away from allowing the market to determine these issues; and it does not explain why all the major watchdogs, including the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Reserve Bank, have generally given it the green light. Of course they have expressed some concerns, and a number of those prudential requirements have already been addressed by the participants. But for the Treasurer to now hit the proposal on the head on the basis of a decision made in his office, presumably on his terms and his judgment of his own interests, is certainly not in the interests of the Australian community. I think we are entitled to more of an explanation than we have had to date. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real concern about where this current decision is likely to take us. It is quite clear that Mr Keating is trying to capitalise on some community discontent at the high profits that are being derived by banks. I suppose with the notable exception of the ANZ's negative 23 per cent yesterday over the last six months--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Westpac last week. No doubt the banks are a convenient scapegoat for the political opportunists, such as the Australian Democrats, who want to find reasons why we cannot reconcile high interest rates and high bank profits. But the fact of the matter is that Mr Keating seems to find it a convenient opportunity to turn around and bag the banks. It is only a decade or so ago when the banks were regarded as arch conservatives. Now they are regarded as profligate predators and proxy entrepreneurs. It would seem to me that what was contemplated in this merger was a return to conservatism; simply a recognition that there are enormous opportunities provided by the Government's tax incentives in the direction of superannuation and a legitimate and understandable desire to capitalise on those market opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened here is that the Treasurer, by royal fiat, has simply said that he does not think that that ought to be the case, despite the fact that there are no trade practices or other statutory prohibitions on such a merger. He simply decided that it is not in the national interest. I am sure there will be some plaudits around the Caucus room but I doubt that there will be very many in the wider community. That is where this decision ought to be judged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue I raise follows a question I posed in the Senate yesterday as to the confusion that has been caused as a result of the Government's proposed luxury car tax-a tax announced on the run during the election campaign. As I understand it, the decision to apply a tax on luxury motor vehicles was the result of a strategy meeting during the election campaign following a call by a Labor backbencher to apply a 2c a litre petrol tax for the purpose of road funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was of the view that road funding and its maintenance would become a major election issue. Therefore, to respond to that election issue, the Government decided, on the run, to apply the luxury car tax-indicating that it would generate some $100m in the first year of operation-with a starting date of 1 April. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because the result of the election was not known as early as had been anticipated, the date was deferred to 1 May. This indicates clearly that when a policy decision is made on the run it equals, and usually results in, bad law, bad legislation and confusion for those in the industry-in this instance the motor vehicle industry-who have to abide by that law. Yesterday I referred to the confusion in the motor vehicle industry regarding the advice it had been given by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Members of that industry are being encouraged to collect the extra tax when in fact there is no legislation entitling them to collect it. In fact, collection of the tax is illegal because no law has been passed entitling motor vehicle dealers to collect it. Their bind is that, if they do not collect the tax from people to whom they have sold motor vehicles and legislation is subsequently passed with an operative date, they will have to go back and collect the tax in arrears from their customers. One well understands the dilemma that would be created for motor vehicle dealers if they attempted to go through that procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, whether the Government would clarify the position and what it intended to do, given that the Senate had now clearly rejected the Government's proposal that the operative date for the luxury car tax be 1 May. That proposal was rejected as a result of the combined vote of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, obviously supporting the principle of the tax but not the principle that a tax should be collected prior to legislation having been passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> That being the case, the operative date of 1 May is no longer an option for the Government because the Senate has rejected it, full-stop. The 1st of May is off. Therefore, why is the Australian Taxation Office, as of today, still advising motor vehicle dealers that they have a number of choices. They have been told that they can collect the tax and hold it in abeyance in case the legislation is passed-in which case they would apply that tax as of the appropriate operative date or refund it if the tax was not liable on the date of purchase of that motor vehicle. Or they can seek from their customers an undertaking that they will pay the additional tax, should the operative date for the legislation be such that they have bought the car in a period that would make them liable to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I understand and have received information that one branch of the Taxation Office, as recently as yesterday, advised the Nissan Finance Corporation that it ought to collect the tax because when royal assent is given to the Bill, whenever that might be, it will be retrospective to 1 May 1990. If the Tax Office is currently giving that advice to organisations such as the Nissan Finance Corporation and, through it, to the dealer network, it indicates that confusion is reigning not only among motor vehicle dealers but also within the Tax Office itself. For that reason it was not good enough for the Government to respond yesterday by saying that there are technical problems and it does not know quite how it is going to handle them, and that a decision will be made in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the advice being given by the ATO to those who inquire as to the course of action they ought to take-people who in good faith want to work within the spirit of the policy that the Government has clearly enunciated-is clear. There ought to be some clear guidelines given to the ATO, so that the advice it gives to motor vehicle dealers throughout this nation is consistent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The complaint as to the level of fraud has been brought to my attention. The short answer to Senator Colston's question is no. Out of a total expenditure of $820m in 1989-90, it is expected that Austudy fraud will amount to about $12m. This sum is spread proportionately across all States according to the level of expenditure. In addition to this $12m, it is also estimated that another $40m is overpaid, not as a result of premeditated fraud but due to failure of students to advise the Department of Employment, Education and Training of changed circumstances. Recovery is initiated when an overpayment is detected. The majority of fraud and overpayment cases are caused by, firstly, failure of students to notify the Department of withdrawal or change of course or, secondly, failure to advise of an increase in personal income over the estimate given in the application for Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is aware of this particular problem and is responding to it in a very effective way. In the economic statement preceding the election Mr Keating announced enhanced control measures which will include increased level of review activity and frontline recovery capabilities. These measures are expected to yield savings of approximately $50m annually by 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a five-pronged response to the problem. Initially, and importantly, there will be a review of high-risk clients. Secondly, there will be verification of client data with external agencies, including checking of claimed personal income with employers and enrolment status with educational institutions. A third response will be to encourage students to inform the Department of changes likely to affect their rate of allowance. An effective way of informing students of that requirement is the fourth response: to publicise the role of the benefits control mechanism to deter students from attempting to defraud the Department. The fifth response is to refer cases of alleged fraud to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) or the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for further investigation or prosecution. As I said, the Government is responding in a quick and effective way. For instance, in 1989-90 a total of 80 cases have been referred to the AFP or the DPP and 40 students have been prosecuted.</PARA>

This Government has a strong record in deregulation of the financial sector. The Treasurer made a very full statement about this matter yesterday. I was not personally aware of the figures that Senator Hill cited and I do not know whether those matters were taken into account by the Treasurer before he made that statement; but I think they were, because it was matter which was considered at some length. It has been under consideration for some time and I am sure all those matters were taken into account. The decision does not indicate a wish to keep life insurance and banking separate as was implied in the question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the correct ruling by the President. I wish to indicate my wholehearted support for the ruling. It is the appropriate ruling. It is a fact that Question Time is prolonged by nonsensical points of order like the last one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question from Senator Schacht asked: Is the percentage levy tax deductable? The answer to that is that the figure is tax deductable for woolgrowers. As honourable senators would now know, the levy is set at eight per cent of woolgrowers' income. That levy goes to support the reserve price scheme, marketing and research and development. If the maximum wool tax was increased to 20 per cent, as in the legislation that has been passed in the House of Representatives but which has to come here, or to 25 per cent as the wool industry as asked for and, as recently as yesterday in Roma, expressed its support for, there will be, of course, given the tax deductability nature of it, substantial amounts of revenue forgone. The report that Senator Schacht has referred to in the Australian Financial Review yesterday indicated that this could be around $200m, with a 20 per cent wool tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to be very accurate when giving these figures because it requires a calculation based on the number of growers and so on. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy estimates that the present 8 per cent rate provides a total woolgrower tax deduction of around $100m. An increased wool tax rate to 20 per cent would mean about $230m of tax revenue forgone, and a 25 per cent wool tax would mean around $300m forgone.</PARA>

<PARA> In the area of renewable energy there has been a dwindling of interest in the number of research projects that have come forward and, in recent years, from a commercial point of view, commercially renewable energy sources have been competing against a very low price for conventional energy sources such as oil.</PARA>
<PARA> Oil prices, having been low now for some considerable time, have displaced, if you like, to a large extent the research impetus that was generated during the Arab oil price shocks of 1972 and 1977. The reduction of interest in the commercial sector is why the market has reacted in the way that it has and why there has been a reduction in outlays by the Commonwealth for renewable energy research.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, it is not to say that this is an issue which the Government is not concerned about; we are. In my previous incarnation as Minister for Resources with responsibility for the national energy research development and demonstration grants, I was concerned about the amount of research moneys being allocated to alternatives. I commissioned a study by a consortium, comprising the Centre for Technology and Social Change at the University of Wollongong, Energy Policy and Analysis Pty Ltd in Canberra and the Science Policy Research Centre at Griffith University, into how the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council funds are allocated so as to give a focus in this area so that when prices and commercial interest are low we maintain our research commitment. Inevitably prices will rise and, consequently, so will the interest in alternative energy sources. I understand that that report will be in the hands of the new Minister for Resources any day now. He may even have it. It will be the basis of his and, perhaps later on, the Cabinet's consideration of the possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other reasons that interest in alternative energy research has dwindled a bit is that some of the more exotic alternative energy sources have become mainstream energy sources. In Western Australia, for example, about 26.4 per cent of all households have solar energy accumulators on their rooftops. In the Northern Territory, 37.8 per cent have them. The interesting statistic here is for Queensland. Queensland, at 5.8 per cent, is below the national average of 6 per cent. That illustrates that some energy sources which were thought of as alternative energy are now, in fact, mainstream energy.</PARA>

Obviously, that was a cause of great concern to me. However, during the meeting it became obvious that those costings were not comparing apples with apples. As an example, the Melbourne centre uses 2,200 square metres of space, whereas what was being costed for a building in Hobart was to be 4,500 square metres. That was a source of some concern to the Tasmanians assembled. I sent the Department away to have another go at those costings, so we at least knew what a reasonable comparison was of both proposals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the latest report issued on 16 May by Amnesty International concerning continuing human rights violations in China. We have no independent confirmation of the material contained in that report, particularly about executions, but it does reinforce the importance of maintaining efforts to persuade the Chinese Government to bring about an improvement in the human rights situation there. Certainly the human rights situation in China does continue to cause concern to Australia and to the Australian community. We have been very active in stating our concerns to the Chinese Government through bilateral representations and at international forums such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to which, incidentally, Australia was re-elected yesterday for the first time since 1987. We will continue to maintain this level of activity so long as the human rights situation in China remains a matter for concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to recent developments in the country, it is the case that recently the Chinese Government announced the release of another 211 people who were arrested for their role in the pro-democracy movement. Amongst those released are some prominent leaders of the movement, including one of the four hunger strike leaders. According to Chinese officials, a further 431 people involved in last year's demonstrations, including 42 students, are still, however, in prison under investigation. This development has followed a number of other announcements relating to human rights, including the lifting of martial law in Beijing and, more recently, in Lhasa; the easing of restrictions on travel by foreigners to Tibet; the release in January of 573 detainees; and an official admission that some detainees have been tortured, injured or died in custody. However, we have no further information than this at this time about the fate of political prisoners in China.</PARA>
<PARA> As I made clear in my discussion on 9 May with the visiting Chinese Minister for Metallurgical Industry, Mr Qi Yuanjing, although Australia does welcome these measures that have been announced recently, we very strongly believe that China can do a great deal more to improve the human rights situation, including allowing greater freedom of speech and association.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crowley has indicated, in the 1989-90 Budget the Commonwealth announced funding of $6.4m as an incentive package, over four years, to assist State and Territory governments to establish alternative birthing services. The incentive package is in recognition of the demand for alternative birthing services, which was brought to the attention of the Commonwealth during the development of the national women's health policy. The Commonwealth's offer consisted of $50,000 in capital or establishment costs for the birthing centres; the salary of one midwife per centre; and a Commonwealth contribution per delivery for outreach midwife assisted home births.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is currently negotiating with the States and Territories on the manner in which this program can best be introduced to meet its objectives. The program will be introduced incrementally, as many States and Territories are not in a position to implement the program immediately.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="992" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Bureau of Statistics published, on 22 May, catalogue No. 7144.0, headed `Sheep and Wool, Australia-1989-90 Preliminary'. The main features of that report are that the preliminary results for 1989-90 show a record total of shorn wool production of 1,015 thousand tonnes, an increase of 12.9 per cent on 1988-89. The number of sheep shorn to produce this result rose by 5.7 per cent to 207.6 million. The national sheep flock has increased by 7.1 per cent to 176.6 million. Although there is a massive wool surplus-these are the words of the Bureau of Statistics-mating intentions for the 1990-91 season have risen in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a conjunction of oversupply of wool at the present time with reduced demand because overseas buyers in China, Japan and the Soviet Union have not been participating in wool auctions in the same way as they have in the past. This has meant that a stockpile is held by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) of around 2.5 million bales. In about four or five weeks, by the end of June, that will be three million bales. The largest stockpile ever held up until this time was 1.6 million bales in 1974-75.</PARA>
<PARA> According to the Australian Wool Corporation figures, the stockpile will be between four million and 4.7 million bales in a year's time. The cost to the AWC of storing a single bale for a year is $220, and of this $180 per annum in interest costs is paid on the Corporation's borrowings. A decrease in the interest rates would have only a marginal impact on the AWC's borrowing requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for these reasons that Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and the Government are concerned that the implications of all the options are properly considered for growers and are in their own interests and in the interests of the economy in general.</PARA>
<PARA> The level of the reserve price, which has attracted a lot of public comment, is only one issue, as Mr Kerin keeps saying, that needs to be carefully thought through. Other issues to be taken into account are the effect on woolgrowers of their debt to equity ratio, the effect on woolgrowers' incomes, since they are in effect selling their clip to themselves, and the marketing and promotion strategies adopted by the International Wool Secretariat in the present situation.</PARA>
<PARA> In Roma yesterday Mr Kerin pointed out to woolgrowers that, even if there are record sales from now on, it will not be until 1994-95 that the stockpile can be expected to be depleted. For those reasons, and reasons adverted to in the earlier question from Senator Schacht, there is of course widespread public interest in this issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the honourable senator's description of the human rights situation in Myanmar, which is nothing short of disgraceful and has not lived up to any hopes or expectations that might have reasonably been held for its improvement in the last couple of years. I have already answered a question to that effect. It is not the case that Australia has any kind of significant aid program to Myanmar. That aid program was severed in 1988 in the aftermath of the revolution that occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circumstances of the one very small residual component of that aid program which still exists in relation to the Mandalay dairy project were explained to the Senate a few days ago and on a number of previous occasions. It was simply in order to avoid the squandering of a multimillion dollar investment in circumstances that would have been profoundly unhappy for about 8,000 dairy farmers in the area in question.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of judgment as to whether one can go that far in the pursuit of what is unquestionably a legitimate moral judgment about Myanmar.</PARA>
<PARA> It is always a nice question as to the way in which an aid program ought to respond to human rights violations, bearing in mind that human rights is about economic and social rights as much as it is about political and civil rights. There is no one to one nexus between an aid policy response and a concern about human rights violations. It is a matter of weighing and balancing the circumstances of each particular case. That is something that we have made clear before in talking about the application of aid policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian commercial activity in Myanmar is not great but it does exist, and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is one such company, as Senator Newman pointed out. We have not sought to impose constraints upon companies in any country of the world so far as private commercial activity is concerned, except South Africa. Although there are many countries around the world that have been guilty of human rights deprivations of one kind or another, including Romania, at a time when Senator Newman's party was vigorously applauding the entrepreneurial vigour of Lang Hancock and others in getting barter trade and so on going, it is not a position that we adopt, except in the most exceptional circumstances, to apply government sponsored or government supported sanctions in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> However, South Africa is and always has been a special case. South Africa still has a constitutional system which is unique in the world, in comprehensively discriminating against people, not just providing for an electoral system as in Fiji which discriminates on the basis of race, but not even acknowledging a right to vote at all on the basis of race and treating people not merely as second class citizens but as non-citizens. We all know of the circumstances in South Africa. The fact that those circumstances have never been understood or appreciated with any sensitivity by anyone in the Opposition is no ground for Senator Newman to make any allegations of double standards so far as the Australian Government is concerned. South Africa remains a special case for that reason. It remains crucially important that that pressure, economic and psychological, be maintained until such time, as I said the other day, that real, genuine and irreversible progress is made in the human rights situation there.</PARA>

Does the Minister accept the rationale for the Navy to acquire a helicopter carrier on the grounds that it could be used to carry troops or to rescue stranded tourists or does he accept the line that such a support ship is interventionist, as other vessels could carry troops and Qantas Airways Ltd is perfectly capable of rescuing stranded tourists as it did from Beijing last year?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Vallentine's 10 questions, it is true to say that from time to time any department, let alone the Department of Defence, does have a whole series of wish lists. It just starts off that way and gradually gets pruned down by the bureaucracy. It is then pruned down by the relevant Minister, assassinated by the Minister for Finance and finally amended by Cabinet. That is just the process of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the thrust of the honourable senator's overall question about an overall reduction in defence expenditure, which I think I have answered both at Estimates committee hearings and here in respect of previous questions, it really depends on what level one is coming off. The Soviet Union has cut some of its defence; it now appears that it is coming off at least 25 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. We have never been in that ball park. It was once regarded as 15 per cent because people totally overestimated the Soviet economy but it now appears to be 25 per cent. As Senator Vallentine knows, expenditure in Australia has been well below 3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to that general point, I do not think that what happens in the rest of the world is particularly applicable to Australia. Even less so. It has been a long while since Australian defence strategies and posture have been based on what the superpowers have been doing. Our defence strategy is specifically directed to respond to events and possibilities in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the two specific questions that Senator Vallentine raised in terms of equipment, I will be reviewing whether there is a sufficient case for an extra two submarines. I must admit to the honourable senator that I have a very open mind on the question. I will be looking at it and making a decision in due course, especially after consulting other colleagues in government. The same applies to any proposed mode of evacuation via a helicopter carrier. All those things should, I think, at least be considered by government and assessed, prioritised and then a final decision made on those particular points. I would not agree, however, that Qantas Airways Ltd can, on all occasions, intervene to save Australian citizens in certain circumstances. I am not saying that a military response is the only other way. But I do not think I can conceive, in some circumstances, that Qantas and its crews could necessarily have the effect that Senator Vallentine thinks they can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My ministerial colleague from New Zealand has gone now so I am not sure that the question is quite as necessary as it was half an hour ago, but never mind. It is nonetheless appropriate to put the answer on the public record. The Prime Minister signed the Convention for the Prohibition of Driftnet Fishing in the South Pacific on 2 February during his visit to New Zealand. The Convention bans driftnet fishing by parties to the Convention in their terri- torial seas and exclusive economic and fishing zones and requires parties not to assist the use of driftnets in the South Pacific region and to restrict port access and port servicing facilities for driftnet fishing vessels. The Government is now preparing legislation to enable ratification of the Driftnet Convention and it is cooperating with New Zealand, in particular, to improve driftnet surveillance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Protocols or letters supplementing the Convention through which distant-water fishing fleets, including those of Japan and Taiwan, would accept obligations to ban driftnet fishing in the region have been drafted now for further negotiation with the driftnetters. We remain disappointed that Japan and Taiwan still refuse to consider an immediate ban on driftnet fishing in the South Pacific and will continue to urge them to sign the relevant protocol to the Convention. Nonetheless, we welcome the Japanese agreement to cease driftnet fishing in the region by 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say finally that Australia was also actively involved in the formulation of a consensus resolution at the United Nations General Assembly which was adopted in December last year. That resolution contains a commitment to a cessation of driftnet fishing in the South Pacific by mid-1991 and to moratoriums in other oceans by mid-1992. Australia was instrumental in ensuring that the region's strongly expressed desire to see driftnet fishing banned in the South Pacific was not compromised. It has been Australia's particular concern to coordinate action taken in different oceans to avoid the displacement of driftnet vessels from one ocean to another. It is for this reason that the Government is also pushing for a global ban on driftnet fishing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than the Opposition was able to manage in 23 years of government. Following the APEC ministerial level meeting which was held in Canberra last November, we have been seeking to ensure that the momentum to carry forward the process of economic cooperation in the region is maintained. While that meeting in Canberra focused, essentially, on getting the whole exercise off the ground, since then the emphasis has been on developing a work program to give emphasis to APEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senior officials met in March and agreed on six projects covering human resource development, energy, investment and technology transfer, marine resources conservation, trade and investment data and trade promotion. We were designated as the coordinator, or shepherd, so-called, of the energy project and we are organising a meeting of relevant regional officials to advance that project. The next of these meetings will be held in Singapore at ministerial level on 30 and 31 July. Officials will be meeting in Singapore in late May to review progress and prepare for that meeting and a further meeting is to be held in the Republic of Korea in 1991. In other words, the momentum will be sustained because the institution framework is now well and truly in place.</PARA>
<PARA> I finally mention that a meeting of trade Ministers associated with this APEC process is to consider progress on the Uruguay Round in Vancouver on 11 and 12 September. That meeting is to take place in accordance with the agreement, reached at the Canberra meeting, for enhanced regional consultations on that Round at the official ministerial level. One of the key features of the Canberra meeting, it will be recalled by all except those ignoramuses opposite, was the reaffirmation of strong regional support for multilateral trade liberalisation and a determination to secure a successful outcome of that Round.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the Minister aware that yesterday, students from the University of Tasmania held the biggest protest rally seen on that campus since the days of the Vietnam war to protest over savage funding cuts to the university by the Federal Government? Is the Minister also aware that because of these Federal cutbacks the University of Tasmania will no longer be able to offer courses in women's studies, Asian studies and religious studies and the future of the entire arts faculty is in the balance? Given the Prime Minister's statement in his policy speech that Australia could no longer be content with being the lucky country and had to become the clever country, how does the Minister explain the decision by the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training to impose quotas on first-year arts intakes to the University of Tasmania, a decision which will mean an end to the hopes of a tertiary education for hundreds of young Tasmanians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry-Senator Calvert. He does not ask too many questions, so I forgot who he was. In respect to the part of the question related to whether I knew there was a demonstration in Hobart yesterday-no, I did not. And I did not know there were quotas. I could obviously seek information on that. In respect to the part of the question that goes to the levels of funding and opportunities in higher education, I think probably three points should be made, and made so that they can be understood by honourable senators opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have reached a situation where we are now looking at 150,000 extra places in higher education institutions between 1982 and 1992. Between 1989 and 1992, an extra 63,000 additional places will be created in higher education institutions as well. Senator Calvert is basically talking about this figure-63,000-being the equivalent of re-creating the universities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia. So I think to be fair, in his attack he should recognise that the Government has been concerned about ensuring more opportunities for people to study in higher education institutions, and has been successful in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the level of funding that he is talking about, it should be recognised that this Government will be spending, by 1992, $3.6 billion in higher education, which is $1.6 million more than we were spending in 1988. It is a massive increase.</PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of it is the level of research funding. By 1992 we are looking at an extra $144m for research in higher education with another $1 billion to be allocated through the Australian Research Council over the next five years. Funding for cooperative research centres of $100m a year will also be allocated within the next five years. So the basis of Senator Calvert's question in terms of the Government's commitment to creating opportunities in higher education and also to increased funding, I think, is totally wrong.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the reason for the demonstration in Hobart yesterday and all the matters related to that, I will attempt to find out more information for him and make it available to the Senate, hopefully tomorrow.</PARA>

The point I make is that the Government has an overall commitment towards higher education throughout Australia, irrespective of where one comes from. That commitment has been met by the provision of a massive number of extra places in higher education institutions, as I indicated. That should be recognised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This question relates to the sports selected for the Commonwealth Games program every four years. Firstly, is the Minister aware that, though one of the factors to be taken into consideration when selecting the eight optional sports from the list of 17 is the need for sports to provide maximum opportunity for men and women to compete, male orientated or male only sports frequently take up to 50 per cent of the program? Secondly, is it correct that the various sports represented in the previous Games have a vote to decide the venue-and so the sports-for the next games? Is this the main factor that helps to ensure male only or male orientated sports are entrenched? Thirdly, while I am aware that the Commonwealth does not have any control over the Commonwealth Games Federation, influence and encouragement are always possible, particularly as Mr Hawke is the patron of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association. As we move into the 1990s, how can the Government encourage the Commonwealth Games Federation to ensure that sports selected cater for men and women, for example, by including canoeing and table tennis rather than boxing and wrestling?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the great difficulty in looking at the selection of sports does not come so much from a sexist attitude from the sports that are currently involved in the Commonwealth Games but rather from looking at the profile of sports that developing countries prefer. Those countries are the ones which in the real world have the votes and they are the ones who so often push for traditional sports such as boxing, wrestling and weight-lifting. Many of the developing countries that take part in the Commonwealth Games feel that those are the sports in which they have the best chance of doing well; therefore, they tend to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other factor about the Commonwealth Games that should be borne in mind when looking at the sports which are likely to be played is that each bidding city actually proposes the list of sports which could best be played in that city. Quite often we will find that the city that bids for the Games gets its way in terms of the sports that if feels it can best handle and for which it has the best venues and training facilities. It is not so much a question of looking at just finding opportunities for women; rather it is a question of making sure that developing countries have, what they consider to be, a fair say in the make-up of the sports that will be played in the Commonwealth Games on each occasion.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Lees would be aware, the participation of women has dramatically increased in the last decade, and developing countries are showing more of an inclination now to send women, particularly in athletics teams, when perhaps they would not have done so in the past. So I think there has been an improvement. In the context of the meeting that will be held-I am not sure whether it is this year or next year-that has been organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat to look at the structure of the Commonwealth Games, Australia will take up the question of better participation for women. In the past it has not really been some deliberate sexist policy on the part of any country competing in the Commonwealth Games nor has it simply been sports protecting themselves; rather it has been the attitude of developing nations and the kinds of sports played in those countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the question asked of me earlier by Senator Chapman about allegations of corruption and maladministration in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I now have available a little further information which I think is appropriate to put on the public record. The most recent allegations to which Senator Chapman referred followed a long course of such allegations of corruption and maladministration which began to be made by this officer calling himself the Officers Revolutionary Council in the latter part of last year. On 18 December a senior officer of my Department formally wrote to the officer concerned asking him to provide information for investigation by the Department of allegations he had made. This was followed up in several discussions with relevant officers of the Department. When nothing was provided and when he continued to make these allegations, he was formally directed on 7 May this year to provide all information including any departmental documents or copies of such to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a further step, on 21 May my Department appointed a senior and experienced officer to investigate any matters that come into the hands of the Department alleging corruption or maladministration. The material that Senator Chapman, in his wisdom, put before us today was distributed by the officer in question on 18 May-last week-to the Department, to other departments and to the press. The material refers to the personal situation of a number of officers and, therefore, gravely and seriously breaches their privacy.</PARA>
<PARA> For that reason and also because that matter is now being investigated by the AFP it is inappropriate to go into detail about the allegations. But at this stage I can say that I am advised that the allegations in important respects were factually incorrect. The appropriate and correct means of addressing such allegations is for them to be referred to the AFP. Again, on 18 May, my Department directed the officer concerned to confirm that he had provided all relevant material-in other words that he was not holding anything back-to the AFP. The correct course for him is to comply with those directions.</PARA>

Generally coastwatch provide the detection capability and RAN patrol boats provide the response capability.</PARA>

<PARA> As part of a program to develop and improve its service to listeners, ABC regional radio in Tamworth and other areas of New South Wales is undergoing some changes. The Tamworth office is currently being refurbished and a new staffing structure is being implemented at 2NU. Although there has been a change in individual staff in the Tamworth office there have been no cuts in staffing numbers in Tamworth or the New England area. The ABC has also advised that it is strongly committed to improving its regional service nationally and has, in recent years, provided more than 50 additional staff in regional areas and opened offices in 15 new locations. It is hopeful that it will soon be able to improve services in the New England and North West region with the location of two additional positions in Armidale. This will allow current staff to concentrate their attention even more on the north-west part of the region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of the matter of public importance are in the terms of the resolution passed last week in the New South Wales State Parliament-carried by all political parties-and have the intention of setting up a royal commission into the Mafia and associated criminal activities. All honourable senators would be aware of the difficulties faced in a geographically limited royal commission. For that reason the New South Wales Parliament approached the Federal Government seeking its support that this royal commission become a joint inquiry. It is to our regret that to date the Federal Government has rejected that request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a particularly important matter. The Mafia-organised crime network is firmly entrenched in this country. It is nationwide. It has enormous resources. It corrupts police, politicians and other public officials. It has no compunction in killing its opponents. It operates within a code of silence. Crime is its business. It does what is necessary to make a profit and to protect its interests. Whether it is growing an illegal marijuana crop or executing an informant, it acts in a professional way. It is well organised and ruthlessly determined. It has an Italian heritage. This is irrelevant except that, as in the case of other organised crime networks, for example, the Chinese triads or the Japanese yakuza, it provides a particular ethnic bond which can be useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Mafia is not limited to those of Italian background. In fact, it is as much a curse in Italy itself, and the Italian authorities are now putting in enormous resources to combat its criminal activities. In Australia, the law enforcement agencies now know a lot about Mafia operations. The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) has been gathering material under Operation Alpha since 1981. The National Crime Authority (NCA) under Operation Vigilante has been gathering material since 1986. I understand that since the death of Commissioner Winchester, nearly 18 months ago, the Australian Federal Police has put together a major file on the Australian Mafia. Yet the Australian public knows so little of its structure, its links, its coverage or methods of operation. On this side of the chamber we believe that the Australian public has a right to know that, just as John Hatton had a right to know that there were threats on his life. It is only an aware public which will put sufficient pressure on governments to commit the resources necessary to counter this criminal network. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, if the Government gets away with avoiding this royal commission, it will be because of public ignorance. Regrettably, traditional law enforcement bodies and the NCA have been largely ineffective in combating the Mafia in Australia. In my contribution to this debate I will seek to sketch the overall picture of the problem that we face. I will explain why traditional law enforcement methods in Australia have been largely ineffective. Most importantly, I will seek to explain why the NCA is not proving to be any more successful. That is particularly important because given as one of the two reasons why the Government will not become a party to this royal commission is that it claims to have the NCA doing the job. My colleague Senator Durack will look at what other royal commissions-some unfairly judged-have been able to achieve in the ongoing fight against organised crime. He will demonstrate why the ACT Coroners Court is inappropriate for this task. That is the other justification given by the Hawke Government for refusing the request of the New South Wales Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of traditional law enforcement bodies the difficulties faced have been a lack of resources, a lack of power and geographical barriers faced by our individual police forces. These are the same sorts of obstacles referred to by Mr Dowd, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, in his contribution to the Hatton motion last week. In the case of the NCA, there has been a lack of resources, but furthermore it was not designed or structured to combat a nationwide criminal network of the size, complexity or power of the Mafia. The NCA is not an effective body to take an overview; it is more appropriate for a royal commission to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in my home State of South Australia, there are, unfortunately, pockets of official corruption which the NCA, well run and using its special coercive powers, should be able to root out. They have, unfortunately, been able to defeat the traditional law enforcement methods-the police. That is why the NCA was set up. If there was evidence of institutionalised corruption in South Australia, for example, as was seen in Queensland, the NCA would not be the best body to deal with that particular problem. A more appropriate body would be a royal commission-a body of the type we saw in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the NCA is more akin to that of the orthodox police methods, except that it has special powers that can be brought into play when traditional law enforcement proves unsuccessful or comes upon a particular barrier of silence. Thus, when we look at Opposition Vigilante, the one mentioned by Senator Tate in answer to questions concerning reference 7 of the NCA, we find useful work in combating particular cells of the Mafia. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of Operation Vigilante, there is no greater public understanding of the Mafia network. There is no real suggestion that the NCA has significantly affected the overall operation of the Mafia in Australia. There is no suggestion that it has been able to take out those who head the Mafia network in Australia. I ask Senator Tate, who will respond in this debate: How many Mafia bosses have been put away under Operation Vigilante? I think he will give the answer of none. The method of the NCA in Operation Vigilante is to follow the crops: that is, the public manifestation of the Mafia network. Through that mechanism you get the small players; occasionally you get lucky and might incidentally get a corrupt police official or police officer who might be protecting a crop. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the case of drug chief Moyse. The NCA was observing a crop in South Australia and Moyse happened upon the crop. The Moyse matter was well-handled, in my opinion, and taking him out was a public service. But it did not strike at the heart and soul of the Mafia. He was just another public official, albeit senior, who was corrupted by the Mafia and associated interests. The crop was a Mafia operation. The gardener was one Sergi who was brought into Australia as a specialist in this particular area and who, I understand, is about to be declared a Mafia operative under Italian legislation. I understand that he was responsible also for growing other crops in Australia. A group sought to get him permanent residence in Australia with a false claim that he was a specialist chef. The same group is believed responsible for providing false passports and funds for moving other operatives in and out of Australia. I remind the Senate that this is an international crime network. All of this information was suppressed for two years. The Opposition believes that the public has a right to know. They also have a right to know the linkages between the drugs business and migration rackets. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the fact that the NCA is not structured to combat an organisation of the size and complexity of the Mafia, it is suffering from internal ruptures brought upon it by itself and by poor Government leadership. I regret to say that at the moment it is in its self-justification mode, concentrating upon itself rather than its task, with the consequent loss of public confidence. It has no head. The last Chairman resigned in unusual circumstances. The last two chairmen have been publicly brawling. The past South Australian head of the Authority was driven out by internal bickering. The Authority has allowed itself to become political-which is a matter I will deal with on another occasion. In other words, it is in no condition to effectively take on the Mafia. For Senator Tate to say that Operations Vigilante is the Government's response to the Mafia is to accept a knockout in the first round. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to Bungendore. Bungendore 1 and Bungendore 2 were part of a series of marijuana crops grown by the Mafia and Mafia associates, with the knowledge of the New South Wales and Federal Police, with a potential street value, some believe, in excess of $100m. The police side of the operation was Operation Seville 1 and Seville 2. It is unclear which police officers acted for so-called `legitimate purposes' and which officers were in league with the Mafia. There were some 10 crops. Two crops were ripped off on five separate occasions while under police surveillance. Millions of dollars of the crops reached the market. If ever a set of circumstances called for a public inquiry, it was these. </PARA>
<PARA> Bungendore was just another cell in the network. Experienced gardeners were brought in. Public officials were corrupted. The principles have all escaped successful prosecution. Some of the principals have been known for a long time; some are still unknown. Why was there not a public inquiry? We do not know, but there has been speculation. The links between Griffith and Bungendore are clear. I remind the Senate of the leaked Operation Alpha report from the ABCI which indicated that South Australia was just as important in the Mafia network as Griffith. That is the key point. This is not a pocket of corruption that we are looking at. This is a nationwide criminal network that can be effectively combated only by a national response. In the New South Wales Parliament Mr Hatton said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Wran Government's record on the Mackay murder is appalling-the prevarication, the delay, the inefficiency, the lies, the half truths, the unwillingness. </PARA>
<PARA>Time after time Mr Hatton and those who wanted to get to the bottom of the Mackay murder and the Griffith crops were fobbed off. I regret that we have had the same experience in relation to Bungendore. </PARA>
<PARA> The NCA says that no member of the AFP acted illegally. That is incredible because the whole operation was illegal. The AFP blames the New South Wales Police, and vice versa. In Estimates committees and in questions in this Senate, Senator Tate accepts the incredible. The Senate will remember his answer to the police casting the 18 kilograms of marijuana on stoney ground but failing to remember where. Senator Tate accepted the explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The informant Verducci played everyone for fools-or were they fools? As Mr Hatton said, the role of Verducci, his relationships with the police and the reliance placed on him by the NCA scream out for investigation. Of course, after Operation Seville, Verducci was alleged to be growing marijuana in the Guyra area. The prosecutions all collapsed. Senator Tate shrugged his shoulders: they were New South Wales prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the truth? At the committal we heard that the usual cut for informants was 10 per cent of the crop. That would come to many thousands of dollars-perhaps $100,000-yet the police claimed to have received only a few thousand dollars. Why did the AFP refuse the applications of Max Chapman to join the force? Who gave the advice that he was too hot to handle? Why did the Federal Government tolerate the situation?</PARA>
<PARA> Last week the New South Wales Police Minister said that the AFP Commissioner Colin Woods sanctioned Bungendore. In 1987 Woods went on television and said he knew nothing of Bungendore. Yesterday Senator Tate said Woods knew and agreed to the use of the informant. Where is the truth? When were the Federal Ministers first told of the illegal Operation Seville, and what has been the extent of their briefing since?</PARA>
<PARA> The Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking, reporting in 1979, was the last real attempt to expose the Mafia, to break through the code of silence. Woodward exposed those involved with the Mafia and marijuana growing in Griffith. The same names turned up at Bungendore a decade later. By accident, Bungendore resolved the mystery of the murder of Mackay-murdered by the Mafia. Winchester's murder had all the hallmarks of a Mafia execution. The Federal Government knew of the connection between Winchester and Bungendore-and I do not imply by that any wrongdoing on the part of Winchester. It knew that Winchester was due to give evidence in the Bungendore trials. It knew Bungendore was primarily a Mafia operation. But did that lead the Federal Government to a clearly required, long overdue inquiry into Bungendore? No. Certainly, ultimately there was a coronial inquiry into the death of Winchester, but no-one thought that that would lead to an investigation of Bungendore. </PARA>
<PARA> Now Magistrate Cahill, I would say with great courage, is doing what the Government should have caused to be done a long time ago through a more appropriate body. There will be a royal commission. It will be a New South Wales royal commission and Mr Carr, with some courage, I suggest, has made it bipartisan and called upon the Federal Government to put the matter above party politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Between a magistrate hampered by inadequate powers and a New South Wales commission hampered by limited jurisdiction, enough of the truth will come out. It will demonstrate that all the Hawke Government has done by its refusal to cooperate is to hinder effective law enforcement, benefit those who are prepared to undermine a basic pillar of our society, and further enrich this evil criminal network which gains from the misery and suffering of fellow Australians. It will be seen as another sad chapter in the sequence of government inaction. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senator Tate, of course, who has principal responsibility for protecting the public from organised crime-and who proudly said yesterday that he had advised the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) against a royal commission-ultimately it will be another blot on his record. Senator Tate becomes yet another Minister who, instead of seizing what Mr Hatton calls an historic opportunity, as has been seized by Mr Greiner and Mr Carr, puts another obstacle in the path. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that ultimately the Federal Government will be embarrassed into joining this royal commission. Senator Tate, as the one who advised against cooperation, should reflect upon where that will leave him. It is not too late. This motion has been deliberately couched in moderate terms because what we want is for the Commonwealth to cooperate with New South Wales and, hopefully, other States, in a nationwide effort to combat this criminal network. I repeat what Mr Carr said: this is something which should be put above party politics, and Senator Tate, ahead of all others in this chamber, should be providing the lead the community deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill says that his matter of public importance is couched in moderate terms. Certainly it is couched in different terms from those which were faxed to my office earlier in the day, which spoke of a motion, and moving a matter of public importance. That had to be withdrawn by Senator Hill because, quite clearly, he knows that in this chamber there would not be support for a motion of the type of the matter of public importance that he has put forward if it were in identical terms to the motion moved in the New South Wales Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is trying to start this matter of public importance on an entirely flawed premise, an entirely erroneous premise. The first sentence states:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Government to reconsider its rejection of the call . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That would give the listener, as I have no doubt it is intended to do, the impression that there has been a straightforward, blunt, utter, forever and a day rejection of the call for a royal commission. I have made it absolutely, abundantly clear time and time again in answers to questions in this place that if at the end of the coronial inquiry there are matters which require further investigation, and if a royal commission is the best way to investigate those matters then this Government will have no hesitation in adopting that particular procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said time and time again that there is no question of the seriousness of the matters which have been raised by Mr Hatton. What I have said is that we need to have a process which can further elucidate the matters to which he points. The fact is that I have made it abundantly clear that the question of the convening of a royal commission from the Australian Government's side and the assistance we might give is one that will be properly looked at at the end of a process that is already under way in relation not only to the coronial inquiry but also to inquiries being undertaken by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the National Crime Authority (NCA). </PARA>
<PARA> It is in relation to the National Crime Authority that I would like to spend some moments. Senator Hill's matter of public importance states:</PARA>
<PARA> to investigate the activities of the Mafia</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>focusing upon-</PARA>
<PARA>the involvement of the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police with the Mafia in the illegal growing of marijuana crops in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and in the Brindabella Ranges in the Australian Capital Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>corruption involving the cultivation and distribution of marijuana in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and, in particular, the Griffith area;</PARA>
<PARA>Of all honourable senators, Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority member, Senator Robert Hill, would be very well aware of the reference given to the National Crime Authority under the title `Vigilante' by the Commonwealth and by all mainland jurisdictions. Indeed, that reference deals with most of the matters which are of concern to Mr Hatton and others. In the annual reports of the NCA which are tabled in this place there is a full description of the matters which are covered by that reference. As one knows from certain public hearings that have been held by, I think, Mr Justice Stewart he made it clear what the scope of that reference was. In particular, he called for assistance from the general public in relation to those matters dealing with the involvement of persons associated with the Italian community. I take Senator Hill's point that that is not to say that that community is to be tainted by the illegal and criminal activities of some in its midst. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vigilante reference has been supported by the Federal Government and by all governments on the mainland of Australia in a bid precisely to tackle Mafia organised crime in Australia. I find it quite extraordinary that Senator Hill would say of the National Crime Authority that it is not constructed in a way which would allow it to tackle organised crime on a national scale across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That was precisely why the National Crime Authority was established. No doubt, it is because it was established on that basis and was operating to achieve the objectives set out in its statutory charter that Senator Hill found himself able, as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, to give his support to the Committee's report entitled The National Crime Authority-An Initial Evaluation. He indicated that it was working sufficiently well in this new task to have his confidence, that it should have the sunset clause repealed and be allowed to continue. Indeed, this is what the Committee had to say at that time:</PARA>
<PARA>Certain of the fears expressed at the time of the establishment of the Authority, both as to the obstacles which might lie in the way of its effective performance of its functions and the potential threat to civil liberties which it posed, appear to date to have proven groundless. So far from being a `9th police force', as some have claimed, the Authority is a unique and novel investigative agency, combining elements of traditional law enforcement agencies with the powers of a Royal Commission and able to use the one to complement the other. </PARA>
<PARA>It was that combination of the elements of traditional law enforcement agencies with the powers of a Royal Commission which, apparently, appealed to Senator Hill and the other members of the Committee in ensuring that this Parliament guaranteed the continued existence of the National Crime Authority in its fight against organised crime nation wide. </PARA>

In relation to the National Crime Authority, my particular concern is with the involvement of the Australian Federal Police, as I have explained to this chamber before, in relation in particular to the dreadful killing of Colin Winchester, the Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, in the Australian Capital Territory the aftermath of his assassination, the day after his killing, I went to the National Crime Authority headquarters in Sydney and asked Mr Peter Clarke about the National Crime Authority's investigations into the Bungendore plantations, Operation Seville and, in particular, the role of Mr Winchester. I was told by Mr Peter Clarke that no criminality was involved. The National Crime Authority had carried out an examination of the role of the Australian Federal Police in relation to Operation Seville and had come to that conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the conclusion of the National Crime Authority as a result of its investigations, that there was no evidence of criminality on the part of the Australian Federal Police in relation to Operation Seville. The National Crime Authority pointed to what it regarded as shortcomings in relation to the administration of Operation Seville by the Australian Federal Police and suggested certain disciplinary actions. Certain action, including counselling, was undertaken by, I think, the then Commissioner, Major-General Grey, in relation to the officers concerned. That was the conclusion of the National Crime Authority in relation to the involvement of the Australian Federal Police. Whatever Senator Hill might want to say about it, it was not tainted by illegality or criminality. I think that that is an extremely important matter once again to put on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one takes, perhaps not that particular response by the National Crime Authority in relation to those sorts of allegations but, as Senator Hill did, concentrates more on the overall role of the National Crime Authority. I believe that this Parliament is still entitled to rely on the expertise and the powers available to the Authority to continue to conduct its investigation, particularly with the assistance that it is able to draw on in relation to other law enforcement agencies around Australia, precisely to overcome the jurisdiction barriers, the protection of turf and the jealousy between law enforcement agencies which had so bedevilled and fragmented the fight against organised crime in this country up to the time of the creation and operation of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill says that some of the consequences of Operation Seville in law enforcement terms were somewhat accidental, but I think it needs to be emphasised that, as a consequence of following marijuana resulting from the crops at Bungendore down into Victoria, eventually the police were led, by way of admissions made by a person arrested, to the successful conviction of those responsible for the conspiracy to murder Donald Mackay. They are languishing in prison now. Further, there were convictions relating to the conspiracy to murder the Wilsons, who were involved in the terrible Mr Asia syndicate. I think this needs to be emphasised; I do not think it has been mentioned much by the press. The fact is that arising out of Operation Seville, if you wish to put it that way, those responsible for the conspiracy to kill Donald McKay are now in prison. One particular person was sentenced to eight years gaol for his part in the conspiracy to murder Donald McKay. Another person was sentenced to nine years gaol for conspiracy to murder Donald McKay. I think he was also sentenced to life imprisonment in relation to other conspiracies to murder. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are very important convictions, and I think Senator Hill ought to acknowledge them. Senator Hill asked whether any of the top people had been successfully prosecuted. No one was more disappointed than I in the collapse of the Queanbeyan prosecutions. It was quite clear that those committal proceedings were going ahead on the basis that, in particular the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, and, indeed, the New South Wales Attorney-General in offering an indemnity hoped that the witness Verducci would live up to the undertakings he had given in order to secure that indemnity. As everybody knows, the committal proceedings collapsed in relation to most of those who were on committal. In relation to four who were eventually committed to trial, they were not proceeded with because Verducci did not live up to the undertaking he had given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I felt strongly about this and other instances where prosecutions had collapsed. Indeed, it is interesting that Mr Faris indicated that he believed that in relation to informants one should not use them as witnesses in these sorts of criminal trials unless a lot of corroboration is available. Indeed, he said that he preferred that the informant, if involved in criminal activity, should be charged and convicted, and representations be made to the judge as to sentence in order to deal with the cooperation aspects of the informant turned witness rather than dealing with it by way of indemnities. In any case, Mr Dowd has had to withdraw that indemnity in light of what the magistrate said in relation to Verducci's lack of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, those committal proceedings and prosecutions did not succeed as one would have hoped. That is greatly to be regretted. But I hope that certain lessons have been learnt about the way in which informants can be turned into witnesses and about what ought to be done in relation to corroboration or some other way of dealing with the evidence they might give. In relation to the coronial inquiry, I do not know what Senator Durack or Senator Hill has to say further about this, but I think that if one reads Mr Hatton's speech-I take it that Senator Hill and Senator Durack, naturally, have perused his speeches as I have-I think they would agree that Mr Hatton did not grasp the full powers available to a coroner in the ACT, particularly his ability to offer an immunity to a person giving evidence so that a self-incriminating answer cannot be used against that person in subsequent criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hatton claimed that certain people were not going to come forward at the coroner's inquest because they were not aware that they could be offered that particular section 57 immunity, as it is called. I believe that the coronial inquiry nevertheless is directed to ascertaining the manner and cause of the death of Colin Winchester but, as I also pointed out, if at any stage the coroner thinks a prima facie case has been made out he can charge a person with an indictable offence-and it does not have to be an indictable offence in relation to the actual killing or death-and can, after a certain procedure, commit that person to trial. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason primarily that I have indicated my concern that it would be improper to have a royal commission running alongside a coroner's inquest possessed of those particular powers with that sort of evidence coming forward because we know that Mr Cahill, the Chief Magistrate acting as coroner, intends to take evidence in relation to Operation Seville in the next few weeks. I just do not believe that it is at all proper that that coronial inquiry should be conducted in tandem with a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I believe that the Government's position is a sound one. It is that the establishment of a specially constituted joint royal commission is not justified in the current circumstances. I believe that at the end of the coronial inquest we will be in a far better position to make a judgment as a government as to whether indeed the most productive process would be to join with the New South Wales Government in a royal commission procedure. Given the fact that the coronial inquiry is so well advanced, I believe that it would be improper to take any other course at this stage. It is true that I have offered that advice to the Government in relation to the decision which has to be made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his response to Mr Greiner. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that Mr Hatton has agreed to cooperate with the coroner and has, in fact, forwarded some material. I think that is an indication that Mr Hatton, having spoken with the Australian Capital Territory coroner, has concluded that he should respond to the invitation of the coroner to put any information he has before him. I believe that is a sensible course for Mr Hatton to take. I think Mr Hatton has probably taken some further advice as to the exact scope of the powers available to the coroner and is prepared to cooperate with the coroner in forwarding that material. I believe that the coroner ought to be allowed to complete this inquiry. I undertake very sincerely that at the end of that coronial inquiry the Government will reconsider the question of the royal commission, and I believe that we will all be in a far better position to make a considered and deliberate judgment in relation to these matters at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, whilst Mr Hatton has, in good faith, put forward this particular proposal for a joint royal commission to be commenced immediately, the Senate ought-not that we are called upon to vote at this stage, given the form of the matter of public importance-to permit the current course of inquiries to continue; and at the end of the coronial inquest no doubt there will be further debate in this chamber as to the appropriateness of a royal commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter we are debating today concerns a call that was started by Mr Hatton in the New South Wales Parliament for a royal commission to deal with a number of matters set out in the resolution of the New South Wales Parliament, some of which actually refer to matters within the Australian Capital Territory. Our view is very much that all parties in this place have an interest in combating crime. There may be a disagreement as to how that should be done. I believe that the suggestions made to date are based, first of all, on a fallacy and, secondly, on an earnest wish and desire that something be done quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fallacy-it has been expressed to me by a large number of people I have spoken to on this issue-is, firstly, that the National Crime Authority (NCA) is not capable of undertaking these investigations, which is patently false both in terms of its legislation and its activities, and, secondly, that it has not done so, which is patently false in terms of its reports and the reports of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, a committee of this Parliament. If the NCA continues to be destabilised, it will be the largest gift to organised crime in this country. If the undermining of the NCA continues, as has started in the last few weeks, organised crime, including the Mafia and other criminal syndicates that operate in this country with international links, will be overjoyed because it is the only organisation in Australia capable of dealing with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I, too, wish there were a magic wand to wave around so that organised crime and the Mafia would go away. It so happens that there is no magic wand in the real world. In the real world the combating of family syndicates depends very largely on deliberative, painstaking, long-term investigatory work. There is no substitute, no matter how much we desire it, for that activity. To do that we have not only the National Crime Authority, but also seven State police forces, two Territory police forces, independent commissions such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence-a panoply of organisations directed at organised crime. The idea is that if we get a judge-and if one is to believe the overwhelming conspiracy theories in operation at the moment, where would we find a judge who is not corrupt?-and appoint a royal commission, somehow these things will go away. I ask every honourable senator who is interested in the fight against crime to read the history of royal commissions in this country and see what the results are in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that many names will be traduced and dragged through the mud. I am not interested in that; I am interested in whether or not we actually solve the problem of crime. We will get headlines, there will be lovely stories, and politicians might feel good. But the community will continue to be corrupted. There is no substitute for the long-term, painstaking investigatory activity that is necessary to blow apart family syndicates. I wish there were, as I think most people in Australia do. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who has ever bothered to look at the exercise in Italy would know that the exercise we have embarked on with the National Crime Authority will go on and the community will be paying not just for the next 10, 20, or 30 years but indefinitely, because there is no ultimate solution to crime within society, certainly not the criminal syndicates that are based on international links. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a number of the reports that honourable senators have referred to in this place. For example, in the National Crime Authority annual report for 1988-89 Mr Justice Stewart says:</PARA>
<PARA> As the first Chairman of Australia's only truly national law enforcement agency, I have experienced first hand the realities of law enforcement in a federation-</PARA>
<PARA>the realities, not the wish list-</PARA>
<PARA>With the establishment of self government in the Australian Capital Territory, we now have in Australia nine jurisdictions making and enforcing laws, each with its own imperatives, issues and pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>We have the States righters running around saying that we must not tread on anybody's toes. There are a lot of ways to help the fight against crime which I am sure most people in the Senate-and certainly some have argued this already in this debate-will find completely incompatible with their political objectives. But they are there, if people want to look at some of the more dramatic ways of dealing with the issue. Justice Stewart goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Achieving and maintaining the required level of co-operation from all agencies, to ensure an effective Australian response to organised crime, is no easy task. The need goes well beyond co-operation between individual police forces and other agencies in particular investigations, though that is important. It means focusing on those areas where governments have never achieved effective co-operation . . . It includes the need, on a continuing basis, for the pooling and proper analysis of information, difficult to develop and maintain when corruption is an ever present threat . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage of the Authority's life, I believe it is time to develop and widen the use of the power to convene task forces-</PARA>
<PARA>which are already under way-</PARA>
<PARA>drawn from a variety of investigatory and regulatory agencies such as police forces, the Taxation Office and Corporate Affairs Commissions. These temporary forces give the Authority and other participating agencies the flexibility to target particular syndicates or criminal enterprises, using a wide range of information, powers and resources . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reality of fighting crime in Australia. Justice Stewart knows what the reality is. That is what he has put in his report. I wish that some people had read it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the third report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which was presented to this Parliament last year and which Senator Hill signed. He has already spoken in this debate. I quote from page 3 of that report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority was thus under pressure to prove itself and to do so quickly even though the investigation of organised crime is a lengthy process and it takes even longer for the results of investigations to be processed by our criminal justice system. </PARA>
<PARA>It does-that is the rule of law. There are alternatives. We can have a lynch gang if we want; we can traduce people if we want, but they are not the ways we operate under the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it passing strange that a couple of weeks ago there was a censure motion moved and carried in this chamber against Senator Tate with regard to a few comments that he made which in fact put a trial off for a time. Now we want people to be tried and convicted without proof and not in a court of law. Will that make people happy? We want to spend millions of dollars doing it, which will come from where? It will come out of money we currently spend combating crime. The money has to come from somewhere and that is where it will come from. When we are making the decision on where we will spend $23.5m-that is what the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union cost us in today's dollar terms-we must ask: Is is better spent here or is it better spent there?</PARA>
<PARA> I have said with regard to the call for a royal commission that I am not against it, and my Party is not against a royal commission into this matter. But give us reason as to why we will do it this way; give us some reasons as to why this would work. Give us some reasons as to why the Government would not want to follow through with the NCA and its painstaking operation of not naming people in public without them having the right to defend themselves, but rather taking people into our court system and convicting them-as the Authority has convicted people such as this: Saffron, 3 years; Kiss, 8; Ng, 7; Tung, 7; Ferguson, 16; Royal, 14; Oloyede, 7; Wong, 24; Ng, 20; Xhow, 11; Yau, 9; Tsoi, 9; Wong, 11; Sha, 14; Souksamrane, 14; Phanith, 13; Yuen, 9; Chen, 7; Luu, 10; Nguyen, 7; Nguyen, 8; Wong, 12; Lian, 24; Han, 18; Tan, 22; Tang, 12; Tiffany, 12; Scott, 15; Cornwell, 23; Bull, 18; Webster, 10; Drew, 8; French, 7; Rogers, 13; Rowell, 12; Angelini, 9; Manstead, 7; Huttley, 4; Domican, 14; Moyse, 21; Sergi, 5; Carbone, 7; Malvaso, 5; Barber, 5; Barber, 10; Ferguson, 6; Woods, 6; Amad, 18; Malkoun, 18; Skelton, 6; Shand-Smith, 11; Yeow, 10; Gobindram, 10; Loh, 6 3/4; Chan, 10; Cheah, 8; Grant, 6; Marinovich, 5; Lee, 15; Chan, 15; Maio, 18; Asciak, 10-the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely absurd to say that the National Crime Authority has done nothing. Senator Hill knows of all those major criminal figures. He knows of the destabilisation of organised crime that the National Crime Authority has engaged in and done so well in. Up to the last count by the National Crime Authority, 191 convictions had been attained-and I have had people ringing me saying that it has not done anything. The amount of confiscated money going into the coffers has totalled $51m. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters: All little fish. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters, from the back bench, knows absolutely nothing about this. She is bleating away she is not interested in how things are really done in the real world. That is how organised crime is battled. It cannot be done by waving a wand. It has to be done in the painstaking way, under the rule of law. That is what we are combating; that is what we are up against. If people believe the noise that is going around that we need only find a judge and appoint a royal commission and it will all be solved, they will create an impression in this country which will be of great joy to organised crime syndicates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we can do, and I hope we will do in a short time, is get a witness protection organisation up and running. If we want to roll organised groups, such as the mafia-as Senator Hill knows, the only way these are broken up is by getting inside people-we have to be able to protect them. They do not come cheap and they do not come easy. There is no easy way of doing it. Let us not kid ourselves and let us try not to kid the community. There is a most extraordinary amount of corruption out there. It is from the top to the bottom. It will always be in the police forces. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the waving of the wand around Scotland Yard? In fact, 22 or 24 members of its internal anti-corruption organisation are in gaol-and that is the type of organisation we were going to call on. When we are talking about international syndicates, Scotland Yard is no further removed than Queanbeyan. That is the type of problem that we are dealing with. It is all encompassing, it is dangerous, it is corrupting of our society and of our organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a light matter, it is not a funny matter. It is a matter that goes to the very guts of the organisation of our democracy. How we deal with that will be on the head of everybody in this place. To suggest to the community that there is a simple, easy, slick way of doing it is to feed them a pup, to feed them something which will lead them at the end of the day to come back to us and say, `You misled us, you are the people responsible'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition, through Senator Hill's motion, has raised a very serious problem and has proposed the consideration of a solution to it. It is no part of the Opposition's case to discredit the National Crime Authority (NCA)-Senator Macklin seems to have worked himself up into a great state of passion about that matter, nor is it the Opposition's case to discredit the coronial inquiry being conducted in the Australian Capital Territory by Mr Cahill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned to propose and establish by this debate today that a royal commission in the particular circumstances would be a better and a more likely way of tackling and solving this very serious problem. Clearly, there are deficiencies in the NCA, as Senator Hill has said. Hopefully, they are temporary difficulties, but we are not here to discredit the NCA, and Senator Macklin's speech has mostly been way off the point. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that we are really concerned about does raise, and has raised, very great public disquiet; so much so that the whole of the New South Wales Parliament, both the Government and the Opposition, has supported a motion moved by Mr Hatton, an independent and long term crime fighter, and it is in substance that motion that we have proposed should be considered by the Government and the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter at the heart of this problem is police operations that go back to the early 1980s, known now as Operation Seville 1 and Operation Seville 2. They involve the authorisation or participation-whatever the right word to use is hard to say-in the growing of marijuana crops in Bungendore, which is just over the border from the Australian Capital Territory in New South Wales. The involvement of police in these particular activities is not, of course, unknown to police work. It is popularly known as entrapment, but in our own legal parlance it has got another name. But that is the popular name, and that is the way I propose to refer to it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very difficult, sensitive and dangerous form of police work, and clearly the involvement of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the New South Wales Police in this particular entrapment exercise has gone off the rails and raised these matters of great public disquiet. When I read the Queanbeyan proceedings, as they are now called, in the newspapers in February or March of last year I was immediately concerned about the evidence of the involvement of the police in the growing of marijuana. On what scale it was grown is also a matter of great concern. I do not think we have really ever established the scale of the growing of this marijuana. In fact, we do know that there was a rip-off-I think that was the word Mr Hatton used-in that people had converted to their own use marijuana valued at $2.75m and that it was as a result of this stripping of the crops that the operation was finally brought to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the concern I felt as a result of what I had read-and I did not know anything about the scale of the matter at all-I raised at the Estimates Committee dealing with the AFP on 13 April 1989, at which Senator Tate was present, the police operation in an abstract way with the Assistant Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. I did not want to get into the particulars of that operation because I did not know exactly the stage that legal proceedings had reached. I raised with him as best I could a hypothetical case, although he was very concerned to talk about the particular case, and I think that that is where we ended up. Mr Johnson said some very enlightening things. First of all, he said that in deciding on an operation of this kind the issue would be so important that it would need to come to the attention of the Commissioner of Police. Of course, we now find, in the answers given in the New South Wales Parliament earlier this week, that it is said that the Commissioner of the AFP himself approved of the involvement of the AFP. Mr Johnson went on-and this is even more important-to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>If confronted with those circumstances today-this is as far as the AFP is concerned-he would not allow that plantation to have been grown. In our judgment, and again armed with 20:20 hindsight, we are saying that that was a wrong decision. </PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>The risk of it being stripped, as it was, and released out into the community, as it was, was a risk not worth taking, from our point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>This operation was embarked upon essentially by the New South Wales Police, but there was clearly very deep involvement by the AFP as well. It was embarked upon apparently as a result of a decision taken at the very highest level. Whether the decision was actually taken by Sir Colin Woods on behalf of the AFP, I do not know, and that is not important, but it certainly was approved at the highest level in both the New South Wales Police and the AFP. The operation was embarked upon without any legal advice having been taken in relation to the matter and, as Mr Johnson said further in his evidence last year, that is now regarded as very foolish indeed because, of course, the difficulties of the evidence that is obtained by these entrapment methods when it gets to court may in fact lead to the trial failing-which, of course, it did in Queanbeyan. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those matters because these are very dangerous and difficult police methods and should be embarked upon only after very clear consideration and the taking of the best advice possible. But it has raised clearly in the minds of a lot of people a whole series of questions, and it raises the question to what extent some of the police may have been corrupt in these matters. That is what has been behind Mr Hatton's own research over so many years. His concern has been raised more and more by the failure to get answers. The answers given in the New South Wales Parliament earlier this week were the first time that any matters had been put on the public record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For years and years Mr Hatton has been trying to get information about these questions. The information has only just been given, and has raised a huge head of steam, and it is in those circumstances that we say a royal commission is probably the only way in which this matter can be handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate, the Minister in charge of this matter, has said that he does not accept the proposition that he has in fact rejected the call for a royal commission, and I am very pleased to hear that. But the fact is that he has rejected it at the present time, and one of the purposes of this debate today is to put to him, the Government and, hopefully, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself and not just the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who seems to be the one now handling this question, for further consideration the very strong arguments there are for a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Royal commissions in the last 10 years or so have been appointed into matters of this kind, and I mention in particular the Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking, in New South Wales, headed by Mr Justice Philip Woodward, which was a very thorough investigation for the first time into the growing of marijuana in Australia. That Royal Commission produced a great deal of valuable material. Subsequently, there was the joint Royal Commission between New South Wales and the Commonwealth known as the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, set up to investigate the activities of the infamous Mr Asia syndicate, and the subsequent Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Activities of the Nugan Hand Group, which was an equally infamous group. Mr Justice Stewart's report was a valuable and voluminous document which led to a great deal of action by government. Indeed, it led to Mr Justice Stewart himself being appointed the foundation chairman of the National Crime Authority. So that was also a very valuable royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commission that perhaps had the greatest value in the sense of developing new techniques and new methods was that conducted by Mr Frank Costigan. Again, that was a joint commission between the Commonwealth and Victoria and it led to a vast amount of information and recommendations which successive governments have been implementing over a number of years. Some of the better legislation in the criminal field by this government in recent years has had its origins in the report of Mr Costigan. </PARA>
<PARA> A royal commission is a very clear way to go because it gives the commissioner wide powers to deal with these vast areas and can obtain information on a wide scale. It can sit in public or in private, depending upon the circumstances, and that is particularly important as far as witnesses are concerned. It can require evidence to be given even though it may be self-incriminatory. It cannot be used in other proceedings, of course, but it can require the evidence to be given. It does not have to rely on a certificate, as does the coroner deciding to give a certificate in a particular case, which presents a coroner with very great difficulties indeed.</PARA>
<PARA> The importance of a royal commission is that it has these wider terms of reference as against a coroner's inquiry, which is a specific inquiry. Although it has the powers that Senator Tate has mentioned, they are limited. This matter we are now discussing calls for a wide-ranging power of inquiry. Royal commissions are also much better resourced than coroners' inquiries can be. I mentioned the pioneering methods and techniques of Mr Costigan, and those well established means are now available to a royal commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> A royal commission also has a great deal more general public authority. A royal commission can be given to a distinguished person. He does not have to be a judge, as Senator Macklin seems to think. Indeed, the two most outstanding royal commissions in recent years have been those conducted by Mr Costigan and Mr Fitzgerald. It is a question of the resources that are available to them and the investigators available. As Mr Hatton has pointed out, the investigator available to the coroner, Mr Cahill, is really the police force, which is under suspicion and should be inquired into. I know that there are police who are perfectly capable of assisting him, but the fact is that there is a question of public concern and public disquiet and it is a matter of allaying those concerns as much as getting the information. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that royal commissions can have access to taxation records, another very important power in relation to inquiries of this kind. </PARA>

<PARA>My dear Premier</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter dated 18 May 1990 expressing your Government's support for a proposal that a joint Royal Commission be established to investigate alleged activities of the Mafia, including police involvement with the Mafia in illegal growing of marijuana crops and alleged corruption, and the death of Assistant Commissioner Winchester of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has given careful consideration to your proposal. The matters covered in Mr Hatton's statement in the New South Wales Parliament are clearly of a serious nature. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Government, on reviewing the material raised, that establishment of a specially constituted Royal Commission would not be the most productive way of proceeding in the current circumstances. This view was elaborated on by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, in the Senate on 21 May. Senator Tate said: ``The real issue, I believe, is not whether the matters raised by Mr Hatton have needed or do need investigating but, rather, the most productive way to proceed from this point onwards''. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate did, nonetheless, give the following undertaking: ``I do, however, give this Government's commitment that if at the end of the Mr Cahill's inquiry there are remaining issues or if new issues come to light they will be investigated. If, in our view, that requires a Royal Commission, that is what we shall have, but at this stage that requirement is not clear''.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to those matters associated with Assistant Commissioner Winchester's death, there would be difficulties in conducting such an inquiry while the police are still energetically pursing lines of investigation and a Coronial inquiry into the same matter is well-advanced in its own comprehensive investigations. I might add that the Coronial inquiry is armed with considerable statutory powers, including not being bound by rules of evidence or procedure, the power to summon witnesses, the power to require the production of documents and the capacity to compel answers to questions on oath. </PARA>
<PARA> While the outcome of both investigations is uncertain at the present time, it does not seem that the circumstances of Assistant Commissioner Winchester's death would be effectively dealt with by the broad ranging inquiry you have outlined. In the event that either investigation brings to light matters that could affect that view the issue would, as I have said, be reconsidered. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to other allegations and events raised in Mr Hatton's statement, I am advised that the more specific and serious of these have already been thoroughly investigated, principally by the National Crime Authority. Moreover, the National Crime Authority has had a national reference since 30 May 1986 into the Mafia and its activities in Australia, as a result of which some 103 persons have had charges preferred against them. I also understand that the ACT Coroner has spoken to Mr Hatton and invited him to put before him any information he has. Mr Hatton has agreed to co-operate with the Coroner and has in fact forwarded some material. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned at the possible impact a Royal Commission may have on the findings of the Coronial inquiry. Should the Coroner commit a person or persons for trial, the attendant publicity surrounding a Royal Commission may well prejudice a future trial. In my view, the more appropriate course of action would be to allow the Coroner to complete his inquiry and consider the question of a Royal Commission in the light of his findings. </PARA>
<PARA> Both our Governments have been co-operating closely for some time now to counter the problems created by organised crime and I would want to see this continue. While it is the Commonwealth's considered view that a Royal Commission is not the best way of proceeding at this time, I would certainly not wish to close off dialogue on this matter and I would be happy if relevant Commonwealth and NSW Ministers meet to discuss it, if that seems desirable. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Sport is about performance in competition. Its huge popularity is due to a range of factors. It is self-fulfilling to compete, can endow fame and material rewards, and is usually most entertaining as a spectacle. For all of these reasons, competitors in sport often consider employing banned practices. Regrettably, many succumb to the temptation to use banned drugs in the pursuit of the success. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem is particularly widespread because sport enjoys such a high participation rate in this country. And it is not only competitors at the elite levels who will resort to drugs to succeed. The drugs in sport inquiry has found that there is a performance drug problem even among adolescent athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the problem is wider still. Some performance drugs, in particular anabolic steroids, are used by some people for what can only be described as cosmetic purposes. These people extend from professional bodybuilders to teenagers who want to improve their appearance on the beach. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly the inquiry on drugs in sport pursued by my Committee was not an inquiry concerning the exposure of a very narrow band of the Australian population to a small market in highly esoteric drugs. it was an inquiry into banned sporting drugs whose use could be considered by many people, from lower grade sports competitors and teenagers who frequent beaches all the way up to Australia's most elite athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential market for sports drugs, then, is very considerable. In the course of its investigations, the Committee heard from gymnasium proprietors and health professionals who advised the extent and value of this lucrative market. In fact, the potential scope and value of the sports drug black market raises the spectre of criminal activity concerning these drugs parallel, if not coincident, with that for other proscribed drugs, including narcotics. Of course, some drugs such as amphetamines are drugs of abuse in the wider community and are also proscribed sport drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the problem examined by the Committee is not only potentially widespread and involves significant criminal elements, but its possible consequences are tragic. In the course of the inquiry the Committee's resolve to contain the non-therapeutic use of sports drugs was even further strengthened following the death of a young Sydney bodybuilder from the abuse of diuretics and other drugs. The coroner found that at the age of 23 this university student has been rendered sterile from anabolic steroid consumption and had died from a sports drug induced heart attack on the eve of a bodybuilding competition in which he was to compete. The Committee's inquiry, then, is of particular relevance across Australian society and is not simply confined to questions about athletes cheating in sporting events. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Committee found that the problem of sports drug abuse could not persist as it has without the complicity or incompetent of corrupt medical practitioners, veterinarians and pharmacists. However, just as the inquiry did not expose more than a segment of the black market in banned sports drugs, so it had opportunity to do no more than expose a small number of doctors and pharmacists who have facilitated sports drug abuse. The second report analyses the particular circumstances made known to it about the black market and compliant doctors and pharmacists in the knowledge that the problem is much more widespread. Nevertheless, the Committee examined closely each of the cases before it to determine the methods by which sports drugs have been disseminated. </PARA>
<PARA> To demonstrate the nature of the problem uncovered by the Committee in this regard, I refer to the case of a doctor who practices at Woodridge in Queensland. In a seven-month period, one Brisbane pharmacy alone filled 1,107 steroid items on prescriptions from that doctor. Not only were veterinary anabolic steroids supplied for the majority of these prescriptions, but the doctor encouraged steroid use in a Brisbane gymnasium, touted for consultations there and prescribed anabolic steroids solely for bodybuilding purposes-against Australian Medical Association (AMA) policy. This case and several others assisted the Committee to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA>that the concept of self-regulation for medical practitioners on this issue is invalid;</PARA>
<PARA>that the AMA policy deploring the prescribing of anabolic steroids to improve athletic performance requires regulatory support and enforcement;</PARA>
<PARA>that doctors must be prevented from prescribing veterinary anabolic steroids and pharmacists from supplying them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, while the black market in sports drugs and the activities of corrupt doctors and pharmacists across Australia is more extensive than that revealed by the inquiry, the Committee's analysis of particular individuals has been sufficient for devising public policy proposals adequately to control the supply and abuse of sports drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Committee was unable to examine all `professional' sporting codes. In choosing four for examination, however, it was able to satisfy itself about action being taken in `professional' sport to curtail sports drug abuse. And, on the basis of that examination, the Committee devised recommendations for all `professional' sports that centre on the encouragement and administration of adequate drug testing regimes and ensuring that penalties imposed in any one sport-whether amateur or `professional'-will be respected by all sports. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to non-`professional' sports, the way in which the Committee proceeded was somewhat different. While all sports are vulnerable to performance drug use, some are certainly more vulnerable than others. And what is loosely known as the `power sports' are perhaps the most vulnerable. Accordingly, the Committee devoted considerable attention to the problem of drug abuse in weightlifting and powerlifting. It was also logical in this context to consider sports drug use in bodybuilding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee uncovered a most disturbing picture in Australian weightlifting. In recent years, the Australian Weightlifting Federation has corrupted drug tests by providing adequate clearance time warning, failed to investigate circumstances surrounding the failure of weightlifters to be drug-tested and, in one important case, failed to apply the internationally recognised penalty when a weightlifter was found positive for anabolic steroids in 1987. Further, as was noted in the interim report, the then head weightlifting coach at the Australian Institute of Sport admitted to the Committee that he had knowledge of rumours concerning the purchase overseas of large quantities of performance drugs by AIS weightlifters in 1982. He also admitted that he did nothing about an incident of anabolic steroid use at the AIS in 1984. The interim report had recommended a tribunal, which, had it been in operation in the early 1980s, would have been available to consider these sorts of matters and prevent the subsequent difficulties that were experienced by the AIS and several of its weightlifters. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to introduce appropriate reforms in Australian weightlifting, the second report makes eight recommendations. Many more of the Committee's 53 recommendations, however, will contribute to the establishment of a climate in Australia that will significantly constrain the black market in sports drugs and encourage a culture of drug avoidance among athletes. This will make it much less likely that performance drug abuse will continue in weightlifting and all other sports. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations concerning weightlifting are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the sport is improved while allowing it to reform itself. Because of the problems experienced by the Australian Weightlifting Federation, however, the Committee considered that the reform process should involve the International Weightlifting Federation. Further, the implementation unit recommended to be established in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories would facilitate the reviews and the necessary reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, much has already been achieved in the cause of preventing sports drug abuse since the Committee received this reference just two years ago in May 1988. One of the most significant steps following the tabling of the Committee's interim report in June 1989 was when the Commonwealth Government established the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) to conduct sports drug testing in Australia. ASDA has discharged that responsibility with distinction over the past year and the Committee anticipates that ASDA will soon enjoy appropriate legislative support. Its role has now been supplemented by the accreditation in April 1990 of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) by the International Olympic Committee. AGAL's accreditation means that ASDA no longer has to send samples abroad for testing. </PARA>
<PARA> While the achievements have already been significant, the fact that the Committee has made a further 53 recommendations for the second report indicates that very much more must be done to control sports drug abuse. Internationally, for instance, Australia must ensure that its drug-free athletes are competing in environments where those athletes can be confident that no competitors have resorted to performance drugs in the hope of securing an advantage. More must be done to present Australia's position on these matters in forums presently under way abroad. For example, the Dubin inquiry in Canada is inquiring into a similar range of matters examined already by this Committee; and I have been invited to present evidence to the sports drug inquiry into British weightlifting and powerlifting in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, the Committee's recommendations centre on the establishment of an investigatory authority, the Australian Sports Drug Tribunal, which would have authority to review all sports drug matters. That is, the Tribunal would ensure the rights of individual athletes who wished to appeal against penalties imposed following positive drug tests. And, importantly, the Tribunal would also ensure that all drug testing proceeded effectively and that sport authorities conducted their drug testing activities properly and enforced them. The Committee considers that the Australian Sports Drug Tribunal should be established as a matter of some urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal would complement the role of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The Tribunal would receive advice from ASDA about drug test positives and any instances where samples had failed to be provided or where sports administrators had not applied the required penalties. The Tribunal would utilise powers approximating those of a Senate committee in conducting its investigations. It would report to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories the substance of all its investigations and findings. It would subsequently report to the Parliament through the ASDA annual report. Clearly, the operation of this authority would ensure the competent and fair administration of sports drug testing in Australia. Importantly, its establishment would comply with section 7 of the International Olympic Committee's model for a national anti-doping program where the IOC advocates due process review and appeal mechanisms for doping control. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should note that the Committee has determined that it will continue with the drugs in sport reference until the Australian Sports Drug Tribunal is established. This will permit the Committee to continue its public monitoring role of sports drug abuse until that is no longer necessary. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the limited time I have I want to go through some of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts report on drugs in sport. Many of them have been covered adequately and competently by Senator Black, the Chairman of the Committee. I refer first to some recommendations which were made by the first Committee and which have not, in the view of this Committee, been dealt with adequately. We again pursue those recommendations with a sense of the integrity that is required of this Committee and of those who administer public funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two matters, regrettably, appear to me to reflect the arrogant disregard the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) has for the findings of this Committee and the view of anybody outside the Committee. In the interim report we made some recommendations, for instance, in respect to Miss Jane Flemming. I feel it is a great pity that this matter has to be raised again in this report and has to be raised by me in this chamber because it rather gets to the point where we could be seen as being persecutors because of the attitude of the ASC, and no doubt it will cause Miss Flemming some unnecessary pain and discomfort. Having said that, I do not believe that Miss Flemming ought to suffer a penalty which would bar her from future participation. However, the severity of the penalty ought not, in my view, in any circumstances be equated to the skill, the ability or the profile of the athlete. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Miss Flemming, as the interim report noted, Miss Flemming confessed in camera to us, although she had come along for a quite different reason, that a Mr Plant had come up to her at the Ulster Games in Belfast on 30 June of 1986. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> [Mr Plant] came up to me [at the javelin throwing area] and asked me if I would urinate in a bottle for Sue Howland because she had been picked for testing . . . He gave me a drink bottle . . . I went and weed in a bottle and apparently it got passed off as Sue's urine sample. </PARA>
<PARA>This attempt to corrupt a drug test was closely examined in the interim report and a number of conclusions were drawn. Without reading them all, let me mention one:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee finds it unacceptable that although Ms Flemming held an AIS scholarship and discussed the incident with Messrs Kemp, Hilliard and Rice, all AIS coaches, no formal report was made to the AIS, in the first instance by Kemp, although he wrote to the AAU, and in the second instance by the other two. The Committee rejects Mr Bowman's suggestion-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bowman, I might tell honourable senators, is now the acting head of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS)-</PARA>
<PARA> that because Ms Flemming was representing Australia and not the AIS, the substitution incident was a matter for the Australian Athletic Union and not the AIS. Under the Code of Ethics which AIS scholarship holders are required to sign, the athletes agree, inter alia, to `abide by both the rules and the spirit of my sport'. In the Committee's view, Ms Flemming is liable for disciplinary action by both the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Athletic Union. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the publication of that report Mr Rice, a very senior member of the Australian Institute of Sport, has written to the Committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that Jane Flemming, Merv Kemp and Craig Hilliard have admitted that Jane produced a urine specimen at Belfast. When I interviewed Jane at A.I.S. she informed me that she had not done so. For this reason I took no action against her, allowing A.A.U. to continue its enquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>That begs the question of whether Mr Rice is likely to have lied to us or Miss Jane Flemming is likely to have lied to us under oath. That, I trust, is a matter that will be pursued by the Australian Sports Commission. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>For present consideration, perhaps the most relevant part of the Interim Report conclusions with regard to Jane Flemming is the last sentence of paragraph 7.102:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Committee's view, Ms Flemming is liable for disciplinary action by both the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Athletic Union. </PARA>
<PARA>During the Estimates Committee hearings last year I managed to extract from Mr Perry Crosswhite, then acting Chief Executive of the AIS and now the acting head of the Australian Sports Commission-he appeared before Senate Estimates Committee D on 28 September 1989-advice that a report had been provided to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Minister responsible for the Australian Sports Commission, concerning the conclusions of the interim report. He confirmed that a letter had been sent to Miss Jane Flemming advising her that the Australian Sports Commission thought that she had done wrong and that it disapproved of her participation in the urine substitution. As events transpired, Mr Crosswhite then went on to say that a letter had been written to this effect to Miss Flemming. He subsequently contacted the Committee to advise us that, contrary to his previous advice, no such letter had been sent to Miss Flemming at all but that it was subsequently written and that disapproval was contained in that correspondence. I remind the Senate and the Australian Sports Commission that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) list of doping classes and methods states:</PARA>
<PARA>The IOC Medical Commission bans the use of substances and of methods which alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping controls. Examples of banned methods are . . . urine substitution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is some considerable comment in respect to the IOC's attitude to the corrupting of drug tests. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Australian Sports Commission, headed by Mr Ted Harris, has judged that nothing worse than a letter of disapproval ought to be written to Miss Jane Flemming, notwithstanding the fact that under normal circumstances she would have been expelled from the Institute and she would have been banned, I think for life, for her conduct. That is what has put us in the dilemma we are presently in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Athletics Union thus far has done absolutely nothing, although Mr Plant, who solicited the urine sample from Miss Flemming, has written to the AAU and, in a moment of remorse, he has acknowledged a potential error of judgment-not that he was wrong, not that he was downright corrupt, not that there had been an error, but that there had been a potential error. He acknowledged a potential error of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other recommendation which has been ignominiously ignored is the recommendation that disciplinary action be taken against Mr Peter Bowman. The interim report recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>that the AIS investigate the approval of medical supply purchases without medical officer authorisation, contrary to AIS policy, with a view to disciplinary action. </PARA>
<PARA>Our report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee finds it difficult to believe that the actions of Mr Jones and Mr Wardle could have taken place without some degree of acquiescence or co-operation by senior administrators, and in particular, Mr Bowman. </PARA>
<PARA>The relevance of that is that the Committee found that Mr Jones and Mr Wardle were purchasing drugs, anabolic steroids, for weightlifters at the Institute, presumably using taxpayers' money, and it would have been very difficult for that to have taken place without the conduct of Mr Bowman. Mr Bowman's discipline for that was to be promoted to acting head of the AIS. I suspect that that again is the attitude of the Australian Sports Commission to the report and to the conduct of the various officers. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Mr Jones and Mr Wardle themselves, of course, absolutely nothing has been done. Mr Jones has left the Institute but Mr Wardle happily lives on over there without, to my knowledge, any disciplinary action having taken place whatsoever. In respect to Mr Jones, it was the Committee's conviction that action ought to have taken place on two levels. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the Australian Weightlifting Federation (AWF) ought to have conducted its own investigation of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has established that the approach taken by the AWF to Mr Lyn Jones and the conclusions of the Interim Report is reprehensible. This judgment has been drawn on the following grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>2.35 First, Mr Lyn Jones did not appear before the Committee to provide evidence until Wednesday, 14 December 1988. Yet, at the Annual General Meeting of the AWF held on Saturday 10 December 1988, the AWF passed a resolution pre-emptive of hearings to be held about the AIS, weightlifting in Australia, and drug-taking. The minutes of the AWF Annual General Meeting of 10 December 1988 record that a motion was passed unanimously declaring `total confidence in the integrity and the record of Federation officials, the weightlifting coaches of the AIS and the weightlifting coaches of NSW and Victoria'. The AWF, then, before any officials appeared at the inquiry, showed that it had prejudged the matters to be reviewed. It did not present itself as an authority capable of objective investigation of whatever conclusions were reached by the Committee about Australian weightlifting. This matter is further mentioned at Chapter Six of this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter is referred to later in the report. I think it is a reflection of the standing of weightlifting and its administration in Australia and, in part, makes the recommendations that the Committee ultimately made on weightlifting compelling in their conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to further findings of the second report. One matter which we raised again is that concerning the Australian Sports Drug Tribunal. It is the Committee's view that there ought to be a mechanism in place which provides an opportunity for athletes who feel aggrieved to appeal against findings of whatever nature. It is my view that had such a tribunal been in place now, we would not have had the problems with the Vinnicombe-Neiwand allegations and we would not have had the Chairman of Australian Airlines, Mr Ted Harris, investigating an employee of his company. The Tribunal is designed to protect and preserve the rights of athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will jump ahead to the evidence we received in respect of professional sport in Australia. I will touch for a moment on the matter of the Australian Football League. It is symptomatic, I suspect, of almost every sport in Australia that those asked about the likelihood of drugs being used in their sport give what they believe to be compelling reasons why drugs are inappropriate and then reflect favourably-and quite properly-upon their athletes. They say there is no prospect of their athletes being inclined to use performance enhancing drugs. Those sorts of comments in respect of the Australian Football League show an abysmal lack of understanding of steroids and perhaps highlight the need for further and better education in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> We received evidence from the Australian Football League's doctor and from the players' representative, Mr Madden, who concluded that anabolic steroids would be of no benefit to the sport and that they were not being used. Much was said in a similar vein by Mr Ross Oakley. Mr Oakley stated:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most important things in our game is durability; being able to last a full game and being able to run around a large football field for 120 minutes of football. On that basis, I do not believe there is a risk group, as such, as there is in rugby. </PARA>
<PARA>That contrasts rather acutely with a recent positive finding from a Soviet Union marathon runner who presumably runs for a period of 120 minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would have thought so. Perhaps, more than anything else, what epitomises the lack of understanding of what is going on in their own sport was this evidence that was given to the Committee in camera:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, with regard to anabolic steroids, the Committee's conviction that they can be directly relevant to AFL players was confirmed during in camera evidence. The Committee accepts, as credible, advice that VFL players in at least one Melbourne club have been administered anabolic steroids over a period of years by the Club doctor. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably the doctor, the coach and players imagined that there was some perceived benefit from steroid use. While the Committee has proposed some improvements, it considers that, in general, the administrators of the professional sports examined for this report have taken a responsible attitude to the threat posed by performance enhancing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Black made reference to the problems that we have with doctors prescribing steroids and with chemists dispensing them. The Committee has made some recommendations which I trust will overcome that problem. For instance, there is the Queensland case concerning Dr Mark Mitchelson who prescribed 1,107 steroid items which were dispensed at Mr Azar's pharmacy over a seven-month period. Of those 1,107 items, 366 were Deca 50, which is an animal steroid. Mr Azar dispensed 756 veterinary steroids between the end of July 1988 and 20 February 1989. One must assume that there are either a lot of very sick dogs in Queensland or that the use of anabolic steroids is endemic and that veterinary steroids are being obtained legally through doctors' prescriptions and are being dispensed by chemists. The two issues are: firstly, the use of anabolic steroids and, secondly, and more particularly, the use of veterinary steroids. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Azar is not the only person involved. There are a number doing exactly the same thing. Mr Azar explained to the Committee in evidence that, upon checking with the poisons regulations and other information, there was nothing to say that he was doing anything improper or illegal and that that, in his view, applied also to the doctors who had been filling in the prescriptions. Mr Azar made it clear to us that he knew something about the side effects of steroid use but that he knew absolutely nothing about dosages. As the report points out, it makes it impossible to discuss side effects of steroids if one does not know anything about dosages. The Committee has made recommendations in respect of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the question of a black market for steroids, there clearly is a black market in Australia. The depth of such a market is not easy to identify but the Committee received sufficient evidence to satisfy it that it is alive and well. A company in Western Australia, SAA Research, which has been referred to previously and which is run by Mr Were and Mr George Farquhar, used to advertise very freely that it was providing steroids. Hopefully, the Committee's recommendations might solve that problem in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA> If my memory serves me correctly, at the present time, with the exception of Queensland, it is not an offence in any State to prescribe veterinary steroids for use by humans. Of course, one of the other problems concerns the apprehension of anabolic steroids at the Customs barrier. In one recent case steroids were returned to the gentleman who had been apprehended on the basis of his claim that they were for his personal use. He had sufficient steroids for normal dosages for forty years of personal use. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter we looked at, although not in as much depth as I would have wished, as time overtook us, was the question of bouncer violence. While it is not an issue which directly reflects upon sport, it is a by-product of athletes using steroids for body building purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has taken considerable evidence from a number of body builders who found employment as bouncers in the security industry. There is clearly a disturbing increase in the level of violence in nightclubs. We took very disturbing evidence. In fact, Sergeant Jones from the Australian Federal Police told us in evidence:</PARA>
<PARA>We know of at least one firm in the Australian Capital Territory, MIL Security, which hires a lot of powerlifters, cum bodybuilders. Several of the ex-AIS lifters (weightlifters) and the owner of the firm, Michael Ian Lawrence, have records as long as your arm, for want of the better word. My understanding is that he has a number of convictions for assaulting police. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lawrence, the principal of MIL Security, responded to a letter from the Committee by confirming that he had a criminal record, including four counts of assaulting police over the past four years. The reason that is a matter of concern to me is that, almost without exception, the bouncers in these nightclubs are body builders and many of them use anabolic steroids. They see their duties and responsibilities as giving them a quasi-legitimate right to use physical violence against customers, and in many circumstances those customers are not in a state either to resist or to recall in detail later the events that had taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other matters which is of concern to us is that of police officers moonlighting after hours as bouncers and also those that take anabolic steroids. I understand that both Victoria and Queensland are now taking steps to regulate the security industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Black has spoken at some length on the question of weight-lifting in Australia and its administration which I would have thought is either corrupt or incompetent. My best guess is that it is both. It is clearly not able to administer itself in a professional way. There is much evidence given of the use of anabolic steroids by weight-lifters. There is evidence of prior notice of the intention to test, including a circular distributed by Dr David Kennedy, Chairman of the Australian Weightlifting Association and the Oceania Medical Committee, and a member of the International Weightlifting Federation Committee. There are two excellent examples in the report of positives taken and no action taken. One is in respect of a Mr Satry Ma. Another one is Mr Nick Voukelatos. There are circumstances surrounding a Darren Walker. All of these deserve very considerable investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that I hope that the recommendations in this report are pursued by the Government with some vigour and by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC). It is the latter one that I have particular concern about. I will be raising the matter of primary concern at the Estimates Committee, but thus far I have seen no determination by the ASC to pursue the recommendations that have been made by this Committee and which impinge upon the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly. The first point I put on record concerns the work done by the Chairman and the secretariat on this inquiry. I believe that when this term of reference was first mooted it was received with quite a lukewarm reception by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. It was mainly activated by the wish of the Chairman, Senator Crichton-Browne and me. It turned out to be a far-reaching inquiry. History will treat it as a far-reaching inquiry for what it has brought out today. I know that Senator Black departs on 30 June from this place but that may be temporary. If he does not ever return to this place, I think he will be remembered for the work that he has done on this Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I have any criticism of the inquiry, it is that although it lasted long enough it was not quite widespread enough, and there have been some reasons for that. My biggest concern is that the inquiry did not come to my State of Western Australia where we have a lot of expertise in sports medicine and other facilities allied to sports medicine. But not only that, we have a problem. Probably the greatest single problem in Western Australia pertaining to drugs in sport is that the veterinary chemicals that are being used and abused by humans are supplied from over there. I was sorry that the inquiry did not go to Western Australia, but I know that there were problems. I believe there were two dates set down and both were interfered with by the airline strike. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I will not go into the recommendations in depth, but I would just like to look at No. 1 which has already been mentioned, and that is that the Government establish an implementation unit within the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to deal in an integrated fashion with the recommendations from the interim and second reports. The fears or concerns I expressed earlier were that the inquiry did not cover all of Australia or other codes of sport, because I believe that the inquiry was concentrated mostly on power sports. Obviously, that is where steroids have mostly been abused. There are certainly other codes of football and other sports that could have been looked at. I do not fear for that. </PARA>
<PARA> If this first recommendation is put into place, those aspects can be picked up in due course. I certainly hope that the Government does take up that particular recommendation and most of the other recommendations that are in this report. I know there are members of the Committee who have not had a chance to read the report fully who may want to speak further-and I certainly have not digested the whole report-but I would seek leave at this stage, if there are no other willing speakers, to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before us this afternoon we have four reports from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I wish to speak to two of these. The first is the report of the inquiry into the death of Nita Blankett. Nita Blankett died on 14 January 1982. She was then in the custody of the Department of Corrections and died at approximately 10.30 p.m. en route to St Andrews Medical Centre, Midland, which is on the outskirts of Perth, where it was intended that she would receive medical treatment for an acute attack of asthma from which she was suffering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nita Blankett was a chronic asthmatic with a history of severe attacks requiring hospitalisation. Her asthma was not well controlled. Before her imprisonment she was an invalid pensioner unable to work because of asthma. On the day of her death she was cleaning windows with an ammonia-based cleaner. It is possible that this precipitated the attack. While junior custodial staff and other prisoners were sympathetic and concerned, Senior Officer Crowfoot did not both at any time to check up on their concerns, although she did ask Sister Rice to see the prisoner. Sister Rice, we learn in the report, despite her professional training, had very poor knowledge of the condition of asthma.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Sister Rice did not accept the request of Nita Blankett to be examined by a doctor, nor did she pass on the request to Senior Officer Crowfoot because she did not think it would be possible. It appears that there was some thought that Nita Blankett was putting it on and that her symptoms were not real. Eventually, in spite of Nita's hysterical pleas for an ambulance, she was taken to the medical centre, but taken in a prison van. She was left alone in the back of the van with non-one to comfort here. When they arrived at the medical centre she was dead. In spite of the fact that the surgery was well equipped with all the necessary equipment, the doctor on duty did not bother to attempt resuscitation. He certified life extinct. </PARA>
<PARA> We learn that the police investigation was inadequate. One day was allocated for completion of the task and the young woman given the job had no experience with sudden death, let alone a death in custody. She did not bother to check on the standing orders relating to such matters. In his report the Commissioner states:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems an unusual way to conduct an investigation of a death in custody, to rely upon the Superintendent to select the prisoners who would, or would not, speak to the investigating officer from the police. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on he states:</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the inquest the Coroner discovered that a number of other prisoners could give evidence on the events of that night, and the inquest was adjourned accordingly to enable these prisoners to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The tragedy of this sorry tale is that a fully equipped ambulance was only minutes away. Indeed, knowing the history of Nita Blankett and her asthma, the suspicion has to be there that she need not have died. The Commissioner in his conclusions says:</PARA>
<PARA>I commend changes in procedure which have already been implemented and I recommend that custodial and medical staff receive the necessary information and training to enable them to follow general procedures for dealing with medical emergencies and specifically to recognise and deal with an asthma attack in a prisoner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish also to speak to this report, which again relates to a death in custody in Western Australia. This is the report of the inquiry into the death of Albert Dougal. Albert Dougal was born in Broome on 26 February 1956. On the evening of Wednesday, 4 December 1980, he was lodged in the lockup of the Broome police station by police officers, who assumed that he was drunk when they found him at about 8.45 p.m. on the roadway outside the Roebuck Bay Hotel. He was in an unconscious condition from which he could not be roused and he smelled strongly of alcohol. He died on 9 December. A post-mortem was performed on his body and it was found that the cause of death was respiratory failure due to brain damage. In fact his skull was fractured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is particularly tragic here again is that the police acted in good faith. At the time their ruling was that if a person was found presumably drunk but unconscious outside the Roebuck Bay Hotel in Broome, then that person would be imprisoned. The rules have now been changed and for very good reason. Indeed, the death of Albert Dougal has had a lot to do with the changing of those rules. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened to Albert Dougal? He did not regain consciousness. In fact, he was checked only once during the night. During the period Dougal was in the police lockup, only one cell check was noted and that was at 2.55 a.m., five minutes before the constable and the police aide went off duty for the night. The Commissioner is very critical of the fact that police lockups in Western Australia, and presumably in other States too, are not necessarily manned all night. Indeed, in this report the Commissioner makes the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> I would urge the Commissioner of Police to ensure that country police stations such as Broome are manned twenty-four hours a day. If resources are not available, it is incumbent on government to provide them. The police cannot fulfil their duty of care to those in their custody otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very obvious statement. If people are in custody, by definition they are under care. The next morning when Albert Dougal could not be roused he was removed to the Broome District Hospital. Finally, emergency exploratory surgery was undertaken to treat brain damage but he did not regain consciousness and died four days later on the morning of 9 December. Other recommendations which have been made with regard to other deaths in custody also relate to the condition of Albert Dougal. That is, if a person in custody cannot be roused, then medical attention should be sought immediately. This is one of the standing orders of the East Perth lockup. I presume that this is now carried out in all the lockups in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Very shortly the Royal Commission will cease its investigations. Certainly the recommendations made by the various Commissioners are very serious. It is to be hoped that all States will take note of those recommendations and immediately implement them. Some of the recommendations made in Commissioner Muirhead's interim report have not yet been implemented by a number of States. This is a very urgent and serious matter, which should be addressed immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jane Mugford has taken a particular interest in domestic violence, dealt with in the seventeenth annual report of the Australian Institute of Criminology. She very clearly points out that, although several surveys have been taken, we have no statistics on domestic violence at all. One survey that comes to mind states that one in five men think it is all right to rough up their wives every now and again. Some women think that that is still acceptable. It is horrifying, but it is just a survey; it is not a statistic that is at all reliable. Ms Mugford says that there are no accurate statistics on the extent of the problem that could be used to guide the present Government on any decision making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government has committed only $2m over three years for its national education campaign compared with $16m for the current year alone on public education on drug abuse. As honourable senators can see, the $2m over three years is totally inadequate. We believe that there is a problem in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report, put out by the Criminology Research Council, relates to rural domestic violence. Again, there are no statistics. Miss Mugford says that the use of the statistic of domestic violence being committed in one in three homes can only come home to haunt us because we have no accurate information and therefore that statistic could be entirely wrong; yet we keep perpetrating the use of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Mugford has prepared a methodology for working out statistics. That is mentioned in this annual report. The Minister might be able to inform me whether this suggestion is being taken up by the Government. Miss Mugford has a method of collecting statistics on domestic violence which, if implemented, would provide for the first time in Australia a firm basis for estimating prevalence of domestic violence and it would collect and coordinate information on cases reported to criminal justice as well as health and welfare agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that this information, this data, is collected and collected as soon as possible. As I say, it is of great concern to me that so little money has been put forward by the Government in this area. I ask the Minister to inform the Senate whether Miss Mugford will be permitted to carry out this research.

<PARA> We are now in a time when people are placing ever-increasing emphasis on correct diet and healthy lifestyle. Seafoods fit well within that category. It is clear that, as we approach the twenty-first century, seafoods will become a more important part of our diet. In considering programs suitable for funding, the Council looks at applications which can conserve our fisheries resource and at the same time enhance productivity. One of the key areas which falls within these categories is the opportunities for new fisheries in providing access to fish stocks. We have seen the development of aquaculture as part of this process whereby what previously would have been considered as native species are being harvested in a similar manner to normal farm production. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments lead to increasing returns to producers and the lowering of costs generally for the consumer. During the election campaign Senator Fred Chaney, as he then was, and I inspected a fish farm at Dover in Tasmania where we were shown a trial growing area of native fish called stripey trumpeter. The potential for that species further down the track, particularly on the Japanese market, is quite considerable. In looking at this Council's report, I was particularly interested in a number of programs that have received funding and were based in my own State of Tasmania. I will, therefore, briefly elaborate on several of those projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I would like to mention the jack mackerel resource assessment in south-eastern Australian waters which is being undertaken by the Division of Sea Fisheries within the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries. Jack mackerel is Australia's largest single species fishery. In 1988-89, 42,000 tonnes valued at $4m were landed. Over the last two years catches of jack mackerel have been monitored with a view to collecting important information regarding stock size, breeding and early life history. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important for the future that jack mackerel stocks be assessed in relation to environmental factors to enable appropriate annual total catches to be set. Over this season it has been disappointing to see that those numbers have dropped significantly. As yet, we do not know the reason. But because of this important research we will be able to find out the reason. I also place on record my personal appreciation and the appreciation of the whole community for the work which the Division of Sea Fisheries is undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the scholarships for training fishermen which the Council is providing at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. The Australian Maritime College has filled a vital role in providing training for local fishermen to ensure the proper utilisation of our fisheries resources within the 200-mile Australian fishing zone. Obviously, if our fishing industry is to prosper and grow, it is vital that we encourage young people to make use of the comprehensive training facilities at the College. Without such financial support the young people concerned would not be able to take time for such courses. </PARA>
<PARA> I also briefly refer to the very important work being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) into toxic dinoflagellate spores in ships' ballast water, which has been of some concern to the mollusc growing industry-for example, oysters and mussels-in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel area. This problem has come forward in recent times and it is very encouraging to see that this Research Council is investigating that matter. It is understood that the algae was introduced to Tasmanian waters, possibly from Japan, through the discharge of ballast water. It is thanks to the research of the CSIRO that we are developing a better understanding of this process and the way in which such micro-organisms can cause risks to human health. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to comment on a couple of matters in this report of the Australian Agricultural Council (AAC) meeting, held in Hobart on 8 February 1990. Page 19 of the report refers to the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. I place on the record that that particular Australian Agricultural Council meeting made recommendations as a result of recommendations that were made by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare in its report on Animal Experimentation. In sections 13, 15 and 16 of that report, the Senate Select Committee recommended that all States and Territories upgrade animal welfare legislation and establish animal welfare advisory councils and departmental animal welfare units, as has been done in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The Committee went on to recommend that the system of controlling animal experimentation in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia be extended to other States and Territories. That system was to be based on upgraded legislation, incorporation of a code of practice into regulations, the accreditation and licensing of institutions in which animal experimentation was to be conducted, and the appointment of inspectors to monitor the work of ethics committees, animal house facilities, and practices in the conduct of animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA> That particular report caused quite a bit of comment among those learning facilities throughout Australia that use animals in experimentation. I am very pleased to see that the Australian Agricultural Council has recommended that those particular recommendations be taken up. The Australian Agricultural Council noted that its writing group, set up to revise the code of practice, had consulted with all State and Territory government departments responsible for the welfare of animals, and that nominees of the relevant Ministers in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia had joined in with the writing group to assist with the revision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to see that the recommendations we made last year in our report have been taken up and that the relevant staff or Ministers from those particular States that we highlighted as being the three States that had shown the lead in this particular code of practice were imploring the other States to pick up the code of practice that we had recommended in our report. It is also interesting to note that the revised code had been considered by the sub-committee on animal welfare of the AAC's Animal Health Committee and was endorsed by the Standing Committee on Agriculture, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The result of that will be the publication of the code by the NHMRC. It was agreed that the code will be taken back to the Australian Agricultural Council for further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council raised another matter in its report. It referred to the Select Committee's report on Sheep Husbandry and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Select Committee's recommendations are generally moderate and most relate to research inputs which the Committee wishes to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to note the recommendations of our Committee report on Sheep Husbandry and agreed that the progress by the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments towards implementation of the recommendations should be reported back to the next Council meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. Before we adjourned the discussion on the immigration estimates prior to lunch the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) had responded to some of the questions and issues which I had raised following answers from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to my questions on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He made the point that the long processing times to which I had referred with regard to Athens and Damascus were due to delays in the lodgment of further information requested by those stations. That, in turn, was also attributed to problems in the Gulf area. However, I remind the Minister that the applications which we are discussing relate to applications lodged by accredited agents. All of those applications ought to be complete-certainly, I would assume that most would be complete unless the accredited agents acting for intending migrants from those areas are very amateurish in fulfilling their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I ask the Minister: In what respect are those applications incomplete? What percentage of applications at those two stations are being lodged incomplete? What is the average processing time to finalisation of those applications which are lodged in complete format?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned that there was going to be an increase in personnel provided in Hong Kong to process applications. I think he mentioned that those increased resources would be in place by August or September. How many extra people will be devoted to processing business migration program applications in Hong Kong?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also attributed the increase in outstanding applications in Hong Kong now, compared with six months ago, to the fact that a number of them were what he described as stage 3 situations; that is, the applications had been approved but the visas had not yet been collected. Surely that situation would also have applied six months ago. Is the proportion of applications 37 per cent, or smaller or greater? Surely that, of itself, is not the reason for the increase in the number of outstanding applications now as against six months ago. I ask the Minister what percentage of the applications were at this stage 3 process six months ago, so we can get a real comparison of the actual increase in outstanding applications. </PARA>
<PARA> More generally, with regard to the continuation of long processing times, is the Minister aware that accredited agents have expressed their concern to me, certainly, that they believe that some posts are ignoring the role of accredited agents, as intended by this Government with regard to the processing of business migration program applications, and certainly appear to be processing these applications themselves in the way that they used to be processed under the pre-accredited agents. In effect, they are ignoring the role of accredited agents in dealing with applications. These agents believe this is a significant factor in continuing delays in the processing of applications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Chapman were to look at the record from earlier today he would find, for instance, in respect of the first question he asked about Athens and the processing of forms there, that I indicated generally that one of the reasons was the fact that we are talking about applications from Gulf states being processed in Athens. There are difficulties because of that particular area and also because of the travel involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without being able to give specific details to his specific questions, I ask Senator Chapman to take into account that the processing of forms and applications from the Gulf states is done by someone who goes down periodically to those states. Obviously, that would not be a daily or weekly event. It happens infrequently, I believe-at three monthly periods. Then there is the associated question of medical and security checks which also have to be done. When all those things are added together the scenario shows there are good reasons for longer time periods out of Athens. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Hong Kong and the number of extra staff there, I will go to the second part of the question first. In terms of stage 3 problems with applications I am informed that there has been a slight increase over the six month period. There were 495 outstanding applications six months ago and 647 outstanding now. That is just a slight increase in number. I also indicated earlier this afternoon that it was one of the factors and that the Department had reviewed the situation. I am informed, if I can read the writing, that there will be one A-based officer extra in Hong Kong and appropriate local staff will be employed as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman went on to ask about accredited agents being ignored. I think we should take into account the fact that even though agents are accredited, at some of the posts people can still make applications as individuals, and do so. That might be something which Senator Chapman is not taking into account. Probably the best way to approach the problem that Senator Chapman has with accredited agents claiming they are ignored is to bring those cases specifically to our notice and we will pursue them that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have three matters remaining which relate to questions not answered at the time of the report. They are numbers 9, 22 and 7, and I will talk to them in that order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, there is the question of Cambodian citizens in Thailand. For more than a decade there have been persons who have left the turmoil of Cambodia to go across the swamps in the border region at considerable danger to their lives from mines, one army or another, the swamps, civilian ambushes and thieves. Thousands of those persons are in camps which have become well known in this country, such as Khao I Dang and others along the border. Many honourable senators and members have visited one or other of the camps. I have made such a visit. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks there has been a series of letters sent by the Australian Embassy in Bangkok to about 2,000 families in Australia who came from Cambodia, almost entirely, through the refugee program. They wish to sponsor persons in those camps to come to Australia. I raised questions about this quite large program that is now under way with regard to those 2,000 families. The letters came soon after the last general election during the month of April from Bangkok to very many Australian families that had formerly been living in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Minister and the Department for the careful supplementary answer that has been given to us. I note and endorse the distinction that is being made in the consideration for immigration purposes between a refugee application as one thing, and an application for immigration on ordinary grounds as another. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that there is a minority of persons in the camps who are last remaining relatives, spouses or dependent children and who would, on an ordinary application, wherever they lived in the world, be successful in being able to immigrate to Australia. It is commendable that there is now a concentration in the Department's program on the priority of those person actually joining their families in Australia in a way that does not offend the Thai Government. In particular, I want to ask about the happy conclusion that was set out in the further answer given to me yesterday, which is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Thai authorities have indicated that in very strong compassionate circumstances they would permit, on a case by case basis, immediate family of Australian residents, such as spouses and dependent children, to be processed for settlement in Australia if the Australian Government were prepared to accept them under our normal migrant entry criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>My remaining few questions are: Have all of the letters that are to be sent under this new approach been sent to former applicants; are the 2,000 letters that have been sent all that will be sent; how many applicants have taken up the letter's suggestion that if there is a close family relationship they reapply; and is there any difficulty in the way these new applications are being processed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Teague would probably accept the sort of response I give. He seeks a lot of information which is not available to us. I will undertake to get that for him as soon as possible. We are talking about how many letters have been sent and whether all of them have been sent. That, for instance, might be very hard to answer. Finding out how many applicants have responded would be impossible for us to answer at the moment. We will get those answers to Senator Teague and also pay attention to the question of difficulties that might arise through the immediate experience that we have had.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Bolkus. I press on with my second last question, question no. 22, which is on the same topic as question no. 23 and which relates to the grants-in-aid program. The grants-in-aid scheme is one that has bipartisan support in Parliament. In the settlement process there is the need for advisers and counsellors to be associated with particular communities in various cities and country areas. That is without dispute. However, there was a half a million dollars addition to the grants-in-aid program further to that which had been determined in the Budget. It is interesting to look down the list of where those grants went to in the various States. In the material supplied yesterday, there is a list that sets out where the grants-in-aid are located in each state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty I have is that the Government, just prior to an election, during February, gave an extra half a million dollars to a multi-million dollar program of grants-in-aid. Whilst the Minister sent letters to the recipients noting that they had been successful in receiving the grants in aid, this statement is in the paper I received yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>All Government MPs with successful grants in their electorates were advised of the award of those grants. </PARA>
<PARA>Not one Opposition member was advised of these grants-in-aid going to their electorates. Yet, as one goes down the list of where the grants-in-aid were given, one notices quite a large number of electorates that were then represented by the Opposition. Happily, a lot more are now represented by Opposition members. Yet it is the policy of this Government to give selective information only to members of parliament who are from the Government side of the House. Of course, in the six weeks preceding an election those members can go around the community involved, `glad hand' them and put a great deal of emphasis on the way they have received this grant from the Government and on the fact that an extra half a million dollars has been given to the program. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Minister has determined not only that the multi-million dollar grants program will be approved in February but also that an extra half a million dollars will be in the hands of government MPs so that they can announce the grants and make the most of them in an electioneering context. I regard that as disgraceful discrimination against other members of parliament who also care for their electorates and who are concerned about the ethnic communities that are in need of these grants. I protest to the Minister and ask that, whenever grants are made, the member of parliament concerned be given the same information and prior notice whether he or she is a member of the Government or a member of the Opposition. </PARA>

The process that was in place last year, this year and for the time of operation of this scheme, I am told, is one that has been advised to the Senate through our answer to Senator Teague's question. We have a situation where a Government Minister makes the announcement and Government MPs are advised. The last part of the third last paragraph of the answer may also be something that Senator Teague skipped in his quick reading of the answer. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I am told that that one sentence covers scores of MPs who made representations from all sides of the Parliament. They were advised as well.

<PARA>ETHNIC LOBBY INFLUENCE STEERS MIGRATION POLICY</PARA>
<PARA>by Joanne Gray</PARA>
<PARA>Several ethnic leaders, together with senior officials in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, are exercising extraordinary power over the Government's Immigration policy, blurring the push for a stricter economic focus and forcing senior public servants to be dumped. </PARA>
<PARA> The influence of ethnic lobbyists derives from the perceptions held by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and other senior members of the Australian Labor Party that the established ethnic communities in marginal Sydney and Melbourne electorates can make the difference between winning and losing an election. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the perceived power of Lebanese community leaders in Sydney and the Jewish, Greek and Italian community leaders in Melbourne, they have had almost direct access to Mr Hawke and have been instrumental in wresting from the Government fundamental changes to immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the Office of Multicultural Affairs and its head, Mr Peter Shergold, ethnic lobbying has been successful in persuading Mr Hawke to soften migration rules and dump the Immigration Department's secretary, Mr Ron Brown, and deputy secretary, Mr Tony Harris. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brown was replaced by Mr Chris Conybeare from the Prime Minister's department, and Mr Shergold has been mooted as the new deputy secretary. Mr Conybeare has been asked to ensure that the immigration department no longer pushes for the tough options. </PARA>
<PARA> The OMA has enormous power within the bureaucracy. It vets every Cabinet submission and has become a major voice in migration policy formulation. Just weeks away from the announcement of the 1990-91 immigration intake, there is persistent speculation that the push for a lower migrant intake will force a cut to the skilled category. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Immigration is understood to be in disarray after the removal of its two most senior officials. Two key elements of immigration policy-that the people selected are useful to Australia and that the department is in control of the programme-are at the brink of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Department officials feel that the economic rigour that the department tried to introduce to policy following the FitzGerald report's recommendations is being progressively undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also speculation that the next phase of changes to migration rules will restore some elements of ministerial discretion to interfere in immigration cases, removed last year. </PARA>
<PARA> While Mr Hawke has a long association with ethnic leaders and sympathy with multiculturalism, several senior public servants believe he and Mr Hand are hypersensitive to concerns raised by the ethnic communities and have jeopardised the careers of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> The most influential ethnic leaders include Mr Eddie Obeid, of the Lebanese community, Mr Nino Randazzo, editor of the Italian weekly Il Globo, and Mr Walter Lippmann, deputy president of the Jewish Board of Deputies. Mr Lippmann is treasurer of the Victorian Federation of Ethnic Communities Council and an old friend of Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Although former Immigration Department secretary, Mr Ron Brown, was handpicked three years ago by the Prime Minister, it is understood that Mr Brown and former deputy secretary Mr Tony Harris were forced to leave the department at the behest of ethnic leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> The ethnic lobby has apparently succeeded in halting the push for a sharper economic focus to migrant policy advocated in the FitzGerald report. </PARA>
<PARA> It has ensured that the family migration programme remains the keystone of policy and that family reunion applicants no longer receive points for English skills, despite official reports which estimate that English language difficulties cost the economy $3.2 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> It has argued for even higher family migration, more liberal rules and rights of review for illegals, and restoration of grants to the more established ethnic communities rather than to those who have most recently arrived in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The first move of the new Minister for Immigration, Mr Gerry Hand, on taking over the portfolio was to signal a relaxation of immigration rules in response to solid lobbying by ethnic representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations were intended to make administration easier and more transparent and were originally expected to receive ethnic support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. I note the answer to the first question, which relates to why Mr Ron Brown is no longer Secretary to the Department. The words refer to his decision to leave the position in order to make a career change away from the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the face of it, that is all we have learned publicly about that decision. Mr Brown is a very discreet and professional person. He is not a person given to scuttlebutt in the press or to any kind of self-protection by racing to newspapers, even if unfairly treated or pressured by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or other members of this Government. These arrangements for changes to the Public Service were not the responsibility of the present Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). I note that I asked a similar question with regard to Mr Tony Harris, the Deputy Secretary. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the reason for Mr Tony Harris leaving the Department?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is very brief and does not give an answer to my question. In a line and half it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harris decided to accept an offer of appointment to the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an undeniable fact. We all knew that. But I did not ask where he is now employed, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the reason for Mr Tony Harris leaving the Department?</PARA>
<PARA>If there is more than one reason, I make it very clear that I would like to know all of the reasons for Mr Tony Harris leaving the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the intent of my question with regard to Mr Brown. I ask the Minister: in preparing the answers to be given as a result of the Estimates committees-indeed, Senator Button responded on behalf of the Prime Minister today at the end of Question Time and his reply was in exactly the same words that I have now incorporated in Hansard-was any approach made to Mr Brown or to Mr Harris to seek their views so that an answer could be supplied to the Estimates Committee and to this Committee?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that we may not be able to complete the estimates for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs until we find the answer to those questions. Let me explain why. Yesterday when this matter was mentioned in the tabling of the two reports from the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations, Senator McKiernan, who is in the chamber now, referred to remarks made by Senator Jenkins and myself expressing concern about these matters. I wish to read Senator McKiernan's words. They are very instructive and I think they should continue to guide us in the way that Senator McKiernan intended. Senator McKiernan was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations and is an esteemed Deputy Whip for the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take back the word `esteemed'. In yesterday's Hansard at page 910, Senator McKiernan stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . about the resignation of Mr Brown, the Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Mr Brown has put down his own statement as to why he decided to leave the job. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . we should accept what this individual says and not attempt to point score and put words into his mouth as to why he left that occupation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly my own approach to this matter. I therefore want to know, in the words that Mr Brown and Mr Harris used, the advice that they gave to the Government with regard to those decisions. Therefore, I ask the Minister to ascertain not only that there was consultation with these two persons, that they responded to the request for information, and that they used their own words with regard to their leaving the Department; I want the Minister also to table the words that were used by Mr Brown and Mr Harris so that, in the words of Senator McKiernan:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . we should accept what this individual-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, both of them-</PARA>
<PARA>says and not attempt to point score and put words into his mouth as to why he left that occupation. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, I raise one other general argument, and with that I will cease. On 11 April, the day after Mr Brown announced his resignation as Secretary to the Department, there was a great deal of press speculation as to what pressure led the Secretary to be no longer in that position and, along with that, the Deputy Secretary. Perhaps there was pressure on other individuals in the Department as well. I will not accept what members of the press may say, but there has been such a reiteration of similar lines of speculation and assertion in the press, after careful inquiries have been made by them and along lines that are similar to those known on a confidential basis by the Opposition, that there is still a series of questions to be answered by this Government. Let me refer to an article of 11 April and also to an article of 21 May, which I have incorporated in my speech. I quote from the article of 11 April:</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of Mr Brown has caused disquiet amongst senior public servants who are concerned at the way power is being exercised by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and especially the Office of Multicultural Affairs, which falls under the department. </PARA>
<PARA> They regard his resignation as an indication that the economically rational immigration reforms formulated by Mr Brown's department and the previous minister, Senator Robert Ray, have been undermined by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, which will now be able to exert greater power over immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Immigration officials argue that Mr Brown adequately addressed the agenda set by Cabinet and sharpened the economic focus of the department. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the article of last Monday:</PARA>
<PARA> Department officials feel that the economic rigour that the department tried to introduce to policy following the FitzGerald report's recommendations is being progressively undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also speculation that the next phase of changes to migration rules will restore some elements of ministerial discretion to interfere in immigration cases, removed last year. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister has a long association with ethnic leaders and sympathy with multiculturalism, several senior public servants believe he and Mr Hand are hypersensitive to concerns raised by the ethnic communities and have jeopardised the careers of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> The most influential ethnic leaders include Mr Eddie Obeid, of the Lebanese community, Mr Nino Randazzo, editor of the Italian weekly Il Globo, and Mr Walter Lippmann, deputy president of the Jewish Board of Deputies. Mr Lippmann is treasurer of the Victorian Federation of Ethnic Communities Council and an old friend of Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Although former Immigration Department secretary, Mr Ron Brown, was handpicked three years ago by the Prime Minister, it is understood that Mr Brown and former deputy secretary Mr Tony Harris were forced to leave the Department at the behest of ethnic leaders. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be a gross intrusion upon the professionalism of the Public Service and on the contributions made by a good Secretary and a good Deputy Secretary to the Department if they were pushed aside because they had done their job too well. </PARA>
<PARA> There are questions to be answered and I want to see tabled in this Senate, in the words that were used by Mr Harris and Mr Brown, the reasons for their no longer holding those positions. I ask the Minister whether he will be able within hours to gain answers to these questions and report them to an adjourned sitting of this Committee at a later hour this day?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that during the Estimates Committee hearing Senator Hill asked a question of the Trade Practices Commission about the fees paid on a per diem basis to counsel in the Arnotts matter. I know that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) is aware of this matter, but perhaps for people who may suffer from insomnia and occasionally read Hansard I should put it into perspective. There was some reluctance at the Estimates Committee for Senator Hill to be provided with an answer. Originally, he was referred to the Attorney-General's annual report and advised that that report has for some years clearly indicated the fees paid in total to various counsel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was also, quite properly, advised by the Minister that those fees might cover a number of matters in which that particular counsel may have appeared for or on behalf of the Commonwealth or a statutory authority. Consequently, it was not possible, if one knew the length of time that particular matters had run for, to necessarily work out who got paid what for which days. When this matter was pursued there was some reluctance on the part of the Minister and the officers present to indicate exactly how much counsel was paid on a daily rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee moved off that matter with undertakings being given by the Minister to investigate it, but came back to the matter as a consequence of a resolution of the Senate to be found in the Standing Orders. At the end of the Standing Orders there is a list of resolutions and orders of the Senate that have continuing effect, and on page 123 under `Statutory Bodies-Accountability' the third resolution of the Senate is there referred to. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the committee . . . </PARA>
<PARA>recommends . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the principle, espoused by the Senate in 1971 and 1974, that there are no areas of expenditure of public funds where Statutory Authorities have a discretion to withhold details or explanations from Parliament or its Committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise, be re-affirmed;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the affirmation, in accordance with this principle that the right to privacy of individual counsel accepting a brief on behalf of the Commonwealth for which money is appropriated by Parliament is supervened by such acceptance-</PARA>
<PARA>and adds-</PARA>
<PARA> subject to the reasons for the information being clearly defined and to the proviso that injudicious or unwarranted invasion of privacy is not the intention of the Parliament or its Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>What that boils down to is a statement of two things: firstly, that it is reaffirmed by the Senate that there are no areas into which the Senate cannot inquire in relation to expenditure. It is taxpayers' money that is being spent and the taxpayer is entitled to know how it is spent. It goes on in the second part to say that yes, counsel do have some sort of right to privacy, as for that matter, I suppose, any other commercial contractor does, and points out that counsel, by accepting a brief from the Commonwealth knowing that the taxpayer is paying his or her bill, waives that right to privacy. That is really what that second paragraph says. </PARA>
<PARA> It adds that the reasons for the information will be clearly defined and that there will be no injudicious or unwarranted invasion of anybody's privacy. That need not have been added because Estimates committees are not there for the purpose of members carrying on some invasive inquest into the privacy of individuals; they are there for senators to inquire into expenditure allocated by the Commonwealth-for example, whether departments can tell us how many consultants have been used, who those consultants were and how much they have been paid. The reason someone asks that is in order to ascertain whether a department is judiciously expending its wealth in the form of taxpayers' money on consultants. Someone may ask, `How much are you spending on outside counsel?', and that would be a reason for seeking the information. </PARA>
<PARA> This information was provided with some reluctance, and I have some questions on the general matter of providing information in respect of counsel's fees and some specific questions. I deal with the specific questions first. I understand from the answer-and the Minister's answer has been tabled by the Chairman of the Estimates Committee, Senator Colston-that, in the particular matter referred to, counsel was paid a total of $457,723.80 over a reasonably extended period. Is that simply counsel's fees? I ask that because the question was asked originally, `How much is counsel paid per day as a fee?'. Are there additional costs-for example, additional preparation and reading costs-or any other costs on top of a per diem rate for appearing?</PARA>

I agree entirely that the resolution says that the right to privacy of individual counsel accepting a brief on behalf of the Commonwealth for which money is appropriated by Parliament is supervened by such acceptance, subject to the reasons for the information being clearly defined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not argue that Senator Vanstone, in giving her exposition to this point, has clearly defined the reasons for the Committee of the Whole seeking to have the more specific per diem rate in relation to certain counsel made public, but I think that would have been, with due respect to the Committee, a better way to deal with the matter, because I think it would be more in the spirit of the resolution of the Senate for me to then respond to Senator Vanstone giving more particular reasons as to why the right to privacy should be superseded. I agree, of course, that the Senate is entitled to the further material that was sought, but in terms of the resolution itself it is subject to the reasons for the information being clearly defined. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to accept that the reasons have been clearly defined, but I guess it is now a question of whether we incorporate the letter in Hansard to make it clear that my reply is given in response to Senator Vanstone's exposition of reasons why the Committee of the Whole seeks the supervening of the usual right of privacy. I would like to do it that way because I think it is more in accordance with the spirit of the resolution. So I seek to incorporate in Hansard the letter which I have sent to Senator Colston as Chairman of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Justice</PARA>
<PARA>Senator The Hon. Michael Tate</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the recent Senate Estimates hearing for Committee `E' and the matter of a 1980 Senate resolution requiring authorities to disclosure details of expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I have examined the resolution and concluded that the information requested by the Committee should be provided. Accordingly there were three questions asked by Senator Hill which were related to this issue. The questions were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Re Trade Practices Commission (Arnott's merger case):</PARA>
<PARA> (1) What do you pay your senior counsel?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How much did you pay your senior barrister all up for the Arnott's case?</PARA>
<PARA>Re National Crime Authority</PARA>
<PARA> (3) What do you pay junior counsel full-time?</PARA>
<PARA>The answers to the questions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The senior counsel was initially paid $2,000 per day and this increased to $2,200 per day during the course of the case which spanned two financial years. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The senior barrister in the Arnott's case was paid a total of $457,723.80. This was made up of $140,009 in 1988-89 and $317,714.80 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The junior counsel is paid $1,200 per day. </PARA>
<PARA> In providing this information to the Committee I would stress the commercial and confidential nature of the information. Given the resolution's reference to the importance of privacy, I would hope this could be reflected in the practice of my giving you and the members of the Committee information of this commercial-in-confidence type in a non-public way. I ask that the intent of the resolution with respect to privacy be observed unless there is some specific reason for seeking to make the information public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Minister says that the Senate may have to offer reasons why it requests information. I do not have exactly the same interpretation of this resolution as he has. I am not of the view that the Senate is obliged before it asks for some information to give the reasons why it wants it. This seems to be-I am slightly paraphrasing-the Minister's view, that is, that in relation to counsel fees there should be some clear reason for the information being defined. The reason I do not think that this is so important is that I work on the proviso that any senator asking questions at Estimates committees or the Committee of the Whole, as we are now, is doing so for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Commonwealth has spent taxpayers' money properly. That ought to be all that need be said. Nonetheless, I am grateful that the Minister accepts that the question which, as he realised, was not asked by me was asked in that spirit by the honourable senator who did ask the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My interest in the matter came about because of the reluctance to answer. My interest flows from that. I note the letter that the Minister has incorporated. In particular, I note the paragraph on page 2 which says:</PARA>
<PARA>In providing this information to the Committee I would stress the commercial and confidential nature of the information. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand the commercial nature of the information. Quite clearly it is a case of, `You do this job for me, I give you this much money'. It is exactly the same as what a bricklayer says when he does a job for someone. It is exactly the same as what consultants say when they offer to do a job for the Commonwealth. It is a commercial enterprise entered into with the Commonwealth. I am at a loss to understand the confidential nature of that information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If honourable senators look through the Hansard they will find that Senator Vanstone actually agreed that there was a parallel, an analogous case, with those who contract with the Commonwealth. It is a question of competition and tendering between persons seeking to undertake business, in this case the provision of legal advice or counsel services, or whatever it might be. In that situation what the Parliament has hitherto taken to be a sufficient indication of the expenditure by the Commonwealth is the listing in the back of the annual report of many hundreds of solicitors and barristers and the aggregate of the monies that they have received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have indicated that I am prepared to make available, if a senator thinks it necessary, the per diem rate. It is, I suspect, going to create some problems if those who are approached by the Commonwealth, say, the Trade Practices Commission, to appear in a matter, say, in Sydney, know exactly what the daily rate was that was agreed to by another counsel. It will make the task of the Trade Practices Commission in seeking to get the best value for the dollar out of counsel in Sydney that much harder. They will know roughly what the per day rate is. I do not put a lot of emphasis on this because anyone who gets the aggregate sums in the back of the annual report and knows how many days a counsel appeared in court would be able to work it out pretty roughly anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that I have been happy to respond to the request for specific information. I have accepted in a sense that the mere fact that Senator Vanstone indicated that she wanted the information, even in terms of the resolution of 1980, is itself sufficient reason. She did not actually go much further than saying that she thought it was important in order for the principle to be vindicated. What Senator Vanstone has been about-I do not say improperly-is vindicating the principle rather than wanting to know in this particular instance precisely how much was paid in relation to the appearance by senior counsel in the Arnotts case. That principle has been vindicated. I believe that honour is satisfied. </PARA>

I understand the need for confidentiality until a deal is struck. That is the same with the tendering process for bricklaying, or whatever. But once the deal is struck the nature of the confidentiality is lost on me. As I understood the Minister's answer it basically comes down to the fact that if the matter is revealed it is difficult for the Trade Practices Commission to get the best deal because everyone knows what everyone else accepts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have received the answers, or a list, from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to the questions that I had asked. I will put the matter into context. I had a discussion with Mr David Hill on 10 April. On that date I asked him whether I would see him at the Estimates Committee. He said to me, `Yes, Senator, that is right'. Because he was well aware that I wanted to ask him questions, I did not ask the secretary of the Committee to see that he was present. Mr Hill was not present. As a result, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Colston, and the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, both gave permission for me to ask a question of the ABC. We were told that the ABC did not have an appropriation and that that was why Mr Hill was not present. This was although, as I have said, he was aware that I had asked him to be there.

<PARA>The raising of this ABC programming matter in the context of the Senate Estimates Committee Hearing is of some concern, as the questions do not relate in any way to Estimate matters. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that, if the Minister in charge of the Estimates, Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Estimates Committee, Senator Colston and the Estimates Committee as a whole decided that it was proper for me to raise these questions, the Chairman of the ABC, the Managing Director or whoever it was-because these answers are not signed-has no right at all to express concern that these questions were raised. The Minister, Senator Collins, at that Estimates Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>These questions are not strictly relevant to the appropriations. I am anxious to accommodate Senator Walters. </PARA>
<PARA>And he allowed me to put these questions on notice. What right indeed has Mr Hill to say that the ABC expresses concern. I believe it is a direct insult to the Minister who is in charge of the Estimates, to the Chairman of the Estimates Committee and to the Estimates Committee itself. I would like to express my deepest concern that Mr David Hill chose to express his concern that I should be allowed to ask these questions. I asked for the number of complaints there had been to the showing of the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls on Palm Sunday. On 10 April I had asked Mr Hill for that figure, and he knew I was going to ask that question at the Estimates Committee. He has said to me in answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Below is information readily available given the time-frame the ABC has had to respond, and our resources. </PARA>

I think this is a complete disregard for the Estimates system, a complete disregard by Mr Hill of this Parliament. The Estimates asked for the number, and he would be able to give me the number of capital city complaints to the switchboard by a phone call to each of the capital cities. Mr Hill chose not to do that, knowing the questions I had asked on 10 April. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The number of calls to various regional ABC offices are not known. </PARA>
<PARA>He has not told me that he will seek out those numbers. He has merely said that they are not known.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the determination of the question for the adoption of the report of Estimates Committee E be postponed till after the further consideration of the votes in Group D. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the only way to deal with this is to take the precedent set earlier this evening with Senator Teague's matter; that is, the matters relating to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which are contained in the reservation made by Senator Walters to the report of Estimates Committee E, should be deferred until after we have concluded the matters of Estimates Committee C, which is the last one on the agenda, and Senator Teague's subsequent matter with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to the fact that the new procedure introduced after the resolution of 5 December last stated very specifically that, in order to facilitate the debate of Estimates committees, only matters which were the subject of particular reference or particular reservation in the report should be addressed. The fact that the Committee, either by reference of a matter or by the attachment of a reservation, has sought to put the Government on notice that this is a matter requiring attention during the debate of the Committee of the Whole surely imposes upon the Executive the responsibility to ensure that the answers for the particular matter are available. Senator Walters's reservation, which appears in the report, states:</PARA>
<PARA> I recommend the following matters relating to the estimates of expenditure referred to the Committee be further examined by the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the questions which were not answered at the hearing of the Committee on 15 May 1990, but which were taken on notice-</PARA>
<PARA>and these are the operative words-</PARA>
<PARA>with an undertaking by Senator Collins, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, that answers would be provided . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that the answers to the specific matters have not been provided. Saying `We do not know' or `We will get you the information in due course' is not a satisfactory answer. The Parliamentary Secretary knows full well that if the additional estimates which relate to the ABC or this Department are passed tonight, then the chances of getting the Department back for proper answer and proper consideration next week are virtually zero. The ultimate power-in the final analysis, the only power-that this chamber has is not to pass appropriations, not to give the Government its money, if the Senate is not satisfied that certain things have been done. At the end of the day that is the only ultimate power this chamber possesses: the power not to grant the Government the money it says it requires for a particular undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I suggest that in relation to the matter of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which is the subject of the reservation entered by Senator Walters in relation to Estimates Committee E, in the absence of satisfactory answers to those questions we should defer dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation part of Estimates Committee E and, therefore, the final resolution of the motion to approve the expenditures referred to in Estimates Committee E until after we have dealt with Estimates Committee C later tonight, or whenever we get around to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address that matter. We do not have a situation where a question about which a reservation has been made has not been answered. The only outstanding matter from the reservation is the question of the details of capital city switchboard complaints. Everything else that was part of the original question about which the reservation was made has been answered. It is true that more questions have been asked tonight that were not part of the reservation, about which concern is now being expressed. But this was not perceived as a matter that had not been answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A quite comprehensive and detailed answer was given on all the information that was available and, it seems to me, quite promptly. We do not have a situation where a reservation was made and no action has followed. A reservation was made, an answer was provided accordingly, and we are now finding tonight that someone wants to say, `But there is an extra question I wish I had asked and about which I would have made a reservation had I known the answer to the first question and therefore I want to make a retrospective reservation'. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not present, but it appears from the written record in front of me-as far as I can tell it is comprehensive; if someone can point out that something is missing I am happy to listen to it-the only matter about which a detailed answer has not been given is the details of capital city switchboard complaints. That was not specifically in the question, but quite clearly the question states `number of concerns'. So that is properly a part of it. Everything else has been answered in writing, and not tonight but previously-yesterday, as far as I know. The only reason we have concern is that now, as a result of the answers, subsequent questions are being asked to which we are happy to provide answers, but they cannot be provided now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a situation in which the reservation has not been addressed at all. Therefore, while it is proper to protect the Committee's right to have reservations dealt with and to have these new procedures properly adhered to, in this circumstance they have been. It is not appropriate to proceed with the motion-even though it is one in which there are circumstances where I could envisage it would be appropriate. I do not believe these are such circumstances.

I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that when I asked how many similar requests had been made to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), I was told that I could get a part answer to that eventually, at some future time; so it is not answering my question at all. I have been told that the number of calls to various regional ABC stations is not known.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that, if any honourable senator considers that his or her question has not been answered by a statutory authority or a government department, the Committee should go on to the next estimates, so that time can be given for appropriate answers to be provided. I recall what Senator Puplick said in his motion, that at the end of the day the only thing that is available to us is to hold up or vote against Supply. There is another matter that the Committee should consider when the time comes. I can well recall that from time to time Estimates committees have been frustrated by the replies that have been given by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite rightly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer indicates that it is not the Government's intention to dictate to the ABC what its programs ought or ought not to be. That is one thing. The ABC seems to be carried away with the idea that it is a law unto itself, answerable to absolutely no-one. It seems to me quite extraordinary that, if it felt it was answerable to the public, it should not have readily available overnight the answer to the question posed by Senator Walters. </PARA>
<PARA> All that that question seeks to elicit is the number of complaints received in the ABC's offices concerning a particular program. If the ABC is going to be in some way responsive to the people who pay its bread and butter-who pay their money to it-that information should have been available immediately to the Chairman of the ABC and he should then have been able to respond to the question asked by Senator Walters. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I proposed to a broadcasting Bill at one particular stage an amendment that would have established a watchdog over the ABC, an independent authority that would have been able to receive this sort of complaint from the public, rather than the situation as now, where a television viewer or a radio listener who is concerned about a particular program is required to complain-where to? To the ABC. It is appealing from Caesar to Caesar. The ABC sets up a committee to consider these complaints, and that is where they live or die. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is good enough for the commercial television stations to have a system whereby the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, to a certain extent, is the institution with which complaints can be lodged by viewers or listeners, then why not for the ABC?</PARA>
<PARA> I simply take this opportunity of reminding honourable senators that Estimates committees have previously been frustrated by the ABC. I believe this Committee is entitled now to defer consideration of this estimate until such time as it receives the answer to the question raised by Senator Walters, given your ruling, Mr Chairman, that, despite what may or may not have occurred in the Estimates Committee, nonetheless, because of the reservation that has been made, this matter is properly before this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza. The provision of $960,000 relates to accounts which were paid by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) following the transfer of airports on 1 January 1988 for goods and services which overlapped or which were billed for after the formal transfer date. In the first instance, liability for these accounts was disputed by the Department's New South Wales regional office as there were legal problems in establishing the proper liability for the accounts. It would not have been appropriate to have made provision in the principal estimates because there had been no agreement. Liability had not been accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue was eventually referred to the Department's central office for resolution. There were negotiations with the FAC. It looked like it was getting to the point where liability might have been denied totally by the Department, but that would have led to continuing contest. There was sufficient ground to support the FAC's view that the Department should accept responsibility for some of the accounts, and agreement was eventually reached for payment to the FAC of $632,741 to cover those accounts which were the responsibility of the Department. That is how it came about. We could not do it in the estimates at Budget time because at that stage liability had not been accepted. It is accepted now. Agreement has been reached. The appropriate amount has therefore been transferred and the Department has paid. </PARA>

The amount of $960,000 arises from the transfer of $800,000 of salaries funds to administrative expenses. Senator Panizza would appreciate that we normally get that 1.2 rate-that leads to the $960,000 figure-but it was not all required to meet the amount in challenge by the FAC.

I think that is the figure I queried. Once again, could I have an explanation as to why those amounts have been hanging around for six years? I presume that that rental property was on a lease with certain conditions about renewal, what would be done about the new rent and how it would be set, whether by arbitration or by agreement.

<PARA> If the honourable senator wants me to explain the circumstances on this occasion I will do so. As I understand it, it arises each year because of the nature of the relationship between the Telecom broadcasting directorate and the Department. It operates and maintains Commonwealth transmitting stations on behalf of the Department and the size of the program is such that it cannot be finally reconciled until after the close of the financial year, so there is always a little left over. That is why it occurs. It is not a special circumstance, but I think there is some merit in the honourable senator's general point about advising people in what would be, in a private enterprise sense, a note to the accounts. That is a matter I will draw to the attention of the Minister. There may be a reason why it cannot be done, but if it can be done, I will make sure that it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move on to the next matter, which concerns the amount of $1.59m in relation to Australian National Railways' (AN) payroll tax obligations to Tasmania. In the Estimates Committee hearings I asked a question on the variation required to cover Tasrail's payroll tax obligations following legal advice that AN is liable in respect of its Tasrail operation. I was told that there was a legal opinion that the Commonwealth would be liable. I also asked whether that legal opinion had been tested. I would like some further explanation of that, especially as to why it was not tested. Also, how many opinions were sought.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Committee can gather, it is a rather long and complicated story, but the key to it, as I understand it, is that there was a lot of discussion about the legal advice but in the end the matter was resolved when the Tasmanian Government passed legislation in April 1989 which, when taken in conjunction with the earlier Federal legislation making Australian National liable to pay payroll tax, meant quite clearly that there was no longer any doubt about the liability. So there was a subsequent piece of legislation that removed the doubt about the liability, and that leads to a liability flowing through into this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Finally, in relation to the $8m damages and costs arising from the Amann Aviation Pty Ltd matter on page 52 of the explanatory notes, the Full Bench of the Federal Court awarded $8m in damages to the company, but there is a note here that the Federal Government has applied to the High Court for special leave and that there is only a possibility that special leave will be granted.

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Dear</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your personal representation of 21 February 1990, to the New South Wales State Minister for Health concerning the waiting time for surgery at the Repatriation General Hospital (RGH), Concord. Your letter was referred to me for reply as the matter you raised comes within my portfolio responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the surgeon examined the veteran at RGH Concord and recommended his admission for surgery on the right knee. </PARA>
<PARA> He performs one major and one minor surgical case each week at the hospital. He also usually performs one procedure per week at Departmental expense at a private hospital. As at 17 April 1990, he had 85 patients on his waiting list, 30 of whom had the same or a higher priority for admission than him. As a result he could not be guaranteed admission as a patient until November 1990. That is a waiting time of 30 weeks, which is more than the average waiting time for orthopaedic surgery. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the hospital's strategy towards waiting list management, patients on waiting list were invited to transfer to the care of alternative orthopaedic specialists whose waiting times were significantly less. This proved quite successful as one third of his patients have accepted the offer. </PARA>
<PARA> On learning of case, the hospital contacted him and gave him the opportunity to have his condition treated by an orthopaedic specialist other than . . . I understand he has accepted this offer and arrangements were made for him to be reviewed by a Staff Specialist whose waiting time is seven weeks. A tentative admission date of 12 June 1990 has also been set with surgery planned for 14 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that with the recent opening of the new operating theatres, RGH Concord will have ten operating theatres, with one dedicated to orthopaedic surgery for five days each week. It is anticipated that the current average waiting time for orthopaedic surgery of 19 weeks will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to have been of assistance. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Crowley,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the questions asked by the Senate Estimates Committee, about the Official History being completed at the Australian War Memorial, reported in the Canberra Times on Tuesday, 15 May. I would like to correct an apparent error in the Committee's record. </PARA>
<PARA>In October 1989, the Estimates Committee was informed that the diplomatic volume of the history was being completed by Dr P. G. Edwards (photocopy of Hansard record enclosed): the implication was that he was writing that volume alone. In fact, I was co-author of the volume at that time and, indeed, had written the majority of that volume so far written at that date. I have now left the Official History Unit but intend to press my claim to co-authorship. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>(Dr.) Gregory Pemberton</PARA>
<PARA> I received that letter, I think, earlier today and I drew it to the attention of the Secretary of the Committee and asked him to write to Dr Pemberton telling him that we would include that answer in our consideration of the estimates. I believe he contacted Dr Edwards, who is the Official Historian, and I received a letter from Dr Edwards, a copy of which I have just given to Senator Walters as it was she who asked the question. I beg the Minister's pardon that I have not been able to provide him with a copy of that letter. I seek leave to incorporate Dr Edwards' answer in Hansard, as further information for the Estimates Committee record. </PARA>

<PARA>Senate Estimates Committee C</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Crowley</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary of your Committee suggested to me today that I might write to inform you briefly of some of the factors relating to the duration of the Official History, along the lines discussed in the interview reported in the Canberra Times of 16 May. This letter is in addition to the material forwarded by the Memorial in response to the questions raised by Senator Walters in the Committee on 14 May. </PARA>
<PARA> An Official History of Australia's involvements in the post 1945 conflicts was discussed by the Memorial with the Government of the day at various times in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1982 the Fraser Government agreed to the proposal that an Official Historian be appointed for Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. In advertising the position, the task was described as the largest and most prestigious official history since the publication of Australia in the War of 1939-45. The series of books was to include at least 5 volumes, but no upper limit was set. On the recommendation of a selection panel, I was appointed by the Government in October 1982, after consultation with the then Leader of the Opposition. A bi-partisan appointment was essential, both because of the political sensitivity of the task and because access was required to the records of both Labor and Coalition administrations. I was granted complete and unrestricted access to all relevant Government documents. Like previous Australian official war historians, I was assured that the volumes would be published without censorship, subject to certain provisions which do not detract from this basic principle. </PARA>
<PARA> No deadline was set for the task, but the advertisement stated that: `It is not expected that the project could be completed in less than 7 years.' Accordingly I was appointed for an initial term of seven years. (The Government, in consultation with the then Leader of the Opposition, has recently re-appointed me for a further five years.) No deadlines were set for previous official war histories. The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918 (which the Official Historian, C. E. W. Bean, initially thought he might conclude in five years) took from 1919 to 1942 to conclude. The Official Historian for the 1939-45 war was appointed in 1943; the last volume of that history was published in 1977. The Official History for the Korean War took more than a decade to complete. Similar experiences could be quoted for official histories in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> A fundamental problem is that an official historian is the first person to be granted unrestricted access to a Government's records. Thus, at the outset, no-one knows precisely how much relevant material there is, how it is organized, what indexes (if any) exist, or even where the material is located. In this case, for example, there have been occasions when there has been considerable uncertainty about whether a particular collection of documents was held at the Australian Archives or in the originating department. Unlike the Official Historians for the two world wars, I was not appointed during the conflicts but long afterwards. There was therefore no opportunity to supervise the collection and organization of relevant material while the conflict was in progress. (It was suggested that historical officers should accompany the Task Force to Vietnam, but the proposal was rejected because of the strict limits on the size of the Australian contingent there.)</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Government decided that Australia's involvement in the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation (1963-66) should be included in the Official History. I welcomed this decision, as it enables us to deal in a co-ordinated way with Australia's military involvement in Southeast Asia over the third quarter of this century. It does mean, however, that the History is to cover three conflicts over a total period of 27 years, from the outbreak of the Malayan Emergency in 1948 to the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. By comparison, the previous Australian official war histories were concerned with conflicts that lasted four, six and three years respectively. The inclusion of Confrontation has also entailed, of course, substantial revisions to the schema of volumes and the programme of research and writing. </PARA>
<PARA> The sheer volume of material involved in this History is difficult even for professional archivists and historians to comprehend. Reference was made in the Canberra Times article to 9.74 shelf-kilometres of Defence Department records. (A typical substantial file occupies about 3 centimetres when placed vertically on a shelf.) This figure in fact relates only to the more highly classified material of that Department for the period 1950-1970. It does not include a number of other relevant Defence Department collections, such as minutes of the Defence Committee and the Chiefs of Staff Committee. In addition there are all the records of the Cabinet and its Committees, the Prime Minister's Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Labour and National Service and others. Coverage of `the home front' requires extensive use of Hansard, newspapers, the records of various political and other organizations, and private papers. Oral history is a very time-consuming activity if it is to be conducted in a professional manner, but it too has been necessary in certain areas. Because the Malayan Emergency and Confrontation were fought as Commonwealth operations, and because the Vietnam war was fought in association with the United States, there are many records in London and Washington which are necessary to an understanding of Australia's involvement, both political and military, in addition to those held in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement for the position stated that the Official Historian's tasks would include `engaging and supervising the work of a supporting research team' and `appointing writers for individual volumes'. At the time I took up the post in February 1983, no firm decisions had been taken, or guidelines established, on staffing arrangements or budgetary provisions. These were to be handled through the annual appropriations for the Memorial. During the ensuing years the severe constraints on public expenditure meant that attempts to build up the staff required for the Official History took place in a most difficult climate. Like other areas of the Public Service, the Memorial faced many competing demands on its limited resources. Nevertheless it provided funds for four research officers and one administrative support officer. </PARA>
<PARA> To augment these resources, assistance has been sought from other organizations. Two historians at the University College, Australian Defence Force Academy, are writing parts of the History. They receive no remuneration, but the Memorial funds a research assistant for them. Through the co-operation of the Chief of the Air Staff, a historian will next month start work at the Air Power Studies Centre on the RAAF operations in Vietnam. The Memorial Council has made a special grant from its Fund to allow the appointment of three short-term research contractors in the current financial year. By these measures, it has been possible to build up a team of writers and researchers commensurate with the task, but it has taken some time and effort to do so. Moreover, administering a team which is geographically dispersed presents its own demands. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, given all the circumstances, progress has been remarkably good. Five volumes are currently being researched and written. I have set target dates for the completion of the manuscripts of all seven volumes in the History. I enclose a list of the proposed volumes and the completion dates at which we are aiming. It is my intention to have the whole project completed by the mid-1990s, which would compare favourably with the record of most official histories of comparable scale. </PARA>
<PARA> You may be assured that the members of the Official History Unit do not see their positions as sinecures. As professional historians, whose reputations rest on publications, it is in our own interests to publish volumes as quickly as possible. At the same time we are conscious that this is not a private endeavour, but the nation's official history. It must meet the highest standards of fairness, accuracy and comprehensiveness. It is to that end that my colleagues and I are working. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many people are working on the history?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Pearson-It has an ASL of six and assistance is also being given by two historians employed by the Australian Defence Forces Academy. </PARA>
<PARA>I was told that there was a small team of writers and researchers employed to work on the project. I then asked how it was progressing. I was told that it had been going for seven years and that the official historian had just been given another five years, I think it was, but that no volumes had yet reached the publication stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of some media comment, Dr Edwards went public in an article which appeared in the Canberra Times on Wednesday, 16 May. The letter which he sent to Senator Crowley-as Senator Crowley said, I have only just received this and have not been able to read it in full-seems to me to be a recycling of the Canberra Times article, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, since his appointment,-</PARA>
<PARA>it was saying that Dr Edwards had been appointed for seven years-</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edwards had been forced to seek researchers and writers because funds had not been made available, although his clear understanding had been there would be a `team of historians'. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards said he was eventually able to appoint three researchers but it had `proved impossible' to get the resources for the appointment of writers. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask, particularly following the letter from Dr Pemberton: Were the co-authors Dr Pemberton, Ms Jordens, Dr O'Keefe, and Ian McNeill? Did Dr Pemberton write the diplomatic volume of the history or the strategic one? Was Ms Jordens writing about the home front? Was Dr O'Keefe writing about the medical side of it? Was Ian McNeill writing about the combat operations? Were they co-authors? Could I have the duty statements of those officers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of Senator Walters, I shall set out the names and qualifications of those historians who are writing parts of the official history, other than Dr Edwards. Two are permanent officers of the War Memorial. The first is Ian McNeill, who is writing on combat operations in Vietnam. He is a former Army officer who has postgraduate qualifications in history. He is the author of The Team, a history of the Australian Army training team in Vietnam, in which he served. Brendan O'Keefe, who is writing on medical aspects, has degrees in both history and dentistry and a diploma in archives administration. He has several publications in local history and medical history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three are not remunerated by the Memorial and are not included in the Memorial's ASL. The first, Peter Dennis, who is writing on combat operations in Malaya, is professor and head of the department of history at the University College, Australian Defence Force Academy. He has a doctorate in military history and is the author of several works on British and Commonwealth history, including Decision by Default: British Politics and Peacetime Conscription; Troubled Days of Peace: Mountbatten and South East Asia Command 1945-46; and The Territorial Army 1907-40. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is Jeffrey Grey, who is writing on combat operations during confrontation and on Royal Australian Navy operations in Vietnam. He has a PhD in military history and is a lecturer in history at the University College, Australian Defence Force Academy. He is the author of several works on Australian and Commonwealth military history, including The Commonwealth Armies and the Korean War: An Alliance Study; A Military History of Australia; and The Vietnam Years: Australia and the Impact of Vietnam, which is a forthcoming publication. </PARA>
<PARA> The third is Chris Coulthard-Clark, who in June will begin work on Royal Australian Air Force operations in Vietnam. He is the author of several works of military history, including a history of the Royal Military College Duntroon, and two military biographies, Heritage of Spirit on General Bridges, and No Australian Need Apply on General Legge. He has just completed a major study of the RAAF between the two World Wars. He will be located at the RAAF's Air Power Studies Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The two research officers working with the official history unit on permanent appointments funded by the Memorial appropriation list and included in the Memorial's ASL are Dr Chris Walters and Mr Ashley Ekins. Three researchers are working with the unit on short term contracts funded by a special grant from the Memorial Council and are not included in the Memorial's ASL. They are Ms Elizabeth Stewart, Colonel David Chinn, MBE, and Dr Bridget Brooklyn. A research assistant is located at the Australian Defence Force Academy to assist Professor Dennis and Dr Grey. This position is funded by the Memorial but is not included in the Memorial's ASL. At present this position is vacant but arrangements are being made to fill it. </PARA>
<PARA> Duty statements for the permanent officers of the Memorial-Dr Edwards, Mr McNeill, Mr O'Keefe, Dr Walters and Mr Ekins-are available. I will table them. Professor Dennis, Dr Grey, Dr Coulthard-Clark, the research assistant at the Australian Defence Force Academy, and the researchers on short term contracts are not officers of the Memorial and therefore duty statements are not held for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The former non-administrative members of the official history unit, their qualifications and their former tasks are as follows: Dr Gregory Pemberton holds a PhD degree in diplomatic history. He is the author of All The Way: Australia's Road to Vietnam. He was working as co-author with the official historian on a volume which was initially on strategy and diplomacy but subsequently included domestic political aspects to become a volume on politics and diplomacy. He left the unit at the end of 1989. He currently holds a post-doctoral fellowship at the Australian Defence Force Academy. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Ann-Mari Jordens holds two masters degrees and is the author of The Stenhouse Circle. She was working as co-author with the official historian of a volume on homefront aspects of Australian involvement until that area was merged with strategy and diplomacy. Miss Jordens left the unit in early 1989 to take up a position with the Department of the Senate and is now with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned Dr Jeffrey Grey. In relation to Dr Pemberton, I am assured by the official historian that no final decision has yet been taken on the attribution of authorship for the volume, which, I have indicated, changed its objectives during the course of the writing. Appropriate acknowledgment will, of course, be given to all those who contribute to research and writing of the various volumes. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1988 the Memorial Council resolved that the designation of authorship is a matter for the official historian. As I have told Senator Walters, the official historian advises me that he has made no decision as to the attribution of authorship in relation to the volume in question. But, in general, quite apart from authorship, in accord with the canons of proper academic attribution those who contribute to the research will be properly acknowledged in the pages of the volume. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report we made on the family medicine program (FMP) related to a change in policy. There were two issues involved: the first was whether or not the policy should have been changed in relation to those eligible for the higher descriptors under vocational registration. I do not wish to enter into that argument; that is a policy matter. Government can take it up and argue with us at an appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter which emerged was the manner in which this changed policy was made known. It was important to report to the Senate the way in which it came to our notice. A member of my staff drew to my attention a publication from the family medicine program in New South Wales which contained within it a letter signed by Joan Lipscombe, Assistant Secretary, Health Care Strategies Branch of the Department of Community Services and Health, which indicated that a decision had been made that certain people, without the requisite qualifications but in advanced stages of training, should become eligible for the payments under the vocational register. That is a policy decision, so I do not want to question it. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions that we asked in the Estimates were as follows: was this decision made known to the Parliament? The answer we received was no, it had not. Was this decision then made known to the public? The answer we received at that time was no, it had not. So the information we had received, unless it is to be modified now, was that this information, which appeared in a journal of the trainee doctors indicating that they could get some more money for what they are doing, was announced to them and not announced to the Parliament or the public. I will read just one paragraph of the letter that appeared because it really did make the matter clear. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these discussions the Minister for Community Services and Health has acknowledged the concerns of trainees on this matter. Dr Blewett-</PARA>
<PARA>the then Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>is particularly concerned to ensure that there are no barriers to practices accepting FMP trainees. Consequently he has approved in principle new arrangements to allow the use of the new content based descriptors by FMP trainees subject to specific conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>What that means, when the jargon is translated, is that Dr Blewett had agreed that the FMP trainees could attract higher rebates. It was an agreement in principle. It did require further details to be worked out, but the fact remains that this decision, which was available to every FMP trainee in New South Wales who read the journal, had not been made known to the Parliament or to the public. It is of particular concern because this Parliament had taken upon itself the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance to look at the question of vocational registration-a committee which had studied the matter under the chair of Senator Crowley, had reported to the Parliament, and had made some recommendations about vocational registration. </PARA>
<PARA> The point we wish to make is that this was an act of gross discourtesy to the Parliament by the Department of Community Services and Health. We want to understand how and why it happened. Could the Minister explain that to us?</PARA>

He read a letter which suggested that the family medicine program trainees would be able to attract the higher fee.

I could read it but it would take some time. As to the process part of the letter, it is acknowledged that the correct parliamentary process is that this matter be dealt with by way of regulation and subject to the normal surveillance by this chamber pre-eminently, but under parliamentary sanction as is the case with regulations. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>VOCATIONAL REGISTRATION FOR FAMILY MEDICINE PROGRAM TRAINEES</PARA>
<PARA> Given the criticism that the Government should have informed the Senate of its intentions in relation to vocational registration for family medicine program trainees I wish, on behalf of the Minister for Community Services and Health, to inform the Senate of the Government's considerations on provisional vocational registration in certain circumstances for such doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> The family medicine program is an integral part of the vocational registration arrangements. It is the only comprehensive, formal, post graduate vocational training course for general practice. From January 1995 completion of this program will be the main way for doctors to become eligible for the vocational register. </PARA>
<PARA> The program is run by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance on vocational registration of general practitioners recommended that the college examine the content and structure of the FMP with a view to providing options with regard to the length and intensity of the course to accommodate different trainees' requirements while maintaining appropriate standards. Since then the College has reduced the minimum training period from four years post intern year to three years by making the training more intensive. It is still possible for doctors to complete the training over a longer period if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> These three years involve at least one year in hospital on rotations relevant to general practice, one year on formal training placements in a general practice under close supervision and one further year spent in general practice under the supervision of a mentor. Time spent in acquiring other special skills which may be required for remote or rural practice, such as training in anaesthetics, paediatrics, may also be encompassed within the program. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report on vocational registration for general practitioners, the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance recommended that FMP trainees not be eligible for vocational registration, but that the case for provisional registration be considered further by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Department of Community Services and Health as part of the evaluation of vocational registration. FMP trainees have continued to express major concerns that being prevented from using the new content based descriptors limits the effectiveness of the training periods in general practices and creates financial disadvantages for training practices, as well as making trainees less attractive as potential employees during these periods. </PARA>
<PARA>After extensive discussions with the RACGP, which has liaised closely with trainee representatives, the government has acknowledged these difficulties. It considers that it would be appropriate to permit FMP trainees to be placed on the register under specified circumstances. Trainees would be permitted to be registered for the duration of their formal training placements in general practice and in their mentor year, but only where they are under the direct supervision of a vocationally registered GP and where the trainee does not benefit personally financially from the arrangement. In the case of the formal training placements in general practice it would be a condition of the arrangement that the trainee not practice elsewhere. Should these conditions not be met or should the trainee fail to complete the program successfully the trainee would be removed from the register. I understand that this approach has the full support of the RACGP and trainee organisations. I understand also that the AMA does not oppose the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is mindful that these trainees are doctors who have not completed the requirements for appropriate training and experience for vocational registration. The Government therefore will not be proceeding with the proposed changes unless it can be unequivocally assured that the trainees will not benefit financially from the changes and that the trainees are under proper supervision to ensure the highest quality of patient care. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposals are designed to ensure that training practices are not disadvantaged by taking on FMP trainees and that the trainees are properly trained in the use of the content based descriptors during their placements. It is crucial to the success of the scheme that sufficient training placements be made available to accommodate all doctors who wish to undergo vocational training for general practice. While the government has provided sufficient extra funds to finance the extra training placements in general practices, the training places will not be forthcoming if there are substantial barriers discouraging practices from taking trainees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General's Department has been requested to draft appropriate regulations. If regulations can be drafted to ensure adequate safeguards then the Government would wish to proceed with the proposals. In that case the relevant regulations will be tabled in the Parliament in the usual manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the report of Senate Estimates Committee C it will be seen at paragraph 9 that the Committee reports as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 2 March 1990 the Australia Council made a news release in which comments were made concerning the proposal by the Coalition Parties to abolish the Council, and a claim was made by the Council that the Shadow Minister had `misled both the Australian people and his own Party'. The Committee is of the view that statements of party political opinion should not be canvassed in news releases of government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>I should, lest anybody be unaware of the situation, indicate that I was the shadow Minister for arts, heritage and sport at the time that that news release was made. The point which the whole Committee is seeking to make-and I remind the Committee that this is the report of the whole Committee, not just of some members of the Committee or of the Opposition members of the Committee-is that there are proper ways in which governments and oppositions engage in partisan debate about differences of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also limits which should or should not be observed by departments and statutory authorities, essentially by public servants, which go to the question of preserving the integrity of a genuinely neutral or apolitical Public Service. This country, in best Westminster tradition, has been well served for the whole of the period since Federation by a Public Service which has prided itself properly on the question of an apolitical ambience of a neutrality of behaviour on the part of public servants in relation to what are legitimate discussions between the political parties about various aspects of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the point quite clearly that on 17 September 1988 the coalition parties-as I said, I was the shadow Minister responsible for the arts portfolio-released their arts policy in which a reference was made to the Australia Council. The Party policy says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australia Council will be abolished and its functions transferred to the relevant Department responsible for the Arts, thus bringing Commonwealth policy into line with that adopted in each of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The document goes on to deal with the advisory board mechanism which was proposed, with the principles of arm's length funding and peer assessment and with various other directives which may or may not from time to time be given to the Department in the discharge of its responsibilities in accordance with what would have been the policy of an incoming coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> March 1990 was the middle of a very vigorously fought election campaign. The policy document to which reference has been made had been in the public domain for a period of some 15 or 16 months. On 2 March the Australia Council put out a news release in which I, as the shadow Minister, was described in a number of disparaging references. The policy which I was advocating was described as an arbitrary act of cultural vandalism. I was named on a number of occasions in that press release. For example, one part said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australia Council regards with amazement the statement of Senator Chris Puplick, the Coalition spokesman for the arts, that the staff of the Australia Council would be safe in their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>This is despite the fact that I had given a number of assurances that because the staff of the Australia Council were members of the Public Service their security of tenure was to be guaranteed. The statement of 2 March made a number of further disparaging comments. It concluded with the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>The Council is deeply concerned that this misstatement of Senator Puplick's, is merely one of many in which he has misled both the Australian people and his own party. </PARA>
<PARA>I was somewhat offended by that and offended by the press comments, particularly since this comment was made and this press release was issued during the Adelaide Arts Festival which, as Senator Crowley rightly pointed out during the Estimates Committee hearings, is one of the great arts festivals not only of Australia but internationally. I was particularly offended at the comment that I had misled both the Australian people and my own Party and that this was alleged to be one of several occasions in which this had occurred. I indicated my concern about that and the fact that I thought it was actionable, as indeed I believe it was. </PARA>
<PARA> Three days later, on 5 March, the Australia Council put out the news release again, only on this occasion it simply deleted the offending last paragraph which referred to the misleading of the Australian people and my own Liberal Party. So the release was, in fact, put out a second time. The attack upon me was nevertheless continued and I was again named. There were implications that I was threatening the jobs of the employees of the Australia Council and that my assurances of their security of tenure as Commonwealth public servants were worthless. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election campaign I had a number of vigorous run-ins with Government Ministers. Senator Richardson, who is now in the chamber, and I debated at the National Press Club on environment matters. I had two debates with Mr Holding during the election campaign, one at the Victorian Arts Centre and one on radio about arts policy. I take it as the absolutely legitimate and proper way in which political parties operate that the representatives of the political parties debate each other on questions of alternative policies. What I do not accept as legitimate is that Commonwealth statutory authorities should engage themselves, any more than public service departments should engage themselves, in the partisan debate during an election campaign. It would have been quite interesting if this debate had taken place immediately in September 1988 because that was when the original statement was made. But the Australia Council decided that it would wait until the heat of the election campaign to buy back into the particular argument. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if this was simply some whimsy on the part of the Chairman of the Australia Council, Professor Horne. If we look at the record of the hearing of Estimates Committee C on Thursday, 17 May 1990, we see that Mr Max Bourke, General Manager of the Council, was before the Committee and I asked him a series of questions, one of which was:</PARA>
<PARA>Do the news releases represent the official view of the Australia Council on particular matters that are contained within those releases-the Council's official view?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bourke replied, `Yes.' I then went on to ask him whether the description of me as a cultural vandal and a person who had misled both the Australian people and my own Party was an official view of a statutory body. Mr Bourke replied:</PARA>
<PARA>It was a view expressed by the Council, yes, that is right. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bourke was unable to provide details at that time of the distribution or cost of this news release. I note that despite his assurances that the material would be provided it still has not been provided to this date. I still do not have provided to me, as was undertaken by Mr Bourke, the details of the distribution or the cost to the Australian taxpayer of the Australia Council's participation in this particular election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> When I asked Mr Bourke in what way he believed I had misled people, Mr Bourke's reply was:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe I can do that,-</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say, give me the information-</PARA>
<PARA>as chief executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he said, `Well, I'm not part of the Australia Council; I am only its servant; therefore I am unable to tell you that'. I asked Mr Bourke subsequently:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . can you recall previous releases by the Australia Council which have, over any number of years, sought to personalise attacks upon shadow Ministers or upon members of parliament, in relation to what is clearly a live matter, in the course of an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bourke replied, `I cannot'. He qualified that by saying that he had not been at the Australia Council for all of that period, but he could not recall any such previous releases. I then asked him whether the Australia Council had made comments about the two political parties' policy speeches which were issued by Mr Peacock and Mr Hawke during the election campaign. Mr Bourke indicated that the Council had made no evaluation of the respective policy statements of the two parties. I asked whether, in fact, discussions between the Ministers of the Government and the--</PARA>

I am perfectly happy to do that. However, for the sake of expedition I will resist the temptation unless Senator Crowley interrupts me again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I went on to ask Mr Bourke whether in fact discussions between the Ministers and the Australia Council, particularly where there might have been any disagreement between them on policy questions, had ever led to official Australia Council press releases on policy questions. Mr Bourke confirmed that they had not. Whereas discussions which I had had as shadow Minister with the Australia Council had in fact led to the issuing of formal press releases by the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of the merits of the particular argument-you, rightly, Mr Chairman, prevent me from canvassing the merits of the particular argument-what the Estimates Committee has done, with the unanimous consent of the three Labor members and the three coalition members of the Estimates Committee, is draw attention to the fact that the Estimates Committee does not believe that it is appropriate that statutory bodies should put out statements which are of a party political nature in their official press releases. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make the point that the adoption of the Committee's report implies quite clearly to statutory authorities and agencies that this is the view taken by a Senate Estimates committee and may in fact be the view taken by this chamber: that it is not a legitimate role, if we are to preserve the apolitical integrity of the Public Service and its statutory authorities, for authorities to engage in behaviour which is seen as partisan political, particularly bearing in mind that this occurred during an election campaign and that the policy which was being discussed was not a policy that had suddenly emerged during the course of the campaign and, therefore, had not been in the public domain, had not been subject to debate between the Australia Council and me, or between the Australia Council and other commentators in the public domain but was in fact a policy which was 15 or 18 months old. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the underpinnings of the parliamentary system that we have is the belief, held by members of the Opposition, that when they get into government, the public servants with whom they will be working, as Ministers, will serve them with the same degree of commitment, fairness and neutrality as they served their previous political masters. If that is broken down by the partisan intervention, particularly during an election campaign, of those senior public servants and statutory authorities, the loser will not be the politicians who are involved one way or the other in the dispute and the debate; the loser will be the integrity of the Australian political and Public Service system. That, in fact, is far more important than the egos or the feelings of any politicians who are involved and it is something worth fighting for to preserve. I think the Estimates Committee and the Senate, in noting this in its resolution, in fact will make a contribution to that important preservation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well done, Senator Puplick. I think his explanation is a good argument; it is one he led with in the meeting of Estimates Committee C and it is the one that I disputed with him there. I think it is fair, at least in my opinion, to put on the record some of the points that I raised then. First, I would like to make it absolutely clear that I have no dispute at all with Senator Puplick in respect of the way he was referred to in the press release. We all agreed that that was unacceptable and we made that quite clear. But I think Senator Puplick has strayed in suggesting that the press release contained partisan political material. He has gone from what I think was a very reasonable complaint about the way he was treated to stretching the sentiments of the Committee, or at least its Labor members, in his discursive explanation of why a statutory authority should never make party political comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time of formulating our report, the Committee did make qualifications which may not be understood. For the record, it is important to note that the Committee did not think public servants and heads of departments were to be equated with officers of statutory authorities. There is an independence and a distance from government pertaining to statutory authorities that is not true of public servants and, particularly, heads of departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable for a statutory authority to make a comment about matters political. It may be that there is a fine line between what is party political and what is partisan political. But I would have thought that if a political party had a policy which said that it would wipe out a particular statutory authority if it got into government, it would not be unreasonable for such a statutory authority to say that it had strong views counter, or contrary, to that political view. </PARA>
<PARA> When does one raise this matter? One can raise it at the time of first discovering this policy, but in particular one can raise it at a time when it is of particular relevance, that is, when people may want to decide, amongst other things, whether or not they want to see a continuation of, in this case, the statutory authority, being the Arts Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I take some issue with Senator Puplick's comments-certainly not his points raised about references to a particular individual as occurred in the press release to him. That was very much agreed. But I just put on record some slightly different understanding of the sentiment conveyed in that report from Estimates Committee C. It is open to understanding and I think the way Senator Puplick has described it is certainly not entirely how I would want it seen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Puplick's feelings on the matter although I think a number of points that he made need some correction. The first point to make is that the Australia Council, which is, I think, made up of 14 members, has among its membership only two public servants. The rest of the Australia Council includes, of course, people of some prominence in the arts in Australia. They are not public servants, and in many cases never have been and never will be. Rather, they share the passions of those who work in the arts community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Passions were certainly aroused by the policies which Senator Puplick espoused during the last couple of years. Obviously when one proposes to abolish the Australia Council, to abolish therefore the role of peer assessment in the arts in Australia, particularly when those who are doing the assessing are among the most eminent people in the arts world in Australia, one is bound to draw some return fire. In this case the Australia Council chose to fire a broadside, which I must concede is most unusual, but then again it is not exactly unexpected, given the circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA> In terms of the distribution of the costs, I am disappointed that that information has not been made available to Senator Puplick. I have checked tonight with the advisers to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and I am informed that Mr Bourke is in New Zealand. That is obviously responsible, at least in part, for why we have not got the information tonight. I have nevertheless suggested that this is not satisfactory. It is my earnest wish and, I think I can say, fond hope that tomorrow morning we will have an answer for Senator Puplick on the distribution and the costs. Even if Mr Bourke is away I think it is more than reasonable that somebody is at home at the Australia Council who can give us an appropriate explanation. At least on that score I am sure we can satisfy the honourable senator on the morrow. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the more substantive point as to what we are going to do with the Australia Council, and an explanation overall, I would have to say that our policy was never for its abolition, so it may be that in the future we would get a similar sort of serve if we were to propose its abolition. I think that would be certain. We were not silly enough to do so and did not have to accept the consequences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight on the adjournment debate about the forthcoming elections in Myanmar which are to occur on Sunday, 27 May. Recently in the Senate some questions have been asked by senators regarding these proposed elections. I know that Senator Jenkins from Western Australia has asked a couple of questions over the last year or so and has also put forward notices of motion indicating her interest in the affairs of Myanmar. I noticed today that Senator Newman asked a question and tried to draw some parallels, on the ground of inconsistency, between this Government's policy towards South Africa and its policy towards Myanmar. That was a quite erroneous and irrelevant comparison and I think it shows that Senator Newman, in drawing that comparison, does not understand much about either country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have spoken before in the Senate about my interest in Myanmar, which has been generated as a result of my visit to that country in February last year. Since then I have maintained an interest in the affairs of that country and have maintained regular contact with people from the Myanmar community in Australia, as well as overseas. I have had correspondence with Congressman Solarz and Senator Moynihan from the United States of America, who are both interested in the affairs of Myanmar, and also with groups of people around the world who, in many cases, are expatriates who have left that country during the long regime of General Ne Win. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed elections to be held on Sunday have been, in my view, rightly criticised on a number of aspects concerning the conduct of the election campaign. It is quite clear that by any definition that we would use in Australia, these are not free and fair elections because most of the major Opposition politicians-particularly Aung San Suu Kyi, U Tin U and others-have been arrested, detained or held under house arrest and have not been able to participate in the election, either by campaigning or by being able to stand in the elections on Sunday. There have been restrictions on campaign techniques, advertising, on the way in which rallies have been able to be held, and so on. So, as I say, I agree with the criticism that, by any normal examination, this is not a normal, free and fair election as we in a Western democracy would believe. </PARA>
<PARA> But I also want to put information before the Senate which indicates that there is some evidence that the actual voting on Sunday-if it is carried through by the regime-technically will have some validity. I wish to present the information that I have received from a number of contacts both here in Australia and overseas concerning the arrangements that the authorities in Myanmar have put together through their electoral commission for holding this election. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing is that it appears that the people running the polling booths and administering the election at the local level will not be party members associated with the present regime but will be administrators and, in many cases, community elders who are recognised and respected in their local community. It is estimated that 20.7 million registered voters will be eligible to vote, but voting is not compulsory. The present regime says that there will be 18,190 polling booths, one for approximately each 5,000 voters. About 80 per cent of wards and villages will have only one polling booth. In a polling booth of 5,000 voters will be one polling booth officer, five persons to check the electoral rolls, five persons to issue ballot papers, five persons to look after the ballot box, and 10 voting cubicles or rooms. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure the security of a ballot paper, the emblem of the Election Commission will be printed on the back and each paper will have a security thread. In addition, the polling booth officer is required to sign each ballot paper as it is issued. The names of candidates, emblems of the parties they represent and voting squares opposite each name will be printed on the front of the paper. Voters are identified in the electoral roll by serial number. Voters are also required to prove their identity by producing to the polling booth official their identification cards. </PARA>
<PARA> Voters will mark their ballots with a cross in the box of their preferred candidate in the privacy of a voting cubicle using a rubber stamp provided. Ballot papers will be declared invalid if there is a cross marked on the ballot paper in a place other than in the box opposite the name of the candidate, is misaligned between the boxes, is on the name of the candidate, is on the candidate's electoral symbol, or if the cross marked is stamped repeatedly. Moreover, if ballot papers are stained, marked in other than the approved manner, or torn, they will be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> The completed ballot will be placed in a single ballot box located in public viewing in the polling booth. Representatives of the candidates will be present at polling booths as well as the polling officials. The booths will be closed at 4 p.m. and if there are persons queueing outside the polling booths waiting to vote, they will be allowed to do so even after 4 p.m. The votes will be counted at the individual polling booths in the presence of members of the polling booth team, the candidates, or their designated representatives, and the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> Invalid ballot papers will be so declared by the polling booth officer stating the reasons for so doing. The polling booth officer, members of the polling booth team and other witnesses will be required to sign on the back of the rejected ballot. The composite result of each booth is to be entered on a form which is to be signed by those persons listed. The form and ballots for each candidate will then be conveyed to the relevant township sub-commission. The Central Election Commission, after scrutinising the relevant forms and signatures for the constituency as a whole, will declare the winning candidate. The names of the successful candidates will be broadcast daily on radio and television, starting on the election night, the 27th. No-one will be allowed to canvass votes within 100 yards of the polling booth. </PARA>
<PARA> Information that has just come to my attention in the last 24 hours says that army commanders have indicated in briefings to their officers and troops that the responsibility for the security of polling booths rests with the Electoral Commission, but in the event of disturbances at a booth, troops will not intervene unless requested to do so by the Commission, and where such a request is made, will do so only after a statement is signed indicating that the intervention is taking place at the request of the Commission. It is understood that troops have been instructed to stay well away from polling booths in order to avoid accusations that they may be intimidating voters or electoral officials or otherwise interfering with the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA> One area of concern is that if a determination of a valid vote is the use of the rubber stamp, it is suggested that if the ink is not dry when people fold their ballot paper and put in the ballot box, the smudging may lead to a stain which may lead to invalidity of the vote. There has also been some concern expressed about whether 5,000 voters could be processed through one booth in a 10-hour period. As the voting is not compulsory, no-one expects there to be a 100 per cent turnout and, as suggested previously in my remarks, the booths will stay open past 4 p.m. if a queue is formed. </PARA>
<PARA> With the information that has come to my attention from a number of sources in the last few days, if those procedures are carried out by the regime, as far as the actual voting is concerned on the day, one could see that the election will be reasonably fair as far as the technicalities are concerned. It also means that we have on record enough information to indicate that if these procedures are not carried out the election will certainly not have been free and fair. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that the major opposition party-the National League for Democracy (NLD)-is contesting around 440 of the 485 seats, which means that, as the major opposition party, it does have a chance of winning the election if it gets the support and the voting is free and fair on the day. In a late press report tonight I noticed that some diplomats in Myanmar are now saying that, despite Aung San Suu Kyi being detained and not being able to participate in the election, the NLD, as the leading opposition party, may have some chance of winning the election. Personally, I would applaud very much if the NLD could win the election as the main opposition party. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence that the election campaign is very low key and very calm because of the limitations placed by the regime on normal election activity. Public rallies, with up to 2,000 or 3,000 people attending in some cities and villages, have been held. Over the last few days limited television coverage has been provided to the various candidates, including opposition candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> My final observation of the election is that up until yesterday it was apparent that the regime would not allow outside observers into Myanmar to observe the election. For example, Congressman Solarz from the United States of America, who had requested a visa to visit Myanmar and observe the election, has been rejected. But late this afternoon the regime announced that it would allow 60 journalists to visit Myanmar over the weekend and observe the election. These journalists are based mainly in Bangkok and have been covering Myanmar affairs over the last couple of years. That is a very welcome development. I would be surprised if those 60 journalists were not able to make some relevant comments about the conduct of the election. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is substantial support for the Opposition in the election of the national assembly, the real test will be what will happen with the transition of power from the present army regime to the national assembly. The final test of democracy being partially restored in any sense in Myanmar will be whether the army accepts the result of the election and arranges for the transition of power to a civilian government; whether it accepts the result of the people if the voting in the election has been properly and fairly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 18 months a number of honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives have shown interest in affairs in Myanmar. I hope that the Australian Parliament will watch closely the events in Myanmar next week and subsequent weeks after the election and be willing to make public comment and express views about what may occur, particularly if the present military regime is not willing to hand over power or arrange for the transition of power to a democratically elected civilian government if the election is properly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly wish the people of Burma, now called Myanmar, all the best for Sunday. I hope they get the chance to vote properly and fairly and to elect the government of their choice. I urge the military regime to respect the result so that in the years to come Myanmar can once again develop a proper democracy and economic policies that restore prosperity and a decent standard of living to the people of that country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Administrative Services, is in the chamber this evening because I have a story which has taken on the proportions of the Epic of Gilgamesh or The Forsyte Saga. I have no doubt that he knows about it, but I want to reiterate it to the Senate and put it on the public record. I was delighted, in fact thrilled, that on 9 April this year Mrs Fran Bailey was formally declared the elected member for McEwen. She came into this Parliament to join me as the first female Federal member of parliament from Victoria to represent the Liberal Party of Australia in the lower House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern I raise this evening is that Mrs Bailey still does not have an office. When Mrs Bailey was declared elected, the Department of Administrative Services in Melbourne identified suitable premises in Epping at her request and negotiated with the landlord. The size of these premises is below the entitlement area for a Federal member of parliament's offices. Because of this, Fran Bailey originally put forward a submission applying for temporary accommodation, but was always mindful that, as there was a dearth of suitable office accommodation in Epping, this accommodation may have to be permanent. She waited and waited for a response from the Minister on her submission. When told that the Minister had refused her submission for these premises to be temporary, she was also informed by the Minister's Department that she had to use an electoral office that already existed in Seymour as a temporary office.</PARA>
<PARA> She was left with no other resort but to bring her plight before her constituents through the use of the media, which she did on 3 May. Once pressed by the media, the Minister then declared that he had given approval for Mrs Bailey to proceed with an office in Craigieburn. During the campaign Fran and I looked at the offices in Craigieburn-in fact, Fran and I had talked about these as a possible location because I was pretty convinced that she would win the seat. Unfortunately, the Minister had not kept up with the current information being provided to him. The premises which Mrs Bailey had suggested originally and which the Minister had approved were already occupied by a video shop and were no longer available. </PARA>
<PARA> After consulting with her staff, Mrs Bailey accepted that the 103 square metres of office space-which is below a Federal member's entitlement-in Epping would be appropriate as a permanent office given the fact that there was very little office space in the southern area of her electorate. It should be noted that the temporary office in Seymour which the Minister was urging Mrs Bailey to occupy was approximately 75 square metres and, in the opinion of the officers of the Department of Administrative Services, totally unsuitable. I have been led to believe that this office was never the sole electorate office of the former member for the electorate, who worked mainly out of the office of Senator Gareth Evans in Greensborough. That office is no longer within the boundary of the McEwen electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Since applying for 738a High Street, Epping as permanent office space on 4 May, Mrs Bailey has been fobbed off with answers such as that the Minister will approve `shortly', `soon' or whenever. I think that the time that has elapsed between 4 and 24 May comes well between the bonds of the definition of `shortly'. </PARA>
<PARA> The only concern the Minister's office has expressed relates to a technical report on the building. Officers of the Department in Melbourne-and Mrs Bailey has found these people to be nothing but helpful to her-arranged for a technical inspection to be carried out and a short verbal report was given. The report suggested that heavier duty glass be used in the panel on the front door and that it may also be appropriate for insulation to be put into the ceiling to make it more comfortable during summer. These could hardly be excuses for the Minister to continue to delay giving approval. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at this matter and consider the plight of the landlord, who has been waiting patiently for a decision since 9 April, we can see that the Minister, in continuing to delay this decision, is preventing Mrs Bailey from effectively carrying out her duty as an elected member of parliament in representing and looking after the needs of her constituents in McEwen. </PARA>
<PARA> What do the constituents do now? They either track her down at home or they track down her staff, some of whom were operating out of her home until they got temporary accommodation at 400 Flinders Street. The conditions there are not appropriate either. One staff member is using a coffee table as a desk. The only progress that seems to have been made so far is that Mrs Bailey has shifted her card table from outside the temporary premises-and her telephone, typewriter and other equipment from out of her boot-and from the streets of Epping. The card table has moved and has now become a coffee table in Flinders Street. I ask the Minister: When will Mrs Bailey know? What reasons can he give for the fact that there has been an undue delay in the approval? I believe that every effort should be made to ensure that the people of McEwen have their representative located in their electorate and not at 400 Flinders Street. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the Senate for speaking at this very late hour-I do not make a habit of doing it. I promised last Thursday-also in the adjournment-that I would take out some facts surrounding a statement made by Senator Crichton-Browne about the delay in the swearing-in of Senator Campbell to this place last week. I remind the Senate that last week Senator Crichton-Browne accused the Western Australian State Government of being incompetent and inept over the delay surrounding the swearing-in of Senator Campbell. He implied that the Government had had from 30 April until 16 May to go through the formalities surrounding the selection of Senator Campbell and his final swearing-in in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicated in my speech, following Senator Crichton-Browne's speech, that I would check out the record and that some time this week I would seek to put it straight. I now intend to do so. On 20 March this year, the Premier of Western Australia wrote to the Liberal Party asking it to nominate a replacement for now Mr Fred Chaney. The Leader of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Mr MacKinnon, replied on 3 May-not 30 April as Senator Crichton-Browne suggested-nominating Mr Ian Campbell as that replacement. On that same day, the Governor of Western Australia, Sir Francis Burt, sent a message to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in Perth and the President of the Legislative Council notifying them formally of the vacancy caused by Mr Chaney's resignation. Between that date and the actual joint sitting of the two Houses of the Western Australian Parliament, which took place on 16 May, there were four sitting days of the Western Australian Parliament-not three weeks as was implied by Senator Crichton-Browne. There were four sitting days and no more. That joint sitting did duly take place. </PARA>
<PARA> One further element that caused some delay in bringing about the swearing-in and bringing the Western Australian representation in this place up to its proper level was the fact that Senator Campbell himself had to be contacted to ensure that no tricks were being pulled on him and that he was willing to accept the nomination of his Party. After going through a tortuous preselection exercise, I doubt that there was any doubt about that, but the formalities had to be followed. Also, Senator Campbell was in Canberra for some of that period and did take some tracking down. </PARA>
<PARA> All the way through this scenario the Western Australian Government acted properly and in accordance with all of the conventions that apply in the filling of a casual vacancy. At no time did it stoop to some of the tricks that have been pulled by other conservative governments around Australia in the replacement of new senators. Perhaps the most famous of those happened in the first half of the 1970s when the then Premier of Queensland, Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, replaced the late Senator Milner with Mr Albert Field. At no time did the Western Australian Labor Government consider doing such a thing. At no time in the history of casual vacancies in this place has any State Labor government ever pulled some of the stunts that were pulled by the Bjelke-Petersen Government in Queensland in the 1970s or the Liberal-Country Party Government in Tasmania when it replaced Mr Arnell-</PARA>

Of course, in most recent times, there was the delay the then Liberal Government in Tasmania brought about following the selection of Senator John Devereux to this place. It was not a question of a delay of two or three days as Senator Crichton-Browne stated. It went on for some months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about the Tasmanian situation tonight. I am a Tasmanian, as is generally accepted, by birth, by choice and by conviction. Tasmania is certainly God's own country. It is beautiful. It has been generously endowed by nature and it is a wonderful place to live. I find it absolutely appalling right now that this wonderful State is having such a terrible battering when it should be going ahead in leaps and bounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we approach the conclusion of the first 12 months of this disreputable Australian Labor Party-Green accord Government in Tasmania it is fitting that we look over the period and assess the results. The Premier's Party, after its ignominious 34 per cent election result-incidentally, the lowest vote ever by the Australian Labor Party in any State election held in Tasmania-has done nothing to reflect other than that the vote was overgenerous. </PARA>
<PARA> The dismal decade, as it was known, from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, with such notables as Nielson, Holgate, Lowe and Batt-it followed the great period of the Party under the Reece-Fagan regime-has returned with a vengeance. Tasmania is now in the worst condition it has ever experienced. Tasmania in the past, the present and the future has depended and will depend for its existence and prosperity predominantly on its traditional pursuits and natural benefits-primary industry, mining, forestry products, fishing and tourism. Any unthought-through or unplanned change to the relativity of these will be disastrous as anyone with any real consideration and appreciation will know. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, there is no progress, no plan, no imagination, no vision and no hope, and it is almost 12 months since the arrangement came into being. The early efforts to panic industry, commerce and ordinary individuals over the state of Tasmanian finances has produced volumes of dubious figures to support dubious claims. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now, of course, a matter of record that there was more than $300m-or 20 per cent-less debt in 1989 than when the Gray Government took over at the end of the dismal decade in 1982. During the same period Tasmania's debt to gross product fell by 2.3 per cent, and that is more than in any other State over that period. All this while, Canberra cut Tasmania's funding by $505m in real terms. Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table produced by the Tasmanian Treasury to support that figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is in real terms $505m less than it received in 1984-85, while the same Canberra government engineered policies that produced the astronomical interest rates which we know so well as the cornerstone of its financial policies and which imposed a vast extra cost on the established and necessary capital borrowings of the State. I have to ask, therefore: Is the Field Government poor? If it is, then let it start by selling off the first $200m in government-owned assets that could be sold and that have already been identified and listed. But, no; it will not do that. Again, if it is poor, how about curbing the extravagances with its ministerial staff and the facilities they have lavished on themselves and their new-found friends? It should look at the new glorified superannuation and termination arrangements for its new staff members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In June 1989 the entire Liberal Government had a staff of 62 receiving $2.1m per annum in salaries. In March 1990, just nine months later, the Greens and the Australian Labor Party had 82 staff and a wages bill which was up 50 per cent, to over $3m per annum. The new head of the Premier's Department also receives a greatly increased salary package, including a fully maintained car, which alone is costing $8,800 a year, plus full running costs, superannuation, severance and all sorts of other things. Senior private secretaries' salaries have gone up 41 per cent, from $42,363 to $59,733. How is that for restraint? Does this smack of poverty? Twenty per cent of the ministerial staff are now paid more than the Speaker, who receives $59,141, when under the Liberals there were only two. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of services and facilities turned on for the razzle-dazzle of the five Independents to keep them in the standard to which they would like to become accustomed is ridiculous and amounts to far more than the services available to the entire majority Party. So, one would surely say that it cannot all be bad. </PARA>
<PARA> So what progress has come to Tasmania under the great new Government? After nearly 12 months, industry and business are yet to find out the philosophy or intentions of the Field Government, if they exist. The Government is yet to look at the simple issues. It has been talking of shop trading hours, price control, equal opportunity in the public sector and so on. At the time of the election there was much talk about the 35 major election promises. Where are they? What has happened to the ban on cigarette advertising, the HIV-AIDS package, the battery hens debate, the gun laws, freedom of information and so on? Who in all honesty would expect anyone to invest in Tasmania while we have no idea of where we are going, no certainty in the crazy accord and no clear direction? Is it any wonder that the Institute of Public Affairs has projected a 30 per cent fall in investment this financial year and a further 27 per cent fall in 1991. I noticed that Terry McCrann was making comments to this effect in the Melbourne Herald under the heading of `Tassie heads for the red under greens'. We all understand exactly what he means. </PARA>
<PARA> So which way is Tasmania going? It can be going only one way, and that is clear to everybody. Then there are the other things that have been stopped including the Huon Forest Products development, the International Antarctic Centre and cutbacks in various roads-primarily the Smithton-Zeehan corridor-and other public works. But what has been started? And what of the future? Nothing. When is something productive or constructive going to be implemented or even discussed? What about our children and their futures? What are we educating our children to do? Is it just basket weaving, wood carving, making beds and washing dishes? If that is the intention, it just will not do.</PARA>
<PARA> During the first year of this Government, businesses suffered most sorely. The list goes on and on of those which have closed their doors or gone into receivership. I mention just a few: Oystas Pty Ltd, ANI fabrication plant, Waverley Woollen Mills, Norsewear Industries Ltd, Launceston International Hotel, Hadleys Orient Hotel, Gray Holdings Pty Ltd, the owner of nine hotels, Argyle Developments, John de Jong, builders, Capitol Constructions, Loones Agricultural, South Cape Ltd, ISAS (Tasmania) Pty Ltd, and Grays Sawmills Pty Ltd. Nobody in Tasmania really knows who is running the State. Both the Independents and the 34 per cent Australian Labor Party will, we presume, continue to cling desperately to power for as long as they can, and we may as well expect all sorts of crazy and unprincipled deals to be produced with just that end in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Of late, members of the parliamentary wing and/or their associates in the Wilderness Society have produced a wonderful range of well researched methods to really close down Tasmania forever. Everybody knows the basis of the various wood product developments that have been terminated, as they do the rapacious and never ending advances for the listing of whatever is left unclassified, irrespective of people's lives, jobs and futures. And remember: already 21 per cent of Tasmania is under heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has produced a schedule involving, in all seriousness, pulling down huts and shelters in national parks; tearing up all maps with a scale of 1:25,000 because there is too much detail on them; draining and demolishing hydro dams; preventing horseriding on the plateau and boating on many waterways; banning any new fish farms; no new roads and the closure of some we have. Why, for goodness sake? Surely all these things are for people to enjoy in their various ways. Surely we do not all have to dress alike and do the same things in the same places. In a well-balanced society people have different ways of getting their relaxation and enjoyment, and we all want to use Tasmania in our own way. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, all that was only the beginning and was before we were urged to remove all introduced flora and fauna, starting with honey bees, rainbow and brown trout and, I presume, blackbirds, goldfinches, rabbits, most vegetables, flowers, shrubs, trees and so on. If the European wasps were taken away, I would be satisfied. This is genuine; this is what they want. It is not some crazy Monty Python episode but what has been seriously proposed by some power-crazed group of very difficult unTasmanian extremists with no thought of the hundreds of thousands of Tasmanians who see it as where they want to live, work, recreate and pass on to their children for exactly the same or different purposes, but mainly simply to enjoy into posterity. That is all they seek. I for one get terribly tired of those zealots who drop in, declare that they have discovered Tasmania, and then tell us what they think we ought to be doing. But there is more: the latest. As the State slows down and becomes more and more disillusioned, we now have the parliamentary wing recommending a solution to all the woes and problems by, firstly, doubling the electricity rates for all Tasmania's major employing and productive industries; secondly, doubling all mineral royalties; and, thirdly, forcing the Forestry Commission to make greater dividend payments and so on, irrespective of the work it is doing. The fact that such nonsense would close many of them immediately and certainly prevent any others from starting is of no consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier must decide and declare whether or not this is being said by people who are part of this great accord. He must tell us where he stands long term. Between them they are a laughing stock for their total irresponsibility. All this is based on some crazy, mixed up philosophical grounds with no thought of economic capacity or of the effects on investment, present or future, employment, or anything practical or balanced in any way. We know that there are Green representatives who have no concern for posterity, but most Tasmanians do, and they want increased living and work opportunities in Tasmania for their children and grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA> So people say that, if it all sounds so bad, what effects has it had? It just so happens that I can give the Senate one example to think about. Research that I have obtained from the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Hotels Association shows that in 1987-88 seven hotels and accommodation places in Tasmania were listed for sale. In 1988-89, there were 12 for the year. But in the first nine months of the first year of this Green-Australian Labor Party accord, the figure had reached 48. That is what the people who have invested in Tasmania think of the future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania is not a museum; it is home to those of us whose families have been there for generation after generation, and who hope our families go on for many more. We seek stable, predictable, balanced and sustainable development to benefit everyone. Not just the few, not just the extremists, not just the developers or the non-developers, but everybody. We cannot afford to let things go on like they currently are. </PARA>
<PARA> Would these vandals sell all or part of our famous and invaluable agricultural research farms? Would they seriously prejudice our mining industries that currently employ directly or indirectly over 20,000 Tasmanians, pay $600m a year in wages and produce $714m a year in sales? Do they relish the grave likelihood of being responsible for getting unemployment in Tasmania up to the 10.3 per cent, or 22,000, that has been predicted by the Savings Bank of Tasmania? Are they happy with the business closures and the building decline? I simply ask: What of the future of Tasmania under this Green-Field liaison? I seek leave to incorporate a table showing the number of hotels on the market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree fully with the way Senator Archer spoke glowingly about Tasmania. It is a great State. I want to go very quickly to Senator Patterson's point about Mrs Fran Bailey, the new member for McEwen. Senator Patterson raised the case of Mrs Bailey's electoral office and I regret that she did not raise it with me earlier during the day because maybe we could have come to a satisfactory resolution of the problem. I have tried to approach this particular case, as I have with all others, sensibly and sanely, without resorting to the sort of histrionics that Mrs Bailey seems to have indulged in in her lust for publicity. I have had a chance to discuss this with Senator Patterson, and undertake that tomorrow we will very quickly get into the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must ask both Mrs Bailey and Senator Patterson to acknowledge that there are currently some 50 proposals for accommodation variations before the Department of Administrative Services as a result of not only the recent election but also the redistribution in Victoria and Western Australia. That meant that requests for new accommodation in those States were deferred until after the election. I am further informed by the Department that, at Mrs Bailey's request, my Department investigated a permanent location for her office at Craigieburn, but it will not be available for occupancy for several months. </PARA>
<PARA> I have rejected a temporary arrangement on the basis that it would cost something like $24,000 of Commonwealth funds, and asked Mrs Bailey to do what other members of Parliament are doing-that is, occupy the office of the previous member. I felt that $24,000 for an interim period was an expense that we should not incur. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be some confusion between Mrs Bailey's Melbourne office and the information I have been getting. I have undertaken to ensure that this matter is fixed up as soon as possible. What I do say to both Senator Patterson and Mrs Bailey is that if they really want these things fixed up, they should do what other members from both sides of the Parliament are doing-come to my office and have their requests attended to. Many members of Parliament from both sides are in temporary accommodation until their ultimate requests are satisfied. Mrs Bailey does not deserve to have $24,000 spent on her while we indulge her with an interim measure. I will ensure that this matter is attended to tomorrow so we can sort out where the hold-up is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that there is no government body or organisation that keeps historical records of the type of service provided by a bus or coach.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties of collecting the relevant information is that any suitably appointed bus or coach is capable of providing a range of transport services. Many such vehicles can provide inter-urban, intra or interstate services all in a single week. For this reason it is virtually impossible for any government or industry organisation to know with any precision the actual number of buses or coaches performing a particular type of service.</PARA>
<PARA> Although I am unable to provide the honourable senator with the precise information he is seeking, the following information may be helpful.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bus and Coach Association advise that there are some 14,000 buses used for general route, school, tour and charter services. Of these 14,000 buses, only around 20 per cent or 2,800 buses are appointed with facilities for intra or interstate long distance services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bus and Coach Association also advise that there are currently some 700 buses which provide the basis of Australia's interstate long distance services.</PARA>
