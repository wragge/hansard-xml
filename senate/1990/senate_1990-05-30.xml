<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The Petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> That the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act, 1988 includes legislation, Part III-Changes to Non-Government Schools and New Non-Government Schools, designed to inhibit the establishment, growth and development of these schools in Australia by the imposition of restrictive provisions in the areas of funding, enrolments and approval criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should: reconsider the application and implications of this legislation in the light of justice, equity and freedom of choice for parents and have the unfair sections (Section 8 (2), 8 (15) and (11) repealed.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> But for a High Court decision narrowly favouring the Federal Government, 20,000 years old archaeological cave sites near the Franklin River, Tasmania, would have been destroyed like a United Kingdom Government unable to stop a Wiltshire authority from clearing Stonehenge for a freeway. Constitutional protection for historical and environmental assets is needed.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution so that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has the bounded constitutional duty, which any citizen may legally require it to perform and a right superior to State and local governments, to set above the commercial advantage of one generation, protect and restore all we hold in trust for the future, including relics, sites, features, areas, wildlife, buildings or things of Aboriginal and other historical, cultural, architectural, scientific, aesthetic, ecological or environmental importance and</PARA>
<PARA> To care for the maintenance of the balance of nature, manage land, marine and atmospheric use so as to avoid their degradation and act nationally and internationally in any matter seen as related to these, including: to prevent military and commercial use of uranium and derivatives, beach and related mining; to preserve heritage areas, the Great Barrier Reef Region at least as originally defined in the 1975 Act and extended into Torres Strait.</PARA>

<PARA> (v) `Hoverspeed France', the second vessel to be constructed, was launched on 28 April 1990, and will commence trials next month, another to be launched on 15 September 1990 will enter service across Bass Strait and the remaining vessel presently under construction will be launched at 6.30 am on Sunday, 30 December 1990 for delivery to Europe, and</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) a major obstacle preventing International Catamarans reaching the full demand for their products, estimated at 200 vessels over 10 years with an export value of $5,000 million is a lack of suitably qualified aluminium welders in Hobart which the company is attempting to address by an in-house training program; and</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senators, my purpose in introducing the Legislation (Non-Sexist Language) Bill is to advance beyond the Government's half-hearted attempt in 1984 to address the problem of sexist and discriminatory language in Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 the Government amended section 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That Act had provided since it was first enacted that words importing the masculine gender were taken to include the female gender, unless a contrary intention appeared. In 1984 an amendment was made that unless the contrary intention appeared, words importing one gender should be taken to include the other. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a very small step-a token response to the problem of sexist and discriminatory language. A lot of older legislation on the statute books, by the use of masculine references, gives the impression that those with power, the decision-makers, will almost always be men. Only rarely are words used in legislation which refer to the female gender and which, as a result of the amendment, would now be required to be taken to include the male. </PARA>
<PARA> A more substantial response was the Government's adoption of a legislative drafting policy to no longer limit references only to the male gender where both males and females were contemplated. Since the adoption of this drafting policy we have seen expressions such as ``he or she'' appearing in Federal Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also began amending legislation to change references which are sexist and discriminatory and amended its Style Manual to prevent their use in Government publications. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that in administration and policy the Government has made some practical reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we can be reasonably confident that, with the ``purposive approach'' under the Acts Interpretation Act and, with changing social attitudes to gender roles, that Act will be construed to to avoid gender discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am strongly in favour of a statutory commitment to the removal and prohibition of sexist language in Federal legislation. Such a policy is important enough to enshrine in an Act of Parliament. A reversal of the policy by a future government would be made that much more difficult to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> My bill, although it is short, has substantial philosophical underpinnings. The works of Derrida, Foucault and Barthes with their semiotic and post structuralist approaches argue that words are not mere words with meanings attached, such as that ``he'' will be taken to include ``she'', but rather that words have a ``meaning potential'' within their social context and within a particular discourse. Semiotics tells us that language is a system of signs, not reflecting on a reality external to the words, but part of that external reality. They shape behaviour, environment and attitude. The exclusion of the word ``she'' has the effect of making women invisible, of making them subordinate within a patriarchal discourse. My Bill aims to challenge that discourse, to charge the reality in an important area of human affairs, by requiring Federal legislation to adopt non-sexist language. </PARA>
<PARA> If I can illustrate my point in a quite different context, the use of the term ``Conservation Zone'' to define the area excluded from Kakadu National Park, in order to preserve the area's potential for mining and at the same time appear to answer environmental needs, is a use of language to create a reality suited to the requirements of a particular interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Foucault has argued that modern practices of domination may not necessarily be overtly coercive. They are internalised with the effect that the will and the soul and the mind of a group within society are susceptible to domination. One form of domination sexism is supported by the willing use of language which renders women subordinate, dependent or invisible. The language itself embodies male domination and contributes to a social order that is patriarchal and discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA> Women now comprise a large part of the paid labour force but discrimination still affects them. Vocational titles still tend to derive from male titles: author/authoress, poet/poetess, waiter/waitress are some examples and the Commonwealth Style Manual details many others. Other titles are inapplicable to women, suggesting that they could never aspire to such roles; spokesman, statesman and chairman are examples of these. This terminology has to be reformed and this Bill would help in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel it is appropriate to pay tribute here to the women (and a few men) who are actively challenging the use of sexist language. Senator Crowley in particular has taken an interest in the propensity of language to influence the position of women in society. </PARA>
<PARA> I reserve some less complimentary remarks for those, on both sides of the chamber, who I suspect might deride this Bill and snigger at the thinking behind it. I suggest that is an attitude derived from ignorance rather than awareness and fear rather than reason. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when I was speaking on the Training Guarantee Bill, I was explaining to the Senate why I believe that it is important that what may be perceived as a good idea should be referred to a Senate committee to ensure that the detail in this Bill matches the rhetoric of the second reading speech and the expectations of those who believe it is a good idea. I announced some of the problems that business will be faced with, with this new Commonwealth payroll tax. I was referring to a letter that I had received from the Real Estate Institute of the Australian Capital Territory Ltd. I had read a portion of it, including the sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Small businesses join trade and/or professional organisations to obtain information and improve the level of skill and knowledge of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>I was reading that with a view to suggesting that it should be appropriate for small businesses to be able to claim as part of their tax the money that they spend for this training purpose on investment courses, magazines and journals that relate to their specific area of expertise and to improving their skills and those of their employees. The letter goes on to indicate that the employers are therefore disadvantaged in two ways. To save the time of the Senate, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the letter from the Real Estate Institute dated 25 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follow-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Margaret Reid</PARA>
<PARA>1st Floor, 4 Mort Street</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2601</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Margaret</PARA>
<PARA>Training Guarantee Bill</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing in regard to the Training Guarantee Bill proposed to be introduced this year and wish to provide the Institute's comments on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute is committed to increasing professional services of its members and therefore supports legislation which encourages a higher level of skill in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We do, however, have some concerns with provisions of the Bill and the effect on small business in Canberra. In particular, we are concerned with the administration of the system. The Bill intends to be linked to the taxation system, thus creating a negative image in those affected by it (ie employers), rather than a positive response. It will be perceived by employers as another taxation measure, rather than an endeavour to improve the level of skill of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration involved with the Bill will adversely affect real estate agents in the ACT; in fact all small businesses in Canberra. It will add to the already considerable workload involved in Government paperwork of these businesses. Moreover, the Standing Committee on Industry, Services &amp;Technology presented a report on small businesses and identified Government paperwork as a major handicap of small businesses. The Bill therefore ignores the recommendations from that Committee and will only compound the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if this legislation intends to remain as it stands, we must ensure that it works effectively to minimise the administrative workload of employers. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular concern that we have is the eligibility of expenditure under this Bill. The Bill does not include membership subscriptions to trade or industry related organisations, like ourselves, as eligible expenditure. Small businesses join trade and/or professional organisations to obtain information and improve the level of skill and knowledge of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Our own Institute provides seminars and newsletters for our members' benefit free of charge. This form of training is just as important as formal structured training, as required under the Bill, yet is not recognised in any way. We also provide training courses for members at reduced rates. For example, we are currently running an Investment Analysis course which costs members $150 and non members $280. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers are therefore disadvantaged in two ways. Not only are their subscription fees to professional organisations not acceptable, but they also receive free or reduced rate training which will penalise them under the Bill, as the Bill requires a certain amount of expenditure for their employees. They spend the time and money to acquire the increased level of skill but are penalised due to not spending the required amount. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore recommend very strongly that subscriptions to trade or other professional organisations be recognised as eligible under the Bill. As an example of what real estate offices in Canberra pay in membership fees per annum, the average real estate office with say six employees (1 Director, 1 Registered Agent &amp;4 Affiliates) would pay $695 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> These subscription fees should be acknowledged under the legislation. I again emphasise that trade and professional organisations are committed to increasing the level of skill of its members, thus achieving the requirements of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We would appreciate your support in this. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another area of small business that warrants investigation is that relating to those in the activity of offering personnel services. A personnel firm of this kind has on its books a large number of people-maybe 50, 70 or more-for whom they obtain work. The person for whom the employees work pays the salary to the personnel service firm, which then pays the worker. As a consequence, the personnel firm has a huge payroll, but a very small margin of profit for itself. Such firms assist qualified people into employment; the system works very well. It is a particularly useful form of activity for many women who wish to work part-time and intermittently. If such firms are required to pay this additional tax, it will just about wipe them out because their margins are so small. They offer training programs from time to time. But the fact is that the people who register with the personnel service firm have qualifications; that is what they are offering. There needs to be a wider range of exceptions in the Bill to enable people to proceed with the business that they are already in. I hope that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), will deal with this and that we can pursue it in the committee stage of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder also whether the fringe benefits tax is to be specifically excluded from operation in the area where an employer has paid for a training program for an employee which significantly advantages that employee. Is it certain and beyond doubt that, having paid for that, the employer will not also be liable for the fringe benefits tax, having advantaged the employee to that extent? One could go on for a long time and talk about areas in this Bill that are not sufficiently clear and which I believe warrant the Bill's detail being looked at to ensure that it is putting into effect what the Government says that it wants it to do. As I said last night, Senator Childs was saying that, by our suggesting a committee investigation, we were merely attempting to get rid of the Bill. That is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In a number of cases people are employed by an organisation for virtually a charitable purpose. Clause 17 of the Bill deals with the exemptions for particular employers and it states that a training guarantee charge-which is, of course, a training guarantee tax-is not payable by an employer that is a public benevolent institution other than a public hospital. If one goes to the Income Tax Assessment Act to find out what are classed as public benevolent institutions, it seems to me that they are only organisations for which gifts of $2 or more are tax deductable. There are quite a number of them. But what about all those other organisations doing charitable work in the community which get small sums of money, or perhaps a grant from government, and are paying people to go out and do charity work but just do not have vast resources? Surely, they too should be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> As I speak, many examples spring to mind. I am sure that I and others will go through them when we get to the committee stage. Why is it that only those public benevolent institutions as defined by the Australian Taxation Office will be exempt from the operation of this Act? Surely it is possible to find a definition that takes into account other charitable groups in the community that are not in the business of gathering huge public donations in the way that these are. </PARA>
<PARA> It also exempts a religious institution in relation to those of its employees whose duties are solely or principally pastoral duties or duties directly related to the practice, study, teaching or propagation of religious beliefs. Does that then mean that all the stenographers employed by the religious organisations will be included in the payroll for which religious institutions will have to pay the training tax? If it does, I think there will be a pretty swift response from the religious institutions when they find out the extent to which their bill to government will rise dramatically. This legislation is not clearly worded so as to totally exclude all of the staff of religious institutions. Their cleaning staff and secretariat staff are presumably attracting wages on which the institutions will then have to pay the training tax. That is not in the best interests of those institutions and the work they do. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that a number of journalists who have written in adoring terms about this Bill have read only the second reading speech and heard the rhetoric of government; they have not read this legislation. They praise it but they have not read it and analysed it. They certainly have never run a business with 10 or 12 employees and have never seen the amount of paperwork involved in running a small business. As I said last night, anybody who has written in that fashion does not understand the Bill. Clause 27 will attract an enormous amount of paperwork as a result of having to keep the necessary information to withstand the Commissioner of Taxation's audit. For that reason I repeat that the Bill must go to a committee and the problems must be clarified and ironed out. It is important that we get it right now so that it does not become a festering sore in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, can an employer who has a staff member who is a member of the Army Reserve claim that fee which he pays by way of wages as a benefit under this Act when his employee is off in the Army Reserve? I suggest that he could and should, because an enormous number of skills would be acquired during that process. While he allows his employee to go to an Army Reserve training course he ought to be able to debit against his training tax the amount of wages he pays during the time his employee is not with him. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Senate most strongly to send this Bill to a committee to make sure that its detail matches what the Government says it is trying to do and to make sure that it is not merely a tax to get more money out of the private sector and businesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990 currently before the Senate are inefficient. They are heavy-handed and they will not be an effective means of improving industry training programs. They are merely another tax, another impost on industry; another overhead that will make industry more and more uncompetitive as we seek to overcome the problems of recessionary conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Government: under what head of power is it introducing these Bills into the Senate today? As I see it, the head of power it is using is section 51 of the Constitution. I draw attention to the fact the it is highly likely that these Bills will be challenged on constitutional grounds. They are an exercise in taxation adventurism-normal taxation, levies, rates of tax on certain groups or classes of people at graduated rates. We saw a slight departure in superannuation in that we had complying funds and non-complying funds. The complying funds attracted a concessional rate of taxation; the non-complying funds attracted a penalty rate of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does not fit the norm or ordinary taxation legislation as perceived by the founders of the Constitution when drawing up section 51. It discriminates even within the same groups of people. It lays down regulations as to the code of conduct. It has inclusions and exclusions for particular types of activities. This is quite discriminatory. If our Tax Act discriminates in such a way I wonder where we will finish up. So much for simplicity, so much for the need to make it relatively easily understood. It is a serious departure from the norm of ordinary taxation legislation because essentially it does not seek to tax; it seeks to use this mechanism to regulate. Many of the people closely involved in the administration of this tax perceive that, at best, it will be revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party view is that Australian management has a poor attitude to training. This is a very poor way-I submit even a very unconstitutional way-of trying to coerce companies into increasing their investment in training, to make the most of the opportunities to improve efficiency and productivity through award restructuring. It will fail because our award restructuring, particularly that which is designed to improve re-skilling, training and retraining, has not advanced as quickly as the Government had hoped; there are a number of problems in this area. It is unfortunate that we are seeing the completely inappropriate implementation of some European socialistic ideas in Australia, which has a different training structure from that of the Europeans. Time and time again, ideas are plucked from overseas and imposed on inappropriate structures here. This is another example. It will not improve the quality of training. </PARA>
<PARA> My background is in the textile industry. Last night I thought through the various processes of a vertically integrated textile mill and how I would have had to apply these particular provisions. We start off with wool handling. We were highly involved in training. This was done for our own interests. Training is undertaken because one cannot afford to have employees making mistakes with wool of this quality, nature and, in some cases, fragility. Training is a highly essential component in which everybody is involved at present. It provides the opportunities for what the Government has in mind. We then had the willowing process. This was predetermined by chemists and was regulated according to type and batch. This was done apart from training in work practices, training to eliminate repetitive strain injury and such things, which was applied throughout the following processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The facility of applying particular training, as outlined in this Bill, is not there because the training will be one-to-one training-for example, the carding, the spinning, the weaving, even the burling or the mending. It will be a one-to-one training hands-on experience. We should not take these ladies out into a classroom environment and show them how to mend a piece of cloth. It should be done with a training officer on the job, for which there is no recognition in this Bill. Apart from that first entity we come to the wet finishing and the dry finishing. Again, there should be one-to-one training. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other possible exception would be in the dye-house operations where we use the training facilities that are available. In this case people would actually be sent away to the mainland specialist institutions. We find that these sorts of expenses do not fall within the ambit of the Bill. The practical application in a manufacturing situation, as I have described it in a typical wool mill, or the office situation involving training and retraining has possibilities. For the great bulk of these processes and the great bulk of the people involved in a typical wool mill the application of this Bill is way out. The Government is approaching it from the wrong direction, has given it the wrong recognition and has the wrong sort of goals to fit a manufacturing operation of a vertically integrated nature. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that the proposed legislation will apply to employers with an annual payroll of $200,000 or more, indexed to the average weekly earnings. It is to take effect from 1 July 1990. The minimum training requirement expenditure on training is equal to one per cent of the payroll for the financial year from July 1990, increasing to 1.5 per cent in later years. The review of the scheme will be conducted after four years. Already the scheme has been virtually damned before it begins. Affected employers will have to pay a levy equal to the percentage of their payroll, less their own training expenditure. This is an unusual way to raise revenue. The non-deductability for income tax purposes of levy payments will be a significant additional cost. This is another imposition. It is not surprising because it is not usual for us to be able to deduct Federal income tax charges against another income tax charge in an almost equivalent revenue-raising Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A close reading of the draft Bill reviews a significant number of sections which will greatly add to the administrative load and the personal liability of public officers and employer personnel. For example, let us look at some comments from people around Australia who really know, people who represent small business and others. Let me take the words of Peter Boyle, the Director of the Australian Small Business Association. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It will be a wonderful make-work program for public servants and create another tide of red tape and paper work for small business. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a relevant comment. David Edwards, the Executive Director of the Victorian Employers Federation, went so far as to say in a letter to the editor of the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's training levy is unlikely to raise the $600 to $800m that the Government has forecast. Indeed it may not cover the administration costs of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>If enacted in its present form the legislation will be expensive for those employers that it affects. Qualifying employers will need to ensure that their training expenditure complies with this tight statutory definition which is quite inappropriate for a whole host of manufacturing operations because of the one-to-one and special training operations that they have in place at present. It would be difficult for them to comply with the statutory definitions. They will have additional accounting systems to put in place to detail the eligible-this is the crunch word-expenditure programs. Where training expenditure exceeds the training requirement companies will not be able to carry forward the amount or claim a refund. It is quite inequitable. It might be high in one year but one cannot carry forward the excess to another year, contrary to normally taxation principles and income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has already indicated in the House of Representatives that it is opposed to this legislation because of its very arbitrary nature, both in terms of who has to pay and the threshold figure of $200,000. It is bad legislation. We believe that as a coalition, as a responsible alternative government, we cannot support a levy which is applied carte blanche, irrespective of what the company does, irrespective of whether it provides any one-to-one training-this is the message we have to get across-and irrespective of whether the nature of its business requires it to recruit and employ untrained staff and to then train them. There is a whole range of ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> As a coalition we cannot accept the Government's definition of eligible training. I suppose we should at least be grateful that the Government has attempted to define it. In the first round of the draft this was totally lacking. It was only from intense pressure that we had even a definition. That shows that the scheme is hastily thought out and ill-conceived and will be a patchwork program of improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that training programs are really only eligible if the program is structured-that is the first prerequisite-that is, if the objective of the program, the means of achieving the objective, is clearly identified before the start of the program. In a sense that is going to take a lot of bookwork and a lot of unnecessary paperwork. In theory, it is desirable. One almost wonders whether the whole program has been based on the job skills program around Australia. While a number of the programs are very good and identifiable their application across this whole spectrum of industry and manufacturing is not always applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The program must also be designed or approved by a person appropriately qualified to do so. Again, this creates some problems. An appropriate qualification, as per the explanatory notes, means a person with a working knowledge of the area who has undertaken at least a short course on program training design or has been approved by a person with such qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the person appropriately qualified should be spelt out in the Bill, not just in the explanatory memorandum. The explanatory memorandum has very little force of law. We should be looking for an appropriately worded Bill which includes this concept. We should not have to go back to the speeches in the Parliament or to the explanatory memorandum. The whole content should be in the Bill for employers to understand if they are going to implement it justly without penalty and without consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> The sole or principal object of the program must be to develop, maintain and improve the employment-related skills of employees or other persons. Recreation should not form a significant part of the program. If it does it does not qualify. If the program consists of or includes on-the- job training it must include periods of instruction and periods of closely supervised practice. That will be very hard to detail in a program that may be necessary to raise skills or satisfactory standards. If a program does not include such things it will be ineligible. In the whole raft of apprenticeship training, on-the-job training supervisors may have to take a couple of minutes off to explain intricate wiring networks. They then go on with a job, complete it and move to another one. Will they have to stop and document all these sorts of operations, instructions and special training to their apprentice? Imagine the paperwork involved! I do not really think the Government realises what an elephant it has created here. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues have drawn to the Senate's attention the invaluable nature of work experience in terms of training and the fact that to preclude it from the legislation is almost laughable. That sort of experience is vitally necessary in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Other defects in the draft legislation, as highlighted by an international firm of accountants, include there being no provision under which employers can apply for exemption where their circumstances justify it. It is usual to have an opting out clause in special circumstances but there is no such provision in this Bill. In support of the raising of this defect, there are employers who hire out to other employers temporary staff such as relief secretaries or locums for professional practices. That is a major deficiency because, as explained by my colleagues, those companies may have 50 or 100 people on their books and the charge-out fees are quite nominal. There is no provision in the Bill for companies with substituted accounting periods. These companies will be inconvenienced, extracting information on a financial year basis when their records are maintained for a different year end. I find it extraordinary that here we have tax legislation with a tax head which has obviously not been put to the Commissioner of Taxation. If it had, those sorts of features would be recognised and written into this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The record retention obligations are onerous and some exemption should be available from record keeping retention obligations where employers are able to establish that their training expenditure is well in excess of the minimum required under this Act. One can draw the analogy, of course, of the keeping of motor vehicle logbooks for 13 weeks to determine the percentage of costs which will be applied for work purposes. In other words, once a standard has been established it then applies, unless there is a major change, for quite a number of years. Why cannot these sorts of principles be applied to the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> We are giving the Government plenty of ideas on how to improve the quality of this legislation. We are not happy with it. We have pointed out the defects and the problems to the Government. I believe that, as a minimum, the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted, and have a different starting date, at least until we can get some more award restructuring programs under way with appropriate recognition for retraining and reskilling. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of an appropriately qualified person, as set out in the explanatory note, is far too narrow for ordinary day to day manufacturing purposes and it has to be broadened if it is going to have any practical application. The proposed section with regard to apprentices and trainees is inadequately drafted and it will cause confusion. It is apparent from the explanatory memorandum that the full amount of $1,000 should be allowed as eligible expenditure per apprentice or trainee employed for a full year without a deduction for any reimbursement in relation to such an employee. However, this interpretation is not reflected in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires eligible expenditure to be directly attributable solely or principally to eligible training programs. This is another problem of definition. Where rent is paid for premises, and less than half of those premises are set apart solely for eligible training purposes, this may not qualify as there is only one amount of rent paid and this does not relate principally to eligible training programs. The legislation should be clarified to ensure that items of mixed expenditure must be apportioned between eligible and ineligible activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital expenditure is another area of major defect. Capital expenditure is to be directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of premises intended solely for training for eligible training purposes and eligible training expenditure but this could mean that if a company spent $5m on setting up or erecting an eligible training operation or building, in one year that employer would obviously have an excess but in subsequent years he might fall below the training mechanism, having devoted so much money in one year. He would want to make sure he could amortise that over a number of years. But, according to the Bill, that is not possible. I believe that that is a major impediment to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that this Bill should pass through the Senate when it contains such defects. Additionally, according to the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has caved in to a string of Australian Democrat amendments to its industry training levy legislation which will drastically alter its administration. </PARA>
<PARA>I must admit that some of those changes have some merit, particularly monitoring by peak industry bodies. I believe that up until now they have been left out of the arrangements. As far as I am aware the Bill before us is the original one where the onus for deciding program eligibility seems ultimately to rest with the Australian Taxation Office, and I think that needs to be clarified as a result of some of the amendments that have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> With all these sorts of changes which will be incorporated now, and later on, the starting date of 1 July is quite inappropriate. It should at least be delayed until January, or even for 12 months; preferably, the Bill should be scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA> I think these two Bills are already receiving enough general criticism without attracting further condemnation by our making changes in the next sitting. I will outline the reaction to this legislation of some of the people that the Bills will affect. The National Farmers Federation spokesman, Mr John Allwright, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We view industry training as a matter for industry and the workforce to determine, and not a field for further government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA>The Director of the Australian Small Business Association, Mr Boyle, said:</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the economy is looking sick, when sales are slowing rapidly, when interest rates remain punishingly high, it is a gross act of irresponsibility for the Federal Government to be even contemplating imposing yet another tax and cost upon small business. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of opinion is also supported by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, which wants safeguards put in place so that the viability of small business is not put at risk by the enactment of these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than build up business, this training levy could lead to many deliberate decisions against expansion, because expansion of small businesses to over the $200,000 threshold could involve them in additional overheads and additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely this is the area that the Government would want to see increased. We want to see small business expand. Yet many people will see this as an impediment to putting on additional staff which would take their payroll above the $200,000 threshold. The Director of Access Economics, Dr Ed Shann, said in an article which appeared in the Business Review Weekly on 20 October:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . training levies are a mistake. They are an attack on the symptom rather than the cause of training . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is significant. Dr Shann argues that the Government's aim should be to create competitive markets because if companies have to compete they will then recognise that human capital gives them a competitive advantage. We are looking at it from the wrong angle. He says companies will focus on how to give training a priority at the enterprise level and on restructuring work organisation and occupational structures to maximise their human capital. Training levies will never achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Shann cites other training schemes around the world which he also claims fail to meet their objective. France has a training levy; in fact, I think the Government probably copies it from France virtually carte blanche. According to Dr Shann it bears a striking resemblance to what the Government is proposing for Australia. Let us look at the outcomes of the scheme in France. Companies with more than 10 employees have to spend 1.1 per cent of their payroll on training or pay the equivalent, as a tax, to the government. Virtually everybody in France claims to have spent the 1.1 per cent of payroll and the scheme is regarded as a bureaucratic joke. This is almost the identical scheme with the same percentages. It is a bureaucratic joke there and will become a bureaucratic joke in Australia. What do employers do over there? They indulge in training that fits the scheme's requirements, but the scheme actually achieves very little whatsoever. Companies spend their money on in-house training that is of very little use to people outside the companies, or they simply make up fictitious training expenses. And that is a sad indictment. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is the Australian Government's intention to do itself out of a job by imposing a tax wing, are we sure that companies will undertake the necessary training and that the Government will not be collecting a levy or imposing any fines in the long run? I am sure it really wishes to achieve a constructive training scheme and not just have training for the sake of training to meet some particular rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go back to Shann, he points out that the best enterprises in the world emphasise human resources development as a key weapon in their survival and prosperity. They do not need training levies to encourage them to invest in their employee's skills, just as they do not need levies to make them invest in the latest capital equipment. Will this be the next levy down the track for Australian manufacturers, a tax on their failure to invest on appropriate new capital expenditure? We have already seen in the latest capital expenditure details that it is substantially down. </PARA>
<PARA> Shann then goes on to suggest that the Government's aim should be to remove obstacles to training and using labour more efficiently. The age limit on apprenticeships, the non-recognition of migrant qualifications, the high payment of apprentices and a lack of career paths for skilled tradesmen-these are all cited as problems to be overcome. Other areas we could well consider include the shortening of the four-year apprenticeship scheme-something I advocated in industry for many years before I came into this place-the problem of demarcation issues, and tradesmen-apprentice ratios, all archaic systems from a bygone era. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers are taking the attitude that, if the Government wants to run their businesses by telling them how to spend their money, it can buy a share in the businesses. The Government is trying to run Australian businesses. What I fail to understand really is why the Government wants to impose this training levy on an industry when what we need is an effective system of industry training councils. This worries me. Through the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) system we have set up in Tasmania a comprehensive training council, which has worked very well. For example, we have training councils in the areas of building and construction, food processing, local government, retailing, automotive, textiles and clothing, forestry, tourism, road transport, and furniture. Here we have examples of industry and government working together on these training councils, and they have been able to assess industry training requirements and then go about arranging the training programs. Industry is happily contributing to these schemes, whether the annual payroll bill exceeds $200,000 or not. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government is going to make use of the funds raised through the training levy to fund existing training schemes and to establishment other training councils for industries which currently have none, then we might find major problems. But we are uncertain at this stage whether company contributions to training councils are deemed eligible expenditure under the training legislation. It would be a tragedy and a travesty if they were not. May I suggest that the Government look into this to make sure that they are eligible because such a scheme would run against current DEET operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990. These two Bills impose a requirement on employers resident in Australia to spend a minimum amount on structured training every financial year, starting on 1 July 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is not a move towards a better trained work force, important though such an objective is. It is the latest of a whole string of anti-business measures of this Hawke Labor Government that taxes large and small business to pay for a bureaucratic form of training and tells management what kind of training it should have. Only last week we in the Senate here were debating the problems of small business and the unprecedented rate of bankruptcies. Yet here we have another piece of legislation today that is going to impose further commitments on business, both of a financial nature and of a practical nature in terms of the paper work that is attached to it. We have heard from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) that this Bill is focused on structured training-that key word `structured'-carefully thus eliminating a great deal of practical work-based training. The Minister has also told us that a Bill that applies to any business with a payroll exceeding $200,000 will bring within its scope small businesses with more than eight to 10 employees. I would concede that a business with eight to 10 employees is not necessarily an excessively large business, but it is a very sad state of affairs that such a Bill comes hot on the heels at a time when only last Friday the Australian Financial Review reported forecasts that one in eight current small businesses-that is about 100,000 enterprises-are going to fail. It is good to note that the Government intends to help them along their way!</PARA>
<PARA> The business community has also been warned that 60 per cent of enterprises with payrolls above $200,000 spend nothing on formal training. This statement pays no heed to what practical training is being supplied or whether a particular business employee has only fully qualified staff. Clearly, this Bill has a punitive element to it. Later on I will go through some of the areas of business that are currently providing a very good basis of training at their own cost, for which they are not given any credit in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Business people will know all too well what is meant when the Minister blandly tells us that they need `to keep appropriate records' for self-assessment under the scheme. That really is purely and simply Keating-speak for business taking on the administrative expense and carrying the can for any errors. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen on so many occasions before that businesses have been penalised. Once again, there was another debate in the Senate only a couple of weeks ago about this. My colleague who spoke just before me, Senator Watson, led a matter of public importance a couple of weeks ago, talking about how businesses had been very seriously affected by very innocent errors made on their tax returns. Of course, business people across Australia will smile grimly when the Minister tells them that `the Government's purpose is not to collect revenue'. It really is a very sick joke. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition opposes this legislation for two basic reasons. Firstly, if Australians want, as a national good, a better trained work force, it is inequitable to expect the cost to be paid by one category of taxpayers-businesses with payrolls exceeding $200,000. Secondly, the bureaucratic and restrictive nature of these Bills will have an unfair effect on so many enterprises, businesses being lumbered with yet another tax because it is politically expedient to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the State Government has lost billions of dollars. Somehow or other it has to recoup some money. The Premier says, `We will not increase this, we will not increase that, we will not increase something else, but we will increase the taxes on businesses'. That is at a State level. Here we have the Federal Government, at this level, doing exactly the same. I suppose that, if one were to be a cynic, one could say that company directors are considered not to be reliable Labor voters and there are not so many of them. Such is the cheap brutal logic of this Hawke Labor Government. I think it is very sad that we have that attitude coming across in so many pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing applies to the farmers. The farmers are given very little consideration by this Government because it views the farming community as a community that largely does not vote Labor. It is the same with doctors, with dentists, with any of the specialists in medicine, and with the pharmacists. They are not viewed to vote Labor, therefore they are hit for six. </PARA>
<PARA> But, unlike the payroll tax, the training levy will not be deductable against company tax, as Senator Watson detailed very succinctly just moments ago. It applies to the total payroll including payments to subcontractors and casual staff. Where is the equity in requiring employers to foot the bill for their supposed training? There is simply no equity in that at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be emphasised that the application of the levy shows very little discrimination. It applies as much to those enterprises that by their very nature recruit only skilled workers as it does to those who need to train their employees. Public benevolent organisations and religious personnel may be exempt, but schools-hardly profit-making organisations-will be liable for the training levy; so too will nursing homes and local government. </PARA>
<PARA> Superficially, a levy of one per cent of a payroll may not seem a large amount-it can be an overworked phrase when debating the actions of the Hawke Labor Government-but, once more, we see the thin end of the wedge. In only two years time the levy will increase to 1.5 per cent of the payroll and there is no guarantee that it will not rise higher in the future. While raising the levy by 0.5 per cent may seem a very minor adjustment, in cold, hard terms it means a 50 per cent increase at the expense of fragile profitability. If the Government needs to know how fragile profitability is with small business these days, I suggest the a few Ministers go out and talk to small business people, because they are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> But the problem is still the same, as I pointed out in a debate last week on small business bankruptcies, and that is, there are too few Government members who really know and understand what business is all about. There are too few members of the Australian Democrats-who are in fact supporting this Bill-who know and understand what business is all about. I think that, almost exclusively, the Democrats are made up of teachers who have never had to go out and fight to pay staff at the end of the week, fight to pay the rent, the telephone bill, the insurance and the other on-costs. They have never had to do that and, therefore, they do not understand what they are doing by supporting this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already noted the Minister's admission that the levy applies to smaller business. Many such smaller businesses operate on slim profit margins, with payrolls exceeding profit levels by only 5 per cent. Thus the one per cent training levy will be a 5 per cent tax on profits and a strong disincentive to employ more staff. I would have hoped, at this stage of the game, that we would be trying to enact legislation in the Senate that would give business more positive reason to employ more staff. We have a current environment where unemployment is going up and yet we have legislation before the Senate today that will ensure that more staff will not be put on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a farce when the Labor Government sends its Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) to make encouraging noises to our beleaguered smaller enterprises and then hits them with this clumsy imposition. How can one, on the one hand, start encouraging businesses and then, on the other hand, slap another tax on them? The Government's real attitude to business emerges in statements such as the one made by one of its backbenchers who said:</PARA>
<PARA>No group in Australian society has accepted featherbedding as a right as has the business community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, that is clear evidence that the Government does not understand what business is all about. Thus are concerns of business treated with total and utter contempt. I suppose `featherbedding' is Labor's definition of what the rest of us would call simply a chance to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, in fixing an arbitrary figure of $200,000 payrolls for application of the levy, has ignored the fact that State governments exempt smaller business from payroll tax at figures at about this level. In Western Australia, payroll tax is imposed on payrolls exceeding $300,000, but many firms which are exempt from that tax will find themselves paying the new levy. We have already been warned by the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that business in that State will face a bill of $60m because of the training levy. Worst hit will be service industries with fewer than 100 employees, already faced with taxation, interest and wages costs-all of them courtesy of the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why so many enterprises will have to pay the levy lies in the blind bureaucratic definition of training that this Bill specifies. As I said before, the bureaucratic nature of this Bill is something that small business is very worried about. Small business is already, by demand, another arm of the Australian Taxation Office and now it will have more paperwork to fill out and more paperwork with which it could make an innocent error for which it will be penalised. Only Ministers devoid of practical business experience would insist upon a definition of structured training that excludes as much as three-quarters of all workplace training. A more honest definition of training would show that average overall training expenditure would reach between 3 and 9 per cent of total payroll. But we are not talking about honesty with this Bill; we are talking about imposts. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation places a strong emphasis upon, in effect, paying employees when they are not working and deliberately excludes the work experience that, in the real world, is so essential to employers and employees alike. I think it is very sad when even the explanatory memorandum to this Bill states on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA>When a training program includes on the job training, it may include a period of related, closely supervised practice-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that it `may' include it-</PARA>
<PARA>However, further periods of generally supervised practice and work experience are not included in an eligible training program. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not absurd, what is? It is getting away from the real world of what business really needs. In taking away the right of management to decide what kind of training best meets the needs of its work force and business, this Labor Government is really putting credentials ahead of competence. Of course, when business does this, it simply goes broke. But, once again, this Government does not seem to mind that. But let there be no suggestion that hands-on training represents training on the cheap-far from it. Supervising an inexperienced employee to carry out productive work involves some loss to the firm in terms of immediate efficiency. Businesses are prepared to do that at the moment, but they are not being given any credit for it in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chamber of Mines in Western Australia, which represents 120 companies that produce half the State's export income and directly or indirectly account for one job in six, has expressed strong practical concerns as to the restrictive nature of the Bill. On-line training is essential in the real world but, unfortunately, in this Bill we are not really talking about the real world. On-line training is particularly important in the real world of mining with isolated locations and the inability to teach the operation of heavy equipment other than in the field. What would this Government have us do-set up simulators, such as aircraft simulators, in order to try to teach people how to operate equipment out in the minefields? It is absurd. Once again, there is no provision for this practical training to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year one major mining company, Hamersley Iron, would have devoted 40,000 hours to on-line training and this Labor Government will give no credit for such an effort. Another major enterprise, Worsley Alumina, bases employee accreditation through on-line skills acquisition. Does this Bill give it credit for that? Not at all. There is a similar situation in the real estate industry. The real estate industry in Western Australia has a statutory responsibility to provide on-the-job training and, accordingly, receives public funding on a State level. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 1,000 people were so trained in 1989 with no input from the Federal Government. Now we have this Bill that will put a levy on those businesses. Such training, along with seminars funded by the membership fees of individual firms to the Real Estate Institute of Australia, falls outside the bureaucratic definition of training in this Bill. The cyclical nature of the real estate business also means that training can take place on the basis of 18 months rather than the 12 months requirement of this Bill. But is there any latitude within this Bill to be able to cope with those practicalities? The answer is no. It almost goes without saying that as small businesses, real estate firms will suffer through the administrative burdens alone that the Bill imposes. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope, in these tough economic times, that the Government would be doing everything it could to encourage people to do what they do best in business: get out and make some money. But no, the Government would prefer to have small businesses tied into an office where they have to fill out all the paperwork for such a ridiculous piece of legislation. Not so long ago the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was telling us that we had to become `the clever country'. Yet no recognition is given to the fact that in high technology industries and in such professions as accounting, seminars are the essential means for qualified employees to refine their skills and acquire continued essential knowledge. It makes a mockery of Labor's supposed commitment to technological and professional excellence, that expenditure upon such seminars will not be recognised under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week in the Senate, as I said before, the Opposition drew attention to the fact that the Hawke Labor Government had failed the small business sector through its mismanagement of the economy. With these Bills the Government again proves us right, demonstrating once more an uncaring ignorance of the practical needs of businesses, large and small alike. Again I say it is very sad that so few people on the Government side have ever had to experience the pain necessary to stay afloat in business. Many of us on this side have done that. We know what it is all about. We know what these additional levies and so forth mean in real practical terms. So long as the Labor Government, with the support of the Democrats, presumes to levy another tax on business on the basis of a dishonest definition of training, Australia will undoubtedly lack both economic growth and a truly competent work force. I certainly encourage the Democrats to have a rethink about this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to be reinforced. Perhaps some of the Government people, when it is reinforced often enough, might get the message and engage in some practical legislation and government that is of some benefit to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those criticisms that Senator Knowles made are not surprising because this legislation clearly demonstrates the extent of trade union control over this Government and its clear commitment to the corporate state of big government, big unions and big business. This particular proposal for a training guarantee levy, which is introduced by the legislation, is lifted straight from the document Australia Reconstructed, which was published about three years ago. The Australia Reconstructed document published by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Trade Development Council sought to further entrench the unions' privileged position under this Hawke Labor Government. Among the recommendations in that document was the establishment of a national employment training fund to be financed by a tax on companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should be reminded that a major part of the work on Australian Reconstructed was undertaken by Mr Ted Wilshire, of the Trade Development Council. Ted Wilshire has been closely associated with Ted Wheelwright, one of the founders of the Marxist political economy course at the University of Sydney. If we look at the membership of the group that put the document together, we see that Wilshire would have received much support for his views from the old guard left wing of other members of the joint ACTU-Trade Development mission that visited Europe when preparing this document. These include Tom McDonald of the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia-the successor to Pat Clancy of the pro-Soviet Communist Party; Laurie Carmichael of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union-an ex-communist and born again socialist; and Colin Cooper of the left wing Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. Let us be in no doubt as to the source of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad to see the Government succumb to this left wing pressure for centralisation at a time when decentralised decision making is becoming more and more essential. For our part, the Opposition is not opposed, in principle, either to the concept of enhanced training in the workplace or to a more highly skilled and multiskilled work force. If the reshaping of Australian industry is to succeed, innovative ways of training, retraining and assessment will have to be introduced. Technical and further education in no small way has led with its large off campus enrolments. The Liberal and National parties have led the debate that improvements in both the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian industry must take place. However, we are vigorously opposed to this legislation and the detrimental effects it will have if it passes through this place. Those effects will be detrimental to all businesses, large and small. </PARA>
<PARA> After only a few days into what will surely be the Government's last term in office, already it is setting itself up for its first, but certainly not its last, confrontation with the business sector. The business community which this proposed legislation targets totally rejects the statistics and other purported evidence which the Government is using to justify this legislation. The Government has based much of its argument for the need for this training levy on a survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) late last year. While this survey found that less than one in four Australian companies spent any money on formal training, its definition of training was as narrow as that used in this legislation. In other words, as Senator Knowles said a few moments ago, no recognition of on-the-job training and other informal training arrangements was taken account of in this survey. Indeed, the ABS survey specifically excluded on-the-job training such as, as is stated in the concise guide to the ABS 1990 training expenditure survey:</PARA>
<PARA> Exclude unstructured on-the-job training such as being shown how to do things as the need arises, learning by doing a job, for example an apprentice mechanic who is shown a task on the job. </PARA>
<PARA>The ABS survey and the legislation which we are debating today which is based on it, therefore specifically exclude the type of training that is most widely used in the small business sector and which is generally accepted as being the most efficient. The Government's intended measure, relating to both large and small business organisations, is nothing more or less than a special tax on a limited number of Australian companies in order to finance and enforce a level of training on them and their employees. This legislation discriminates against a select section of our community bearing the financial burden of training, which is, after all, benefiting the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, which the Government is ramming down all our throats, is just another tax. The Government is wanting to ensure its passage because it is intended to have it up and running by 1 July this year-little more than 30 days away. The training guarantee levy is a proposal for employers to spend a minimum of one per cent of their payrolls on training, under strict definitions, from 1 July this year. The levy will apply to all employers, and to government departments as well, which have payrolls of more than $200,000 a year. The compulsory scheme will, in fact, mean a new round of tax audits for industry members. After two years, if those companies which have been levied are still in business, the floor price will rise to 1.5 per cent with provision for some industries to face an even higher minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> Those companies which are still clinging on and just surviving this Government-caused recession-and a range of other devastating government taxes and charges-will have to submit themselves to a scheme administered by the Australian Taxation Office, after, it appears, the Minister failed to persuade the States to collect the levy via their own payroll taxation systems. What will happen to those companies which are unable to meet the minimum obligation required of them through the legislation? They will have their funds diverted by the Taxation Office to the States for training purposes and, no doubt, will be swallowed up by bureaucratic administration. One might be forgiven for believing that we are actually living in modern-day Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> These companies' funds will be diverted by the Australian Taxation Office. It is obvious that this Labor Government is well on its way to taxing business to the brink of extinction. This is how it pursues its reform in the business sector. The Government simply taxes one to death. At least the legislation has been amended to somewhat reduce the role to be played by the Australian Taxation Office. Its role is now, apparently, reduced to that of auditing companies annually to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If smaller businesses are unable to meet this minimum training obligation and are consequently forced to meet the compliance costs of this levy, there is no doubt at all that the small business sector, already undergoing immense and significant cash flow problems, may well cave in under the pressure. It is no secret that bankruptcies throughout Australia are on the rise. Between the 1988-89 and 1989-90 financial years, this country saw a 27 per cent increase in the number of bankruptcies nation-wide. </PARA>

Daily, numerous stories catch the eye which relate to the collapse of people's livelihoods. The impediment of Government charges, rates and regulations in the business sector is more than crippling-it is humiliating and disgraceful for a nation claiming that it is on its way to being the clever country. Australia's total tax bill now sits at about $91.3. billion a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is claiming that significant disparities exist between the training effort of the private and public sector employers and between large and small businesses. It is suggested that most employers are getting a free ride at the expense of both the larger companies and the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the parameters the Government has set under this legislation. A small business is one which more accurately, could be described as employing up to 20 people in the service sector and up to 100 people in the manufacturing sector-a business which is independently owned and managed and in which the owner or the proprietor is the main decision-maker. The figure of $200,000 has been randomly selected as the payroll threshold below which no company will be required to participate in this industry levy scheme. This in itself is the biggest hoodwink that we have seen all week. No doubt, $200,000 was chosen as the threshold because the Government will lose fewer votes this way. It will not have to ask too many smaller businesses to cough up vast sums of money and join in the training party. There would be many small businesses whose payroll is below $200,000, which, if the scheme has any justification, should be part of the training levy in any fair-minded manner of assessment. They should be asked to contribute to training costs. It is clearly a political decision to exclude that group. </PARA>
<PARA> From my own dealings with businesses, both large and small, it is clear that very little consultation has taken place regarding this levy. Whilst most do not oppose the fundamentals of enhanced training, many have questioned the propriety of businesses having the responsibility of training totally foist upon them. The chief executive of the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, Mr Bert Evans, has been extremely vocal about the negative effects which these measures will have on businesses. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Companies burdened with high interest rates and uncertain markets, see the proposed levy as another impost which could further erode their viability. They do not see it as a positive measure aimed at increasing workplace training, so much as an additional tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Evans also said that since the proposal to introduce the training levy on employers was first raised, the Association's offices across the country had been inundated with calls from very angry business people concerned about the levy's effects on their businesses. This Bill will, in effect, tax the heart out of every single company which has a payroll of more than $200,000, irrespective of whether it offers any one-on-one training, and irrespective of whether the nature of its business requires it to recruit and to employ untrained people and then to train them. A company's size has become its own beast of burden. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does nothing at all to promote training designed specifically for the small business person or the needs of that particular industry group. The keystone of the legislation focuses on centralised, large-scale training efforts, whereas the requirements of small business reflect a very different set of needs and circumstances. What this means for the small business arena is greater emphasis on work experience and hands-on training skills which are crucial to this sector's survival. The crux of the matter is: Why is the Government reluctant to treat the needs of small business differently than larger businesses for the purposes of this training levy? Why should small businesses be coerced to contribute towards a levy to help fund a centralised training scheme, which by the Government's very own admission cannot hope to accommodate or cater to the special needs of the small business community?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is simply wedded to its large-scale, centralist approach, consistent with a corporate State mentality. There are specific problems which arise from this legislation: Firstly, it encourages structured training at the cost of dismissing a broad-banded, and perhaps more effective skills formation. The definition of eligible training is too limited. </PARA>
<PARA> A one-on-one approach to training is unstructured and relies heavily on the personal interaction between the skilled person and the learner. Further it is tailored to suit the needs of the employer as well as employees to suit the individual business perfectly. Industry and small business have found this to be the preferred form of training. It is usually extremely efficient, especially when the instructor can impart knowledge well. This is completely ignored in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it would promote an inequitable distribution of the training effort between employers. Those companies not required to participate in the training and the levy could see themselves as being slightly competitively advantaged. Some companies would, no doubt, consider that they will have done well by not having to outlay vast sums of money on staff training; while their larger rivals will be caught in the threshold net. Thirdly, many additional costs will be incurred through the administration of the levy, especially for smaller scale operations. Fourthly, there is no provision for a company to carry forward any of its excess expenditure from one year to the next. Fifthly, companies with a training expenditure far in excess of the required amount cannot off-set the levy shortfall in a sister company. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is inadequate lead time allowed for employers and training institutions to assess training requirements resulting from the award restructuring process, which is now under way. As 1 July straddles the academic year, one must surely speculate what effect will this have on mid-year enrolments. Surely 1 January 1991 would reflect a more adequate planning framework. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has made a gross error of judgment if it believes that small business owners, who fall just inside the levy's net, will accept blindly that a great proportion of the training provided by them counts for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the impact of this legislation and its administrative detail, is very unclear. For instance, it does not clearly deal with the scheme's impact on the complex structures under which industries and the professions exist. Nor does the scheme precisely identify the reporting procedures which will be required, or the precise roles of the proposed national training board, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Law Council of Australia has expressed great concern about the legislation's vagueness. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council is concerned that the scheme, as presently drafted, may distort and undermine the very objective which it seeks to achieve . . . The Law Council strongly objects to legislation by guideline. That sort of legislation leads to confusion, avoids proper scrutiny by Parliament, and is not in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The outcomes of negotiations within industry restructuring are, because of this confused Government, being regarded with great uncertainty by both commerce and industry in many sectors. The Government thinks that by introducing an industry training levy it can legislate away the problems it has created. </PARA>
<PARA> We have many examples within industry of the effects of the new restructuring. To avoid further industrial problems, tradespeople have been upgraded, but in name only, to `tradespeople, special class'. Essentially, industry restructuring means the substantial changing of work structures across an industry through altered industrial awards and agreements which allow new approaches to work organisation to be implemented. These changes should allow for greater worker flexibility, reductions in demarcations between jobs, and the establishment of clear career paths within industries. They require more broadly based training programs with study paths linked to career paths, resulting in multiskilled workers and the possibility of different components of industrial training being connected instead of being in separate boxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Restructuring has been forced upon us because, many would argue, Australians have been enjoying the fruits of the lucky country for a little too long. We are told by those who know these things that we as a nation are about to embark on a journey which will lead us to be the so-called clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia has embraced industry restructuring for a number of reasons: Firstly, as a result of the increased sophistication of world markets; secondly, because of the introduction of new technology; thirdly, because of cheaper costs of labour in nearby, more competitive countries; and, fourthly, because of the need to achieve greater productivity than has been possible under the old structures and regimes. </PARA>
<PARA> The new approaches to work organisation which result from restructuring emphasise high quality, increased flexibility and competitive product prices. But restructuring is not just about getting wage increases. It is about job redesign, lifelong training, career opportunities, multiskilling, quality and efficiency, and job satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Three crucial areas in which this nation is deeply inadequate are service, quality and our attitude towards exports. Our approaches to quality, can be heard across, the nation with a resounding `She'll be right, mate'. Unfortunately, unless we have a commitment to quality, this will most certainly turn into `She's worse!'. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless this industry training levy addresses these and other issues, we will continue to be a nation offering poor service and having a bad reputation as a reliable exporter. This legislation will not solve those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Restructuring presents a fundamental challenge to Australian business and industry. Should the approach be taken in levity, our nation will suffer. Had the Government been realistic about safeguarding small businesses, it should have at least allowed a more realistic exemption level. The Government has displayed its complete heartlessness and insensitivity to the problems this levy will have on the small business sector throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, while the Opposition supports the need for more training and updating of skills in the workplace, we oppose strongly the concept of an enforced level of expenditure for one sector of business, regardless of its own needs for training or ability to pay. This legislation is yet another tax against employment and will make a mockery of this Government's claim it will improve levels of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax will cause enormous financial hardship to many businesses already burdened with a large range of government taxes and charges, not to mention high interest rates and an uncertain economy which, thanks to this Government's mismanagement, is fast disappearing down the gurgler. The government already tells businesses who they can hire, what they can pay them and who they may or may not merge with. Now it wants to regulate how a business trains its employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, this whole thing smacks of the big brother tactics which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and his ACTU mates have been employing so assiduously in recent years. The inconsistencies in principle and practice which will arise from this Bill can lead only to the conclusion that it should be thrown out. As I mentioned during Senator Knowles's speech, the Australian Democrats are not here listening to this important debate on this legislation. If they are listening in their rooms, I urge them to join with the Opposition and throw out this legislation. </PARA>

Much of the detail of the objections the Opposition has to this Bill has been outlined in a very succinct and eloquent way by my colleagues, so I will restrict myself ever so briefly to some general comments. I think it is a widely held view in Australia that, if we are to become more competitive internationally and be able to compete for the domestic market against import penetration, there is a very real need for Australian industry to become more efficient, and particularly for our work force to become more effective and more skilled. It is my view, and I think it is a correct view, that Australia lags behind the rest of our trading partners in terms of both skills and human resources. We certainly lag behind in terms of loyalty between employer and employee, which in my view is an intrinsic part of natural on-the-job training.</PARA></TALK.START>

This Bill allegedly seeks to address that problem. It can be argued reasonably that this skill level will inevitably develop and mature as a product of natural market forces and that natural market forces will be the engine room of innovation, change and improvement in skills. But the evidence thus far does not inexorably lead to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very compelling reasons for employers not to provide adequate training to their work force under an absolutely voluntary arrangement. Of course, an employer will weigh the benefits to his enterprise against the costs of training his employees. Whereas the costs to the economy as a whole are substantially the same as the costs to the enterprise, the benefits to the economy as a whole are substantially greater than the benefits to individual firms, particularly in Australia where we have such a mobile work force. Perhaps, instead of putting forward this legislation, that is something the Government ought to be looking at. One of the great difficulties of a mobile work force is that there is a very considerable resistance on the part of employers to train employees because inevitably the benefit accrues not to the employer who is doing the training but to an employer elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the balance that will be struck by an employer in terms of the level of training he is going to provide to his employees will not be the optimum; in fact, it will be below the optimum. The level of training he will give his employees will be exclusively an economic consideration-what is likely to bring the best benefit for the least dollars, not what is going to provide him with the best skilled work force. So inevitably the level of training will be below the optimum. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise it follows that when individual firms are forced into levels of training that might be optimum for the economy the benefits will not flow to the employer. The levels required are not commensurate with the cost to the individual company. Even though all firms, taken collectively, might experience gains from a higher level of training in the community or by skill enhancement, much of the gain to any individual firm will result from the endeavours and the level of training undertaken by other firms' outlays. So it is not an unreasonable proposition to put that at the end of the day a voluntary or market-driven scheme may create some disincentive. However, I quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray):</PARA>
<PARA> The Government favours this scheme partly because it will not penalise those companies which have recognised the value of training and invest in it accordingly. For firms that already train above the required minimum level it will have no direct financial impact. The Training Guarantee is in fact a charge on the failure to train. </PARA>
<PARA>While that may be so, the economic deficiencies or flaws in this legislation will mean that there will be no incentive for any firm to train staff above the threshold. In other words, no benefit will accrue to any individual firm and there will be no reward or incentive to train above the 1.5 per cent threshold. Once that percentage is arrived at, there is no economic benefit for any company to provide greater outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best example of the economic illiteracy of this proposition is the way that it is so selective and absolutely arbitrary. Those employers with a payroll of $200,000 or less will be required to make no contribution to the skills of the Australian work force. Interestingly enough, and perhaps cynically so, that represents 85 per cent of all of Australia's employers and 25 per cent of all Australia's employees. In other words, 25 per cent of Australia's work force is quarantined from further skill enhancement, further opportunities of acquiring talents, new abilities, new confidences and new levels of skills simply because the Government has made an arbitrary political decision to remove 85 per cent of employers from this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a political decision which does not have a shred of economic integrity whatsoever. Clearly, the decision has been made because this Government is not about offending, upsetting or antagonising 85 per cent of employers. Thus, as a result of a politically expedient decision, the Government has cast 25 per cent of the work force onto the scrapheap leaving those employees no opportunity to compete with employees of companies that come within the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of Hawke's great statement about putting Australia first. He said that he would be making no economically expedient decisions, that he would govern for all Australians, that if the hard decisions had to be made he would make them and that he would not opt for the soft option. He is the great economic rationalist. Does anybody really wonder why Peter Walsh retreated to the back bench?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Acting Deputy President, you can be certain that I am not supporting Senator Walsh. I am simply observing that he retreated because, to use his words, this Government did not have the guts to make the hard decisions, he retreated because, to use his words, this Government missed major opportunities for micro-economic reform in its third term. He said that he would have to wait and see whether or not it would have the courage and fortitude to make them in the fourth term. From what we have seen thus far, it does not. The Government has abrogated all the commitments, obligations and imprimatur given to it by the people at the last election. Without question, I know that we are going to have a fourth term of lost opportunities and then, no doubt, this Government will be driven into the wilderness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am no defender of big business, but let me say this: in terms of looking at the economic distortions in this legislation, big business will now be subsidising small business even more than it presently does. I quote from an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey:</PARA>
<PARA> Based on a survey of 2000 employers . . . expenditure on training increased as the number of employees increased (e.g. employers with an annual gross wages and salary of $200,000 or more [this is the threshold for liability under the Bill] spent an estimated 2.4% on gross wages and salaries while those with an annual gross wages and salary cost below this level spent an estimated 0.9% on training). </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, those to whom this legislation is directed are already spending 2.4 per cent and small business, which is excluded, is spending 0.9 per cent. What will that do? That will lead only to greater poaching. Take the case of two businesses which are opposite each other. Company A will have an obligation to provide a minimum level of funding to train its employees and enhance their skills. Company B in competition across the road will have no obligation to provide training and, therefore, its cost of labour per unit is going to be less. All that company B has to do is wait until company A has trained and skilled its staff, go across the road, offer the employees greater salaries for their greater skills-that cost of which is carried by company A-and put them on its payroll. So company B will be able to poach the skills at not cost to itself. This situation will result from a deliberate decision in this legislation made on the basis of crude political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects, this legislation is a windfall for some employers because it guarantees a pool of skilled labour paid for by one sector of the community for the benefit of another sector. While there might be some economic justification for deferral on the basis of hardship or longevity, there is no excuse in my mind for not having any even playing field. It could be argued that it is administratively possible to defer payment, on the basis of hardship, for training and the acquisition of a certain level of skills in the long term. But there is absolutely no logical economic explanation-and I beg the Minister to say something about this-for quarantining 25 per cent of the work force from the acquisition of skills. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, there is no incentive for companies to train above the threshold level. I imagine that it is not beyond the wit of this Government, although most other things are, to provide some sort of arrangement for companies to carry over credits. There needs to be a flattening out process. Companies which are going through certain economic circumstances need to be given an opportunity to operate with some continuity so that they can deal with the difficult economic climate with which we are presently confronted. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill should be referred to a committee for all the reasons which have been set out by my colleagues. I shall not retrace their argument but the anomalies have been adequately demonstrated by Senator Knowles, Senator Chapman and ever so many others during this debate. If this Government were serious about ensuring that we have equity, equality, an even playing field and an enhanced and skilled work force for all employers, it would have no reservations about or objections to referring this legislation to a committee that could look at the various anomalies which have been adequately pointed out. We have learned to understand all of this Government's ideological rigorous pursuits. The Government is determined to ensure that this legislation goes through in the face of those anomalies, notwithstanding the enormous economic difficulties that they will impose on a great many companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak at length in response at this particular stage. I think I will leave most of the argument for the committee stage. I will make a couple of points before going on to some of the matters raised by the Opposition. I think it has to be put on the record that the objective of this legislation is to increase skill output in Australia. If we are really dinkum about matching the world, there is obviously a necessity to do that, and the mechanisms provided in this legislation are very much geared towards ensuring that that happens. I think it was only the other day that I gave figures in the Senate about the levels of expenditure in education and research in this country. I noted that, whereas we may be standing in the top three worldwide on higher education expenditure on the public level, on the private level we are very far behind. So the mechanisms in this legislation are very much geared towards the longer term benefits of Australia in relation to the quality of our output, increased production, skill enhancement and job enrichment. That should be recognised by speakers in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specific problems have been raised by the Opposition. I think it is fair to say that one point was that the guarantee imposes a tax on a very small group of employers. The continuation of that point was that these costs should be borne by the community. As I have indicated, the community already bears a substantial cost for education and training through the public provision of education and training services. The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990 target those organisations that will be a direct beneficiary of improved training and recognise that the public sector has a role to play and that industry has to play a greater role in bearing some of the costs of the work-related training. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne made the point that small business will be exempt. In reality, the Government has come down with that exemption level for a number of reasons. If we were to look at the amount of money and the costs involved in that area in terms of the small businesses that are exempt, then cost efficiency is one argument that has been taken into account. Another reason is the enormous need for training services to be augmented. In the big business sector something like 60 per cent of firms with payrolls above the threshold spend nothing on formal training. A further reason to be taken into account is that small businesses, in providing or accessing training, will have a greater proportional burden to carry in terms of their productive capacity. So there needed to be a benchmark, and the one that the Government has come upon I think all sensible people will see as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> With the exemption of small business, of course, we have also made another small group of exemptions. It should be acknowledged that the thrust of the legislation is to encourage training schemes rather than to collect the levy. I think it is fair to say that the impetus that will be imposed and pushed throughout the community for higher training will also flow through to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid made some points about constitutional power and administrative costs. It should be recognised that administrative costs are expected to be about 0.5 per cent of the increase in industry expenditure on training resulting from the guarantee. It is fair to say that that is very much a small cost when we are talking about quite a substantial increase in industry expenditure on training-an increase expected to be somewhere between $600m and $800m. There is a need for business to commit itself, and the administrative costs are, as I said, at a very low level. Senator Reid also asked about constitutional powers. I do not know that Senator Reid actually questioned fully whether the Government had constitutional power to do this, but I think--</PARA>

<PARA> I will not say much more. Senator Watson clarified the particular point he made. I think that if I were to speak any longer I would be indulging in a lot of rhetoric. I will come back to the questions raised by Senator Reid on the constitutional power point in the committee stage. I close on the point that the Government obviously will not be supporting the Opposition's second reading amendment. We do not think that the matters raised in the course of this debate and particularly specific amendments raised by the Opposition merit this legislation going to a committee. It should be taken into account that there has been a great extent of consultation on the legislation in its draft form and that that consultation has been going on for some time. I think Senator Chapman mentioned that the concept had arisen some three years ago. The legislation and the concept have been out in the community for some time. The points raised by the Opposition in the Senate do not merit deferral of the legislation any further. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990 be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report by 31 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Sessional Orders which were adopted by the Senate in December last year, and which were to come into effect for any sittings of the Senate commencing from the beginning of this year, this legislation would have been one of the most obvious candidates for reference to a committee. I have no doubt that the new Senate Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills would have clearly identified that this legislation should go to a Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA> We have not yet had the experience of fully working out the new sessional order and that new practice for the Senate. I would imagine that this would be the appropriate time for such legislation to be referred to a committee. There has been a very strong division of opinion as to whether this legislation should proceed at all. That had to be resolved before it can usefully be referred to a committee. The Senate has now decided to proceed with the legislation, and it clearly requires very detailed committee consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Australian Democrats have made it very clear that they are absolutely hell-bent on getting this legislation through and into place as soon as possible. Because the Opposition has been aware of that likelihood, it has been considering what options would be available to it. Unfortunately, the new Sessional Orders have not come into place and, therefore, we have to move a special motion in order to get this into a committee. Clearly, from the second reading debate, a large number of deficiencies have been identified in this Bill. Many of those deficiencies cannot really be satisfactorily dealt with by amendments. There would probably be-I do not say hundreds of amendments-a large number of amendments which would lead to an endless debate in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with this legislation is that it has not been properly thought through. It has not been properly discussed with industry. I know the Government says that is has been discussing it with industry. The fact is that the original Bill was unveiled only at the end of last year. There has been the usual summer sleep that occurs in Australia, and then we got moved into an election mode, and the Bill has been suddenly resurrected and changes made to it as a result of some consultation, but I do not believe anything like the sort of consultation that would normally be required. </PARA>
<PARA> Whole areas of this legislation do require a great deal of evidence being given to senators to learn about how training is in fact conducted in Australia. One of the great deficiencies of this Bill is that it has just been assumed that training is desirable for everybody in any circumstances, and clearly there should be some examination of why it is that numbers of employers do not train or do not train as much as others. That really goes to the heart of this legislation, and that is something that a Senate committee would be very well able to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, whole major areas of this legislation have yet to be determined. Guidelines by the Minister are having to be brought in before this Bill can be fully brought into operation. Those are the sorts of things that ought to be before a committee for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Another great weakness of the Bill is the confusion that it creates in the tax position of a lot of these expenditures and a lot of the expenditures on training. This whole scheme seems to be being brought in without any real consideration of the impact and of the increased confusion in the taxation field. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I strongly support the motion that this Bill should go to a committee-and, of course, the appropriate committee is clearly the one I have mentioned: the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I voted for the second reading of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Training Guarantee Bill to enable them to go into committee. I entirely agree with what Senator Durack has said. This Bill, of all Bills that have come to us within I suppose the last month, is one of the best candidates for the new committee system. It would have been referred automatically, given the new Standing Orders, to a committee. As those Standing Orders are not operative until another two sitting days, we find that, in order to operate as we would two sitting days hence, Senator Durack has had to move a motion for the reference of this Bill to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The exposure draft of the legislation certainly was available earlier this year and was available generally in the hands of the representative bodies by about February of this year. As Senator Durack said, we then went into an election mode. Now we have the legislation coming before us. A number of contributions made during the second reading stage have raised in my mind considerable concerns about this legislation, concerns particularly with-how shall I put it?-the desire of the Government and all of us for greater training inputs that will not be achieved because of the unworkability of aspects of this legislation and its perceived injustice for certain groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential, if we are to have a combined and coordinated approach to ensuring greater training input, that we have people behind us, that we have support for that proposition and its implementation in practical form. Only last week a small organisation that had only just found out about the legislation approached me about it. It may be said that that is not the fault of the Government because it had its exposure draft earlier this year. Nevertheless, the fact is that a large number of small organisations are not aware of the implications of this legislation for their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the constitutional questions. I think that there are constitutional problems about this. The use perhaps of the corporations power and its implication for trade union activity in the future in the hands of a conservative government does concern me, as does the inequity of the type of taxation that is levied. What about the contributions of those firms that are highly computerised with high technology? A number of these things, of course, could be discussed by a committee, and I strongly support Senator Durack's motion and appeal to the Senate to have the legislation referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order in relation to the limitation of speakers in this debate to five minutes. As I understand it, the explanation for that is that my motion has been moved under standing order 115 after the second reading, which states: `After the second reading, unless the bill is referred to a standing or select committee, the Senate shall forthwith resolve itself into a committee of the whole', etc cetera. The five-minute time limit, as I understand it, is now being imposed under the new sessional order, which I understand is being brought into operation but which is in some sort of state of suspension or suspended animation-I would have thought practically no animation, frankly. The whole of that sessional order depends upon the fact that there is a committee set up-I suppose it has been set up-but that is assuming that the Senate is going to deal with the report of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following the report of the committee, the chairman or a member of the committee may move without notice a motion for the adoption of the report, according to subsection 4 of the sessional order. That subsection goes on to deal with the fact that amendments to the motion may be moved. At paragraph 7, the sessional order states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . upon a motion pursuant to paragraph  (4) or (5), a Senator shall not speak for more than 5 minutes, and at the expiration of 30  minutes--</PARA>
<PARA>for the whole debate. It seems to me that this limitation to five minutes has been based upon the assumptions that this new sessional order will be fully operational, which clearly it is not. Mr President, I would like your ruling as to how that five-minute limitation really comes into effect. </PARA>

It was assumed, when the sessional order was drafted, that there would be a selection of bills committee and we would be considering its report. This is a quite separate and old-established practice. Whatever the technical results of the peculiar procedure we adopted, surely the fairest thing would be to permit people to speak, by leave, for the usual time and not have an argument about a technicality resulting from a motion by the Minister to defer Wednesday sitting days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until the new system was introduced and adopted by the Senate, people could speak on such a motion for half an hour. We have not fully adopted the new system and it seems to me fair that they should be able to speak for the time they could before the system was adopted. When we adopt the new system, by all means go the new way; but we are in a transitional phase and I suggest that whatever the Standing and Sessional Orders say, it would be sensible to allow people, by leave, to speak for a reasonable time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I think we should press on with what is important in this issue and sort this out later. I do not think there is any doubt that the new rules apply, but we are not at that stage in this debate-we have not got the report back. I can restrict myself to five minutes in any event, in adding to the view that the details of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 must go to a committee to be investigated fully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine and Senator Durack have already referred to the fact that there has not been the sort of consultation in the community that the Government likes to think. The Government is out of touch if it thinks that the organisations and businesses which are being affected by this Bill know anything about it or have seen it. The big organisations which are involved in training certainly know about it. Does the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) seriously tell me that the religious institutions affected by clause 17 (b) fully comprehend the wording of that proposed section? There are a lot of questions that need to be asked about that. There are a lot of organisations which ought to have the opportunity to come and tell honourable senators what they think of that. We need to look at clause 17. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to discuss public benevolent institutions and why it is that the Government is restricting those clauses to those who are exempt under the Taxation Act or who can receive gifts which are tax deductable. Why only those? Does every other organisation which provides charitable services, with some paid staff, understand that it is excluded and does not get the benefit that the public benevolent institutions gets?</PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable senators to turn to clauses 25 and 26 and look at the number of ambiguities and questions there that need to be dealt with. What about clause 27, which I dealt with in some detail earlier when I spoke, and the amount of paperwork and detail involved?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister told us that the guidelines were not available. Clause 30 deals with three sets of guidelines that the Minister may make. They will not be available until January but the Bill is to operate from 1 July. People will be flying blind from 1 July until the guidelines are operational. Yet, under other clauses of the Bill, there are horrendous penalties which will fall upon anybody who-with the best will in the world in trying to make this mess work-finds that he has fallen foul of what the Commissioner finally decides it means. Then where will such people be? It will be the last straw that will break the backs of many businesses and send them into bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is not prepared to allow a reasonable time for this to be debated. How can he come to this chamber, following a period which includes December-Christmas, and the horrendous problems that many businesses have at that time-and January, the election season, and bring the Bill before the Senate and say that people have had an adequate time to look at it? We know, from the representations we have received just in the last couple of weeks, that people are only beginning to find out what is in this tax legislation. An enormous burden is going to be placed on so many who are already facing bankruptcy, as the Minister well knows. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 27 ought to go before a committee. If there is any purpose whatsoever in having committee analysis of Bills by this place, this is the one Bill that should go through it. Senator Harradine has very graphically just explained that what we are talking about is two days. I appeal to the Minister to adjourn the debate, if necessary, and invite his colleagues to understand the difficulties and complexities. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: the journalists who have written up this Bill as a great idea have read the second reading speech, and have read the concept that has been floated about for a long time. They have not read the detail of the Bill and appreciated what it actually means to a business that has eight or 10 employees and the additional burden it places upon such a business. It is not just the additional tax burden. What I am talking about is the additional burden. Most small businesses these days need 26 hours a day just to survive and try to keep their heads above water, without the additional paperwork that this Bill imposes upon them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise in support of the reference of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 to a committee. I believe the justification for sending this Bill to a committee has been demonstrated very significantly by the inability of the Government to adequately respond during the second reading debate to the many issues that have been raised by my colleagues on this side of the House. The issues are serious in terms of the inadequacy of the definitions and the extra burdens that will be placed on business. Obviously, there is a complete underestimation of the costs and inconveniences that arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government continually talks about the need for deregulation-to streamline activities, to make business more efficient-and here we have an added cost. Yet it does not satisfy the basic tenet of training-in other words, to improve the quality of training. There are so many unanswered questions. As suggested by my colleague Senator Durack, the best forum in which to debate this Bill is a committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said by most people, under the new Standing Orders this Bill certainly would have been sent to a committee. The Opposition accommodated Senator Robert Ray by not going ahead with setting aside a day in these four weeks of sitting so that the Government could get its legislation. Had we not accommodated Senator Ray, there would be no problems; we would have sent this Bill to a committee and everything would have been as it should have been. The Government is taking advantage of its negotiations with the Opposition. The Opposition gave the Government an assurance that we would allow the Standing Orders relating to the setting aside of that particular day to be waived during this four-week period so that the Government could get ready for the coming Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If small businesses, which frankly are just struggling to keep their heads above water, had understood the implications of this Bill, I assure the Government that it would have heard a lot more from them. It is only in the last few days that I, as an Opposition member, have heard from concerned businesses because it is only in the last few days that they have become aware of it. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus): is it a fact that it is only recently that he has been hearing from concerned small businesses? If the Minister has been hearing of these concerns as recently as the last few weeks or the last few days, it proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that the consultations have not been as great as the Minister thinks. If he has consulted with industry heads, it certainly has not reached the lower echelons. </PARA>
<PARA> While the principle of encouraging businesses to train their employees is very good, so many small businesses do not need to train. Let us look at a couple of the welfare services. I do not know whether they will be classed as public benevolent institutions. They certainly think they are, although they do not know whether they will be classed as such. Some of them have already folded because they say that the people whom they employ do not need training. If they employ trained sisters, the sisters do not need extra training. They do not need to spend money in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> So many questions are coming up. I have not spoken on the Bill but I will certainly take part in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government denies the Opposition the opportunity to send this Bill off to a committee when we have accommodated the Government by allowing that special day, Wednesday, to be set aside, it will be flying in the face of the goodwill the Opposition has extended to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage a number of facts ought to be established about the process that went on before the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990 and the Training Guarantee Bill 1990 arrived in the Senate. It may very well be that the Opposition has not had a close interest in this Bill for quite some time, but it is quite apparent that in the community there has been a process of consultation for more than two years. Basically, the process has been long and exhaustive. In December 1988 a discussion paper entitled Industry Training in Australia: The Need for Change, was circulated. Consultations with a whole range of industry organisations and peak bodies were undertaken on the basis of that discussion paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In May 1989 the Employment and Skills Formation Council canvassed a similar scheme to the one that was recommended. During the previous process-more than one year ago-small businesses were asked to make submissions to the Employment and Skills Formation Council.

Responses were made to those submissions and changes were made in accordance with some of the points put forward in those submissions. Honourable senators opposite should not come in here saying that there has been no consultation. They have been hibernating for the best part of two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specific points were raised about public benevolent institutions. I am informed that they were consulted. It should also be recognised that the exemption that applies to them is the same as that which applies under the fringe benefits tax legislation. A whole raft of points have been raised, but the core point made by those opposite is that people have not been consulted about this Bill. The reality is that there have been consultations and that responses have been received from both big and small business. Business organisations such as the Australian Chamber of Manufactures supported the definition of eligible training programs that Senator Reid was concerned about. Peak bodies support it, are relaxed about it. Senator Walters should acknowledge that while she has been hibernating for the last two years the rest of the world has carried on without her. The reality is that we have had consultations. They are a lot more relaxed than Senator Walters makes out in here. The Government feels that this legislation should go through, not only because of that long consultative process but also because the Opposition has not come up with anything substantive in the issues that it has raised specifically for amendment. This legislation should go though because there has been wide consultation on its implementation and wide notice of it given in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill 1990 makes technical amendments to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977. The amendments are necessary as a consequence of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory that the proposed Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission take over the operations of the Australian Legal Aid Office in the Northern Territory on 1 July 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It amends the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act in such a way as to ensure that part IV of the Act applies to officers of the Australian Legal Aid Office who transfer to the proposed Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission. Basically, the Australian Legal Aid Office staff should be offered a position in the new commission on terms and conditions at least as favourable as those under which they are currently employed. This has been the usual arrangement in the past when Australian Legal Aid Office staff have transferred to State commissions. The proposed amendment also ensures that staff transferring to the Commission are eligible persons for the purposes of division 3 of part IV of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the Bill. There is one comment, however, that my colleagues in the other place have made and it perhaps deserves repetition in this place. It is with respect to the drafting of the Bill. The Bill includes the Northern Territory as a State. It says that where the Bill refers to a State it shall include the Northern Territory. My colleagues have made the point that this is sloppy drafting and there are alternative ways to achieve the same end without simply fiddling around with the definition of a State. I am not sure how far back this practice goes, but at least it is found in the Ombudsman Act 1976, in the Public Works Committee amendments in 1981, in the supported accommodation assistance package in 1989, in the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Amendment Bill in 1989 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill in 1989. In conclusion, the Opposition supports this Bill and underlines the need for technically efficient and clear drafting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Vanstone on expressing her Party's support for the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill. She raised the question of drafting which no doubt will be answered very capably by the Minister. This is a further step in the provision of proper legal aid for people around Australia. I think it is an appropriate time to bring out the fact that this process really started with the Fitzroy Legal Service which was established in Melbourne and opened on 17 December 1972. The people who have been in charge of that centre are worth listing because they have adorned the profession over that time. There is Julian Gardiner who in 1980 was to become the first director of the Victorian Legal Aid Commission. There is Tony Lawson, Bebe Loft, Jon Faine, Tim McCoy, who unfortunately died at too young an age, Simon Bailey and the present director, Jeff Giddings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fitzroy Legal Centre typifies what lawyers ought to be all about. They represent not only people who are well off, but also those who could be called the coppertails of this world, the everyman and the everywoman who need legal aid desperately to vindicate their rights in the community. They have established a legal culture which is to be admired and bring credit to the profession in a way that is unique. The legal profession has been much criticised over the years and is criticised quite vigorously at the moment, in many ways unfairly. But within that context it is good to remember that there are people of great generosity, of great heart, people dedicated to what is best in the human spirit who staff legal centres like the Fitzroy Legal Service. This is an occasion to pay proper tribute to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to thank those members of the Senate who have contributed to the debate on this important Bill, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill. It marks a very important stage in the provision of legal services to, in this case, inhabitants of the Northern Territory, but it is part of a much wider process of reconstructing the various mechanisms by which such services are provided. It is a very important part of the social justice strategy of the Government and I know that it is supported by honourable senators from all parts of the chamber as we try to ensure that those who cannot afford to vindicate their legal rights from their own resources are assisted by the Commonwealth Treasury, by State treasuries and, indeed, by the profession in the vindication of those rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an important part of the social justice strategy of the Government and I thank those honourable senators who have indicated their support. I would particularly like to thank, in relation to this particular setting up of a Legal Aid Commission in the Northern Territory, Mr Daryl Manzie, whose personal intervention at various stages ensured the success of the project in the Northern Territory. I thank honourable senators for their supportive statements and wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Great Barrier Reef is one of those issues on which there is a bipartisan approach by the Government and the Opposition and always has been. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill is therefore supported by the Opposition. It proposes to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 by providing for the inclusion of several definitions which will clarify the operation of the marine park zoning plans which govern how the park may be used or entered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These changes are needed because of a decision by a magistrate in December last year involving a ferry operator who was taking tourists to Green Island without a permit. The provision of a tourist program requires permission but the operation and navigation of vessels does not. He said he was operating and navigating a vessel, not running a tourist operation. The decision by the magistrate is subject to appeal, but the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority does not wish to wait for the outcome of the appeal to clarify the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional regulations were gazetted in February 1990, but their effect is not certain. The other alternative is to amend the Cairns section zoning plan, but this would require the laying of the proposal before both Federal chambers. There is concern that in the estimated nine months or so that this could take there may be damage to the park from a big increase in visitors to the island using this loophole in the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has no objection to the amendment and the Queensland tourist industry, to my knowledge, does not oppose the Bill and neither do we. However, I would just say in passing that some concerns are being expressed about some aspects of maintenance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This related to permission granted by the Government to P &amp;O Australia Ltd, which had been given permission to dump rubbish. To my knowledge it was the only island resort entitled to dump rubbish in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that P &amp;O have ceased dumping and will dispose of the waste on the mainland for a two-month trial period which is to be monitored by the Marine Park Authority. I stress the importance of this, because this dumping, according to the department, presented significant environmental difficulties. That was contained in advice from the Authority to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It reinforced earlier advice about the effects of the existing sea dumping regime at Heron Island. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority was concerned primarily about the attraction of silver gulls and the predation by these birds on other seabird populations. There was also concern for human safety resulting from the sharks that are attracted to and consume the garbage and concern about the precedent for allowing dumping in other areas of the marine park. I must say I do hope that P &amp;O-which, as I said, is the only organisation allowed to dump in the park-will have a successful program of dumping the waste on the mainland and that after this two-month period dumping rights on the reef will cease. I have no doubt the Opposition and the Government will have a bipartisan view on that matter as well. But we certainly have a bipartisan view on this Bill and we support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Michael Baume's comments which, quite properly, are given in support of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. That reflects the bipartisan view of all those involved in the national Parliament that the Great Barrier Reef ought to be managed and protected to preserve its beauty, accessibility and the wonder of it for future generations not only of Australians, but also the inhabitants of the planet into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, there is no intention to change any of the zoning plans which are set down in the major Act, but it is intended to clarify the original intention of the Parliament which, quite clearly, was to ensure that certain activities are able to be undertaken only with permissions granted. There is a presumption that permissions are to be granted and regulation might go to the point of forbidding certain activities which may have a detrimental impact on the marine park of the Great Barrier Reef. I appreciate the support given by the Opposition and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of these two Bills relates to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, which agreement was the culmination of a landmark decision and negotiations by the Fraser Government. The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to bring certain other bounty Acts in line with that agreement to get rid of the bounty which is paid with regard to goods which are exported to New Zealand, again in accordance with that agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill seeks directly to prohibit the payment of a bounty on equipment or goods produced which will be exported to New Zealand, either directly or indirectly through another country. The Bill amends the Bounty (Books) Act, the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act, the Bounty (Computers) Act, and the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives Mr Prosser raised a concern as to whether goods which were transshipped through New Zealand, or off-loaded in New Zealand for distribution to other Pacific nations, would be exempt from the bounty. But the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), in his second reading speech, appears to state that the prohibition on the bounty will not extend to goods exported through New Zealand to those other destinations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes some technical changes to the existing bounty Acts to overcome omissions in the initial drafting of the legislation. An example is the amendment to the Bounty (Ships) Act. As the Act currently stands, only those direct material costs incurred by the shipbuilder for goods actually incorporated in the vessel or its modification are eligible for the bounty. This means in turn that there are a number of costs of consumables which are not eligible costs and this Bill corrects the anomaly by allowing bounty eligibility for the costs of consumables such as welding gas, welding rods and grinding discs. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, with regard to the Bounty (Books) Act currently the full bounty is not payable on the production run of a particular book until all books in that production run have been bound. This is a problem for producers who bind and put on hold and put onto the market only a proportion of the production run and keep the remainder in storage until a later date. This Bill provides for producers to submit bounty claims as each batch is bound. That should discourage the practice of small production runs merely to claim the bounty, where a larger production run would be more appropriate. We support that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices (Misuse of Trans-Tasman Market Power) Bill relates to the implementation of article 4 of the protocol to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement on the acceleration of free trade. The Opposition also supports this Bill but has some concerns which I think are worthy of being raised. The Acts which this Bill amends are the Trade Practices Act, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act, the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, the Evidence Act, the Federal Court of Australia Act and the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act. The 1983 agreement originally had a target date of 1995 for the establishment of free trade between the two countries. In 1988 a review of the agreement was conducted and it was decided to bring that date forward to 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand is now Australia's third largest export market after Japan and the United States of America, taking some 5.1 per cent of our total exports. Similarly, with Japan and the United States, Australia is one of New Zealand's largest export markets, taking 15 per cent of New Zealand's exports. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill can be seen as an interim step in the harmonisation of the business law. However, there are no provisions in the Bill which seek to establish uniform laws between Australia and New Zealand in the area of competition or anti-monopolistic provisions. Those things will not be considered until 1992. New Zealand is mirroring this legislation. The New Zealand legislation includes the Commerce Law Reform Bill and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the New Zealand Government is also confident of meeting the 1 July target. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious aim of closer economic relations is to allow free trade to exist between Australia and New Zealand. But there are a couple of reservations which are provided for which perhaps mitigate the concept of free trade. We simply raise them so that people are aware of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reservation is that the relevant goods must originate in Australia or New Zealand. In Australia the test to establish this fact is whether the last process of manufacture is performed in New Zealand and whether or not 50 per cent of the factory or work cost was represented by labour and materials of Australia or New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> A further reservation contained in the August 1988 protocol on trade and services excludes some sections of activity from the operations of closer economic relations. In Australia those sectors to be excluded represent industries such as the media, telecommunications, banking, airport services, domestic air services and coastal shipping. Many could argue that they are just the sectors which ought to be subject to and could benefit from further competition. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the beginning, the Opposition does support the Bill and recognises that to implement article 4 of the protocol it is necessary to get rid of the anti-dumping provisions and to deal with the question of market power in another way; in our case it is under the Trade Practices Act. This is the purpose of this Bill. The target date for the Bill of 1 July 1990 has been quite artificially deemed to be an important date. The Government seems to be taking the view that it is less important to achieve harmonised and uniform laws in the narrow context of competition than it is to produce legislation to meet this date. It is curious given that the protocol allows for the date to be altered, and of course 1992 now becomes the date for harmonisation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, disparities between our legislation and the equivalent New Zealand legislation. Here, upon the removal of anti-dumping measures, which will be the only sanction against predatory market practices, under our proposed section 46a of the Trade Practices Act and the New Zealand equivalent, section 36a of its Commerce Act, there is a disparity between definitions of what is market power. The difference means that it may be easier to substantiate a breach of competition provisions in Australia than it is in New Zealand. The Australian provision has a test of `substantial degree of market power', which has been held by the Federal Court to mean as little as 30 per cent, whereas in contrast the New Zealand test of `a dominant degree of market power' has been interpreted as meaning something in the vicinity of 80 per cent. In the Australian Bill the proposed section allows the court to determine the question of degree of market power by `inference from the conduct of the Corporation or any other person or from other relevant circumstances', but there is no equivalent provision in the New Zealand Bill. This disparity could well impact on the conduct and presentation of matters before the court. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other place the shadow Attorney-General raised concerns about the operation of the existing section 46 of the Trade Practices Act which regulates anti-competitive acts and market power. His concern was with the definition and meaning of `substantial degree of market power'. The section has been the subject of a review by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has recommended that the section does not need to be amended. The High Court of Australia has given guidance concerning application of the section in the Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd case where it was noted that the aim of the section was to protect consumers by protecting the competitive process. Professor Baxt of the Trade Practices Commission has implied that the cost and complexity of proceedings under section 46, and by extension the proposed section 46a, could deter its effective use by private parties. In the House on 17 May the responsible Minister, Mr Duffy, said that Professor Baxt's comments had been superseded by a review of the Trade Practices Commission following the Queensland Wire Industries case. Mr Duffy said:</PARA>
<PARA>The result of that review was that provision of a guideline on the workings of section 46, in line with Professor Baxt no longer calling for a review . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It will be interesting to monitor the judicial interpretation in light of the comments and the contrary view of the shadow Attorney-General that there is some need for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> As concerns the financial impact of the changed arrangements, $146,000 will be provided to the Trade Practices Commission for the employment of two extra staff. It seems a little ironical that, in trying to bring about trade which is freer than hitherto, we are in fact increasing the size of the bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA> With the replacement of the anti-dumping laws by competition laws comes the transfer in litigation costs. Whereas with anti-dumping laws the state has borne the cost associated with that litigation, under the arrangements which will be the order of the day when this legislation goes through the cost will be transferred to private parties. In his second reading speech the Attorney-General indicated that the Trade Practices Commission would take into account the expense that complainants would incur where necessary as private parties to commence proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> A few other matters are dealt with in the Bill concerning evidence, the admissibility of evidence and the need for amendments to allow for the reciprocal registration and enforcement of interim and final orders made in each court in a trans-Tasman market proceeding, which of course is most important. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall we believe that it is important that both the costs and efficiency of the proposed regime being introduced by this Bill against alleged anti-competitive practices should be closely monitored. The Opposition is of the view that it is crucial for the scheme to be scrutinised in the future to ensure that remaining administrative or market impediments to free trade and open competition are identified and then eradicated. It should thus be understood that this Bill is to be an interim measure to be reviewed in the context of the 1992 review on the harmonisation of trans-Tasman business law. </PARA>

Where capitalisation has been granted under the new scheme provided for under what will become the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Act, and the manufacturer who has sought and received capitalisation has not been an exporter to New Zealand but subsequently becomes an exporter to New Zealand, will that exporter now comply with the legislation that is before us in the particular and, indeed, with the protocol itself?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that does not really answer the problem. People who are presently exporters of yarn and are in receipt of a bounty are eligible for the capitalisation scheme. If such a person, having been eligible for the receipt of a bounty, subsequently becomes an exporter of yarn to New Zealand, is that to be construed in any way as there having been a bounty paid, in respect of the export, albeit in advance, by way of the capitalisation scheme, and therefore does it comply with this legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>

How is the Authority to deal with, firstly, the fact that a manufacturer exports to New Zealand? Secondly, in light of the discourse that we have had today, would the Authority consider, at the time of accepting the application for capitalisation, that it would require some undertaking that the manufacturer is, in fact, not going to export to New Zealand?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, that does not quite answer the question. The question I asked was: because at the time of working out the capitalisation the Authority is dependent upon the advice given by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer advises that he is exporting part of his capacity to New Zealand, must that not be taken into account so that no bounty is payable in respect of it in accordance with this legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>

Quite frankly, if one is entitled to capitalisation only where one is entitled to a bounty which is in fact being paid, and the amount does not change but simply the destination of the goods in respect of which the bounty was being or would have been paid, and that has been capitalised in advance, the Minister is saying that it is all a bit difficult to try to work out whether or not a part of that capitalisation was, in fact, paid in advance for a product which may end up in New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: How many applications has the Government received to date from People's Republic of China (PRC) students who are here with either refugee status or permanent resident status on humanitarian grounds? What extra resources has the Government made available to process the applications as promised by the former Minister, Senator Ray, who said-I think I can accurately quote what he said on 6 June-that if there were a substantial application rate we would need contingency plans to deal with them. In regard to the Minister's answer that students can apply on humanitarian grounds, is it not a fact that until the Government lists the People's Republic of China in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette as a country for which applications for special humanitarian status can be considered, the applications have no legal status?</PARA></TALK.START>

I would have to get specific numbers for Senator Hill. With regard to the extra resources needed in Australia to process them, I will get an answer for Senator Hill as soon as possible. We have put measures in place to allow PRC nationals to remain in Australia for the time being pending longer term decisions on their future. We have made provision for extensions of stay, for instance, granting permission to work until 31 January 1991 to all those students who were here in the period 4 June to 20 June 1989, whether legally or illegally. We have provided welfare grants to community organisations to provide advice and counselling to PRC nationals. Last year we provided $100,000 to the Australian Refugee Advisory Council and a further four special purpose grants totalling $142,200 were provided this year to Chinese welfare and counselling agencies in Sydney and Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a live action film version of the popular television cartoon series featuring the characters of Raphael, Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello whose mission in life is to assist the triumph of good over evil. The film is classified PG, for parental guidance. The four turtles played by actors in costume are ninja devotees helping a crime reporter clean up a subway gang responsible for a growing crime wave. Although there are many encounters between the turtles and members of the subway gang, as well as other assorted villains, the clashes between them are highly stylised. The Board considered that the ninja-style combat sequences incorporating implied blows to the body and fights with staves and other weapons were relatively discreet, if tonally strong. Injuries sustained did not go beyond occasional bruising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By recognising the violent tone of the film, the presentation of violence as a legitimate means to solve problems and its trivialisation of violence through humour, the board considered the impact of the depictions to be reduced by the strong fantasy element through the film, by the recurring comic touches, and finally by the positive resolution of the plot with good triumphing over evil and the delinquent youths seeing the error of their ways.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Ray in both his capacities, as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and as Minister for Defence. Is the Minister concerned that possible fishing or other violations could be taking place in the Fijian exclusive economic zone because no Royal Australian Air Force or Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion aircraft have conducted surveillance flights there since May 1987? Does this not undermine the effectiveness of the maritime surveillance regime in the South Pacific?

I am fairly certain the New Zealanders have had discussion on this matter. The Australian Government at this stage, though, has not made a decision to resume those particular surveillance flights. One would have to say that Australia is trying very hard to establish as normal a relationship with Fiji as possible. The big reservation from the Fijian Governments point of view is that we have not resumed any military aid to Fiji and nor do we intend to until the new Fijian constitution is brought down and that constitution is seen to be fair and equitable.

There well could be, I acknowledge, problems for Fiji in terms of fishing, or indeed drug importation, through the current lack of surveillance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Beahan for his continuing interest in this area. He raised a question the other day concerning the notional distribution of preferences as used in the Western Australian by-election on the weekend. As happened after the last Federal election, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was given a reference to investigate the conduct of the previous election and to report to the Parliament subsequent to that. That mechanism is very useful and productive and it has led to some quite substantive changes in the way elections are held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an issue which I have had to address in the last few weeks and I have had discussions with the new Chairman of that Committee. I have decided to give the Committee a reference, in as broad a term as the one given after the last election, so that it can look into the conduct of the election and also matters arising from it. I think the issue that Senator Beahan raised will probably fall within the responsibility of the Committee to scrutinise very closely.</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter on which I have had representations-that is, the question of queues at polling booths-will also be one which I am sure, having discussed it with the Chairman of the Committee, will be at the forefront of the Committee's deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that having continual post-election scrutiny by the Parliament is a very effective mechanism. It is one that, in many ways, takes the decision-making out of political hands and puts it into a consensus mechanism within the Parliament. For that reason, I was very pleased today to be able to write to Mr Brereton to inform him of my agreement to a reference given to that Committee so it can investigate the previous election.</PARA>

If authorised by the Government, does this meeting at head of state level signify a major change in direction of Government policy and contradict its earlier pledges to restrict such contact?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General, Mr Hayden, met the Palestine Liberation Organisation representative in Australia, Mr Ali Kazak, at Government House yesterday. This, of course, was recorded in the Vice-Regal notice in today's major newspapers. The Governor-General had advised the Government beforehand of his intention to meet Mr Kazak, who, of course, is an Australian citizen. Mr Hayden had previously met Mr Kazak in Mr Hayden's former capacity as Foreign Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This meeting does not signify any change in the Government's policy on the Middle East or its attitude to the PLO and it is entirely consistent with the Government's policy on contacts with the PLO. The Australian Government acknowledges that the PLO represents the opinion of a significant portion of Palestinian people and must be involved in negotiations towards settlement of the Middle East dispute. However, the Government does not recognise the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 December 1988, Senator Evans announced that statements made by the PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat, on the previous day in Geneva had satisfied the Australian Government's three conditions for direct dealings with the PLO. These were, firstly, that the PLO expressly accept Israel's right to exist without any accompanying qualifications; secondly, that it renounce all forms of terrorism; and thirdly, that it accept the United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government does not recognise the state of Palestine, proclaimed by the Palestine National Council in 1988. The Government has made it clear that the question of Australian recognition of a Palestinian state will arise only in the context of an overall peace settlement. As the Government recognises states, not governments, recognition of the PLO is not a relevant consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 the Palestinian Information Office was established in Australia. In March 1989 Senator Gareth Evans announced that the Government had no objection to this office being called the Palestinian Liberation Organisation Office, thus acknowledging its representative status without conferring diplomatic or consular status. The Australian Government representatives maintain contacts with the PLO up to and including ambassadorial level. Ministers can avail themselves of opportunities for meeting with PLO officials as they arise, as have at least two members on the Opposition front bench over the last two years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that there is this sort of break-out of opposition in the chamber. I was saying that on 2 March this year the Prime Minister announced Australia's ratification of ILO Convention No. 156 on workers with family responsibilities, which makes it a fundamental objective of policy to enable people with family responsibilities to work as far as possible without conflict between their employment and those family responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following ratification, a work and family unit is being established in my Department, the Department of Industrial Relations, to ensure that the interests of workers with family responsibilities are addressed as part of the award restructuring process. Part time and flexible working arrangements will be one of the main issues to be addressed in that unit. While more flexible working time arrangements, including part time work, are desirable, it is most important to ensure that such arrangements introduced as part of the award restructuring process should not cut off part time workers from career paths and industry training. The Government has put it to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the introduction of more flexible working patterns should not operate against the interests of particular groups such as women, who are often the predominant users of part time work.</PARA>
<PARA> In practice this means that clear distinctions should be made between part time work with pro rata conditions and casual work, and that casual work in particular needs to be addressed in a way that prevents abuse and protects the interests of workers and the long term adaptability of the work force. The Government has also intervened in the hearings of the parental leave test case in support of the Australian Council of Trade Union's claim for unpaid parental leave to be made available for both fathers and mothers. It has argued that current provisions assign family responsibilities primarily to women, reinforcing their traditional role and leaving them at a disadvantage in the labour market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report to which Senator Lees refers and also a press report of 21 May, which might be the original source of this story. The first thing to be made clear is that I am informed that we cannot get any accurate information as to the basis of the figures presented in the articles. For instance, the basis for the 1985 figures is unclear. In 1989 the total percentage of women on statutory boards was 19 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has an ongoing commitment, as has just been spelt out by Senator Cook, to increase the number of women in positions on Commonwealth boards and advisory bodies and elsewhere in the workplace. That commitment is being pursued and fulfilled on a number of different levels. In 1988, for instance, the national agenda for women specifically concentrated on the need to increase the number of women appointed to boards. This followed directly from the Government's 1983 commitment to a policy of equitable representation of women on government boards and preceded an August 1988 resolution passed unanimously by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to set a minimum standard of 25 per cent representation of women on boards and authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> This commitment was reinforced by the Prime Minister in February last year when he reminded Ministers and others of this policy and of the fact that the Government had appointed a consultancy, announced last year, to the Office of the Status of Women to look at ways of increasing the appointment of women to government boards.</PARA>
<PARA> Pursuing this commitment even further, Cabinet Office has established a monitoring system, tracking all Cabinet appointments. The percentage of women on statutory boards now stands at 19 per cent, compared to 12 per cent 12 months ago. Monitoring is also being set up within Commonwealth departments to allow within those departments an accurate measurement of non-Cabinet appointments to ensure that equitable representation of women is achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always difficult to look at one quarter's figures and draw conclusions from them, but I must say that when taken in conjunction with the last quarter's figures, the figures released today are encouraging. Senator Schacht particularly asked about exports. In the recent March quarter national accounts figures, gross domestic product grew by 1.8 per cent. Of this, 0.2 per cent was contributed by net exports. Exports contributed one per cent to the rise, and this was partially offset by a significant growth in imports of 0.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. It follows his incredible response to Senator Schacht's dorothy dix question. Is the Minister aware that today's national income figures reveal that continuing increases in activity by governments have provided more than 90 per cent of the increase in gross national expenditure over the last 12 months, with the March quarter showing an 11 per cent real rise in governmental capital spending but a 2.4 per cent real fall for the private sector, mostly involving a sharp fall in new equipment purchases, while government consumption expenditure rose by 1.5 per cent, far greater than the 0.9 per cent rise for private sector expenditure, which was despite a 2.1 per cent rise in wages, salaries and supplements which could have been expected to encourage a rise in private sector expenditure. As high levels of Government spending appear to be the reason for the economy's present rate of economic growth at a time when the private sector is being hit harder and harder by the Government's massive high interest rates, what will be the impact on economic growth of promised restraint on government spending if in fact this ever takes place?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the first place, Senator Michael Baume asked this question, as he put it, in a follow-up to the answer I have just given to Senator Schacht. It was a good try at a follow-up but Senator Baume cannot have listened to the answer I gave to Senator Schacht. In drawing the dichotomy between the government sector and the private sector, first let me make the point that the government sector is not, as a rule, in the export business; the private sector is, and there has been a growth over the last quarter, and the last two quarters, in export performance. I gave those figures to the Senate in answer to the question directed to me by Senator Schacht.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well to huff and puff here in the Senate about government expenditure but let me just make the point that, though I agree with Senator Baume that there has been a 1.5 per cent increase in government consumption expenditure for the March quarter, the Commonwealth government expenditure did not increase.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is the most dangerous interjection I have ever heard Senator Walters make on behalf of the State of Tasmania.

Perhaps it will be in the Hansard and it will be very useful to the Commonwealth when that Premiers Conference comes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To go back to the answer, a number of one-off factors are involved, and the particular one is increased spending by State and local governments. That increased spending has largely been on law and order services, which are matters frequently raised with a fair degree of enthusiasm by Opposition senators in this place, and, secondly, expenditure by State governments and local governments on safety matters involving not only roads and motor vehicle safety but a whole range of safety issues. If honourable senators annualise the six-month figures-that is, the last two quarters-they will see that the growth in government consumption is 2.7 per cent annually, which is a very moderate outcome compared with previous years.</PARA>

He told me that recently the South Australian Health Commission has revealed that the incidence of lung cancer amongst males in South Australia is declining but amongst females is markedly increasing. We know that there is no safe level of tobacco use. Tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. In 1987 there were some 18,000 tobacco-related deaths. I know that Senator Peter Baume also takes a keen interest in this matter and assents to those terrible figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government is very concerned about tobacco consumption and has introduced major initiatives to address this problem, including the banning of smoking in Commonwealth buildings and on domestic airline flights and prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in the electronic and print media. The Government is currently conducting a $2m national media campaign to reduce smoking by young women across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of concerns that have been expressed in the United States that cigarettes are readily available to young children, particularly through cigarette-vending machines, even though this is against the laws of that nation. I understand from various media reports that the United States Secretary of Health is proposing to ban altogether the sale of cigarettes from vending machines. I happened to hear the AM program to which Senator Maguire refers and I managed to get a transcript of it just before Question Time. In the transcript of the AM program some days ago, Martin Devell reported from the United States:</PARA>

<PARA> We must put an end to the time when any child with a handful of change can commence the slow motion suicide that has taken the lives of millions of Americans. We must put an end to the sacrifice of our children on the tobacco merchant's altar of profit.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Sullivan also directly attacked the tobacco companies for promoting tobacco addiction amongst groups in society, in particular, women. He had this to say:</PARA>

<PARA>That is a very telling way of putting the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia regulation of the sale of cigarettes, including through vending machines, is the responsibility of States and Territories. I understand that it is an offence for cigarettes to be sold to children under a certain age, generally 16 years, and that this applies to sales from vending machines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this question probably comes more correctly under my title of Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. However, to Senator Cooney's first question: yes, there are meatworks which are in liquidation which currently owe inspection fees to the meat inspection service. On current information available to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, a total of 10 meatworks Australia-wide are understood to be in liquidation. Three are owned by one company with a total debt on inspection fees of $315,644.47. The remaining inspection works owe, in total, $200,644.62 in unpaid inspection fees. When the liquidations are completed, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service expects to recover a significant amount of the money that is owed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the steps that the Government proposes to take in the future, in so far as newly registering meatworks for export are concerned, the money that is owed for these meatworks will have to be paid before the new owners can actually exercise an export licence. As well as that, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is currently undertaking a major review of its debt recovery procedures. A major issue addressed in the review is the timing of action to be taken when a debt becomes payable. The bills are not sent until 28 days after the debt has been incurred, there is 28 days to pay, and there is a considerable delay before inspection services might be withdrawn. That is to be reviewed. The joint Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service-industry review of the meat fee for service slaughter floor scheme-I am sure all honourable senators know that by name-is currently being conducted. That will play a major role in speeding up the payment of debt.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is yes. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released catalogue No. 5651.0 headed `Company Profits: Australia March Quarter'. That was a survey of mining industry profits. The main feature of the Statistician's report is that the value of company profits in the mining industry was $1,517m in the March quarter 1990-a rise of 25 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms on the December quarter 1989, and a rise of 89 per cent on the March quarter in 1989. That is to say, the increase in the nine months ended March 1990 was 64 per cent over the same period one year ago. There are several reasons for this strong growth-increased production of petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and, to a lesser extent, increased production of coal. There was a high growth in exports of these commodities in the March quarter, with coal rising by 20.6 per cent in real terms over the December quarter 1989 and petroleum and LNG rising by 62.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The growth in the coal industry is expected to continue as forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE). Its March quarter 1990 report suggests that total coal export revenue is expected to be up by 11 per cent in 1990-91. ABARE has attributed growth in the production of coal in the first half of 1989-90 to the benefits of revised work and management practices being increasingly realised. Honourable senators will be aware that this major reform was undertaken through the Coal Industry Tribunal by this Government and it is now reaping some considerable benefits for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> ABARE has also reported that deregulation of the crude oil market in Australia, coupled with strong overseas demand for the premium local crude oil, has boosted our exports.

I further ask the Minister whether Australia is now promoting the idea that UNHCR funding should be based on an available resources approach rather than a needs basis, the logic of such an approach being that there is a limited amount of resources, so if the refugee population increases, the per capita amount going to refugees must fall. Finally, I ask the Minister whether the Government's long term aim with this strategy is to whittle away at the mandate of the UNHCR and whether he believes that such a position is worthy of Australia as one of the rich industrialised countries, at a time when over 15 million people in the world are currently refugees and the number is increasing rather than decreasing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard this as a fairly cheap and grubby question because Senator Vallentine tries to answer the first two parts of the question by having an assumption in the third part as though the first two parts are true. I really would urge Senator Vallentine to construct her questions a little more fairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the general question of UNHCR, there is no doubt that in the last couple of years there was an enormous budget blow-out. Unfortunately, the High Commissioner resigned and for many months people have been travelling without authorisation on first class air fares. It is not a fact that any organisation can always be funded on the basis of `needs'. It is given a budget and it is expected to stick to it. What has happened is that a $38m deficit of last year has had to be rolled over into this year's budget. That is quite a difficult thing for an international organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no substance to Senator Vallentine's allegations that Australia is in any way trying to belittle or undermine the UNHCR. We have historically been very strong supporters of the organisation. We have consistently supported the High Commissioner. The current High Commissioner has the total confidence of the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In case anyone should read into Senator Vallentine's question that this country is not doing enough in terms of refugees, let me remind honourable senators that we have the highest per capita intake of refugees of all countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Let me remind Senator Vallentine that when we went to the Geneva conference last year, as all the other prissy moralistic countries were putting their hands up saying, `Of the 55,000 long term people in the camps we will take 50, aren't we good, we will take 120', the only country that did not put a number on it, naturally, was Switzerland. Everyone else said, `We will take 140'. What did Australia do? We said, `We will take 11,000 in three years'. It looks as though we will be able to almost deliver that amount in two years. I say to Senator Vallentine that the general view in the community that this Government or previous governments have been heartless in the area of refugees is false. We have nothing to be ashamed about at all. When Senator Vallentine talks about there being 15 million refugees around the world she happens to be wrong. There are 15 million displaced people around the world. The definition of refugees is something that must be protected. Senator Vallentine's question does not protect it because her question talks about people who have been displaced from Afghanistan. Not all of those people are refugees-some are, some are not.</PARA>
<PARA> The biggest questions that the UNHCR is trying to tackle at the moment is the proper definition of who is a refugee and how we can protect genuine refugees. It does a good job in my view. It is entitled to proper financial support. It does not have an unlimited entitlement to financial support. It must have good management practices. It must manage the resources it is given properly. It is very easy to argue that in part of 1988 and early 1989 it did not do so. This may have led to Senator Vallentine's assumption that in some way the rest of the world is trying to undermine or dismantle UNHCR. They are not; they are just trying to put proper procedures in place.</PARA>

The question was in two parts. One related to the transfer of funds to the IRA and the second related to the processing of visa applications. I am able to advise the Senate that, on the question of funds being transferred to support, for example, the IRA, the Australian law prohibits persons in Australia from giving money for the purposes of supporting hostile activities in other countries such as seeking to overthrow a foreign government or by the use of violence, causing the public in a foreign state to be in fear or suffering, death or injury.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 May Senator Zakharov asked me a question-which seemed to excite more emotion than the national account figures-about the design of the five dollar note. I have been supplied with the following response: Apart from its broader community contacts, the Reserve Bank of Australia, which advises on the design of the notes, has long had a design panel whose advice it seeks on all aspects of the design of Australian currency. This was the case with the original notes in the decimal series issued in 1966, the five dollar note issued in 1967, the $50 note issued in 1973, and the $100 note issued in 1984. The panel which helped select the design themes for the proposed new series of notes commenced its work in 1984, and comprises Mr Gordon Andrews, a designer; Mr Philip Cox, an architect and designer; Janet Dawson, the artist; and Miss Patricia Lahy, an academic psychologist. The panel has operated within a general understanding that the Queen's portrait would feature on one note. As in 1966, this was determined to be the lowest denomination note on issue. When the then Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr H. C. Coombs, announced the design details of the decimal series in 1966, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>No instructions were given to the designers on the themes and portraits that they should adopt other than the specification of the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth for the front of the $1 note.</PARA>
<PARA>That was then the lowest denomination note. In selecting design elements for other notes, which will be announced in due course, special attention will be given to the role of women. In fact, the new series will honour more women than was the case with the series to be replaced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked a question by Senator Boswell on 24 May relating to the involvement of a Qantas Airways Ltd-Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd consortium building a cruise vessel to operate in north Queensland. As part of that question I was asked whether the Fijian Government was providing any sort of financial assistance for construction of the vessel. The reason I have delayed answering the question until now is that that is the one part of the question that I have not yet been able to obtain an answer for. I will give the Senate what I have to this point in time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that QH Tours Ltd, a wholly-owned tour wholesaling and tour operating subsidiary of Qantas, was invited to participate in a joint venture cruise operation from Cairns with the Captain Cook Cruises group of companies in 1989. After extensive evaluation of the proposal, QH Tours agreed to the joint venture. QH Tours extensively markets tour products to Australia in the United States of America, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, Europe and South East Asia through its network of overseas offices. By bringing together Captain Cook Cruises and QH Tours the joint venture combines the expertise of two companies acknowledged worldwide as major contributors to inbound tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> The 150 passenger luxury cruise ship Reef Endeavour, presently under construction, fills a unique market niche in far north Queensland. The Reef Endeavour will be larger than all the vessels currently operating regular services on the Great Barrier Reef, and will operate out of Cairns. It is believed that the venture will greatly enhance tourism to far north Queensland, generating some 10,000 passengers per year, most of whom will be from overseas. The project is therefore in line with Qantas's strategy to develop additional traffic to northern Australian gateways.</PARA>
<PARA> The joint venture partners' extensive experience in tourism indicates that the planned global promotion of the vessel will attract greater international interest in the Barrier Reef region. Consistent with normal practice, the joint venture partners contracted a ship design company, Ship Design and Management Australia Pty Ltd, a Melbourne based company, to design and build the vessel. Ship Design and Management Australia Pty Ltd sub-contracted the Suva shipyard in Fiji to construct the vessel. It is not known at this time whether any subsidy was paid to the Suva shipyard by the Fijian Government. It appears that we can rule out the idea that any specific subsidy was paid for the construction of this vessel, but there may be a general subsidy paid for this kind of industry in Fiji. We are still finding out whether that is the case. Equity participation by QH Tours in the joint venture is being internally funded without the need to draw on any additional capital from Qantas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 May Senator Walters asked me a question concerning facilities at Parliament House for Commonwealth car drivers. Specifically, Senator Walters asked whether a room could be provided in this building in which the drivers could escape the cold weather and make themselves a cup of tea. As background to this matter, it may be of assistance to the Senate if I describe the circumstances under which Commonwealth cars are provided at Parliament House for use by senators and their staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cars that wait at the Senate entrance are commonly known as the parliamentary shuttle. On sitting days the shuttle normally operates from 7.30 a.m. until one hour after the Senate rises. The number of vehicles on the shuttle varies during the day according to expected usage. For example, between 7.30 and 9 a.m. 20 cars may be required. Between 9 a.m. and midday three cars are usually sufficient. At 10 p.m. 20 cars would normally be called to convey senators away from Parliament House after the adjournment.</PARA>
<PARA> While the shuttle operates throughout the day, individual drivers are normally required to remain part of it for no more than two or three hours before being relieved. It is the responsibility of Comcar to organise relief for its drivers for meal and tea breaks. It is Comcar's management policy that drivers on the shuttle are to remain with their vehicles. To provide a room to which drivers could retire would effectively abrogate the Comcar policy. It may help to allay Senator Walters's concern for the drivers' welfare to know that all Commonwealth drivers are provided with photographic identity cards which enable them when they are relieved to use the facilities of Parliament House, including the staff cafeteria.</PARA>
<PARA> The Speaker and I discussed this matter at our weekly meeting this morning, and we determined that we will ask the Clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives to discuss the issue further with Comcar management.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following matter is a matter of public importance in Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Hawke-Keating Government to secure real increases in Australian family living standards over their entire period in office as a direct consequence of their failed economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>For seven lean years, for seven hard years, the families of Australia have been afflicted by a government which has steadily, remorselessly, relentlessly, heartlessly and deliberately driven their living standards and their prospects into the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1990 a clear and definite majority of Australians voted against, voted to reject, voted to replace the Hawke-Keating Government. A mere 39 per cent of them voted for the Hawke-Keating government on their first preference. Even with the cynical second preference strategy of Senator Richardson-itself based on driving down family living standards by the pursuit of the so-called Green vote at the cost of sustainable economic growth and forgoing projects which could have been achieved in an environmentally acceptable fashion and could have yielded real economic benefits for all Australians-the Hawke-Keating Government still found that fewer than 50 per cent of the Australian people were prepared to support its return. However, given the vicissitudes of our electoral system, the majority of Australians who voted against the Hawke-Keating Government are now sentenced to another three years of continuing economic and social misery. </PARA>
<PARA> What lies ahead is not hope; what waits in prospect is not improvement; what stands before us is not relief but, rather, more of the same and then yet more as this Government's economic policies, which have so manifestly failed, remain unchanged and the magnitude of the failure simply grows and grows. Those braver souls who dare to criticise or to suggest a better alternative-the likes of Senator Button-find themselves rounded upon by the Blaxland bully, flayed and castigated, abused and hung out to dry while Labor's nominal leader wimps and snivels, incapable of providing leadership a jellyback in need of a spine transplant, according to Senator Walsh-a man well placed to know, brave enough to speak up, courageous enough to confess and, above all, too honest to put up with it any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The story of the failure of the Hawke-Keating Government, however, is not written in the raw economic statistics alone. Under the Hawke-Keating Government we have a consumer price index increasing by 8.6 per cent annually; a 26 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the March 1990 quarter; a 25 per cent fall in annual dwelling approvals, accompanied by an 11 to 12 per cent fall in housing loans; record interest rates of 16 3/4 to 17 3/4 per cent for home loans, 18 7/8 per cent to 19 7/8 per cent on the prime rate, and up to 24 and 25 per cent for smaller credit facilities; and record foreign debt, which in the last quarter of 1989 hit the staggering figure of $147,734m. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's failure, rather, is written in the record of the lot of Australia's ordinary families, that majority of whom voted for the coalition parties but two months ago. It is told in the hundreds of thousands who cannot afford a house; the young people, of whom Senator O'Chee will speak later in this debate, condemned as the first generation of Australians whose standards of living will be less than the generation which went before them; the elderly, of whom Senator Patterson will speak later in this debate, whose health, security and welfare have been mercilessly ravaged by this Hawke-Keating junta; the small family businesses and farms who are so crippled by the deliberate Hawke-Keating strategy of high interest rates that they are going under in record numbers-in their tens of thousands. The Government's failure is told not in the statistics but in the woe, the misery, the distress of thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of Australian individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us start by first examining the raw data about family living standards under the Hawke-Keating Government. Let me take housing as my first example. Home loan affordability is, according to the statistics put out by the industry itself, now at record lows. Fewer Australians can now afford to own their own home than has ever been historically the case-certainly in postwar Australia. It is an achievement of the Hawke-Keating Government that fewer Australians can now afford their own homes than has been the case in the lifetime of almost any member of this Federal Parliament. Home loan repayments are up by 30 per cent over the course of the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Australian Financial Review reported on 5 December 1989 a study undertaken by the Research Policy Centre at the University of New South Wales under the heading `Housing Costs Up 50 per cent In Hawke Era, Uni Study Shows'. It points out that the huge increases in housing costs fall primarily upon younger families in Australia. The study calculates that, on average, the increases in house prices and interest rates have led to families with post-1986 mortgages, estimated by the study to be at least 70 per cent of those with mortgages, paying out an additional $48 a week in repayments over the past seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the publication by the Real Estate Institute of Australia in October 1989 entitled Australia's Declining Housing Affordability, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has witnessed a decline in housing affordability in recent times which threatens its traditionally high level of home ownership . . . Interest rates are clearly the single most important factor affecting housing affordability. </PARA>
<PARA>How can Australian families, however described, be formed, nurtured, developed and turned into the building blocks of the future if people in a family situation simply cannot afford a roof over their heads, simply cannot afford a house, a home, a reference point, some security? We find even today that the May 1990 bulletin of the Australian Housing Industry says:</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the focus of government so far has been on crisis management rather than a coordinated response to the problems of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Nowhere is that more manifest than in this Government's lamentable and indeed almost criminal failure to address the housing situation as it affects young families. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take, for example, a second area-the Government's record in relation to the burden of tax. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in its publication Families and Tax in 1989, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Average tax rates have risen between 1976-77 and 1988-89 for all individuals and families with the exception of those on very high incomes and some low income families with children . . . In 1988-89 dollar terms, the same AWE family is now paying $30.80 per week more tax than they did 12 years ago compared to the twice AWE single person who is paying $18.88 more and the single person on four times AWE who is paying $105.32 less. </PARA>
<PARA>What this Government has done again in the words of that Institute of Family Studies publication, is bring about a situation in which `since 1984-85, real disposable incomes have fallen sharply for all income units dependent on one income'. In terms of the immediate situation of the formation and establishment of families in Australia, it will be taking place in a period in which family income will be single income. That is the record of achievement of the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take a third example, that of the management of debt. In April 1989 the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC), the Government's own advisory body, in its publication Economic and Social Implications of Consumer Debt, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The last decade has seen a strong increase in the level of consumer debt relative to household disposable income and a doubling in the debt servicing ratio. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to identify home mortgages as the major component of that problem and at least 100,000 Australian families that may be, in its words, `overcommitted' in the sense that they carry heavy consumer credit and other fixed commitments relative to incomes. It pointed out that some low income families pay 9 per cent or more of their gross income on consumer debt interest alone. EPAC went on to point out the substantial increase in consumer, business and personal bankruptcies which have been the focus of several questions asked in the chamber recently by Senator Boswell and others.</PARA>
<PARA> But even if one can get a home and service a loan, one may want one of those other aspects quintessential to life for many Australian families, for example, a family car. Yet we see in today's Australian newspaper vindication of the claims that Senator Button's policies-so-called Button car plan-cost each Australian car buyer at least $4,000 per car. Even in 1992 it will cost $3,200 per car more than it should cost unless this Government takes the steps necessary to manage the Australian economy properly. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the record of the Hawke-Keating Government. But what has been the rhetoric of the Hawke-Keating Government and what have been its promises to the people and families of Australia? The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his 1984 policy speech said:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government sets the welfare of the Australian family as its top priority.</PARA>
<PARA>God help us as to what its bottom priority was, because the betrayal, the devaluation, the dishonouring of that particular statement is absolutely manifest. In the same policy speech, the same man-the man rejected by the majority of the Australian electorate last March-said:</PARA>
<PARA>What concerns the ordinary Australian family is that there should be jobs available now for parents and in the future for their children; that they can purchase their own homes at a reasonable cost and not have to face crippling interest payments . . . above all, that every Australian family has the opportunity to maintain and improve its standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the promise made and that was the promise that was devalued and dishonoured. In the same policy speech the same man-the rejected leader-said:</PARA>
<PARA>We pledge ourselves to bring home ownership once again within the reach of ordinary Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the third lie in the series-the trifecta of untruths in that particular policy speech. Of course, we all remember that this policy speech was succeeded by yet another-the 1987 policy speech-in which the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>Not content with having devalued that promise, having failed to fulfil that promise, and having presided over the increasing number of young Australians for whom a home is a park bench, a gutter, a youth refuge, the open air or the beach; by 1989 in his speech to the Australian Council of Social Service the Prime Minister had the temerity, the gall and the hypocrisy to say this in relation to child poverty:</PARA>
<PARA>Since our re-election we have acted with determination to reach that goal-and we reached it ahead of target. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nobody in this country-other than the resident who shuttles between Kirribilli House and the Lodge and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who shuttles between his four-storey terrace in Elizabeth Bay and the front gate of the Lodge to make sure that the building is being kept in good repair for his eventual occupancy-who actually believes that any of the problems of youth homelessness and the family distress which arises from that have been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister told interviewers in May this year that there was going to be an increase in family living standards under his Government. Senator Button, who once again was seized with a bad attack of honesty-an unusual seizure for members of the Labor Party Ministry to suffer-actually came into this chamber and said, `Well, perhaps that is not going to be achieved. It all depends how you measure family living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I tell the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who will reply to this matter of public importance, that I know how to measure family living standards. I measure them by going out onto the streets in Sydney and seeing what happens to the kids on the streets in Sydney. I measure them by the number of people that come into my office who cannot afford a home. I measure them by the social indicators of distress, family breakdowns, poverty, domestic violence and real personal anguish. I do not need the statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; I do not know the casuistry; and I do not need the sophistry of the Parliamentary Secretary or his superior. What I know is what I see, and what I see in this country is a less fair, a less equitable, a less just and a less decent society than was the case when this Government came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> I see a Prime Minister who told people, when interest rates were 13.5 per cent in April 1985, `There will be, I would expect, a significant lowering of levels of interest rates', but then they went up to 15.5 per cent. In March 1986 the same man said `We will be able to enjoy permanently lower interest rates', but they went up to 16 per cent. In July 1987, he said, `Interest rates are falling and under Labor will continue to fall', but they went up to 16.5 per cent. In January 1989 the Prime Minister said, `Yes, interest rates are going to fall', but they went up to 17 per cent. This is a man whose capacity to tell the truth to the Australian people and whose capacity to provide the sort of leadership that is required in Australia is so flawed that it is no wonder the majority of people in Australia voted against his Government on 24 March. </PARA>
<PARA> The unidimensional nature of Labor's economic policies, its excessive-indeed, its almost obsessive-reliance on high interest rates has been a failure. It has applied the tourniquet of high interest rates so tight that, rather than merely slowing the pulse, it has driven the life out of the economy and, indeed, out of the very heart of Australian families. Its failure to curb its own excesses, to stand up to the demands of its powerful mates-its effective controllers-in the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who believe that more and more can be extracted from our economy without real meaningful and sustained increases in productivity, is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, in putting forward its family action plan at the last election and in Dr Hewson's National Press Club address given just a few weeks ago on 16 May, has identified the critical areas of necessary reform, such as micro-economic reform. We want more than an offer of Senator Collins' resignation; we actually want to see something achieved. We want to see real micro-economic reform instead of bodgie deals with the television companies or interference with the merger plans of the ANZ Bank and National Mutual. We want to see a real start on tax reform. We want to see real sustained development; not the rhetoric which we have been fed and which has so manifestly failed the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot go on like this and there is no way that Australian families should have to keep putting up with it. Unless the Government changes its ways and its policies and, above all, accepts responsibility for the families of Australia, this country will be neither the lucky country nor even the clever country: we will be, under the Hawke-Keating Government, the hopeless country.</PARA>

He will probably come back and perform better than many other people in the Opposition, as he has over the last few years. I am saying that I am sorry because this was a matter of public importance written in the hope that some disastrous national account figures would come out today and the Opposition could dance on, what it hoped would be, the grave of the economy. But the figures were not disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with what Senator Button said at Question Time. It would be silly to oversell one quarter's figures as it has been consistently silly for the Opposition to make major play about one quarter's adverse statistics. If we stood up today and said, `Today's statistics prove there is no problem', nobody would think that was the way in which the quarter's statistics, out of context, ought to be interpreted. The truth is probably somewhere in between the overly pessimistic December figures and the overly optimistic March figures-somewhere between the minus 0.1 per cent rate of growth of the December figures and the 1.4 per cent or 1.8 per cent, depending on the measure, of the March figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to recognise that the most important statistics published in Australia for three months came out today but because they were not convenient they were not mentioned once. Senator Puplick managed to speak for 20 minutes without acknowledging they had been released. He did say that what he was looking for is not in the statistics. That is absolutely right; it is not. The statistics that Senator Puplick was hoping would come out which would be disastrous, which would have facilitated his speech, actually came out saying that the economy is not performing as badly as the most pessimistic of pundits and the Opposition criers of disaster have been predicting. Not only do the statistics show that the gross domestic product (GDP) grew, variously measured at 1.4 per cent or 1.8 per cent, but there was also a net positive contribution by net exports which is very important in terms of our balance of payment situation. Looked at over the more realistic period of six months, not taking the overly optimistic figure of the last three, these statistics show that gross national expenditure grew by 0.5 per cent while GDP grew by 2.2 per cent. That is exactly the formulation required to be sustained long-term to resolve the fundamental economic problems Australia faces. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want in any way to underestimate the significance of those problems. I simply want to say they will not be resolved by selective quotation of out of date statistics; they will not be resolved by recycling old arguments or by recycling old speeches. That is what we got today. We got a second-hand, second-rate speech quoting figures plucked out of the past. Let met give honourable senators an example. Senator Puplick quoted from Families and Tax in 1989. He conveniently forgot that the body which published that document published a subsequent document, because policy has changed since then, analysing the changed circumstances and coming to much more positive conclusions about the Government's record. Those figures must have escaped Senator Puplick's attention-and he has the gall to talk about sophistry. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the figures over the last seven years-one can draw a variety of messages from figures from the last seven years-indicate that quite a number of important economic factors need to be looked at. I will just refer to one. It is the one that I have never heard the Opposition refer to since it went into opposition. Opposition members used to talk about this factor a lot in the early years of their government when it looked all right. Then the situation turned sour and the Opposition stopped using it. It is the most reliable statistic: the measure of household disposable income; that is, the measure of the amount of money after wages, taxes and social security payments that households have to meet the commitments that they have to face. Real households disposable income under this Government have increased by nearly 20 per cent between 1983-84 and 1989-90. Nobody would claim that because that statistic exists, nobody in Australia faces any difficulty. Nobody would claim that Australia has no economic problems. If we are to face up to those problems realistically, an opposition needs one day to have the courage to say, `Some good things are happening; some bad things are happening; I agree with some; I disagree with others'. We do not need an opposition giving thespian performances, histrionics and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had that increase of 20 per cent fundamentally for three reasons. Wage increases and tax cuts have flowed from negotiations under the accord. There has been continued employment growth of about 2 7/8 per cent and social security payments have increased-I refer particularly to those in 1989-90. During the year in which the Australian Labor Party came to office, household disposable income fell by 2 per cent because employment was collapsing. In the subsequent years, figures up to and including 1989-90, as best assessed, show that in 1984 household disposable income per capita was 2.9 per cent; in 1985 it was 1.6 per cent; in 1986 it was 0.5 per cent; in 1987 it was minus 1.7 per cent-that is one bad year and no one should deny it; in 1988 it was 1.9 per cent; in 1989 it was 2.3 per cent and in 1990 it was 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not cite those figures as the definitive answer to say that there are no problems. I say, `Let us be realistic. A lot of good things are happening out there. Over one million jobs have been created. There are 25 per cent more jobs now than there were when we came to office-the most substantial job creation performance in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by any measure'. There have been wage improvements as against the wage freeze when the Government came to office. There have been tax cuts such that the level of taxes paid are less than they would have been had the 1983 rates been indexed. There have been substantial improvements in social security payments. There have been changes in tax to make it more equitable. Some of the people who are constituents of the conservatives opposite, who might come in to their offices complaining, are those who now have to pay capital gains tax for whom taxation was optional up until 1985, those who now have to pay fringe benefits tax and superannuation because the income tax base has been broadened, the rorts have been closed off and the rates have been able to be dropped. On balance that is why we can say that household disposable income has gone up by 20 per cent in seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other important areas about family living standards that escaped Senator Puplick's attention-the question of superannuation, for example. We have a situation now where superannuation is no longer the preserve of the privileged few. It is being spread rapidly to everybody in paid employment in Australia and being facilitated through other mechanisms for the self-employed. It is very important to Australia long-term that superannuation be extended for three reasons. First, it is important to the families about whom this matter of public importance was supposed to relate, because it talks about income security in retirement. Secondly, it is important because it reduces the burden that will flow onto future generations of taxpayers by the ageing of the Australian population. Thirdly, it is important economically because anybody who faces up to the important economic questions which Australia is facing recognises that an increase in savings is one of our most fundamental requirements. It was not mentioned by Senator Puplick either because the statistic is not convenient-that statistic keeps going up as well. I wish it would go down for the Opposition, it would be much easier. I am sorry, it keeps going up. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Opposition continues to oppose the superannuation increase. The Opposition was opposing it the other day in here, deploring the fact that there is an increased 3 per cent superannuation payment to wage and salary earners. By the end of the term of this Government, 6 per cent superannuation payments will be established for the overwhelming majority of working men and women. The young people who are going into the work force today face a situation where they know that they will be secure for the rest of their lives because of that superannuation. The economy will be better because superannuation savings are being generated. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a whole lot of other issues to do with living standards of families that somehow or other were not mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I still continue to look only at the question of living standards in a financial and economic sense. I wonder whether I have time to divert to some other matters concerning the standard of living of Australians, as might properly be mentioned. For the moment I want to get back to some other matters to do with the conventionally measured quality of life: the question of availability and affordability of health services; the question about home and community care services and what they provide; the questions about child-care, about education, about the quality of living in the suburbs and about urban regeneration. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is one of the prime ideological targets of our opponents. They froth at the mouth at its mention, which is a lot of fun to watch. But Medicare is very important to many Australian families. It means that they know what the health insurance situation is for the first time since 1975. Until this Government came to power they did not know what the health situation was from one year to the next. They now have the security of knowing that they have health insurance, which is very important in terms of access to doctors. It is so important to men and women to know that they have medical insurance cover for their children, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about the opportunity of aged persons in our community to be treated with equity and to have dignity. Everybody would love to be able to promise some big increase in the pension, for example, 30 per cent. We could have an auction to see who could deliver the highest pension. For the first time the pension is 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have the home and community care scheme, which means that people can continue to live where they want to live-in their own homes-instead of being sent to institutions before it is necessary. Those sorts of benefits are available for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> The living standards of ordinary Australians are affected by the availability of child-care. There are not enough child-care places in Australia, but there is almost immeasurably more than there was. There will be another 78,000 places by the end of this Government's term. Child-care availability is important to the people battling to maintain their jobs and to keep their lifestyles in a difficult economic climate. Governments should give that priority, as this one does. In the forthcoming three-year term another priority for the Government will be in the area of improvements in services for people living in the outer suburbs, what are called the western suburbs by people who live on the east coast. They might be otherwise described by people in other cities. The lifestyles of people who live in the outer suburbs of cities can suffer. These families may well have jobs. Sometimes they may have two jobs, cars and other material benefits, but they live in suburbs that need improved resources, for example, transport and other resources that make living for families in suburbs tolerable or even, we would hope, enjoyable. It is very important that we begin to solve this problem. We will not solve it in three years or even 10 years, but it is very important that we begin now to look at the provision of services and special assistance to people who live in those areas-which is a new part of the Government's social justice strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great measures of the living standard of the family-particular working class families-is the capacity of the family to educate its children to a higher level than the level to which the parents were educated, the ability to educate one's kid to his or her maximum potential. That is one of this Government's proudest achievements. We have not finished the task of improving school retention rates. There is more to be done, and I want to comment on what we are going to do in this term. We cannot underestimate the magnitude of improvement in the school retention rate on a national basis. The retention rate to year 12 in 1980 was 34.5 per cent. By 1982, it was 36.3 per cent. Since then, the increases have been enormous. In 1989, the year 12 retention rate was 60.3 per cent. It varies from the lowest figure of 39.7 per cent to the highest of 85.6 per cent. But those are the two Territories, and may be, in different ways, unrepresentative. Tasmania's rate-increasing quite rapidly as it is-is 39.7 per cent. In the bigger States the increase continues to be substantial. It is 54.4. per cent in New South Wales and 60 per cent plus in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The capacity for ordinary men and women to ensure that their children can continue to year 12 and then, if they show the interest and aptitude, go on to tertiary education is very important. It is important in terms of equity, national interest and maximising the productivity of our human resources, if we want to put it in economic jargon. There has been a very rapid expansion in higher education. The high school retention factor has meant a rapid increase in demand, which is a very good thing but which is very hard to meet. By the end of 1992, about 150,000 new student places beyond the 1983 level will have been created-an increase of almost 60 per cent. That is not a figure on which one can sit back and relax and say that we have done the job, because the increased retention rate will mean increased demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The quality of life of ordinary Australian families has always meant-but now more than ever-more than the level of household disposable income, which I regard as very important, the availability of health care, education and child-care, and urban regeneration. It relates to matters like the quality of the environment in which families and their children are going to grow up and which Senator Puplick so enthusiastically disparaged at the commencement of his speech. It relates to facts like our now having a society in which there is less conflict than there was. Fewer days are lost through strikes. There is less confrontation in our society and there is more emphasis on the achievement of change by consensus, agreement and sensible, intelligent discussion. People enjoy living in a society with less confrontation and conflict. They enjoy living in a society where they are confident that endeavours are being made to protect the environment in which their children will grow up. That could be a debate in itself. However, I do not want to digress any more than to say that it is very important, when we have those debates, that we do not concentrate our attention too narrowly. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other issues which I would have enjoyed the opportunity to comment upon-particularly as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, given the most recent and outrageous initiatives of the Australian Capital Territory local government. I would have liked to consider the record of the Liberal State governments and how that indicates concern for the living standards of ordinary Australians, of ordinary men and women trying to live in families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance being debated this afternoon, which was raised by Senator Puplick, concerns the claimed failure of the Hawke-Keating Government to secure real increases in Australian family living standards over its entire period in office. Interestingly, throughout the whole of his speech Senator Puplick did not in any way define what he meant by living standards. As Senator McMullan identified, there are factors related to living standards other than economic indices and the indications which they give of quality of life. I would like to turn to those matters because I think they are far more important than and far more relevant to the material which was put before us by Senator Puplick. I was pleased to hear Senator McMullan at least pay some lip service to those other factors, although he did not clearly give them a very high priority because 90 per cent of his speech dealt with economic factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is meant by living standards? The inclusion of this commonly used term without any further explanation or qualification by Senator Puplick says a great deal about the mover of this motion and the Party from which he comes. The comments that he made and, as I have indicated, most of the comments which Senator McMullan made in his speech indicate that essentially, at the core, they come from the same philosophical position. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin by recounting the content and the result of two studies. Many perceptive people-but they are not yet to be found in the ranks of either the Government or the Opposition-have been critical of the use of the present economic indices as measures of human welfare. Other indices which measure human welfare directly have been invented, and when countries have been compared by using those other welfare measures and the conventional economic ones it has been found that there is very often extremely little, if any, correlation between them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these measures which has been gaining some United Nations endorsement-and only today I again picked up an article mentioning this, although the idea has been around for some years now-consists of equal parts of easily objectively measured factors in human welfare. They are longevity, infant mortality and literacy, scaled on a scale of zero to 100 and mixed in equal proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> A study several years ago, which I understand has been repeated, indicated that on this scale of human welfare Sri Lanka scored 87 while Saudi Arabia, on the same scale, scored only 27. Yet at the same time the per capital gross national product of Saudi Arabia was 10 times that of Sri Lanka. What honourable senator would claim that `the standard of living of one nation is greater than the other'? If that gross difference between those two indices can be demonstrated between nations, surely also relatively small shifts in the rate of growth of either gross national product or gross domestic product over time give very little indication of what is actually happening to welfare within a country such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second example I would like to mention is that as technology improves more goods and services can be produced with less human labour. Over time several countries have conducted repeated surveys of their people, asking the question, `As productive capacity increases would you rather take this improved productive capacity as increased leisure or increased income?'. In Denmark these surveys showed a gradual increase in the proportion of the population who would prefer to take this increased productivity in terms of increased leisure. </PARA>
<PARA> By the early 1980s more than 50 per cent of the Danish community said that they would prefer to take out the increased productivity as increased leisure. This very greatly disturbed the Organisation for Economic-and I stress the word `economic'-Co-operation and Development because the OECD saw that if Denmark were allowed to go down that road, the rate of growth of gross domestic product in Denmark would gradually fall and may even become negative. What did the OECD say to the Danish Government? It said, `What you have to do is to increase inequity in Denmark, to increase the level of discontent and dissatisfaction within the Danish community, so that those who are less well off will then wish to compete more vigorously with their better off compatriots and in this way the growth of gross domestic product will be preserved'. Which honourable senator would argue that the Danes became better off as a result of that overemphasis on an economic index? Yet Senator Puplick included not one single measure of equity in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to some of the things that have been said about equity in Australia, we find that a review of a book called Fair Go: Welfare issues in Australia by Ronald Mendelsohn states:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the messages of this book is that Australian society is becoming steadily less equal, after a brave start up in 1914 towards an equal society. And the chances are that the gap now created will be irreversible. Nowhere is this more obvious and harder to change than in questions of land, of city planning, of shares in the good things that city living yields, and in housing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Family Studies, speaking of the difficulty Australians at the bottom end of the heap, as it were, face in obtaining housing said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . more than 150,000 families or individuals were on waiting list for government housing,-</PARA>
<PARA>this is a 1990 study, incidentally-</PARA>
<PARA>and more than a third of these had been on the waiting list for more than three years. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . for over 600,000 renters, the main reason for renting was because they could not afford a home of their own. Only one in eight public renters reported that they were saving for their own home. </PARA>
<PARA>The Institute of Family Studies also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In the year the present Government announced its intention to end child poverty by introduction of the Family Assistance Package, it also decided to eliminate unemployment benefits for 16 and 17 year olds, abolish Supporting Parents' Benefit when the youngest turned 16, phase out Class B widow's pension and income test Family Allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>The economic measures used by economists and adopted by Government and Opposition-and, it should be noted, also by most journalists-without qualification do not include many of the things which are highly valued by people but on which it is difficult or impossible to place a monetary value. Historically there has been a steady progression from the use of initially gross national product as an index-as a simple accounting tool, the uses of which were recognised as needing to be heavily qualified-to the present day, when the qualifications have been largely forgotten and the country goes into a panic when there are three quarters in which the gross domestic product has failed to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pointed out on many occasions that most of the costs of growth are counted as additions to gross domestic product. The cost of road accidents, including the cost of the funerals of those who die as a consequence of those road accidents, are added to gross domestic product. Meanwhile there being no national capital account, we can deceive ourselves into believing we have become richer when we deplete the natural resources of this country and turn them into dollar-earning junk. Recent international attempts at formulating an index which would more fairly represent those factors which are of concern to real people, and not just the abstraction from real people usually considered by economists, have suggested that such an index would reveal-and I stress it-a decline in human wellbeing on a global scale since the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation does not reflect on the Hawke-Keating Government in the way suggested by Senator Puplick's matter of public importance. But it does reflect on the Hawke-Keating Government in quite a different way-and it reflects even more severely on the coalition parties and their policies. Both the Government and the Opposition, in their pursuit of isolated and deeply flawed economic goals, have ignored the real welfare of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this morning's Australian newspaper contains two articles on the economics of immigration. Without going into the merits of the conclusions in an article by Professor Glenn Withers, an economist from La Trobe University, it is obvious that he attempts to show an economic benefit from immigration but totally ignores in his analysis the increased inconvenience, the travel times, the isolation imposed on those forced to live on the outskirts of an already large city such as Sydney and many more items because they are hard to measure in dollar terms. Attention was drawn to this by the American economist, Richard Ruggles, in his book which was published in 1983. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no well-defined universe of nonmarket activities and imputations to be covered. The set of all possible imputations is unbounded. The only criterion that can be employed is whether the imputations are considered to be useful and necessary for the particular purpose at hand . . . </PARA>
<PARA> For all these reasons, an explicit separation of market transactions from imputations in the national accounts would seem highly desirable . . . It would be recognised, however--</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress this-</PARA>
<PARA>that imputations alone cannot meet the information needs for measuring economic and social performance . . . No amount of imputation can convert a one-dimensional summary measure such as the GNP into an adequate or appropriate measure of social welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>Contemporary society values people for what they possess or what they can produce in a material sense. People are believed to relate primarily through market relationships. This view has received reinforcement from both the Government and the Opposition. For this reason, if this were an urgency debate this afternoon rather than a matter of public importance, the Democrats would seek not to vote either with the mover of the motion or with the Government but would absent themselves from the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Inherent in the wording of the matter of public importance and the presumptions which lie behind it is a lack of understanding on both sides about real people. The market competitive system which attempts to deal with people as economic consuming units to be manipulated to increase material consumption is a parasite on a real human society. A market-oriented and directed society, such as we now have in Australia, does not accumulate moral capital. On the contrary, it depleted and dissipates it. It does the same thing with natural capital and the community must maintain both against the onslaught of the market. Paradoxically, if community outside the economic system did not maintain these factors-that is, the moral capital and the natural capital-the market itself would not long survive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the presence in the gallery of a group of school students from St Patricks school in New South Wales. This debate today is not about the tired old figures, such as the measures of gross national product, with which Senator Coulter has consumed the time of the chamber this afternoon; nor is it about rhetoric. It is about the opportunity that will be given to these young people. It is about the betrayal of their future by the Government and that is what I shall address today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night I was reading the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children-the Burdekin report. Indeed, it is a terrible and sobering document. It says that one in five Australian children lives in poverty. One in five! That means that of 30 children in the gallery, six live on or below the poverty line. Is this a future that we wish to give to the next generation of Australians? Is this the future that the Government wishes to give to the people of Australia? Is this the record on which it wishes to be recorded by history?</PARA>
<PARA> The Burdekin report said that four major trends cause youth homelessness: the increased rates of unemployment amongst chief wage earners in families; the increased number of single-parent families-I do not know how many children in the gallery have only one parent living with them; the decreased value of Federal income support payments; and increased housing costs. This boils down to one thing: inadequate disposable income. Senator McMullan's description of disposable income is not correct. Rather, it is how much money is in the hands of the parents at the end of the week after they have paid the bills and the mortgage and start to buy food and clothes for their children. That is real disposable income. As Senator Puplick so ably pointed out, Mr Hawke, in his 1984 election policy speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We pledge ourselves to bring home ownership once again within the reach of ordinary Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>How ironic, sad and tragic that statement is in 1990 when home ownership is more unattainable under this Government than it has ever been in the history of this country. That is how the Government's record will stand. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk about what it costs to own one's home. If one is fortunate enough to earn the average weekly wage-and I am not talking about the median but the average, which is higher than the median-one will receive approximately $540 a week. After tax, that leaves $406.35. If, like many Australian families, one has a $100,000 mortgage, it will cost $325 a week just to pay the interest on the loan on one's home. That leaves a pitiful $81 a week to pay for the necessities of life: the rates, the electricity, the telephone, a car, and food and clothes for one's children. After one has done all that, one still has not paid off any of the loan; one still has not moved any closer to owning one's own home. One has merely kept one's head above water by paying interest to the bank. That is the future that the generation of Australians in the gallery face in not so many years' time. That is the legacy that this Labor Government has given to them. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the problems facing those of my generation who wish to marry and have families of their own? Our future is dependent upon our employment prospects. It is very sad to note that under the current Government, youth unemployment has reached staggering levels. In 1988, 24.4 per cent of young people were unemployed. This level, which is the highest ever recorded, is currently almost double the national average unemployment rate. The solution to this can only be better opportunities at colleges of advanced education, better opportunities for apprentices and a direction for those who fall short of this mark. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to canvass here the problems with tertiary education, and problems there are, but rather I wish to address the problem of the young unemployed who currently leave school at the age of fifteen-they are not even adults-to commence their travels on the long road to nowhere. These people are our subtertiary youth, those who do not go easily into further education or into the work force. At school they are called the underachievers. Socially they come from backgrounds which are underprivileged and undercared for, but they must not be viewed as a problem seeking a departmental solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, and we on this side of the chamber believe, that the underachievers, the underprivileged and the undercared for constitute the underestimated force in our nation's future. It is for these people that we must be fighting. It is these people that we must bear in mind. We need real innovative solutions to solve their problems. Unfortunately, the Government has not come up with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Government a hand. Let me suggest a scheme of community based part time work at part time school. At school they will have the opportunity to learn basic literacy, numeracy and social skills, and in their part time jobs in industry they will learn job skills for the future. This is one way that we can address the problem; it is one way the Government has not used to address the problems of Australia's young people and, in so doing, it has condemned those people, like so many others, to the scrap heap of our society.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government may not care about unemployed homeless young people, and it probably does not because they do not have a residence and, therefore, cannot vote and do not count in Keating's Australia. We have had seven years of this Government's actions, and it is seven years of condemnation of young people. We will not stand for it any longer. Let me address, too, rural poverty, which is a major problem in Australia today. Perhaps it is not seen that way by members of the Government, such as Senator McMullan, who live in the cities and talk about the cities. </PARA>

But we, on this side of the House, and we, in the National Party, will not stand idly by and let them do that.

<PARA> Senator McMullan, in his comments today, seemed to think that in bringing on this matter of public importance we, on this side of the House, were prompted by the people who complained to Senator Puplick about having to pay capital gains tax. I have not seen-I am sure that none of my colleagues on this side of the chamber has seen yet-one unemployed homeless person who has had to worry about capital gains tax. Senator McMullan may have to worry about capital gains tax, but those young people certainly do not because they do not have jobs, incomes or homes. Yet all we see day after day is this Government's neglect, this Government's lack of concern, and this Government's contempt for the young people of Australia. In evidence submitted for the Burdekin report, the Central Highlands Regional Director for Community Services in Victoria stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Homelessness is a product of society rather than an individual failing. It exists hand-in-hand with unemployment, inadequate incomes and a lack of family supports. </PARA>
<PARA>All of these maladies of which that submission spoke have been brought upon us by the present Government. They have been brought upon us by high interest rates, high taxes and a lack of concern or care for families and young people. The reason why there are so many homeless people in Australia today is that they come from families that have been ripped apart by the Government's economic policy. They come from families where both parents were forced to go out and work-nobody was at home when the kids came back from school, nobody had the time to care, nobody had the money to care, and nobody had the chance to care. That is how this Government shall be remembered. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad truth of the matter is that youth homelessness and, indeed, the whole evil spectre of family poverty are the product of Mr Keating's contempt for the young people of Australia. For that reason he, and this Government, should and must be roundly condemned. And they will be condemned-they will be condemned by youth, they will be condemned by history and, have no doubt, they will be condemned by the people of Australia at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a matter of public importance brought on by Senator Puplick from the Liberal Party of Australia claiming that family living standards have fallen over `the entire period of the Hawke-Keating Government'. I must reject the claim that has been made by Senator Puplick. The history of Liberal government shows that in office the Liberals could not deliver the sorts of things they are talking about today. The Hawke Labor Government came to office in 1983 at a time of deep recession. Under the Liberals, dole queues were swelling, inequality abounded and poverty was rife in Australia. I recall the 1981 Budget, the Budget in which Mr Howard, the Treasurer, increased sales taxes on a number of basic commodities across the board. One commentary on the Budget in 1981 was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the primary aim of this Budget is correct, the burden of its achievement will fall most heavily on those least able to afford it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A further quote from the same commentator:</PARA>
<PARA> Families have been hit with higher government taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a comment made on the second last Budget of the last Liberal Government. The commentator went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it should not be beyond the wit of man to come up with schemes more equitable than those we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA>Those comments were not made by a member of the Labor Party or by a member of the Opposition at the time; they were, in fact, made by the former leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Peacock, in a speech in the House of Representatives attacking his own Party's policies during its years in office-and rightly so, because the Liberals had a pitiful record on helping families, assisting pensioners and boosting social justice in Australia. That was the record and the reality of seven long years of Liberal government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the the seven years of coalition government the number of children in pensioner and beneficiary families increased from 380,000 to over 800,000, but only once in that whole period was there an increase in family payments for children. That is the reality of Liberal government in practice. Only once, in 1980, an election year, did payments for pensioners' children rise from a paltry $7.50 per week to $10 per week per child; in fact, children were forced to bear the cost of the coalition's economic bungling in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In fact, child payments declined in real terms, that is, their purchasing power was eroded by a massive 35 per cent over the course of the previous Liberal Government. By contrast, the Hawke Labor Government has increased payments for families every year that it has been in office. As well as the family allowance, we have introduced the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to examine in detail the family allowance supplement and payments made to children of pensioners and beneficiaries under the Hawke Labor Government. In 1983 when this Government took office-and Opposition senators, I am sure, will not want to hear this-the payment was $10 per child per week. By 1989 the Hawke Government was not paying $10 a week, $20 a week, or even $30 a week; it was paying over $34 per child aged 13 to 16 years per week and $24 per week for younger children. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that from January this year there has been a further increase in child payments; for example, for teenage children to $35.25 per week. So in a period of just over seven years, despite all the rhetoric we have heard this afternoon from the other side, the reality is that under a Labor government there has been a 250 per cent increase in weekly child payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance supplement focuses on working families-that is, families whose head is in the work force. It is a targeted scheme; it focuses on the neediest families. It certainly does not support and endorse middle class welfare in Australia. That is the record: family payments have increased every year under Labor, whereas families were ignored by the Liberal Party when it was in government. Let us face it: in reality, the Liberals in government did as much for Australian families as Captain William Bligh did for the working environment on the Bounty. Under Labor, not only has the family allowance supplement increased, but family allowance has also increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Last July the family allowance for a two-child family was increased from $12.75 a week to $18 a week. The Government has made a commitment that every year from now on-and for the first time ever-all family payments will be indexed every January according to the cost of living rise. Each January parents will be compensated for cost of living rises, as a result of the policies of the Labor Government. In that situation, households with children will no longer have to rely on ad hoc increases in their payments; they will not have to rely on discretionary payments by governments. They are now guaranteed an adequate income for future years. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of family payments is that they began in Australia in 1940. But under the old system of child endowment the Liberals did not give an increase. Not once in a period of decades was child endowment increased to protect parents against inflation. That is the record of the Liberals who come in here today and parade around the place about families. But when in government the reality was that they were mean and they did not provide increases in family based payments. They certainly let family payments slide down in value in relation to the cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Labor Government also increased the dependent spouse rebate in the personal income tax system. For the first time ever that rebate will be adjusted in line with inflation, as measured by the consumer price index. That move will benefit about 1.2 million Australians, focusing particularly on single income working families. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look at the effect of the family based payment increases in the second half of last year, in line with the personal income tax cuts made by this Government, to draw out some of the happenings in the Australian community. For example, a single income family earning $20,000 gross income-a relatively low income by today's standards-with two dependent teenage children will now, as a result of the tax cuts, face a tax liability of about $2,100. As a result of the significant increases in family payments-these calculations were made before the January increases this year which were made due to the cost of living-while that family will pay taxation of just over $2,100 per annum, its family based payments, through the family allowance of $936 per annum, and through the family allowance supplement of $1,658 per annum, mean that it will receive nearly $2,600 per annum from the Federal Government as family payments. In other words, family payments will be in excess of personal income tax payments by almost $500 per annum. It is somewhat like the concept of a negative income tax that has been talked about in social welfare circles around the world for many decades. The reality now is that single income working families whose incomes are in the $20,000 range will now get back from the Federal Government more in child payments than they actually pay in personal income tax. That is a very big achievement; one that has been delivered by a Labor government; one that could only be talked about by the Liberals; and one certainly that a conservative coalition government would be incapable of delivering. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the mechanisms for bringing about that negative income tax in Australia for that group has been the restructuring of the income tax brackets in Australia. For example, when the Liberals were in power, the lowest tax bracket rate on the income tax schedule was 30c in the dollar. As a result of Labor's restructuring of the personal income tax scales, the bottom tax rate has been reduced to 21c in the dollar. That is how we can focus assistance and so forth on the lowest income families in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the tax cuts last year the net income gains for a family on about $20,000 per annum, or $380 a week gross, will be over $21 a week, including the increased family payments for dependent children. The family itself is about $1,100 better off per annum due to that restructuring of personal income tax, combined with the significant rises in child payments through the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. Those calculations are on the conservative side; they do not take into account the increase in family payments from 1 January this year. It is important to note that, as part of the Government's incomes policy, by granting those large increases in family payments, by reducing the tax rates, that $21 a week which is the product of those moves would be equivalent to a gross wage rise-that is, an increase in wages, before tax-of over $36 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that family payments have clearly increased under Labor; they have gone up enormously. The facts I have put before the Senate today clearly indicate that the runs are on the board and certainly raise very severe questions about the claims made by Senator Puplick and Senator O'Chee this afternoon. It is very hard for them to back up their claims when these facts about family payments and the Government's family record are placed on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies in relation to the Australian labour market. How can they claim that persons who have been taken off the unemployment registers in the last seven years are worse off? How can they claim that the people who under this Government have gone into jobs for the first time are worse off? It is nonsense. It is very instructive to look at the unemployment figures. When this Government came to office in March 1983, there were 695,000 unemployed people in Australia-10 per cent of Australia's labour force. In the same month in 1990, seven years later, there were not 695,000 people out of work in Australia; the Government had reduced the figure through its expansionary policies to 510,000 or 6.1 per cent of Australia's labour force. So 185,000 Australians-not a small number, almost the population of the Australian Capital Territory-have been taken off the unemployment registers around Australia. Yet today Opposition senators have come into the Senate and made sweeping claims that Australian families are worse off as a result of the policies of this Government. There, very tangibly, very clearly and on the public record, are 185,000 Australians who did not have jobs when the Liberals last had a go at pulling the economic levers in this country. They do have jobs under Labor. Clearly, they are better off than they ever were when the other lot ran the country seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the equation is employment, which I know is very close to your heart, Mr Acting Deputy President. The reality is that in March 1983, when the Hawke Government was elected, 6.3 million Australians had jobs. In the very same month of this year, seven years later, 7.8 million Australians have jobs. So very clearly 1.5 million extra jobs have been developed in the Australian economy in that seven-year period. It is an absolute nonsense for the Opposition to bring on a matter of public importance today claiming that families are worse off and ignoring the fact that 1.5 million more Australians have had jobs over that seven-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals in government showed that they were economically, politically and ideologically incapable of looking after Australian families. A decade ago the Liberals said that they would protect family incomes, and they failed. Today this Labor Government has boosted family assistance enormously. The Hawke Government will continue to make further improvements to create a fairer, more just and more prosperous Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot leave unanswered what Senator Maguire has said. He gave us a history lecture-History 101-and a litany of the Australian Labor Party's so-called achievements. He listed, one after the other, the family payments, but let me tell Senator Maguire that they have been gobbled up and evaporated by high inflation, high mortgage rates, high interest rates. The policies of this Government have gobbled them up and made them almost as nothing. Like fairyfloss, the families have it in their hands and their mouths but it disappears. If I wanted hope, I would rather listen to what Senator O'Chee had to say than to what Senator Maguire had to say. There is no hope in just suggesting that we are going to give more handouts to people. The hope is in a revitalised economy. Hope for the future of Australia comes not from a dwindling government purse but from an expanding purse that results from a revitalised and dynamic economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McMullan, who put in his little Australian Capital Territory's worth, criticised the Greiner Government. Families in New South Wales owe much less in State debt than do families in Victoria. I come from a State where families are facing a State debt about double that in New South Wales. So Senator McMullan should not come in here and tell us about Mr Greiner and his record. Let me tell Senator McMullan about Mr Cain and his record of declining living standards in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are discussing the appalling record that this Government has in relation to living standards. The best evidence comes from Senator Walsh, who unashamedly admitted that this Government deliberately engineered a recession. Whether it is technical or not, today or yesterday, is irrelevant. Basically, most people would argue that Australia is in the throes of a recession. The truth of this statement is clear to the people on the street. They do not need today's national accounts to tell them where the economy is headed; they know. The two small business people I talked to over the weekend whose businesses have gone to the wall know where we are headed. Regardless of the figures, the pain is the same for those small businesses and for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> How long is it since the Treasurer (Mr Keating) asked his constituents-the failed small businesses, the home buyers who have been forced to give up their dream of a home, or the families struggling to make ends meet-about the state of the economy? I do not suppose Mr Keating has met many of those recently. They would no doubt express their anger at this Government's policies in stronger terms than Senator Button's `severe downturn'. They would be more vocal and florid in their description of where this economy is heading. </PARA>
<PARA> Who can be blamed for the pain of higher interest rates and high inflation? There is no other answer than that this Government is to blame-we do not need a history lesson from Senator Maguire-and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer are to blame. They lack the courage to take the necessary hard decisions and honestly to tell Australians the truth about the damage they have caused. They did not tell us before the election; they waited until Senator Walsh bled his heart out on the Monday after the election-and more than 50 per cent of the Australian population knew that. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian workers are not fooled by the con of the deal between Bill Kelty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Treasurer. The Government's accord mark 6 merely shuffles the inflationary forces; it does nothing to control and reduce them. This must be tackled if Australia is ever to have a hope of once again enjoying rising, let alone sustained, living standards. We are not even at the point where we have sustained living standards. Australian families have never enjoyed any sustained benefits from a succession of these wage deals. Like Senator Maguire's family payments, they have been eaten away by high inflation, high interest rates and bracket creep. The result has been declining living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Real average after-tax incomes reached peaks in 1975-76 and 1984-85. The 1989-90 forecast will restore incomes only to that 1975-76 peak. They will still be substantially below the 1984-85 level. Real incomes have fallen each year from 1985-86 to 1988-89, and the total decline has been about 10 per cent. In the postwar period, significant reductions were recorded in only four other years, and none of these was consecutive. So we had four consecutive years of decline. It is the longest fall in real incomes for over 40 years, probably the longest real fall in the lifetime of most senators in this chamber. That is what we have got. That is the legacy this Government has left us. An analysis of living standards reflects the effects of high interest rates, high taxes and high inflation. They are a damning indictment of the Hawke-Keating economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Average tax rates have risen in the last 12 years for all individuals and all families, with the exception of those on very high incomes and low income families with children. The figures for 1988-89 show that a family on average weekly earnings is now paying $30.80 per week more in tax that it did 12 years ago. Since the early 1980s real disposable incomes have fallen sharply. Real after-tax earnings have fallen by $2,000. This contrasts strikingly with every other postwar decade, when real after-tax earnings increased substantially-if Senator Maguire wants us to go into history. This is all the more remarkable when our huge overseas debt is taken into account. As Senator Puplick said, for the first time it appears that we may be leaving the next generation with lower living standards than we are currently enjoying. This is the legacy from a government which claimed that no child would live in poverty by 1990. What a joke that was. </PARA>
<PARA> The following headlines I have collected from various newspapers make it all too plain how seriously our living standards have deteriorated and I have just picked out a few over the last 12 months: `Debts crisis hits families'; `Family tax higher than 1977, despite cuts'. The Daily Telegraph tells us, `The family is pulling us under'. Why? The newspaper refers to the report of the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC), launched in September last year, which found that for the first time in statistical history the traditional financier role of the Australian household sector had been reversed in the economy; it went from being the lender to being the borrower. Why? Because families do not have any capacity to save. Their disposable income leaves them nothing after they have done what Senator O'Chee talked about. After paying the family bills, there is nothing left to save. For the first time in history the family unit-whatever that unit might be-is the borrower, not the lender, which is an appalling situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The headlines continue: the Daily Telegraph, Families rushing charities; again the Daily Telegraph, Broke families rush charities; the Age, Spiralling living costs force more families to seek help; the Australian, Spending power of families dips; the Melbourne Herald, Middle income earners in strife; and the Australian, Economic despair `boosts suicide'. What a lovely record!</PARA>
<PARA> Those newspaper headlines I have chosen were based on reports or comments by organisations such as the Royal Australian College of Psychiatrists, the Financial Counsellors Association of Victoria, the child poverty summit of the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Marriage Guidance Council of Victoria, the Family Court of Australia, the Smith Family, EPAC and the Australian Institute of Family Studies. This is not journalists dreaming up headlines. These are reports of study after study by government instrumentalities, charitable organisations and research groups telling us that family living standards are falling. </PARA>
<PARA> Family housing and, in particular, the dream of all Australians to own their own home will now only ever be a dream for many Australians. It will only be a dream because of the deliberately engineered, as Senator Walsh reminded us, high interest rate policy that this Government has relentlessly pursued. The national account figures out today only heighten the likelihood of high interest rates remaining at record levels for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1988 I asked Senator Cook a question in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. At that time interest rates for housing loans had risen and I asked him whether high interest rates would mean that young Australians were having to make a choice between having a family or a home of their own. The Minister answered me and said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is an emotionally charged appeal to the heartstrings which is frankly quite disgusting . . . an emotionally charged ploy to try to pretend that what this Government is doing is discriminating against families. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet what happened? Week after week, in weekend magazine after weekend newspaper, we see articles on that very thing-young couples telling us they are making a decision between having a family and trying to make ends meet; they are just managing. They are not necessarily trying to have exorbitant standards of living, but just trying to make ends meet. Yet the Minister told me this was an emotionally charged ploy. What nonsense! Another disturbing aspect of the Government's economic policies has been the number of young families who are now homeless. Senator O'Chee has dealt with that quite extensively. </PARA>
<PARA> One group of people that I think we have neglected to talk about this afternoon with regard to families is elderly people-a group of people not made up of parents with young children, but the aged in our society, aged couples, the widowed and single aged people who may be living alone or with family and friends. This is not an amorphous mass of silly old buggers or wrinklies as our Prime Minister and our Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) choose to call them. These are human beings who have contributed to this society and the sort of society and upbringing we, in the baby boom, had-a generation that was feted. We owe something to these people. They represent an important and growing part of our society which is too often overlooked. The Governor-General's Speech at the beginning of the last Parliament and the one at the beginning of this Parliament did not mention the aged. I can tell the Senate that Mr Hawke will be out there wooing the greys as well as the greens at the next election, but he does not mention them in his policy speech for the life of this Parliament given by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the impact of this Government's economic policies on the aged, I would like to discuss the opportunities that aged families have had under this Government. The Government was moved to look at retirement income policies only when the Opposition produced its retirement incomes policy. The Government has done little to adopt the features of that policy which would directly benefit people over 60 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition policy includes the banning of a compulsory retirement age. It also allows people to work beyond the standard retirement age, to continue to benefit from superannuation concessions through retirement incomes accounts and to allow them to take an increased benefit of pension as a result of retiring later. This allows people real security in providing for their own retirement and, of course, if people wish to work longer there are economic benefits to this. A study that was recently carried out in 1986 showed that a quarter of Australian men who reached the compulsory retiring age and had no legal recourse to avoid it said that they would rather have worked longer. This is a group of people who can contribute and give us their skills as well.</PARA>
<PARA> Some aged people do not have the resources to care for themselves and rely on the age pension. To give credit where credit is due, the Government has increased this to approximately 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, but not at the speed at which it was promised. It took a long time coming. The group that is particularly affected by high inflation is people on fixed incomes, retirees and pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I want to mention is health care, which tends to impact on the living standards of the aged more than anyone else. They are the greatest users of our health budget. It is instructive to note that since the introduction of Medicare a greater proportion of the aged has private health cover. What does that tell us? It tells us that aged people have no confidence in Medicare and its ability to deliver free care. The Prime Minister might be able to have his prostate operated on in a private hospital, but not so other people over 60. They wait in long queues to have their prostates operated on. Many of them scrimp and save to pay Medicare benefits-more than before this wonderful Medicare system came in under a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the Senate that not only are young people suffering as Senator O'Chee mentioned, and the families that Senator Puplick mentioned, but also older people are suffering. The fall in living standards is a direct consequence of this Government's failed economic policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the alleged failure of the Government to secure real increases in Australian families' living standards, and this, the Opposition alleges, is a sign that our economic policies are not working. I would have thought that this is scarcely the subject for a debate here in the Australian Capital Territory this week. I would have thought that it is an issue that the coalition would wish to avoid on the day after the Liberal ACT Administration has brought down very savage cut backs in public sector expenditure which will have a dramatic impact on all families in the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just mention a couple of examples: rate rises of 16 per cent, bus fare rises of up to eight per cent and, for heavens sake, pre-school fees. I have never heard anywhere else in Australia of children having to pay to go to pre-school. Pre-school is part of basic education, yet here in the ACT, under a Liberal administration, families will have to decide whether they can afford to give their children that very important introduction to education. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally reject the proposition that Senator Puplick has put forward today. I would like to quote from a number of government reports to indicate the facts of this matter-facts which I regret have not really been acknowledged by Opposition members in the debate this afternoon. Let us look at household incomes and employment. I am quoting from Economic Notes-1990, dated 22 February 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Real household disposable incomes under this Government have increased by nearly 20 percent between 1983-84 and 1989-90--</PARA>
<PARA>This has occurred because of wage rises and tax cuts flowing from negotiations under the accord. The accord is fundamental to the Government's ability to deliver in this regard. We all know the industrial relations nightmare that would exist under a coalition government. Senator O'Chee might like to do a little history of industrial relations in Queensland and suggest what new strategies he would bring in in this regard. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Continued employment growth of around 2 7/8 percent. Following on from exceptionally strong growth of 4.6 percent in 1988-89, employment growth will be more moderate this year. The fact that Labor has created over 1.6 million new jobs since coming to office has been the largest single factor underscoring the lift in household disposable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased social security payments in 1989-90 have also added to household disposable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> What guarantees of increased living standards did the coalition offer in the last election campaign? Perhaps we can get some indication of how it managed to present these to the electorate from the results of the last election. First, as we know, the coalition is fundamentally committed to major cutbacks in public sector expenditure. Just this morning Senator Bishop, in discussion, said, `Let's privatise'. Whenever one talks about these issues, the Opposition says, `Let's privatise. Let's get rid of this responsibility'. Of course, this is happening under the Greiner Administration, in New South Wales, and in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There was confusion in the Opposition's social security policy. David Connolly announced cutbacks of $1 billion. Does a $1 billion cutback come from a politically alternative government that is committed to a better deal for families?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the coalition's policy contained gross discrimination against the poor, Aborigines and migrants. Despite repeated requests in the lead-up to the election, the coalition failed to give any guarantee to index child payments. Of course, we know about its tax policies and its continual reference to a consumption tax-some time in the future. It was wise enough not to make any commitments for the first term. Coalition members really cannot stand up here and talk about family living standards when that is their record. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, let us look at what the Hawke Government has initiated. Obviously, we have been committed to major economic and social reform, which has benefited Australian families. Employment growth has offered major benefits. For example, in 1983 nearly 270,000 children were dependent on adults receiving unemployment benefits. Yet in August 1989 that number had been reduced to less than 170,000. The Federal Government's employment record has ensured a far more secure and fair future for those Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the introduction of Medicare, a massive rebuilding of our health and community services, the creation of nearly 70,000 additional child-care places, and major improvements in education and training programs. These reforms have all been initiated in recognition of their importance to the quality of life for all Australians, particularly those most disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been unprecedented reform of the taxation system to improve its fairness, to stop tax avoidance and evasion being used by the privileged, and to provide substantial increases in take-home pay for Australian workers. Similarly, the spread of superannuation supported by the Federal Government, in combination with its recently announced retirement income policy, for the first time provides for every Australian, now and in the future, the basis for a decent and dignified standard of living in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the least acknowledged Federal Government reforms has been the historic restructuring of family payments. Earlier I indicated that the Opposition had made no commitment to maintain the indexation of family payments. Family allowance payments have been simplified and substantially boosted. This has directly benefited nearly two million families with over 3.8 million children. The lowest income families have also received levels of income support never before delivered by any Australian government through the introduction of the family allowance supplement-FAS. FAS, or its equivalent paid to families receiving social security pension or benefit, provides on average an additional $50 a week tax free to over 500,000 families with over 1.2 million children. Do they sound like policies of neglect?</PARA>
<PARA> This Federal Government has been the first in the history of Australia to set standards for family payments, for those most in need and to pay them directly to the mother on a regular basis. The Opposition has never let the Government forget the very historic promise that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made about child poverty. But it is important that the Opposition acknowledge that it never tackled poverty. This Government has tackled poverty. We have established benchmarks. We have greatly reduced the levels of poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, these historic family reforms will mean expenditure of nearly $3.5 billion in 1989-90 compared to barely $1.7 billion when we came to office. Again, does that sound like a Government that has been neglecting the Australian family?</PARA>
<PARA> We have overhauled the family allowance system to remove its complexity and the lack of indexation. In July we moved to the two rate structure of $9 and $12 and, having completed the reform of the family allowance supplement for low income families, moved to pay the allowances fortnightly and index the payment according to the consumer price index. By contrast, the Opposition's plan was to reintroduce a child tax rebate, which would not have been available to the mother when she needed the cash most. The Government has found, from research that it has done, that often the mother never sees the benefit of a tax rebate; she wants cash in hand. That is the most equitable way of assisting families-by giving the money to the mother for her to decide the priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue is how the Government pays for family transfer improvements. We have an established record of reducing dependency, including massive improvements in the situation of the poorest women-that is, sole parents. Thirty per cent of them declared income in 1983; 60 per cent do now. So more sole parents are participating in the work force than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need government statements to attest to our policies that have benefited Australian families over the last seven years. I have a document entitled The Australian Family Income Transfer Project: Families and the Tax Package, which was published late last year by the Australian Institute of Family Studies-the most reputable organisation that concentrates on family needs and policies. On page 12 of the report it states this about the Government's policies:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, with the implementation of the new package, taxpayers in general will have higher real disposable incomes than applied . . . in 1976-77 and 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder where the Opposition has been when information such as this is readily available? Page 13 of this document talks about the distribution of gains from the Hawke Government's families and tax package. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, 49 per cent of the cost of the package goes to the 30 per cent of households which include dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As can be seen, approximately 60 per cent of the benefits of the package go to low and middle income families, i.e. those receiving less than one and a half times average weekly earnings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The document also talks about other measures that have been introduced:</PARA>
<PARA> Other measures which improve the economic wellbeing of low income families include:</PARA>
<PARA>* the abolition of the six-week delay in indexation of pensions and benefits;</PARA>
<PARA>* the prospective supplementary payments for low paid workers which could benefit an estimated 300 000 families with children;</PARA>
<PARA>* improved training and income support for sole parents and the long-term unemployed;</PARA>
<PARA>* upgraded child support arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the general improvements in employment referred to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in rebutting the thrust of the matter of public importance submitted by Senator Puplick, I will quote from the concluding remarks of the same document:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Government's tax package redresses substantially all of the deficiencies in the tax-transfer system affecting families and single individuals, as identified in Families and Tax in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes in the tax scale benefit most those families receiving incomes around $20,000 per annum and have restored a significant proportion of income lost over recent years. The changes were certainly more beneficial than the indexing of the tax scale of 1983-84 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think on that note I would say to honourable senators who have spoken this afternoon that it is one thing to be critical of Government policy-obviously that is the role of an Opposition-but it is another thing entirely to blatantly and totally ignore the very significant reforms that have been made by this Government and not to be prepared to put anything up in its place. We hear much in terms of rhetoric from the Opposition about what is wrong with Government policy, but we have never been able to get from it clear coherent policies, particular when it comes to social policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the very fast train project we must bear in mind that distance is one of Australia's major problems, if not its greatest. Therefore, travel is a subject that has to be addressed, and addressed regularly. We are dealing with this matter in the light of the fact that we are coming up to the twenty-first century. We are not looking for a solution that would have been appropriate in the eighteenth, nineteenth or twentieth centuries. It needs twenty-first century thinking and decision making. Australian transport generally is terrible. I support the very fast train project with enthusiasm and congratulate those far-sighted Australians who have promoted it so far. Clearly, the Melbourne-Sydney base is the logical area to start, but I look forward to preparations to be added in the Brisbane-Adelaide area in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one could possibly argue that rail traffic is anything but the ideal way, all things considered. In the consideration of travel we are looking at matters of time, safety, cost and comfort. Our long distances take much time, are high in cost, and are questionable in comfort and service and there are real safety risks, particularly in road transport, these days. </PARA>
<PARA> How do others cope? The Japanese have a very fast train system. My last reading would indicate that it has now carried over 50 billion passengers and never lost one. France now has a well-established fast train system. I now find that Taiwan, a country two-thirds the size of Tasmania, is saying that by the year 2001 it will also have a system. </PARA>
<PARA> We do need better transport; there is no doubt about that. Of course we do. Is there a better system than rail? Of course there is not. Let us look at the alternatives. There are only a limited number of even possible alternatives. One is the Hume Highway. Nobody would try to convince any Australian that the Hume Highway was the best way of getting between Melbourne and Sydney. The cost of its redevelopment and maintenance is enormous. The cost in death and destruction is absolutely terrible. It takes a long time and it is certainly not a comfortable way to travel. The Pacific Highway is exactly the same, only far worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The rail system we have at present is quite unsatisfactory. It is very slow, expensive and needs vast amounts of money for modernisation, anyway. The other alternative is air. We are talking about extra runways at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, a new airport at Badgerys Creek and we are looking at the time it takes to get in and out, the holding patterns, the congestion and everything else. It just gets worse and worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The purveyors of doom and gloom would stop it just for the sake of stopping it, if they got the chance. They want to ignore the time and losses in human terms and the costs in dollars and all the present alternatives that are involved with it, just as they try to prevent population growth, promote the cessation of all growth and development, and have a complete review of immigration and such matters. Whatever they want to do, we can absolutely rest assured that we are looking at a population by the year 2000 of something in the order of 20 million people, and probably 30 million people by the year 2030. We are going to have to provide a reliable transport service for all those people. </PARA>
<PARA> What about all those people and their transport? There is no doubt that a large proportion of these people will reside in the south-eastern corridor of Australia. If we are going to transport not only our own people but the increasing tourist traffic which is expected, we are going to have to provide this adequate service. We cannot just send people out to an airport and have them leave the middle of the city two hours before departure time, take an hour to fly and take another hour and a half to get into the city at the other end. We have to do better than that. If we do not, we are heading straight down into the comparative stakes-with all the comparisons between us and other countries-and getting less and less competitive and comparative all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians must be more imaginative. The Government must show a bit of vision and leadership at a time like this. We have to provide a bit of technological demonstration of our capacity to the other countries of the world. I do not know whether many people fully understand that when we are talking about this sort of transport, time wise we are talking about Sydney to Canberra in an hour, from the centre of Sydney to the centre of Canberra. We are talking of two hours from the centre of Canberra to the centre of Melbourne-and doing it in speedy, safe, comfortable and fully-serviced travel. How else could one do that?</PARA>
<PARA> I accept that there is disability and disturbance and that these are quite considerable for the new train project, just as they would be for any new road, airport, urban development and just as they would be if there were floods, fires or earthquakes and even, as we are heading for now, climatic change. Of course, this creates problems. I regret the fact that all changes cause problems, but these things must be attended to. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the environment, I regard it as extremely important, but it cannot be allowed to stop the project. We should make the commitment to proceed and say that we recognise that such factors are sensitive and that they will need particular attention. But we have the wit and the capacity to say that there are problems and that we can solve the problems. We can get the best experts and top practitioners to conclude the detail, but we must make the commitment now. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned Taiwan. Taiwan has said that by the year 2001 it will have its system running. If these people have their way in Australia, by 2001 we will still be procrastinating or we will have the proposal in the garbage bin. That sort of attitude is not the Australian way. I have great faith in Australia and in its scientists and engineers. Of course there are problems, and they will be overcome. We can overcome them only if we face them and deal with them with goodwill and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of people who are involved in this, people such as Alan Castleman and Dr Paul Wild, give me great faith in what can be done. Australia has vast space and mobile people. Providing for their needs and the needs of visitors just has to be done. I repeat: from travel we expect safety, comfort, economy of cost and the best use of time. No other travel could compare with the very fast train in these directions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not one obstacle that cannot be overcome if we put our minds to it. From a country once famous for its initiative we are now identified with what we are trying not to do, what we can put off, how we can stop things and how we can prevent development. That is not good enough. I am still trying to do things. I want to be listed amongst the achievers and I want to be here amongst those who set visions for achievement. The very fast train is the best example currently available in Australia for people to demonstrate that they want to be in that team. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that this is a very important issue. I would agree with Senator Archer that railway transport as an option for the future needs to be looked at seriously. It is very important for us to take the load of movement of people and of large amounts of goods from the Australian roads because they are certainly a disaster area at the moment. I would agree that the way of the future with regard to transport in Australia is railways. But the very fast train (VFT) is a proposal that should be followed by many question marks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that people in the environment movement are trying to stop progress in every respect at all but certainly they want to ask questions and they want the community to be involved in the decision-making process. What Senator Archer has said largely indicates a Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney access bias which is quite offensive. People from other parts of Australia also need their transport requirements attended to. The whole of Australia does not revolve around Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney access, which I know may come as a surprise to people who live in those areas but I think they need to be reminded of that. Senator Archer made some assumptions about a huge population growth for Australia which I would also challenge. If there is a very large population growth forthcoming, we certainly do not want to put more people in this very crowded south-eastern corner. We need to make come alive the concept and the policy of decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The interim report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure presented today certainly raises many very important questions. Two aspects of the report are very striking from the start: firstly, the arguments or objections to the proposals are far greater than the arguments in favour of it-that is already very clear; and, secondly, the widespread demand for a full public inquiry into the idea, referred to in paragraph 1.118. </PARA>
<PARA> Frank Stilwell, and associate professor of economics at the University of Sydney, has described the VFT proposal as a private enterprise venture for profit by corporate capital with little role for public scrutiny of information on social costs and benefits. Indeed, looking through the report, virtually every aspect of the proposal is highly questionable, whether it concerns the projected fares to be charged; the speed of the train, which will have to be 33 per cent greater than the current fastest passenger train; the destruction of habitat by the creation of corridors and the use of herbicides; the forcing of farmers off their land; or the noise levels. The real interests of the consortium may perhaps be summed up in the words of Sir Peter Abeles in December 1988 when he described the VFT as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the catalyst for the major redevelopment of Australia . . . It would be more appropriate if one could call this project the restructuring of our sociological and economic structure of the east coast . . . The train is only a by-product. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very important to keep it in that perspective. He argued that his concept for south-east Australia was too big for government and the taxpayers, saying that:</PARA>
<PARA>Private enterprise can afford to do it on a business basis. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would take two or three generations to compete with the VFT as the catalyst. </PARA>
<PARA>The train project has to be evaluated as part of this national plan. Sir Peter said this in a report in the Canberra Times; it should not be seen as a separate entity on its own. Consultation with the public does not seem to be part of either Sir Peter Abeles' or the consortiums' planning process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Latrobe Valley Community Forum has argued that the common flaw of both inquiries is that they focus only on the fast train project and do not attempt to address the real issue of the development of transport needs and options. These need to be set in a much wider context. Because of the magnitude of the proposal, and the obvious implications for our lifestyles, development and transport options, it is essential that an independent far-reaching national inquiry constituted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 be undertaken immediately. One of the key tasks of such an inquiry should be to assess not only the VFT proposal but other options and alternatives to alleviate our current development and transport pressures in the Melbourne-Sydney corridor. Senator Archer completely ignored this in his enthusiastic endorsement of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference need to be broad enough to consider the social, economic and environmental aspects of a range of options to best assess the costs and benefits to the community. Developers always talk about the financial benefits, but when it comes to costs they narrowly refer only to the infrastructure and building costs, and conveniently omit environmental and social costs-which, admittedly, are difficult to quantify, but they must be part of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Railways Union and the Australian Conservation Foundation presented a submission to this Senate Committee inquiry, endorsed by over 60 organisations, which expressed concern over the fragmentation and lack of adequate resourcing for the three VFT reviews under way and called for a single national inquiry. From a conservation perspective, the VFT proposal has two major areas of concern. The first is that the preferred route will effectively cut the forests of East Gippsland in half if the train goes that way and it could result in the extinction of Australia's rarest mammal-the long-footed potaroo. The second environmental concern relates to the longer term issue of Australia needing to develop energy efficient transport systems as an essential element in a national strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA> From the indigenous people's perspective there has been little attempt to identify Aboriginal sacred sites which may lie in the path of the VFT, particularly along the coastal route. There must be detailed assessment and protection of sacred sites. Another critic of the VFT proposal is John Nestor, a former Passenger Business Manager with the New South Wales State Rail Authority. He argues that a VFT would serve no socially useful purpose and could survive financially only with hefty government subsidies. Surely we do not want to go down that path again. This concern over the financing of the VFT is expressed in the report in paragraph 1.37, and I get the impression that, as Sir Peter Abeles implied, the VFT proposal is not really about the train but about something much bigger and more profitable. There have been many suggestions that it is tied in with the multifunction polis proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Another critic, Owen Magee, an engineering consultant and former director of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, has argued that the issue is whether this country-faced with so many other requirements-can afford to allot so much of its capital resources to a project to improve access between three cities which are already the most accessible in the country, while other centres are under-resourced, which does not do anything for the concept of decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparing the construction costs with the Sydney monorail, Mr Magee goes on to argue that the cost would not be the initially quoted $4 billion but more like $12 billion, and heavy borrowing from overseas would be inevitable. Again, I do not think that is a path we need to go down. Another concern he expresses is that if the costs balloon, a good bet would be that the Government would eventually have no option but to contribute towards it from taxpayers money. He also points out that there are plenty of precedents for cost overruns and for subsequent government subsidies for such large projects. I would argue that the Senate should take urgent note of paragraph 1.118, which echoes the call by community groups for a full Commonwealth commission of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of participatory democracy must become a reality. A well-informed public will generally make decisions which are for the greatest good of the community as a whole. It is time that the wisdom of the people was recognised. No doubt the Senate Standing Committee will receive spirited as well as informed input during the forthcoming hearings. I hope that it takes good notice of that input from community groups and individuals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a much welcomed report, Senator Crichton-Browne, because this is a controversial project. It will remain a controversial project whether it goes ahead or not. I would argue that there is a need for the Senate, and the Parliament, to look quite closely at projects envisaged such as the very fast train. It is something that may or may not be needed by the Australian community but whether it is needed or not, it is something that has to be looked at. If our ancestors did not make the choice about the internal combustion engine we would still be walking around or riding around with a horse and cart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is a vast country. Parliamentarians like myself have to cross the nation every week. We do so using modern means of transport, which in some cases can be deleterious to the environment we live in. But because we need to move-we are a mobile society-we use those means of transport. From my limited knowledge of the very fast train-and I say it is limited because I did not have my research staff prepare a paper on it-I think we need to look at it for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I see some advantages in a very fast train. If it cuts down the use of motor vehicle traffic travelling between the major cities and this city, it will be advantageous to us in the long term. It could also have a tremendous impact on the crush that now exists at Sydney Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the interim report. I wish the Committee well in its continued deliberations on this matter. I know that individual members of the Committee are putting in a lot of time in taking submissions not only from the people immediately involved from a financial point of view but also from the community that may be impacted by it. I wish them well in their continued inquiries and I look forward to the recommendations that they bring down to the Government at the conclusion of the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate my appreciation of the opportunity to make a contribution to this report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology from my background as a trade union official and my very keen observations of what needs to be done in industry in the years to come if we are to be successful in seeing industry make a contribution to the lives of people in this country and to the economy in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to note that the current inquiry stemmed from a previous inquiry and report the Committee brought down about manufacturing industry revitalisation called Making It Together. It was very clear when we were looking at the matters talked about in that report that there were certain long held beliefs by management, government and trade unions that needed to be shaken and that attitudes had to be changed. Of course, we could not go across the whole gamut of those matters that needed to be canvassed in that report so we determined we would look at management and new management techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to say how pleased I was that, even though my attitude to the changes required was a little different from, for instance, Senator Archer's because of his background in management, there were certain unchallengeable facts that we readily accepted. We were able to be educated a little by each other in some matters. Our views were able to be changed and we were able to come up with a report that did not require a dissenting view. So it is a report of the whole Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things we did very early on was to decide that we had better talk about what a successful company was and put on the record a description that would be easily understood by people. I would like to read that into the record:</PARA>
<PARA>A world competitive company produces the highest quality products or services which exactly meet customer needs at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, the enterprise work force, at all levels, will share a common purpose enhanced through consultative and problem solving mechanisms, a commitment to skills training, career structures and access to appropriate technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are saying is that new management techniques are not just about leadership at the top of the company. They are not about authoritarianism by employers or by owners or companies. They are about the management structure from the top to the bottom; about consultation, not confrontation; and mutual benefit flowing as a result of those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked about the need to produce a report that was not just going to be commented upon in this place and then put away to gather dust. It had to be, in our view, a report that had some value to the community, that would be discussed and acted upon. For that reason we suggested a series of five national conferences and also complementary State conferences on these issues. We were not about re-inventing the wheel, so we suggested that the Australian Manufacturing Council and the National Industry Extension Service in the various States had the expertise and had done a lot of work in this area and should be involved in the organisation of these conferences. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we mean by new management techniques? I believe on page 7 it is very clearly set out. It is a very broad term and is used in two senses:</PARA>
<PARA>First, in a general sense, the term covers most available advanced management technologies and management systems such as JIT, TQC, VAM, computer-aided Design/Manufacturing (CAD/CAM), Flexible Manufacturing Cells (FMC) and Integrated Manufacturing (IM). </PARA>
<PARA>That is one aspect of it and it is the technical aspect. The second sense in which the term is used is to describe the underlying management-work force relationship, which is modern, non-directive, participative, where people are seen as having a worth and a value in the process. It is not the old situation where an employee is told by an employer, `You are here, you are paid to work and not to think. Because I own or I run this factory, I automatically must know more than you and be more intelligent than you'. `Participative', `consultative' and `cooperative management' carry similar meanings. As the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>These styles or approaches to management have one feature in common: employee involvement. This is the main sense in which the term new management techniques is used in this report. These techniques do not take away the need for management leadership and direction. However, it is the belief of the committee that decisions made on the basis of employee involvement will have a higher measure of support. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true. We do not want a command situation, as I said. It cannot be emphasised too much that there needs to be cooperation, making use of all those talents that are available in the workplace from top to bottom. I close by quoting a description that leads off chapter 3 about new management techniques, which I think are very important. It relates to an integrated approach to skills acquisition:</PARA>
<PARA>Multi-skilling of the work force, together with a cooperative approach to award restructuring by unions and employers, will be essential to the successful introduction of new management techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>I might point out that there have been some difficulties in that area where restructuring is proceeding fairly slowly. But it is such a worthwhile enterprise, in my view, to make those changes that we must persevere and we will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquisition of new skills will lead to the role modification by employers, managers and employees. Manufacturers will need to recognise this and, together with the college of technical and further education, accept responsibility for the necessary re-education and training to occur. Much of the re-education and training will be on the job and involve integration of theory and practice. There is a real need for employers to see training and skills residing in their employees as an asset, an investment, not as a cost to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> It also must be recognised that if it is looked upon by the whole of industry as being an asset, then the achievement will be in employees gaining that high level of skill, that degree of confidence in themselves and self-worth that will be useful to other employers and, in addition, those employers who may train at a given time. But the pool of skilled labour will be there for the advantage and the benefit of all industry. The establishment of goals which are understood and shared by all of the work force will ensure a more positive attitude and increased creativity in the workplace as well as requiring employees to assume more responsibility. Such changes will ultimately enable Australian manufacturing firms to look at greater market opportunities in the world economy. That is essential. We are part of the world. We have thrust ourselves into that area. The isolation we once had is gone. We will either rise or fall on the basis of our ability in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the changes that are suggested in this document are so vitally important and why almost total support should be given to the concepts in the report. There may be some aspects which people might argue about, and that debate can go on in a civilised fashion. However, the thrust of this report-what it says and what it intends-is so vital that I believe it is probably one of the most important reports, if not the most important, that will occupy our attention in the years ahead in terms of lifting our ability to create wealth in this country and thus finance all the other programs that governments have to undertake on behalf of the people of this country. As it is such an important report I ask other people to pay the same attention to it and give it the same priority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report entitled Report on new management techniques in manufacturing industry-people and technology is about new management techniques in the manufacturing industry. I have just joined the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and I have to say that I have had no hand in the preparation or writing of this report, the collection of data, or the examination of submissions and witnesses. But I join my colleague Senator Burns in saying that I think it is a very succinct and important document and one which the Senate, along with government, is bound to take notice of. It should be read closely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report derives from the previous inquiry and report entitled Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation: Making It Together, which I believe was released in September 1988. As Senator Burns has said, it was decided, following that report, to pick up the idea of looking at new management techniques and to see whether or not they had been introduced, or existed at all, as part of a revitalised Australian manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to read a spell-out of what people mean by `new management techniques'. It also talks about the importance of educating employers and employees in the philosophy and practice of such techniques in order to commit all of those involved in the production sector to the techniques, the importance of education and training, both on-the-job and through our educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I read this report closely I became more and more interested to try to find anywhere in it the word `women'. It does not appear anywhere. Any examination of new management techniques looking at practices within industry in this country that devotes not one page, chapter or heading to the importance of the specific needs of women in the work force-let alone women in management-I think needs to be chided. While I have spoken to the people involved and they have said that it includes the word `people'-and, of course, that applies to everybody-what I think has to be highlighted is the fact that sometimes the needs of women in industry are very different and very specific. In fact, the contribution of women is different. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Parliament the Government has made a number of legislative as well as practice changes in order to specifically address the importance and recognition of women in the work force. One of the most important is the Affirmative Action Agency requiring businesses-and in this last year businesses as small as those employing 100 people or more-to describe, after consultation with management and employees and, where possible and practicable, the union movement, exactly what the status of women is in the company or industry; what the levels of employment are; what the levels of remuneration are; whether or not women are sufficiently distributed over all levels in that company or industry and, if not, why not. This is important to try to address ways in which employment opportunities for women can be advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it quite interesting that if one reads about this matter and talks to people involved in affirmative action, one finds that the language used is not too different from what is used in this report under the heading `New Management Techniques'. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of human resources and the importance of education and training-both on-the-job and through our educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> When we put the award restructuring that is going on in this country alongside the requirements of affirmative action, according to Heather Carmody from the Business Council of Australia-if I can remember her comments correctly-award restructuring needs to address the needs of women in the work force in a very different way from the needs of men in the work force. We are told again and again that the requirement of men in the work force is for multiskilling so that they can extend their range of skills, if you like, laterally. </PARA>
<PARA> But the requirements for women under award restructuring are much more to do with developing career paths. Women have job descriptions or award categories that allow them to be multiskilled and to work across a number of job areas, but they do not have anything like the same career opportunities. So the requirements under award restructuring, at least in some places, are significantly different for women. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is interesting that under the heading `New Management Techniques' this document has not alluded to the very important area of award restructuring, better management of the human resource, better access to training and, in particular, better understanding of what we mean by management. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of emphasis in this report on the importance of on-the-job and tertiary training, particularly through the technical and further education (TAFE) sector, because it focuses on the importance of increasing multiskilling in the work force. As I have said, for many women that is not a priority of concern either within their work or within the considerations of award restructuring. It is a shame that those matters not alluded to or highlighted in this report. In personnel management, an area where we often find women-if not at the very top level-the requirements, again, are very different between men and women. I think that this report could have concentrated a little more on not only training for increasing skills through the TAFE sector, but also addressing, very seriously, where managerial skills can best be taught. There is some reference to that, in the report, but I do not believe that it has been developed fully. </PARA>
<PARA> Should we be teaching managerial skills, as least in some ways, to our children in secondary school along with subjects such as economics, accountancy and science? Should we be looking at management courses as part of basic undergraduate courses, particularly in our colleges and universities, where many students will go on to work in industry or in companies at a managerial level? At the moment they gain almost no managerial skills in their undergraduate courses. Indeed, people are often required to return to study either full time or part time once they are in the work force in order to address their need for managerial skills. They undertake courses such as masters of business administration. </PARA>
<PARA> While I support the thrust of this report, there are two very glaring holes in it-the absence of any mention of women and the failure to specifically address the differing needs that clearly are part of new managerial techniques. It is important for Australia to increase its productivity by becoming smarter, leaner and more efficient. In fact, there are specific references in the report to things such as increasing productivity through decreased absenteeism. One of the best ways to decrease the absenteeism of women in the work force is to take away their concern about adequate child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> A parallel commitment by government to increase our efficiency and productivity, economic restructuring, along with the establishment and extension of affordable, quality and available child-care, has made a huge difference to the participation of women in the work force and the opportunities for them to rest easy in their daily work because they know that their children are being adequately cared for. It has been clearly measured in a number of places that that contributes to decreased absenteeism. It also means less requirement for the retraining of skilled workers. I cite just one area worker-that is, the personal private secretary. Very skilled women may retire from the work force temporarily to have a baby. Any number of managers will say that the cost and loss in terms of their productivity and time in trying to prepare another person to assist in this role is another example of a direct cost-a negative one, I suppose-to a successful company. Yet this report, as far as I know, has not mentioned child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> These things are closely associated with increased productivity and, indeed, some of the case studies at the back of this report, which I think make very useful reading, directly address the increased productivity that can come from good management before one addresses the matter of new skills, new technologies, new capital investment and so on. I would hope that further deliberation on and consideration of further matters concerning industry, both by government and this Committee, will in future not overlook the importance of women and their contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the privilege to be a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which drafted the report New Management Techniques in Manufacturing Industry: People and Technology which is before the chamber at this moment. I recently departed from the Committee. In my opening comments on the report, the first thing I would like to do is to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Childs, who guided us through an extended inquiry which flowed from an earlier inquiry which has been mentioned by previous speakers. Senator Childs did a tremendous job in gathering us from all parts of Australia for the purpose of inspections, of visits and for deliberations in private sessions to bring this report to fruition. I thank him for his assistance and guidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also worthy of thanks are the staff of the Committee, particularly Ann Stewart who served the Committee as secretary until September last year. She is a bundle of energy. She left the Committee to move on to other things; she has some regret about leaving the report unfinished, but I would lay odds that Ann is reading this report with as much interest as she gave to her work during the very early stages of the inquiry. Also worthy of mention are Peter Hallahan and Sue Morton, the research staff who assisted us during the inquiry, and our adviser, Michael Welbourn. The people who have been named were invaluable to the Committee as we went about finding out what we could do. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the criticisms of the previous speaker, Senator Crowley, that we did not cover each and every angle and that we actually ignored the participation of women in industry. I take that criticism; I accept it. I think it is something for this Committee and for other committees of the Parliament to keep in mind as they are developing further work like this. However, I will make a slight disclaimer. Very early in this inquiry we made a number of decisions as to how we would restrict ourselves. Not only has the question of women and their role in industry been overlooked but a number of other questions have also been overlooked. For example, the state of the economy has an enormous impact on how industry operates within Australia. We felt that we had to restrict ourselves; otherwise we could possibly end up with an inquiry into how the economy operates. We could have picked up elements of economic activity that would have, and do have, immediate and long term impact on how industry operates within Australia. Again, we decided we would have to restrict ourselves in what we did in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial relations represents another key element in this area. The subject is mentioned in very brief terms in the report. Again, we made a conscious determination that we would restrict our inquiry to the matter of new management techniques and not get diverted onto other equally important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of training has been alluded to. It was addressed at some length in the previous report of the Committee. Very early in this report the point is made that it has to be read in conjunction with the previous report Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation: Making it Together produced in 1988. Whilst I accept Senator Crowley's comments-I am sure they would be accepted by the Committee-I think we have to be careful that we do not go off on one tangent and destroy the report and the recommendations it contains because it left out one essential element-it did not leave out just one essential element; it left out a number of equally important essential elements. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the recommendations in the report. There are 18 specific recommendations being brought to the attention of the Government. We trust that the Government will subject each one to a detailed analysis and scrutiny and that the response from the Government and from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce will be in the affirmative and that our suggestions will be picked up. We shall wait and see whether that happens. The Committee believes that the recommendations that are made are important and will be useful in the introduction of new management techniques into Australian industry. We feel they are extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than reading each and every one of the recommendations into my brief comments this evening, I will just pick up one that has received a degree of publicity and was subject to very deep discussions within the Committee. This recommendation suggests that we hold a series of national conferences to discuss the introduction of new management techniques. Each of us was cynical of the idea of holding conferences because, as we would all know from our work in the Parliament, from conference to conference people can meet up with the same faces, depending on the type of conference that is being attended. We were very much aware of this and of the tremendous value of the interaction that people gain when they meet at a conference when dealing with a matter that is close to them. We were also very clear that we wanted to ensure that we did not at these national conferences-should the Government pick up the Committee's recommendation-just get the professional conference goers. We wanted decision makers to be present at those conferences. We also wanted people who could learn from the interaction of mixing with decision makers. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the idea of those conferences and also another recommendation about international visits. In the report we have mentioned that we have a lot to learn from overseas. We cannot just go overseas and pick up a Japanese, a United States or a British model for the introduction of new management techniques and implement it in Australia. We are a unique society in the same way as Japan, the United States and Britain are unique in their own right. We can certainly learn from them. Experiences from a number of previous international delegations have shown that we have learnt a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> We paid many compliments to a joint Commonwealth and State sponsored organisation-the National Industry Extension Service, known as NIES. We felt that that organisation was doing a tremendous job even though in the early stages it had some teething problems. We paid that organisation deserved compliments, we believe. We were also somewhat critical that an organisation as competent as this one obviously is, had some shortcomings. For example, when the Committee research staff tried to contact NIES staff members, the phone rang out on three occasions. We all know how frustrating it can be when we are on the phone and there is no response. The Committee staff also ran into the problem of ringing a transfer station where people take messages and pass them on. But the people taking the messages did not know anything about NIES. If NIES is to service its constituency, as it were, it has to lift its act in this regard. The first point of call is so important. We do not want people who want to move on and get into new innovations with industry switched off because a telephone is not answered. It smacks a little of sloppiness. </PARA>
<PARA> NIES has other problems in that it operates somewhat differently within each State because it is a Federal and State organisation. There is enormous competition between the States, as we all know. But there are times when we have to put States issues to one side, look to national benefits and have a lot more cooperation between the States, rather than the competition that greatly exists today. With the earlier comments accepting Senator Crowley's criticisms-I trust the report will not be damaged because of those criticisms-I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I am speaking to this report as a recent member of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, but not one who was deeply involved in the later stages of the inquiry into drugs in sport. The reason for this was partly practical. I was chairing another inquiry with a time limit during much of the period between the interim and final reports of this Committee. The difficulty of travel during the pilots dispute was an added problem. But, taking these factors into consideration, I have to say that I also suffered a lack of motivation to participate more fully, particularly after the hearings which led to the interim report, because of my grave concern about the way this inquiry was conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conduct of the inquiry and the hyper-publicity surrounding it have clearly been acceptable to the majority of the Committee, but I believe they are not in the best interests of a balanced inquiry or of the future of the Senate committee system. I point out that this view is not an afterthought. Committee members know that I voiced these concerns from an early stage of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial parts of the inquiry have investigated matters which might be more appropriately investigated in a court, some sort of judicial inquiry, or the ethics body of a profession. Witnesses were probingly, and at time aggressively, questioned about events which might come within the criminal law or allegations which may be defamatory, in a situation which did not allow for the safeguards of legal representation, in most cases, cross-examination or appeal, or the use of the legal rules of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of hearings were conducted before television cameras, often under a blaze of lights and sometimes in the already intimidatory theatre atmosphere of the main committee room in this building. This was not the usual videotaping of short segments for a background to a journalist's report; but full taping of lengthy sections of hearings. Anyone in the television audience watching this show, even when the witness was being questioned in a reasonable way, is likely to think long and hard before offering to appear at a Senate inquiry-unless he or she has their own agenda of blackening a rival or gaining publicity for themselves, as a few witnesses clearly did. For most people it is sufficiently intimidating to appear as a witness before a Senate committee without the added fear of public media scrutiny. Many constituents have expressed these feelings to me and my own reaction has been to think at times of the star chamber atmosphere of some of the United States Senate inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to see a lawyer comment on the 7.30 Report in Melbourne last week that the inquiry reminded him of a kangaroo court. He held that such an inquiry should have been held in camera. He pointed out that, because parts of the evidence were in camera and parts in open hearing, witnesses could make allegations which could not readily be answered by those against whom the allegations were made. He also pointed out that much of the evidence related to events of several years ago. I note the comments of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in her press release. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must be very careful in how we handle this, and ensure there is not undue concentration on what some individuals may, or may not, have done in the past. If we don't, many people will be hurt and ultimately, it will be sport that suffers. It is essential that we look forward rather than backwards. </PARA>
<PARA>She also said that `the Government has no intention of implementing a wholesale witch-hunt'. Perhaps of greater importance, though, is the devotion of the time of this Committee to this inquiry, to the neglect of the many very important areas which might be investigated in the portfolio areas of the environment, recreation and the arts. In fact, this inquiry delayed the progress of work on our prior reference on the environmental impact of development aid, which was tabled recently, and which many Australians would regard as of far more real importance than the question of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are problems with the slender basis for some of the conclusions in the report, but time does not allow me to go into that matter tonight. I certainly do not agree with some of the Committee members-or perhaps the majority of the Committee-that there should be an ongoing commitment of the Committee to the matter of drugs in sport. If the Senate thought that such an ongoing involvement of the Senate was warranted, it could establish a select committee and allow the Standing Committee to take on other inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> By all means, let us seek to make all sport drug-free, but I would be more concerned about educating young people about the health risks of taking performance-enhancing drugs-or, indeed, any drugs-than whether some adult cheated some years ago or an official erred by inadvertent omission rather than commission. As a letter writer wrote to the Age last week:</PARA>
<PARA>If sportspersons resort to drugs in order to gain an unfair advantage and kill themselves in the process, so be it. I won't worry. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in future sessions of Parliament turns to more socially useful inquiries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what it was, and if the Minister had read the report he would know that. The Committee report was adopted unanimously by every political party in this Parliament. I am staggered to hear an Australian Labor Party senator suggest that, if an athlete dies from an overdose of drugs, so be it. The tragedy is that, as evidence given to the Committee demonstrated, children as young as 13 and 14 years of age have been provided with anabolic steroids by their parents. The Committee received evidence of athletes having died of massive heart attacks because of a lack of understanding and a lack of awareness of the effects of the use and abuse of drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great tragedy for young people and adolescents who are not yet through puberty taking anabolic steroids is that it closes their bone ends and stunts their growth. They become dwarfs. There is a long record of deaths in sport as a result of the use and abuse of drugs. If there is one thing lacking in the Australian community at all levels of sport and society, it is an education process as to the effects that illegal, performance-enhancing drugs can have on the human body. I am absolutely staggered, but not surprised, I suppose, that Senator Zakharov would think that it is important to have an inquiry into the effects on the environment of our foreign aid to other countries than it is to concern ourselves about the health of our athletes and our children-our future generation. It says something about priorities that we are very much more concerned about whales than we are about human lives. I always thought that that was a rather quaint priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry, in my view, was not an easy one because it involved people's egos and, to some degree, people's reputations. Whenever it was likely that hearsay evidence was going to be introduced by a witness we took it in camera. That can never be proved to the satisfaction of the majority of the Senate, but Senator Zakharov, who sat on the Committee and who has access to in camera evidence, is somebody who would know that. </PARA>
<PARA> To criticise the findings of the Committee simply gives succour and comfort to the cheats and the crooks, the pedlars of these illicit, illegal and dangerous drugs. I would have thought that there was nothing more irresponsible than that. </PARA>
<PARA> For the duration of the inquiry, each political party in this Parliament had a representative on it. It was conducted in a bipartisan way. The recommendations and the findings that flow from the report are based on substantial evidence and a reasonable reading of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Without exception, to my understanding, thus far not one recommendation of the interim report has been rejected by the Government. While the Government has not yet, of course, responded to the second report, I am not aware of its intention to reject any of the findings save for one which calls for the setting up of an independent drug testing appeals tribunal, which is intended to provide a forum for athletes and sporting bodies who judge they have been unfairly and unreasonably treated. I understand the Government's view is that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is adequate for that. It is not our view, but it is intended as a future and further safety mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> The great tragedy is that there is not within the community a greater awareness of the effects that drugs are having upon our athletes or a full awareness of the level and depth of the use of drugs, not only by elite athletes but by athletes at all levels of the sporting community. It is a pity that the findings of the report which have thus far been reported in the media are the more controversial recommendations and that the issues of great moment are those such as whether Jane Flemming ought to be further investigated, the recommendations relating to setting up tribunals or recommendations in terms of the conduct of doctors who prescribe veterinary and human anabolic steroids and the conduct of chemists-in one case 700 prescriptions of animal anabolic steroids were provided in a period of seven months-and whether they ought to be investigated. There are wide-ranging recommendations which, as I say, in my view will be accepted and endorsed by the Government and, I am certain, embraced by each of the political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there have been officials and athletes who have been unhappy with the report, and that is natural. I think this is probably the first inquiry that has ever investigated in a proper way the use of taxpayers' money in the funding of sport. Had it not been for this inquiry we would be down where we are--</PARA>

<PARA>The document with regard to unproclaimed legislation is one of a series that the Senate receives twice a year, one which has a relatively recent history in this form but quite a long history, as some honourable senators may know, in another form. It is an important document in terms of the way that we do our business and this one has some interesting further items in it. Thirty-four items that appeared on the previous document that we got six months ago are still in here, and there are 16 new items. Some of our old favourites, unfortunately, have disappeared. Our early 1920s unproclaimed legislation had dropped off, unfortunately; however, an old chestnut of the Naval Properties Transfer Act 1925 is still with us and we are still beavering away to endeavour to get something done on this particular interesting piece of legislation. If honourable senators can but hold their breath, we are informed that in the autumn session of 1990 we will at last dispose of this rather interesting piece of legislation which some parliament in 1925, in the full flush of its vigour, managed to pass and which we have never done anything with. So it is very nice that this Parliament in 1990 will finally put the kybosh on something from 1925. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn to page 2 of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act of 1989. This is one of the new items and it is noted that its provisions will come into effect on 30 September 1990. The reason for that is that, as a result of the Senate insisting on this particular document, the drafting instructions which have been given have been altered so that new legislation coming into this chamber either has a date or comes into operation six months from the date of royal assent. Indeed, if we look on the following page, we find that the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 says:</PARA>
<PARA>This Act received Royal Assent on 17 January 1990 and will automatically come into operation six months and one day after Royal Assent, unless proclaimed before that date. Proclamation before 18 July 1990 is unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, people have not managed to get around to following the new operation. Whether they like it or not, this will happen automatically on 18 July. I think that is a very important move for this chamber and the Parliament in general, and I hope that in coming years honourable senators will concentrate at least on this item to make sure that the departments of state are kept up to that particular proposal and that they will take the opportunity, when these debates come around every six months, to go through these documents to make sure that the departments are keeping up on this. </PARA>
<PARA> This document contains the normal long list of parliamentary time wasting that we have come to accept. Unfortunately, the Attorney-General's Department is the worst. It has wasted more time and not done anything with it than any other department. Considering the very small amount of time we have in this chamber-I know that the Minister at the table, Senator Tate, has often complained about how little legislative time we get in the ordinary course of a day-it would be nice if we dealt with Bills which did something rather than Bills that are left to languish in a bureaucrat's drawer for days, months, and, in fact, years on end. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 we all gathered our collective wisdom to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Bill. I remember it because I spoke in the debate about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). We deliberated at great length and, in our wisdom, changed the legislation. ASIO had in fact employed people on a statutory basis. We thought that this was no good. So the Parliament had the collective wit to pass a piece of legislation to put it on a contractual basis. However, it has now been decided that that is no good at all and that we might as well stay with the statutory basis. So we are going to repeal that piece of legislation. That must be a prime example of parliamentary time wasting. But it also reflects on both the Attorney-General's Department, which brought it in, the Parliament for passing it and, now, the bureaucrats for even suggesting it. Now that they have changed their minds, they want to change the Parliament's mind. I must admit that if I were here to deal with this matter, I have a sneaking suspicion that the repeal Bill should be defeated. But that would probably be somewhat churlish with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cash Transaction Reports Act is interesting, not because it is a new addition to the list-it is not; it has been there before-but because we are given a whole new reason why nothing is happening. An interesting feature in respect of this Act is that different reasons are given for its being unproclaimed. Some reasons run out in the fullness of time and cannot be used any more or new people write them. What I like about this document is that the job of creating it seems to have been given to someone who knows what he is doing as distinct from the person who wrote the previous document. It is evident that that document had been given to someone a long way down the line who had not the faintest idea what the legislation was about or what possible reasons could be given to the Parliament for wasting its time. However, in the current document we are getting a lot of better reasons from some departments. Again, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has managed to find someone in the Department who actually knows what the pieces of legislation are about. In the case of the Cash Transaction Reports Act, we have a reason which actually makes some sense. I hope that in future the departments will continue to give this job to somebody who knows what he is going. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw attention to some of the other Acts from a different viewpoint. When the Circuit Layouts Act and the Copyright Amendment Act were dealt with in this place-I think Senator Puplick was involved in this exercise-they were considered to be of the utmost urgency. We were brought together in a rush. We had to get these things through and really move them along. We were told that there was time wasting during the committee stage. Now we see that this legislation is still languishing around. The following comments are made in respect of the Circuit Layouts Act:</PARA>
<PARA> It now appears that early enactment of these amendments will not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department was not organised in that it did not get the timetable right. We dealt with the Circuit Layouts Act before the Government signed the Washington Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits. The Department then found that it had to change the Act which had been passed a month or two earlier. At that stage we were told that we were holding up the legislation. Having held it up, we are now told:</PARA>
<PARA> It now appears that early enactment of the amendments will not be possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, we are to go ahead with the piece of legislation we passed in the first place. It would be nice if people could get their acts together, but I suppose that that is a bit too much to ask. But if they cannot, I wonder whether the Government would look at its general timetable and see what treaties or major conferences are coming up which are likely to impact on the legislation which we are called together hurriedly to consider, to vote on with a great deal of urgency and flurry, and which is allowed to languish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Hostages) Act has received a new reason-a far better reason than last time. Seemingly, the same person from the Attorney-General's Department has managed to find out a lot about these Acts. This is rather nice to see. One of the nice things about some of these reasons is that they tell us what is going to happen and why. The intent of this Parliament's motion was to try to find out what was going on and not be subject to a little bit of Yes, Minister treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Department of Community Services and Health should get a special medal this time. It has found a new phrase which undoubtedly will occur again and again-that is:</PARA>
<PARA>It is intended to repeal these provisions as soon as the priorities of the Government's legislation program will allow. </PARA>
<PARA>As this Department is not the only department that uses this phrase, obviously somebody has actually thought it up over a drink in a bar somewhere. This has now become the accepted phrase to pop in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is a nice one. However, it falls rather flat in the case of Community Services and health because it was around last time. In fact, it is one of our chestnuts. This phrase could have been tacked on to three pieces of legislation from that Department. `As soon as the priorities of the Government's legislation program will allow' probably means the same thing as saying `as soon as possible'. But `possible' does not seem to be when the Parliament will make it possible, but when somebody else gets around actually to putting the things into the legislation. Can I suggest that that phrase could be tacked onto other Bills which are coming through with regard to health legislation. I am quite sure that no-one in the Senate would object to this in the slightest. The Senate Clerks and others have to keep these matters in some order for the courts, lawyers and advisers, and members of the community need to know what laws they are supposed to observe. That being so, it would make everybody else's job a lot easier if we got rid of most of these Acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are having another `hasten slowly' exercise in respect of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986. We are going to do it again `as soon as the priorities will allow'. I have commented before on the Control of Naval Waters Amendment Act. I am very glad to see that this is the last time we are going to see this Act around because these long extended debates that the Commonwealth has been having, presumably since 1978, with the States have finally come to fruition. We are breathlessly informed that an agreement has been reached. I am sure that all of those people who have been hanging on for the Control of Naval Waters Amendment Act can now rest easy. Agreement has been reached and it is going to be out of the way on 1 August. So vale to the control of the Naval Waters Amendment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember discussing the Laying Chicken Levy Act. This may strike honourable senators as odd, but it was actually debated with legislation dealing with booze and muesli at the end of the session. The Laying Chicken Levy Collection Act is another staggering Bill. It is nice to know that these Acts will be proclaimed on 1 July. I am sure that the chooks will be delighted. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one last comment with regard to an absolutely irresistible favourite of mine: the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act. This is a gem. In 1947, the Parliament, in its wisdom, passed a piece of legislation which, among other things, required that pensioners and beneficiaries had to notify the Department of Social Security of certain changed circumstances. In 1983 we actually got around to taking out section 163, and thereby hangs a tale. Between 1947 and 1983 we were moving pretty rapidly. We had to hold everything in suspended animation because, as the statement of reasons says, `a small group of clients had not yet received forms requiring notification under section 163'. The commencement of those provisions would have excused those clients from notifying changed circumstances. As honourable senators doubtless will be aware, all social security clients have now received that notice. I remind honourable senators that the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill went through in 1983; it is now 1990, so I am glad that we have managed it at last. The statement of reasons says that the fact that all social security clients had now received a notice makes it possible to repeal the 1983 provisions; I think the 1947 provisions, rather than the 1983 provisions, are meant. </PARA>
<PARA> I did a little calculation which leads me to hope that the particular pensioners we are referring to were not old age pensioners in 1947, because they would now be 103. I really think we could have left the poor old dears alone and not harassed them with requirement of notification under section 163, no matter how assiduous we were. I really believe we should have let them live the twilight of their lives without giving them this onerous paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, having read the statement of reasons, honourable senators will now know that this is all about to end on 1 June 1990. Because I will not be around I would have been upset if I had not been able to comment on this matter yet again, but it is nice to know that it has all been settled and those 103-year-olds can now rest easy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They can rest easy, watching television; although to watch the Senate must be an even worse fate than that mentioned by Senator Tate. They can rest easy and not have to fill out forms under section 163. Although I said that in a somewhat joking fashion, it is a serious matter; it is an important matter. As I have said in passing, the reason for that is this: We have a principle in law that says that you have to obey the laws and that ignorance of the law is not an excuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until the Senate insisted on this particular item, the difficulty was in actually finding out what was the law. The passage though this Parliament does not make it the law; the royal assent does not make it the law; it is not law until it is proclaimed. Yet the courts have been guessing, legal practitioners certainly have been guessing, and almost everybody in the community has been guessing at what precisely the law is. At least now twice a year we are able to go through this tidying up exercise. I want to say to the people in the departments who engaged in this exercise that we are making progress, I value the work that they have put in, and I hope that every department will be just that little bit more assiduous. I am quite sure we can get down this number quite considerably by looking at any legislation that is coming through to see whether it might be a suitable vehicle to do the repealing work that is necessary. Once we get this in order-and I think it probably ought to be able to be done within the next 12 months-we will then have a slender document. It will be dealing only with quite recent pieces of legislation. In that regard, it will make the certainty of the law in everybody's mind a much more obtainable goal. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one last appeal. Not many senators have shown an interest in this particular matter. Senator Puplick is one, and he is leaving at the same time as I am. I hope that other honourable senators will see this as an important item that should be drawn attention to and will, in fact, draw such attention to it over the next two to three years when I think it will be crucial to embed this as a feature of the Senate's work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to start off by echoing the concluding remarks of Senator Macklin. He is correct in saying that he and I will be leaving this place at the end of this session and that by and large we have been, I think, the only senators to follow and pursue the question of unproclaimed legislation. I believe that other people have a responsibility now to take up this particular challenge because we are in a situation in which we are given these reports only because of the original insistence of this chamber to know what the status of legislation was. This is the fourth report which we have had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I start off by commending whoever is responsible for the cover page-I presume it is likely to be officers of the Senate rather than officers of any department-which does actually have a date on it. Honourable senators will recall that on the last occasion we complained about the fact that we had a very lengthy document, at that stage of some 25 pages, which had no date on it. It was virtually impossible to work out whether it was the first, second or third in the series. This is now the fourth and, as Senator Macklin says, it contains some golden oldies including the Naval Properties Transfer Act of 1925, and it includes some additions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take a moment just to mention one or two of the matters which remain on the list. It is interesting that in relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act 1987 in the previous report the following comment was made:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not intended that paragraph 23 (1) (ea) be proclaimed at present pending further consideration of the effects of the provision. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Department was actually saying, `Now that we have passed this Act we will actually think about what it means and, until we have thought about what it means, we are not going to proclaim it'. We are presumably to accept the wonderful argument that when the Department actually presented the legislation to us it decided that it ought to come clean and ought to confess. It did not actually know what the effect of the legislation was going to be when it brought the legislation to the Parliament and, because it has now actually had a couple of thoughts about what the effect of the legislation might be, it will eventually get round to its proclamation in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> I am vaguely sorry to see the end of the Naval Properties Transfer Act 1925. It is an old and familiar friend. We are told that the intention of the Government is that in the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill, introduced during the autumn session 1990, there are provisions for the repeal of this Act. As I said by way of interjection, it will be interesting to see whether the sections which repeal the 1925 Act are themselves proclaimed in good time. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come to the question of what I might call, I guess, subsidiary unproclaimed legislation just to test whether this document is entirely accurate. Senator Macklin has mentioned the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1989. I find it passing strange that the Government introduces amendments to electoral law and then has the capacity to determine which parts of electoral law that the Parliament has approved that it will cause to be put in place prior to an election. This is a most extraordinary principle, because there could be a situation in which, theoretically, the Parliament decided to abolish compulsory voting but an election was imminent and the Government decided, after it had done a bit of research, that for the next election it might like to hang on to compulsory voting and abolish compulsory voting only after the election was over. Yet this is what has happened with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act-the Government selectively decided, prior to the March election, which parts of the new electoral legislation, which had been passed by the Parliament in expectation that they would govern the conduct of a forthcoming election, were to be introduced, proclaimed and operative for the election which then came upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I think that that is a most dangerous principle, and I think that when the Senate in future looks at electoral legislation in particular it should have careful mind as to whether, when it is a Bill as complicated as the 1989 amendment Act was-many of the parts and clauses related to each other-there should be any capacity for the Act to be proclaimed in part. It should be a requirement of that sort of legislation that it is a take it or leave it, one in all in provision. The capacity to proclaim parts but leave other parts swinging in the wind until after an election has been concluded is not a legitimate tool to leave in the hands of government, particularly since no government with the capacity to influence electoral law, over and above the way in which the Parliament has influenced electoral law, should be allowed potentially to advantage itself by deciding what is to be given effect and what is not. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention the Koongarra Project Area Act. We are told that section 3 will not be proclaimed until the current review of the Australian Labor Party's uranium policy is completed and the Government decides on the future of mining at Koongarra. That was not the understanding of the Parliament. When it passed the Act, it had a clear understanding of what that policy was supposed to be. Here again is a piece of legislation which, we are told, having been passed by the Parliament, must now wait upon ratification by the ALP's National Conference. What a scandal it is to be told that an Act of Parliament will be frustrated, and part of it will not be proclaimed, until such time as the executive, or the policy making body of one of the political parties, decides whether or not that part of the legislation of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia should be brought into effect. That is equally scandalous. It is a contempt of the Parliament, in my view, for that sort of situation to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention next the Hazardous Waste Regulation of Exports and Imports Act 1989. I note that the important thing about that is that it is one of the pieces of legislation-again, Senator Macklin has mentioned this-that comes into operation six months and one day after royal assent, unless proclaimed before that date. That is a very important trigger mechanism-that there will be automatic effect of certain pieces of legislation if proclamation is delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I look at the Copyright Amendment Act 1989. I see that some of the sections cannot be brought into operation until the collecting societies, which are required to be established under the Act, have been approved and formed, with the authority of the Attorney-General, under subsection 135zzb (1). Again, I believe that an excessive delay has occurred here. The collecting societies could well have been put in place, could well have been authorised by the Attorney-General, prior to this date if the Attorney-General had not been so dilatory in his responsibilities in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not refer to the community services and health area. Senator Macklin has adequately covered that area. I mention the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. We are told that the delay here is the need to prepare supporting regulations. I think the Parliament has a right, from time to time, to insist on seeing the regulations before it actually allows other things to proceed. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we created a precedent in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Act by requiring a new method of dealing with regulations. We said that until the regulations had been approved by the Parliament, the primary Act was of no effect. Again, I hope that departments of state will come to understand that in the Senate our determination to see regulatory instruments prior to giving assent in the normal fashion is something which is proceeding apace. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention two other very brief matters. I refer honourable senators to the comments that Senator Macklin made in relation to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Amendment Act 1986. Parliament undertook reforms because it was told they were necessary. We took some time to debate those reforms. Once we passed those reforms some bureaucrat decided that they were not necessary. We are now to wait for another piece of legislation or regulatory arrangement to unscramble the situation about which we got ourselves into knots trying to establish in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Unnecessary delays are again taking place in respect of the Circuit Layouts Act. One would have thought that consultations with industry would have taken place before the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986. Here is a 1986 Act-and we are still waiting on extensive consultations with industry before we can get into that particular matter. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1983 was held up so that a small group of clients could be accommodated, whatever that particularly means. The Satellite Communications Amendment Act, in respect of which we are now told that we have to wait until Aussat's satellite footprint is properly reviewed before it can be brought into effect, was a major piece of legislation in which the role of Aussat in providing services to what were called neighbouring regions was going to be an important element in the telecommunications strategy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At least we are better off than some of our colleagues in places like the United Kingdom, where the proclamation of various schedules to Acts of Parliament is an absolute nightmare. The Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, was good enough to provide me with a copy of statutory instrument 1985 No. 70(C.2), which has a schedule of the arrangements by which the Control of Pollution Act 1974 is to be brought into effect. Frankly, the thing is an absolute nightmare. </PARA>

<PARA> The last point I make is that there do appear to be some questions about the accuracy of this particular document. The first matter I raise is that the unproclaimed sections of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1985 were apparently repealed by the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act (No. 4) 1989. That may not be entirely accurate in its reflection in this document. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as to the corporations legislation, it appears that some of the items on the previous list are tied by their commencement clauses to the proclamation of another Act, namely, the Corporations Act 1989, the relevant chapters of which have still not been proclaimed. However, the Corporations (Fees) Act 1989 itself is dependent on proclamation and is also missing from the list. In any case, it would appear to me that, as a general principle, Acts which are dependent for their starting date on another Act which relies on proclamation should properly be included on the list, as indeed was the case on previous lists. </PARA>
<PARA> I, therefore, conclude by saying that I am very pleased to have played some small role in bringing into the Senate a new procedure and a new scrutiny of executive behaviour in this regard. I do hope that honourable senators who will be remaining in this place will take some interest in this question of proclamation of legislation, because it has become a real eye-opener to me to follow this over the course of the last two years and to see the extent to which the Parliament, having acted in good faith in that it has passed legislation which it expects to come into effect, finds that by executive fiat or bureaucratic inertia its clear intentions are frustrated. I do not believe that Parliament should allow that to pass without comment. I do not believe that Parliament, as a principle, should allow it to continue the way in which it has in the last couple of years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of these matters refer quite specifically to various clauses. I would be happy to try to sort them out, but it may be simpler to ask them here. One follows on from the question about how the State governments will disburse the moneys that they receive. My problem with that is that undoubtedly the moneys will be paid in by certain firms which have failed to reach the level of training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My first concern relates to a particular industry which is geographically situated. The car industry is a geographically situated industry. I do not think the car industry will be prominent in this, but we can use it as an example. It may fall below the level and may pay in a significant amount of money. If the money is disbursed on the basis of payroll-I understand that is the proposal-undoubtedly Queensland will receive some of that; although Queensland has a Volvo assembly plant it does not produce as many cars as does South Australia or Victoria. My concern relates to the inequitable distribution using that particular method. </PARA>
<PARA> My second concern is about the industries which have under trained. The Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges are very active in this area. TAFE perhaps does not offer a particular course. The reason for that would be that those industries have not sought training, hence TAFE has not introduced a course. Why should TAFE put a course on even now, despite the fact that this particular industry has under trained. The only way I can see around that is by identifying where we are falling down and seeking to compensate that deficiency in a pro-active way. In other words, if this deficiency lay in the hospitality area of the tourist industry, we might seek to promote those courses through TAFE by going to TAFE directly, asking that the courses be introduced and paying the money necessary. We would also go out and promote those particular courses to that industry. That seems to be a rational way to expend the money. At the end of the day perhaps nobody would be paying any money into the coffers, which after all has to be the intent of this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The way that the Government has proceeded is likely to take us a longer way to get there. The States will not necessarily follow that line. I well understand the difficulties that the Commonwealth has in Federation and its rancour with the States in this regard. But unless some direction is provided I cannot see why the States would spend this money on those areas that have under trained. They could very well just turn around and spend it on areas that have sufficient training. This will depend on the education politics of the State and a whole range of other matters. In other words, the intent of the Bill could very well be frustrated. </PARA>

That in itself will provide a great incentive to firms to spend the required amounts themselves. Senator Macklin is right about where gaps might exist. The mechanisms in place are very much structured to highlight those gaps. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister gave information in answer to my first question that I think all of us already know. I was trying to ascertain what sort of courses the Government envisages the money will be spent upon. For example, can a State spend it to fund the courses it already has in the technical and further education (TAFE) system? It would seem from what I have heard that that would be appropriate. The Minister talked about spending it in relation to award restructuring. I do not fully understand what he has in mind when he says that. A TAFE college, or most of them, would have a payroll in excess of $200,000. Are they automatically exempt because all of the money they are spending is on training programs in any event, or are they expected to pay something in addition? What sort of programs would be relevant for them?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have stated a number of times that what we are talking about here is additional training programs. In terms of funding existing programs that would not be part of the parameters of the program under this particular Bill. We are talking about additional funding. In terms of defining what sort of training program is in place, it is quite apparent that Senator Reid is talking about a very wide spread of industry and commerce. Training programs are geared towards the particular needs of industries, employees in that industry and the ultimate skills needs of those industries. Without wanting to give closer definition to it, it will be developed. We do have tripartite bodies in each State which will be able to focus on needs in those particular States in terms of where money should go. It would be almost impossible and extremely time-consuming to go through a list industry by industry and indicate what sorts of programs we anticipate. It will be very much geared towards ensuring that tripartite groups and State governments, as well as the Federal Government, have a role in ensuring that adequate training programs are developed in a whole diverse number of ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third question was in respect of technical and further education (TAFE) itself. I am informed that TAFE colleges would be categorised within the umbrella of the one State government for the purposes of the Act and the State public utility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 1, clause 2, line 9, leave out ``1 July 1990''; insert ``1 January 1991''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment proposed by the Opposition is to change the date of commencement of the Act from 1 July 1990 to  1 January 1991. The Opposition has already made it very clear in the second reading debate, and through my attempts on its behalf, to refer this Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill to a Senate standing committee. The Opposition is by no means satisfied that this Bill has been available for long enough for all those affected by it to come to grips with it. The answer that the Minister has given to that is `Oh well, the whole proposal has been around for a long time. We did have a Bill out at the end of last year and people should have dropped everything that they were doing, all their other responsibilities and concerns, and concentrate on our proposal'. That is typical of the attitude of this Government on numerous matters, namely, the whole community is supposed to wait on it rather than it trying to consult with the community and give it the opportunity to make its contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Bill was introduced into the Parliament on only 10 May. For Senator Macklin's benefit I assure him that this is the Bill that I, and other Opposition senators, have been working on in this debate. It is not the old Bill. There are many difficulties with this piece of legislation which we have sought, in the course of the debate, to point out. At this stage we would hope that if this Bill is going to be passed more or less in its present form, which seems to be the case in view of the attitude of the Australian Democrats, at least people will be given a reasonable opportunity to be properly instructed on it. They will also have the opportunity to study it and get advice about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, there are a number of very important things that the Government still has to do to bring this Bill into a state in which it can be brought into effect. Part 10 of the Bill, which deals with the registration of industrial training agents, and section 43, which deals with the granting of training advisory certificates, do not need to come into operation until 1 January 1991. It certainly seems very likely that that date will be the effective date. </PARA>
<PARA> People have got to have these industrial training agents appointed. Indeed, the Bill contemplates that guidelines will be passed in regard to the appointment of such persons. Again, part 10 of the Bill deals with this, and it does not have to come into operation until 1 January next year. As I have said, guidelines may well be made by the Minister in relation to the appointment of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, clause 30 of the Bill provides that the Minister may make guidelines in relation to eligible training programs. We have already pointed out the very great difficulties there are in giving effect to the provisions of clause 27 about eligible training programs. There are major difficulties that are going to arise there. Guidelines certainly will be required and hopefully will be of some help. This is going to be one of the key sections of the Act and is going to give rise to some of the most difficult decisions. Clearly, the appointment of industrial training agents is going to be a very important part of that process, yet they may not be able to be appointed until the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are some very clear reasons within the terms of the Bill itself why 1 July is an inappropriate date to choose. Also, a lot of the more formal training courses do not commence in the middle of the year. I understand that they are more likely to be commencing at the beginning of a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, the Opposition's case in relation to this amendment is that further time is desperately going to be needed by people who are going to be affected by this legislation. In order for them to really understand it, they will need to get professional advice. They will need to get the advice of industrial training agents and other industry advisory councils who will have a role to play in this. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, this whole exercise is likely to get off the ground in a much more satisfactory way if the commencement of the legislation is postponed to 1 January 1991. When all is said and done, much legislation-in many cases, difficult and new legislation-is given a reasonable time after it passes through the Parliament before it is proclaimed, or the date on which it is to take effect is a time considerably in the future, or it waits until the Government has got its act ready and can proclaim it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing unusual whatsoever in having a date which is, in effect, now only seven months after this Bill has been passed. As I said, much legislation has been postponed for a longer period than that. Here there are many things that the Government itself has got to do before people can reasonably be expected to know how the legislation affects them. If the Government delays for some time in relation to doing some of these things it has to do, then that gives people even less time to get that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that the guidelines that the Minister may make under this legislation can be disallowed. Even if the Government moved quickly over the next two or three months to get these guidelines it may well be that, upon examination by this chamber, some of them would be disallowed, and that would mean a greater compression of time. In fact, it would be after the Bill has come into operation. Even if it is deferred until 1 January, it would mean a greater compression on the time that everybody has to find out what their obligations are. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice of 1 July this year is really quite unreasonable and most surprising. It is an example of the way the Government has rushed through this whole piece of legislation. Again, I emphasise that we are not talking about the fact that it has been discussed, in general terms, for some period. We are talking about this particular legislation having been rushed through. It was introduced in the House of Representatives on 10 May and debated there, I think, on 16 May. A guillotine was put down and even the Minister in charge of the legislation did not get an opportunity to reply to the debate. There was no opportunity for the Opposition's amendments to be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> So it really has become an absurd proposition. This is a new tax. It is a complicated piece of legislation and one on which people are going to need a lot of advice. They will certainly need help from these very important people-the industry training agents-who cannot be appointed for some time. It is bordering on the absurd to expect that this Bill could be effectively brought into force within a month; namely, 1 July. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two points in support of the amendment moved by Senator Durack. Since the proposed guidelines will not be available until 1 January 1991, employers, naturally, are likely to defer their training until the last six months of the calendar year because, as I pointed out before, there is no substituted accounting period. This will create a large number of practical problems. Because the Bill is intended to operate from 1 July 1990, unfortunately, as Senator Durack has said, employers will not know whether expenditure incurred after that date will qualify as eligible training expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this chamber we have seen the deferral of guidelines and the deferral of legislation on several occasions over the years. We saw that happen with the superannuation package and the income tax legislation. That causes tremendous difficulties to the participants who have to abide by the legislation but lack the substance of guidelines and regulations. I believe that we are passing bad law when we cannot introduce simultaneously the guidelines or the regulations that should accompany a Bill. Therefore I support, through this amendment, the deferment of the operation of the legislation to 1 January in lieu of 1 July. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The surprising thing about this amendment is that it has been brought in by the Opposition and not by the Government. It seems incredible that the Government would expect a piece of legislation of this kind to be operating and dealt with by businesses, large and small, when it is quite clear that the Government is not able to tell them what is expected of them. At the very least I would hope that the Minister would give a very clear undertaking that no-one would be prosecuted for anything that may have occurred in the first six months of the Bill's operation, when it is clear that people will not know exactly what is going on, what they are required to do, or what the guidelines might retrospectively inflict upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, the Minister is a lawyer trained by a very highly respected legal institution. I would like him to tell the Senate that he, himself, is comfortable with a situation in which the Government is requiring business to embark upon a tax program the guidelines for which have not been made available. I cannot believe that the Minister, with the training that he has had, with the degree qualification that he has, can stand up in this place and tell us-as Nick Bolkus, not as the Minister-that he believes that that sort of thing is right, that it is a proper way for any government to behave.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing I know, and one thing the Opposition does not know, is that we are not now starting with legislation that has been pulled out of the bottom of a hat. Consultation has occurred on drafts of this legislation for quite some time. Let us get that little fallacy out of the way. Consultation has taken place with peak bodies and with bodies representing small business groups. Draft legislation was sent many months ago to groups such as the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Small Business Development Corporation, the Australian Small Business Association, the Victorian Employers Federation, the Small Business Development Corporation in Victoria and the Gippsland small business centre. Quite healthy and substantial comments were received from a number of those organisations. They have been involved in the consultative process, unlike the Opposition which has just woken up to the fact that it has legislation before it. If Opposition members cannot find a file which has been at the bottom of their desks for seven years it is no wonder they cannot find this legislation in seven days.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they could read it, they could probably see some pretty basic things in it such as, before making the guidelines, the Minister has to take into consideration any relevant recommendations by the training advisory body. Do Opposition members not understand-it is funny that they do not-that we are talking about industry that does not change? Of course, they probably do not understand it. They are still living in the horse and buggy days. How can we put out guidelines today that will suit the processes for ever in the future? The provision of guidelines is a flexibility that is needed in the legislation to ensure that industry changes can be accommodated from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Deferral provisions in respect of registered industry training agents are in place. That has been worked out in a quite constructive and cooperative way between the Government and the Australian Democrats, unlike the way we have responses from the Opposition every time any piece of legislation comes into this place. We have worked out a situation constructively with respect to deferral. The Minister has already stated that industry training agents will be operational by 1 January. It has already been made clear that during that period employers will self-assess with the assistance of industry associations and the advisory services provided by the Australian Taxation Office. It has also been made clear that the legislation can effectively stand on its own, as it stands now. As I have said, in other areas guidelines will be developed as the need arises. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been consultation. The Government has been constructive in the way in which it has approached consultations for quite some time. Draft legislation was widely distributed to industry in February. Mechanisms are in place to ensure that interested organisations and employers are made aware of their obligations by the end of May this year. Full educational packages and so on will be sent to employers later on. Officials and all sorts of mechanisms will be set in place to handle inquiries. I will conclude on one thing: the Government believes it has done enough. It can be recognised in the community that it has done a lot in terms of responding to the legitimate needs of industry in this area. It is a pity that, once again, the Opposition has been left standing at the starting post. The Government will oppose this amendment. </PARA>

The Minister says that the Government has been negotiating with all these people. I know the Government has persuaded the Australian Democrats that this is a great idea but vast numbers of other people with whom the Minister or his colleague have been dealing are by no means satisfied with this legislation. The Minister is trying to present the picture that here we have great widespread support for this Bill from industry and that the Opposition should be simply going along with what everybody wants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was directing attention to the Minister's argument where he was dealing with the Opposition's amendment in which we pointed out that, with all the difficulties that there are with the legislation, people will need to have time to work on them. He is trying to say, `Industry knows all about it. We have been consulting it all this time. All industry is happy about it. It has no worries about this Bill. Industry can get on and have it imposed upon it on 1 July'. I am pointing out to the Minister and the Committee that in fact that is far from the case, and large numbers of complaints have been brought to our attention by industry-large, small and medium-which is thoroughly alarmed and concerned about this legislation, and about the way it will impact on industry and the lack of clarity about many aspects of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was about to read out some of the concerns that the Confederation of Australian Industry, as recently as 23 April, has expressed to my colleague the shadow Minister for employment and training. It says that the Government should identify clearly the extent and types of training now being carried out; investigate and support a full evaluation of the future training needs of each industry sector so their particular needs are properly defined; promote the establishment, in conjunction with employers, of the resources needed to meet identified training needs; and ensure the articulation of outcomes expected from this training process. That is a pretty heavy criticism of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill and this Government's proposals. That was made as recently as 23 April. It is not a question of the Opposition suddenly dreaming up a whole lot of objections to the Bill. The fact is that, after this so-called consultative process has gone on, large sections across the whole range of industry that will be affected by this legislation are expressing great concern about the situation that they are confronted with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay honourable senators any longer than I need to but I wish to raise two matters briefly in the chamber this evening. The first one concerns the standard of protection given to members of the public who enter into residential building contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been approached by an association, known as the Building Action Review Group, to take up its concerns at the unsatisfactory level of protection given to home builders. When I looked at the specific case drawn to my attention-that of Mrs Irene and Mr Joseph Onorati of Drummoyne, New South Wales-unfortunately I found there was not a lot of practical assistance I could give them, largely because the matters they raised with me were State issues and of a legal nature. Nevertheless, I felt that if I could draw attention to their plight it might at least give them some comfort as well as warn others of the pitfalls of entering into such residential building contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Onoratis entered into a contract with Phillips Constructions Pty Ltd in August 1984. This company undertook to build for them five home units on their land at Drummoyne under what is known as a standard BC3 contract. On completion, the building was found to be defective in many respects. This was confirmed by the advice received by the Onoratis from independent architects, engineers, the New South Wales Builders Licensing Board and others. The Onoratis withheld the final payment, I think reasonably, to Phillips Constructions of $120,000 until the defects, some of which were quite serious, were rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> The builder exercised his right under the contract to take the matter to arbitration. Mr Donald Bruce Maxwell was appointed arbitrator in this case. Despite the evidence brought by the Onoratis from independent architects, engineers and the Builders Licensing Board as to the building's defects and the estimated cost of rectifying them of $500,000, the arbitrator ordered that the builder pay them only $84,000. He also ordered that the Onoratis pay the builder's costs of the arbitration totalling $280,000 and the arbitrator's costs of $19,000. As well, they were left to pay their own legal costs of $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Onoratis then availed themselves of such avenues as were available to them to get justice in the courts but found these were too limited for their circumstances. The contract which they had signed made arbitration mandatory as the method of settling disputes, and the arbitrator's decision had, despite the evidence, gone substantially against them. They are now left with a defective building, liabilities for its rectification and other costs totalling about $1m. Phillips Constructions lost its builder's licence, and the company went into liquidation. However, I have been told that the principal of that company has set up in business since under a new company structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Onoratis are facing financial ruin and, understandably, are suspicious about the process of arbitration, which is made mandatory under the terms of building contracts. They feel that too often appointed arbitrators, who are often former builders, are biased. That is an understandable concern. They did not understand when they entered into this contract that arbitration could be so protracted and expensive a process. Neither did they realise that they would be giving up their rights to seek justice in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government has taken some steps to improve consumer protection with its Building Services Corporation Act. The Onoratis and the Building Action Review Group, of which Mrs Onorati is the chairperson, feel that further reform is needed. In particular, they would like to see an end to mandatory arbitration clauses in building contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> The NSW Housing Minister, Mr Joe Schipp, has had a report from the Building Services Corporation before him since about July 1989 which makes just this recommendation. The report also recommends that a mediation process be required to explore whether a dispute can be resolved without the need for arbitration and legal proceedings, which can be ruinously expensive to home builders who are often fully committed financially in meeting the basic contract price. </PARA>
<PARA> The Onoratis would also like to see an end to the practice whereby the building industry is, in their own words, both judge and jury in disputes with building services consumers. I am aware that the Australian Standards Association is preparing a new form of standard residential building contract which could be fairer to the consumer. The draft was circulated last year for comment and Mrs Onorati's group has criticised it as inadequate in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the reforms they would like to see are: an end to mandatory arbitration clauses in residential building contracts; an end to the practice of builders being appointed as arbitrators because of the possibility of bias toward the builder party in a dispute; the establishment of a national consumers' advisory body; a standard form residential building contract that is adopted nationally and which offers much more protection to often unsuspecting consumers of building services than is afforded by the forms presently in use; and an inquiry into past arbitrations to expose unjust and unfair decisions and offer some form of redress to the victims. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Onorati's claims and I note that for a number of them a Commonwealth role is evident. In addition, I would also support a review of relevant Commonwealth law, including the Trade Practices Act, to determine what additional protection can be given to Australian home builders. </PARA>
<PARA> Irene and Joseph Onorati have worked very hard all their lives. They accumulated sufficient capital to invest in a substantial property and expected the income from it to support them in their latter years. Instead they are facing a doubtful old age. A few weeks ago they were served with an order to pay many thousands of dollars of costs arising out of unsuccessful legal proceedings which they commenced in the hope of overturning the arbitration that left them with a liability of about $1m and a building that would be difficult to dispose of in its present condition. I have been told that Mr Onorati's health has declined under the stress of their ordeal, and that does not surprise me. I sincerely hope that the New South Wales Government will find some means to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish to make some observations on the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Unfortunately formal comment to the Government's response was not possible last session and since that time there have been some very interesting developments-indeed alarming, one might say. The first of these is the very recently revealed sequel to the explosion on the USS Iowa which was mentioned during the debate after the tabling of the Senate Committee's report. The United States Navy has attempted to attribute the disaster on board the USS Iowa to deliberate sabotage, and that is alarming enough, but the Navy's official explanation has been completely undermined by recent tests that have produced an explosion by simulating ordinary gun loading procedure. We can add this evidence of design or materials failure to the long list of recent similar and unfortunate accidents aboard United States warships. Secondly, there is the much more serious evidence that many United States nuclear weapons have serious design faults. This was raised in the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 May this year in an article which was taken from the Washington Post. It was also raised on several television channels. To quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA> In a series of secret moves, the United States Government discovered-and is repairing-defective nuclear artillery shells that could have exploded accidentally while stored in Europe, and has started urgent studies of the designs of two other atomic warheads whose safety is suspect</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Urgent orders were issued not to move the warheads, and repair teams hurried to the nuclear ammunition depots to disable the several hundred shells so they could not be accidentally detonated . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that officials have not denied that such an accidental detonation could result in a nuclear yield. Faults have also been found in an air launch missile, the Short-Range Attack Missile-A-or SRAM-A-and special restrictions have been placed on it. To quote again from this article:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a separate nuclear weapons safety incident, last year secretly imposed special restrictions on the handling and deployment of a short-range missile carried by US strategic aircraft, (the Short-Range Attack Missile-A or SRAM-A) in order to avoid accidental explosions that could disperse cancer-causing radioactive plutonium from the missile warhead. </PARA>
<PARA>Faults that could lead to a similar accident were also found in one of the newest and shiniest of the United States Navy's weapons, the Trident missile, just now being deployed aboard strategic submarines. I read again from this article:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Energy . . . last week agreed to a secret congressional request for an independent scientific inquiry into the possibility that a nuclear warhead now being deployed aboard Trident strategic submarines, the W-88, could be detonated in a possible missile-handling accident in port . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Chapter 11 of the Senate Committee report makes it clear that the Committee accepts that formal safety assessments of United States nuclear weapons had been done. Interestingly enough, from the same documents I concluded that they had not been done. I quote very briefly from the dissent in that report:</PARA>
<PARA>Even the Committee cannot produce `calculations' of any substance on nuclear weapons accident probability and the only overseas figures appear to be a few vague U.S. estimates. One is of the probability of accidental nuclear detonation; less than one in a billion for normal environmental conditions and less than one in a million for extreme cases like a fire. There is a no indication that these are calculations rather than guesses and the plump roundness of the figures rather suggests the latter. </PARA>
<PARA>The risk assessments like these which are accepted by the Committee are nothing but a fiction. Indeed, now we find out that the risk assessments for any United States nuclear weapons had not been done at the time that the Committee was considering its conclusions. In fact, that process is being commenced only now. The Lawrence Livermore laboratory did computer simulations of the probability of a nuclear weapons accident. All these are highly secret, of course, and certainly not available to the Senate Committee. The Secretary of Energy, Mr James Watkins, is quoted in the article previously referred to. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ``we're not all that comfortable'' with the Government's past approach to several safety issues, and ``we need to focus a lot more'' on measures to diminish the risk of accidentally dispersing plutonium in warheads. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Watkins has ordered what other officials say is the first comprehensive assessment of the probability of an accident involving any of the more than 20,000 nuclear warheads deployed with US force around the globe. </PARA>
<PARA>These recent revelations cast new light on some of the sanguine conclusions of the Senate Committee report, but as we know Senate committee reports sink without a trace-this one perhaps like a discarded nuclear reactor. I encourage fellow members of that Committee of which I was a member and where I prepared a dissent to take a continuing responsibility for that report, to take note of the developments that cast a serious doubt on the validity of the majority report's conclusions. To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a two and a half page formal response to the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATOR IRINA DUNN'S COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE ON CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR VISITING NUCLEAR WARSHIPS</PARA>
<PARA>The official Government response to the Senate Committee report is in marked contrast to the somewhat surly and intemperate remarks made by Defence Minister Beazley at the time of the tabling of the report in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The unctuous commendations of the Committee are quite unlike the unconcealed Beazley opinion that the whole endeavour of the Committee enquiry was a waste of time and an intrusion into his private principality. </PARA>
<PARA> The prefatory remarks in this paper do deny that there was ever anything to worry about and imply that the only useful function of the Committee was to provide a means of publicising the extremely rigorous and thorough safety provisions already provided by the Government. Later in the general remarks reference is made to ``an already well-functioning safety regime''. It is rather hard to see how the author of the Government's response can assert this in view of the many deficiencies in the existing plans and their implementation exposed during the conduct of the Committee's enquiry and reflected in the number of corrective recommendations. The self-justifying observations in this part of the government response about the benefits of allowing warship visits so that we can enjoy the privilege of playing war-games with US forces I regard as absolute rubbish. The only contingency these very expensive exercises prepares Australian Defence forces for is an invasion by US forces; we could prepare for more likely contingencies with less expensive and more appropriate exercises. And I notice with disquiet the reference to combined Australian/US operations. This is not usually mentioned in the current self-reliance rhetoric; which tacitly recognises the practical uselessness to Australia's defence of the ANZUS/Western Alliance arrangements. I can only suppose that this reference to combined operations means, despite the hard lessons of history, that our Government continues to countenance the possibility of foreign adventures in the service of our principal ally. However, at least the absurd nuclear umbrella argument for accepting nuclear warship visits is noticeable by its absence from the Government's justifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The preambulatory comments continue by restating the official conviction that the probability of any nuclear accident is low and the probability of a nuclear weapons accident is ``virtually nil''. The document quotes selectively from the report but I am not surprised that it does not refer to the numerous anomalies in the Committee's report on this subject, or to recommendation 38 on the desirability of having a nuclear weapons accident plan, or, for that matter, to the facts and arguments presented in my dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of these remarks the report recommendations are categorised in terms of their intent. Basically the Government has agreed in principle with the recommendations in the first three categories and in most cases has promised to put them into effect. However, the most interesting category is the fourth. The Government has rejected these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations are those that suggest a suspension of visits if a particular safety measure is not in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government response is stated thus: ``The Government does not agree, given the very low risks involved, that individually these concerns are sufficient reasons to prohibit a particular ship visit''. </PARA>
<PARA> This spurious argument negates all the pretended rigour and safety-consciousness of the Committee report and reveals the essentially cosmetic nature of the whole safety plan regime. If we need safety plans-and the Government, the previous Coalition Government and the Committee have all agreed that we do-the Government cannot argue that incomplete plans will do for a ``particular ship visit''. It must be complete plans for all ship visits. </PARA>
<PARA> I don't have time to deal with the Government responses to each recommendation but I would like to comment on two aspects of these responses. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the rejection of any measure that requires that a request for information or assurance-no matter how trivial-be made to the operators of nuclear-powered vessels. Of course this means the US Navy and I am reminded of the total lack of cooperation the Committee experienced when it sought information from US authorities and the US Navy; the US Navy's dismissal of any need for Australian safety plans is partially reproduced in the response to recommendation 13. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Government is clearly reluctant to ask the US Navy anything; either because it fears annoying the navy or because it fears the embarrassment of being told to go away and soak its collective head. This servile attitude is exhibited in the response to recommendations 13 and 14, and I believe it is the real reason for the rejection of recommendation 34 (see 34 (a)). The same motive is probably paramount in the rejection of recommendation 37 which deals with dry-docking; an issue which in 1983 revealed the true nature of our alliance relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the Committee recommendations that ask for information or assurance from the US Navy actually reflect a degree of naivety on the part of members of the Committee. Despite their lengthy deliberations on the subject of this inquiry they have not realised that Australia just does not ask questions of the US Navy. Expressions of servile gratitude are all we are permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that I wish to highlight is the response to recommendation 38 which refers to the draft nuclear weapon accident plan prepared by the VSP(N). I discovered the existence of this plan in Brisbane but Mr Beazley refused to show it to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems very likely that this embarrassing plan will be quietly ignored. The wording of the response is worthy of Sir Humphrey Appleby; ``the Department of Defence is continuing to develop draft guidelines which might form the basis for discussion.''</PARA>
<PARA> After this nebulous process is completed discussions with State and Territory governments would begin. It would not be too optimistic to predict that the world will be largely rid of nuclear weapons before this plan is released to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> The response document says that ``the basic thrust of the report and the overwhelming majority of its recommendations represent an endorsement of the Government's actions in this area'' and despite the logical contradictions this is essentially accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> The major party members of the Committee who endorsed the majority report set out to achieve just this while seeming to be safety-conscious. It is appropriate that the Government should say ``well done my good and faithful servants'', but the Australian people are ill-served by bi-partisan committees that rubber-stamp Government policy while essentially ignoring the dreadful consequences that could follow a serious accident on any of these unnecessary and unwelcome warships. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address an issue raised in an editorial on page 10 of the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 May 1990, which is headed: `Hawke's uneasy stand on crime'. I will just read the first paragraph, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government has miscalculated badly by its cool response to the call for a royal commission into links between police, the Mafia and the murder of the Federal Police Assistant Commissioner, Colin Winchester. Had the Government agreed with the idea but deferred the actual appointment of a royal commission until the Winchester inquest was concluded, few would have demurred. But by refusing to consider the possibility of such a royal commission until after the Winchester inquest-leaving open the real prospect that the idea will be rejected-the Federal Government has invited the most adverse speculation about its motives. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial goes on to say that this royal commission is supported by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, and by the Opposition leader, Mr Carr. It arises out of a call by Mr Hatton, a courageous independent member of parliament in New South Wales. What they are seeking to do deserves nothing but praise; that is, to find whether crime and corruption exists in the circumstances that the editorial discusses, and to root out that crime and corruption. It would seem that there is absolutely no reason why the Federal Government should not go along with such a suggestion. The editorial takes up that very point. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that royal commissions tend to be in vogue at present. They are being called for in your State of Western Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President. Indeed, they have been in vogue throughout the 1980s. It always seems that when they are called for it is a reasonable proposition. There are problems with royal commissions and, indeed, with any commission. In this context, it is worth quoting some words spoken by Mr Vincent, as he then was-Mr Justice Vincent, as he now is, of the Supreme Court of Victoria-in the Senate chamber of the old Parliament House on 28 and 29 July 1983. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the more pernicious consequences of the various Commissions which have been conducted in this country over recent years has been the amount of damage suffered by individuals against whom no criminal charges are ever laid, by the kind of public identification which we have seen exampled in the last few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>He was speaking, of course, in July 1983. Later in his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Above all, we must be extraordinarily careful that the kind of publicity that attaches to such Commissions, the kind of damage which is occasioned by mention in the course of such Commissions, is not extended, is not carried beyond the shameful limits which we have observed over recent times. </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout the last decade there has been a call for all sorts of measures outside the traditional ones-by traditional ones I mean the police forces of the Commonwealth and the various States. There have been calls for extraordinary bodies and extraordinary instruments to offset the perceived spread of crime, particularly at an official level. </PARA>
<PARA> I give some examples of what I mean by this extraordinary growth. There was the National Crimes Commission Act 1982 which set up the National Crimes Commission; in 1984 we had the National Crime Authority Act which set up the National Crime Authority; there was the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry Act 1986, which was made specific to a named person, specifically, Mr Justice Murphy; in New South Wales there was the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988. If one looks at the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, one sees amendments to that Act-in 1983 it was amended on two occasions; in 1984 it was also amended on two occasions; and in 1985 it was amended on two occasions. The Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1988 extended the powers given to the various policing authorities under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to those authorities in respect of telegrams. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of all those additional powers and the new bodies that have been set up, apparently there is an inability to chase down the sources of crime and what crime has been committed and to find a solution for it. So the suggestion is that a royal commission be set up. It is to be set up apparently without any concluded terms for what it is to do. It is suggested in the editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald that the commission ought to be set up now and brought into operation at a later date. The editorial-and I think correctly-says:</PARA>
<PARA> There are reasonable concerns about the possible adverse effect any parallel inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>of course, the Sydney Morning Herald is talking here about the royal commission it wants set up-</PARA>
<PARA>-whether by the Senate or royal commissioner-would have on the inquest into Mr Winchester's death. It is hard to see, however, how an immediate commitment in principle to one or the other would make the task of the ACT coroner, Ron Cahill, more difficult than it has been. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this makes all sorts of presumptions. I would have thought that Mr Cahill would be concerned if the facts that he is investigating are to be reinvestigated by a royal commission, because that royal commission would in effect be sitting in judgment upon his findings. Since it is an inquest that Mr Cahill is conducting, that could cause some difficulties and, indeed, problems with proceedings that may subsequently take place. There are real problems in that, and that was adverted to by the Chief Justice of the High Court in 1940, Sir John Latham, in the case of McGuinness v. Attorney-General (Victoria), the judgment being set out at 63 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 73. His Honour, talking about royal commissions and how they may affect the proper course of justice, has this to say, at page 85:</PARA>
<PARA> If, for example, a prosecution for an offence were taking place, the establishment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the same matter would almost certainly be held to be an interference with the course of justice and consequently to constitute a contempt of court. There are other circumstances in which such an inquiry might prejudice proceedings in the civil or the criminal courts. </PARA>
<PARA>It is perhaps worth reading this, though not completely on the point at the moment:</PARA>
<PARA> But it is important, I think, that there should be no doubt with respect to two propositions-(1) the executive government cannot by the exercise of the prerogative create new courts; and (2) the executive government cannot by any exercise of the prerogative interfere with the due course of the administration of justice. </PARA>
<PARA>A royal commission is a body appointed by the Executive and is an executive's instrument, and has been since the first one was set up, as I understand it, in 1086, and produced the Domesday Book. The instrument of a royal commission has been with us for a very long time and has at times, perhaps on most occasions, been a most effective instrument. Nonetheless, there is a danger that if a commission is appointed justice will be prejudiced specifically in the terms that the Chief Justice, Sir John Latham, was talking about and, more broadly, in the terms that Mr Justice Vincent, as he now is, spoke about in his outstanding speech in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John Latham talked specifically about how a royal commission may interfere with the process of justice. Certainly the conduct of an inquest is part of the process of justice. It can determine whether a person is to stand trial. More broadly, of course, as Mr Justice Vincent pointed out, royal commissions can cause tremendous injustice by throwing into suspicion people who are later not charged and who have no effective means of defending themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that the call for a royal commission is a call which I accept as nothing but a genuine and heartfelt call to remedy what is seen as a very serious situation. It appears, as far as one can see, to be a very serious situation. But to react in a knee-jerk way, which I do not suggest has happened here, and call for a royal commission would be wrong. Secondly, to call for it after proper consideration-and that is what I take to have happened here with Mr Greiner, Mr Carr and Mr Hatton-does not necessarily mean that that call is a correct call. I have considerable concern that the call on this occasion is certainly premature because there is an inquest being conducted by Mr Cahill. He should not be subject to the threat, if you like, of a royal commission sitting in judgment on what he is now deciding. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern in the community that, after a decade of a series of instruments, a series of parliamentary enactments setting up bodies and new means of investigating crime, none of those instruments or bodies are sufficient to handle what, on the face of it, they should be able to handle. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the setting up of those bodies and the passing of the Acts giving more power to policing authorities has lessened the liberties we had in 1980. A balance has always to be struck between the necessity of rooting out crime and corruption in the community and the preservation of those liberties which we as Australians are entitled to and which we have enjoyed. I am simply concerned that the balance between those two has been tilted too much in favour of rooting out crime and corruption, which, though done for the most worthy of motives, has the effect of lessening the liberties and freedoms, as we understand them, of the vast majority of Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of Australian citizens are not concerned in crime and corruption-indeed, the eradication of crime and corruption would bring great relief to them. If the community used all the means that might be available to it to eradicate crime and corruption-if it simply locked up people on suspicion, reverted to torture to extort confessions, or labelled people and drove them from decent society on the merest suspicion-certainly a lot of crime might be eliminated. But what sort of society would we be living in?</PARA>

I think that Senator Cooney is playing that role, amongst others, in the Senate these days. Tonight's contribution should be ranked with those of others. I hope that it receives the attention and the consideration that it deserves from those concerned about the balance between issues of justice and liberty. It was an important address notwithstanding that it kept me from a meeting I should have been at half an hour ago. I welcome it for that reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
