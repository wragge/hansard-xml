<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> that the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 includes legislation, Part III-Changes to Non-Government Schools and New Non-Government Schools, designed to inhibit the establishment, growth and development of these schools in Australia by the imposition of restrictive provisions in the areas of funding, enrolments and approval criteria.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the `Porn Capital' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the ACT, with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG and M-rated video-cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R-rated video-cassettes, so that R-rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of `X'-rated or `NVE' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walters' Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video Tapes/Discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video-cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>- Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA>- Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Federal Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Peace Tax Trust Fund Bill 1989 which has been presented by Western Australian Independent Senator, Jo Vallentine. This Bill does not propose that anyone be permitted to withhold tax, but that the law should be changed to allow conscientious objectors to divert the military portion of their tax into more positive and socially useful programmes.</PARA>

<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with most other senators present, I owe my presence in this chamber to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond my control. Firstly, I occupy this seat now because the Tasmanian members of the Australian Democrats endorsed me as the nominee to fill the casual vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Norm Sanders. I am grateful to the members for their endorsement. Subsequent to that the Tasmanian Parliament ratified my appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I shall occupy this seat after 1 July because sufficient Tasmanian electors agreed with both my candidacy and the Australian Democrats' policies. It has all happened in quite a rush. I have only been interested in politics, as politics, since about 1985. My direct participation started with the July 1987 election when I stood as a Democrat candidate for the seat of Denison. I stood then because I wanted to make a contribution to the party which had shown at least some consideration for my concerns about the state of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I began to express my concerns when I returned from New Zealand after being awarded an Anzac fellowship in 1984 to study New Zealand's training programs and job creation projects. In Tasmania, when I returned, the Liberal Government at the time was not particularly interested in the information I offered it. The State's Labor Opposition was quite interested but was cynical of my motives. Its members kept asking me whether I wanted to be a candidate in an election. By contrast, Norm Sanders and the Australian Democrats were much more receptive and said, `Yes, we will help you get those ideas across. Here are some books you might like to read. Here is a telephone and the names of some people you might like to discuss your ideas with'. I was impressed by that. Before long I felt the same as our 1990 Democrat candidate for Braddon, Jim Reilly, who said during the campaign, `I have been a Democrat for years and I have just realised it'. </PARA>
<PARA> In about 1986, having diagnosed my political identity, I made a commitment to the Australian Democrats to help them achieve the objectives which I shared with them. In what seems to me to be an amazingly short time, I find myself standing in this chamber representing Tasmania, the community I am so proud to be a part of. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it hard to accept this responsibility without thinking of my family and those who helped to bring me to this place. I spent my early years in the hydro village of Bronte Park where the harsh climate and pioneering problems added to the difficulties faced by all young mothers in the 1950s. I am grateful to my mother for helping me survive that time, and I mean that in a way which is perhaps a little broader than the usual sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I then spent several years in the close company of my grandparents and the values and principles held by my grandfather still echo throughout my family. I do not know what he would think of my being here now. He was a Devonport waterside worker-a man who worked too hard and died too young. Although I was unable to express it at the time, even as a child I was aware of his mistrust of politicians, institutions and bureaucracies. </PARA>
<PARA> I also learned from him the value of our tangible efforts. He was a physical man who enjoyed simple pleasures, honest toil and practical achievements. He knew about horses, poultry, the soil and vegetables. He recognised quality of workmanship and refused to waste his money on shoddy articles. In fact, he was annoyed by any type of wastefulness. I am proud to have been subjected to his influence and to be here as one of his descendants. </PARA>
<PARA> Other significant influences in my life include the many different communities I lived in after my mother became a teacher and married my adoptive father. I learned the values which are held dear by small, isolated communities. We were a teaching family and we moved around Tasmania to a lot of different places. In those communities I learned of their concerns and fears and the frustrations which are felt when these things cannot be communicated to the distant decision makers. I learned that places like Myrtle Park, Westbury and Ringarooma are very important. They are very crucial to the development of the Australian identity. Indeed, in this chamber on Tuesday we heard that places such as Central Castra and the back blocks of the Kennedy Electorate are all important Australian communities. To most English speaking people, nil equals nothing, but to Australians Nhill should equal a whole town. Senator Powell is presumably willing to give spelling and geography lessons for those who do not understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> It was probably at the age of 10 at the Ringarooma Area School show that I first leapt into public prominence. It was there that I won the Sheila Wardlaw memorial prize for handwriting. I also took third place with my plate of radishes and I think I won an honourable mention for my gooseberries. All this is important because it is what makes Australia and the Australian communities tick. During this period my mother showed me the value of persistence in getting my handwriting to a legible stage and my father set me an example, through his understanding of plants and the soil, which enabled me to get my third prize for my radishes. </PARA>
<PARA> To attend high school from Ringarooma it was necessary for me to travel. Luckily, there were bursaries available at that stage and I managed to be a successful candidate. My parents were not poor but the travel and boarding expenses would have been considerable. Even then, although the existence of some government assistance was appreciated, I understood that that assistance was not sufficient and that many of my able friends at school had restricted educational opportunities due to financial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Later, my parents moved to Launceston and that was a comparative metropolis. I muddled through high school completing a strange assortment of subjects. The Beatles generation had begun. I had a transistor radio and I wanted to be different. My headmaster called me a `deviate' and I was happy with that. That is just what I wanted to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Music was particularly important at this stage and it bound a whole generation of young people to challenge the authority of the system as we saw it. I was embroiled in this challenge and I took it to university with me at the climax of the moratorium marches. We were all involved in the protesting and the reading of the literature, but for some reason I did not see this as politics. Similarly I did not then identify as environmental activism my passionate concern and objections to the plan to flood Lake Pedder. I just saw this as being involved in my community. Politics was what politicians did, and I did not want to be one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned music-I meant popular music-which at the time was loud, aggressive and defiant. I loved it. I believe I was sensitive to the philosophy of that music at the time. It was not just a case of John Lennon imagining a peaceful world. The whole 1960s generation questioned the assumptions of the Cold War. I believe most also challenged materialism, jingoism, elitism and many other values that were held by decision-makers at that time. That era has since been called the `me generation'. I question that. I was very conscious of its being the `we generation', which had a global perspective and a great international cohesiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, university fees were charged and an education department scholarship was the most attractive opportunity for me to further my education, but that greatly limited my career and study options. As well, I also needed to work during the vacations to sustain myself. Being forced to do other work was very important. Working in service stations, wool stores, with tourists, and as a labourer with Tasmania's then Rural Fires Board gave me a broader perspective to take to my first years as a secondary teacher. I was also privileged to have my perspective broadened at that stage by studying poetry with James McCauley. </PARA>
<PARA> For almost 10 years after leaving university I taught in both government and private schools and I am happy to admit that I learned more from the community of the Friends' School in Hobart than I was able to impart to my pupils. Essential to the Friends' philosophy is the concept that within the heart of all people there lies a spark of goodness-the inner light of God. </PARA>
<PARA> This philosophy drives a gentle, caring, humble and humanitarian concern for all people as equals and I have found it very easy to identify with that philosophy. At that school while teaching I nurtured my growing love of poetry and I shared it with the students who were in my charge at the time. I also shared it with my wife's grandmother. She is a grand old lady who is now approaching 95 years of age. She still writes, discusses and communicates, as all people should. </PARA>
<PARA> I left teaching to work as an administrator of adult education in country Victoria, but I was soon out of sorts and I really only felt comfortable when I got back to Tasmania. When I returned there I conducted a special education project at our Risdon Prison. Amongst other things I found again that poetry could be very effective in that setting. I believe that is because, as we should all realise, prison is both a physical and an emotional experience. Good poetry is able to influence our emotions. I believe that most of our actions are directed by our emotions, not by logic. One only needs take oneself back to polling day and ask: Where was the logic in that? Was it really an emotional event?</PARA>
<PARA> While working at the prison, I recognised that I was dealing with people who were emotionally delicate and who were often confused about, and disappointed with, the direction in their life. I found it useful then to introduce some of them to Wordsworth's concept that the child is the father of the man and that as children we are innocent of worldly things and that maturity is perhaps a matter of the acquisition of a greater or lesser number of mankinds faults. By using that concept, I believe that I was successful in helping several young men to go backwards, to rekindle their past, to find their period of innocence and then to start life afresh from there, discarding some of the baggage they had picked up and finding new values. </PARA>
<PARA> I continued with this attitude and approach to people while I spent the next couple of years working with young unemployed people. Apart from what was in all the research, the only common denominator I could find in the young unemployed was their lack of self-esteem. I diagnosed that problem as an emotional one rather than something which could be defined by logic, or solved by throwing money at it or running fancy programs. I found that by carefully searching for a task which a young person could complete, and then master, a sense of worth could be fostered. It did not really matter how simple that task was. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember one young lady who was thrilled when she managed to successfully hit a tennis ball. Her whole persona was changed. Once she had mastered that task she approached all other learning experiences with a new vigour. Now she has part-time employment, some many years later; she is married, has a child and her husband also shares her new enjoyment of life. She is a real contributor to our society because she believes she is competent, which she now is, and worthy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is a clue to where so many things are wrong with our society. We have placed too much emphasis on the achievers, the superhumans who move in circles that are removed from reality and achieve things that are beyond the capacities of ordinary people. Certainly we need heroes and certainly we need to recognise excellence, but we also need to recognise humble competence. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in this magnificent building we can see every day stunning examples of craftsmanship. We can see artistry in the joinery. But to see the evidence of these skills to the best effect, these works have to be cleaned effectively. So it is the humble cleaning of the artistic displays that is just as important as the original effort itself. As a society I believe we have a responsibility to reinforce the worthwhileness of, and the contributions made by, all of our citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> These are my values, and I have tried to indicate the origins of those values. The Australian Democrats have helped me to identify them and Janine Haines helped me to articulate them. My good friends Brian Austen and Peter Walker helped me to find the resources to expose them to an electorate and my wife Jane has given me the courage to continue my endeavours so that I could reach this place. It is part of my purpose in being here to represent the values held by my family, my community and my State, and to present them in an alternative manner. For me, the Australian Democrats provide the only vehicle for that alternative perspective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I am proud to be the fourteenth Australian Democrat to give a maiden speech in this chamber and to be one of a dozen Democrats now elected to parliaments around this country. I have been chosen to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Janine Haines, the first Australian Democrat ever to give a maiden speech in the Senate. Former Senator Haines also entered via casual vacancy, but in far more controversial circumstances. It may be interesting for honourable senators to note that 12 senators who were here at the time she gave her maiden speech are here now to hear my first speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Janine's contribution as a parliamentarian will be forever felt-in the shape of health care, for instance, with her negotiation of many successful amendments to the original Medicare legislation at the drafting stage. It was her strong advocacy, indeed her motion that led to the formation of the Senate's longest running select committee, the Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, which will have a lasting impact on the delivery of government services in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> A witty, determined and intelligent contributor to debates, Senator Haines was also an active participant in two of this chamber's most controversial inquiries, the Select Committee on Allegations Concerning a Judge-the so called Justice Murphy inquiry-and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australia Card. Senator Haines was always in the headlines and went from being `Chipp's girl' to just `Janine' in a relatively short space of time, chalking up a very impressive list of firsts along the way. </PARA>
<PARA> Through 1985 and 1986 Senator Haines survived four leadership ballots within the Australian Democrats to become Deputy Leader and then Leader. She was the first woman in Australian history to lead a parliamentary party. The Australian Democrats, under Janine's leadership, grew in strength through the 1987 election and on to the 1990 election. In the run-up to the last election Janine deliberately chose a more dramatic course to lift the profile of the Democrats by deciding to lead our 144-strong House of Representatives team from the front. In doing this she showed true courage as a leader. The result, through her inspiration, sheer personality and force of will, is that the Australian Democrats gained a record vote. Over a million Australians voted for us at the 1990 election. We now have a record eight senators as from 1 July and a pivotal role in national politics from which to build. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank Janine for her support to me personally, for her advice and for the assistance she has given me in recent months as I prepared to take my place in this chamber. I would like now to leave the subject of Janine. In fact, I had better leave it before it sounds more like an obituary; it is not. She is certainly going to be around for a long time and will be a very active woman in Australian public affairs and will continue to be a very important role model. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to use this occasion to give honourable senators a quick sketch of the way I see the world so that they will have some understanding of my motivations and what I consider to be the vision splendid when it comes to dealing with legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1990s Australia faces a variety of problems. We as legislators, from whichever party, seek solutions to these problems. However, in the broader context when we view our nation against the daily reality faced by most citizens of this earth, Australia can still be called the `lucky country'. As the three Hawke Parliaments have progressively moved to lock Australia into the global society-I am sure that this will continue-it is useful to draw some comparisons between Australia and countries in what are known as the First, Second and Third worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with other developed Western nations we can cite many indicators which illustrate our favoured position. I have time to look at only a couple. I would like to start with the environment. Although our smog problems in our cities are a cause for concern-we are the third worst in the world when it comes to actual sulphur emissions; it is something like four tonnes per person per year-we as yet do not have the acid rains of Europe. From Europe I give just one example: in Greece and the United Kingdom now 64 per cent of their forests are dead or dying. Also, in Canada over 14,000 lakes are strongly acidified. </PARA>
<PARA> We have many unique and beautiful wilderness areas, unspoilt and still in their natural state. This is unfortunately, as my travels in Europe have led me to see, not the case throughout much of that continent. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the water quality in the River Murray is deteriorating and many of our streams and creeks in our cities are little more than open drains, we still do not have the problems that people in Europe and North America face. At least all our major rivers still flow; the Colorado has ceased to do that. Though salty, the Murray's waters are still used for Adelaide's supply. Many of our native species of plants and animals still survive despite predation and habitat devastation. Although we have lost many of our birds and small animals forever and others are restricted severely in their range, we still compare favourably with other First World nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to look at our lower tax rates. If we compare Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures for the total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, we find that Australia ranks a low twentieth out of 23. The only country that asks its citizens to pay significantly less tax than Australia does is Turkey. In Japan and the United States of America, the two countries with which Australia is most often, and most misleadingly, compared, the rate is only about one percentage point lower. Both those countries have significant environmental problems and are far from equitable societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, we are particularly lucky in our lifestyle, the ordinary Australian way of life, and the sheer living space in our cities and our country. We can look at our vast golden beaches and compare those to the crowded pebbles of the Riviera which it costs one to visit and compare our homes and gardens with the tiny boxes found in some developed nations. At the end of the day, after we have paid for the necessities of life, including the tax man, the average Australian has more money in his or her pocket or handbag than many of our Western counterparts. So it is appropriate that we count our blessings and not take them for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare ourselves to the rapidly changing east European nations, the differences I have mentioned apply again and are even greater. Particularly greater contrasts can be found with regard to environmental issues. Their environmental problems have frequently been ignored, and here I am referring to both the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Planning for financial gain or `progress' has overridden any consideration of environmental issues. In fact, many of their citizens have not been aware of the the severity of the environmental problems that they now face. One example is the Aral Sea. This inland sea was once the fourth largest in the world. It has lost about 40 per cent of its surface area since 1960. The dry bed is now a salt encrusted wasteland. Where there were once 24 native species of fish, there are now none; and gone with the fish is the fishery that supported 60,000 jobs. The people of the region are suffering from a host of illnesses related to poor nutrition and environmental degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move from broad environmental problems to food. In Australia we do not have food shortages; there is abundant choice; there is plenty of food on our supermarket shelves. Likewise, consumer goods are readily available for most average Australians-those who can afford them. Again, the choice is almost unlimited. Fuel shortages should also be included in this section, something we have so far been spared. </PARA>
<PARA> We enjoy political stability, a free democratic system. While some would argue that Eastern European nations are, in fact, catching up with us and may, indeed, shortly pass us, we enjoy a free society-something that they are currently working towards. </PARA>
<PARA> When comparing ourselves with the third or developing world, our problems pale into insignificance. Almost any social, environmental or economic indicator will show up the wide gulf between the quality of our lives and the quality of theirs. I shall start with health. Our life expectancy in 1986 was 76 years while in Africa life expectancy was 51 years. In this country the infant mortality rate is eight per 1,000 births, while in Africa 108 babies in every 1,000 die. Lack of access to safe water, adequate sanitation and basic primary health care or immunisation all contribute to these untimely deaths. We could go on to look at educational issues; we can look at environmental issues, with nightmares such as Bhopal in India; we can look at the destruction of the Amazon rainforests in Brazil, which is one of the great tragedies in history that is already affecting our world climate and obviously will continue to do so. Political instability and the resulting conflicts further exacerbate these problems. To all of this, the introduction of Western economic systems has not helped. Resulting changes, such as cash cropping, have led to famine, starvation and disease. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the problems facing Australia in 1990? The easiest way to look at the problems is to put them in three separate categories, although they cannot really be separated because they are intrinsically linked and rely upon each other. Firstly, there are environmental problems. We seem to have learned very little from what we have seen happening overseas, from the actions of other nations and the resulting environmental difficulties that they now face. We prefer to continue our old habits until there is a crisis and then try to patch up the damage. In fact, we are socially geared to respond to crises after they have happened. For example, we are now discussing what should be done for the River Murray. We are still talking while salt levels continue to increase, as was predicted decades ago. Native vegetation is being removed at an alarming rate. Only in South Australia is a permit required for clearing, and that is because my State has virtually no vegetation left at all; in fact there are only remnant patches remaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Many pristine areas are left but still the pressures are increasing-pressures from mining companies, pressures from tourism, and, indeed, pressures from tourists themselves. Do we have to wait until almost nothing is left before we fund national parks and qualified individuals to a level where they can protect and preserve the unique Australian species that remain, or perhaps reintroduce them as Warrawong Sanctuary has done in the Adelaide Hills? Funding must be provided to a level that will ensure that introduced plants and animals are eliminated, or at least controlled. Again, Warrawong Sanctuary is an excellent example of this. </PARA>
<PARA> We can now predict the crises. Ignorance of what we are doing is no longer an excuse. We have the scientific knowledge, the understanding and the experience of this land to be able to make such predictions. We have the support of the Australian people. The last election has shown us this. They want us to do something now. This means an immediate end to logging of old growth forests before there are none left to log. One way or another this logging will stop, and very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> This means a total protection for our World Heritage areas and a rapid listing of other significant areas such as Shark Bay, Kakadu and Mound Springs. It means urgent protection of areas of significance to Aboriginal peoples, and along with this, of course, immediate attention must be given to the control of air and water pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is up to us to act now. As a teacher, until last year, I can assure honourable senators that the generations coming on are very environmentally aware. They are looking to us to do something now. The environment vote will increase with each new batch of teenagers reaching the age of 18. </PARA>
<PARA> The second broad area is social justice. Those already comfortably or well off in Australia are gaining even more under our present economic policies, while those who are struggling are put under even greater and greater pressure and being made to feel guilty at the same time. Time and again, particularly in Third World countries, the trickle down effect has been proven a failure. It further advantages those with power and wealth and few, if any, benefits flow on to those at the bottom of the system-those in real need. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of this, we have a continuing push in Australia for a consumption tax-and I understand that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has again said that at the moment it is not planned to be introduced. But the pressure is still there to raise as many taxes as possible at the level where we actually purchase and to put down the top tax rate for pay as you earn taxpayers. Surely the right way, and the only fair and just way, is to lift the tax threshold so that all taxpayers, particularly those on low incomes, will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people are constantly being told that we pay too much tax. The facts show otherwise, the major problem being who pays it. Large Australian corporations pay taxes that are low by international standards. Despite a nominal company tax tate of 39c in the dollar, the average rate actually paid last year by the 150 top companies was 28c. I acknowledge that this is an improvement on previous years. Australian taxes, which were 90 per cent of the OECD average in 1969, are now only 80 per cent of that average, and the contribution of company tax to revenue is only 10 per cent, having fallen from 17 per cent over the last 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither do figures support the common contention that wages are too high and that there are too many perks demanded by the work force-a lazy and non-productive work force, if we are to listen to some. Economic rationalists, as they are called, will proclaim that we must deregulate further. This is despite the fact that the lending boom which followed deregulation with soaring interest rates has led to misery for new home buyers and escalating corporate crashes. These same people also maintain that this is a welfare state and a workers' paradise in comparison with other countries-again, the facts prove otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare teachers' salaries-and we can do this with a number of salaries. OECD figures for 1987 show that a primary teacher with 10 years experience in Sydney earned $22,000; in New York, it was $26,000; in Toronto, it was $33,000; and in Tokyo, it was $44,000. I could go on and do the same exercise for motor mechanics and for managers. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from being a welfare state, our expenditure on social welfare is only 18.4 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) while Germany spends 25.2 per cent and Denmark 33.9 per cent. In fact, the only OECD member in Europe to spend a smaller percentage than Australia is Spain with 17 per cent. In 1989, a survey in Australia reported that more than two million Australians, including 500,000 children, are living in poverty. In 1990, a New South Wales Department of Planning report shows that 16.4 per cent of two parent families and 50.2 per cent of one parent families are living below the poverty line-and by poverty line I mean living on such low incomes that they are not even able to purchase the basic essentials. They certainly are not able to participate in what we would consider to be the ordinary everyday Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as this large number living in poverty, there is a wide variety of groups in the community with special needs who are being forgotten, ignored or overlooked. Their needs are either not understood or put aside in the rush to get bigger and bigger budget surpluses. I mention only four groups, as time is moving on. Firstly, care givers: those who look after the handicapped or elderly in their own home get very little, if any, respite help. This, in the long term, costs the community more. Other institutional alternatives become essential and the parent or spouse is forced to take them as they become available. The Southern Domiciliary Care Service in Adelaide is one example. It has insufficient resources. In 1989 it had some 6,500 people requiring its assistance, and funding is nowhere near keeping pace with this increasing demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there are those who suffer from violence in their own homes. Domestic violence is the most common cause of assault in Australia. Surveys suggest that as many as one in three women is likely to be subjected to domestic violence at some time in her life. This places a tremendous burden both on the individuals concerned and on the community as a whole. We urgently need to assist the abused, any children involved and, in particular, the offender. </PARA>
<PARA> Forgotten, overlooked and often ignored are Aboriginal children. The infant mortality rate for Aboriginal children is double that for all Australian children, and in fact is approaching Third World standards. I will use some specific examples to look at the problems faced by Aboriginal children. Trachoma is suffered by 32 per cent of Aboriginal children compared with 1.6 per cent of non-Aboriginal children. Over 10 per cent have some hearing loss, and in isolated communities this rises to 80 per cent with at least temporary hearing loss. Early medication can usually cure this totally, with no after effects at all. One in eight primary school age children does not go to school regularly and the number going on to senior secondary school is three to five times lower than for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and final group I would like to mention is the elderly. Many elderly people suffer in silence, and the majority are women. It is not in their nature, or rather their upbringing, to complain about their standard of living. However, a great many people, both pensioners and superannuants, survive on very low incomes indeed. Surely a pittance is still a pittance, no matter what the source of that income. Elderly people often live in conditions which are a hazard to their health, and as health costs continue to rise and institutionalised care becomes a necessity, this places a greater burden on the community than if the source of the problem was tackled in the first place. Urgent support is needed, this time for the services offered for home-based care, particularly in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area I would like to look at is that of economic management. I have obviously already touched on this a number of times. The environment, social justice and the economy are enmeshed, and decisions taken in one area obviously affect the planning and results in another. One thing I have not mentioned is foreign debt. This is not because I do not consider it a major problem-it certainly is-but we must not lose sight of the fact that this is mostly private debt. Much of the money coming in-in fact, I think only something like 10 per cent of the debt is attributed to the Federal Government-has been spent on unproductive takeovers that have cost jobs and in a number of notable cases have led to major collapses of business empires. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to look briefly at a second area, our way of measuring economic success. Our economic indicators do not take into account the quality of life issues. We do not count the costs. We have a political climate where the only thing that really seems to matter is money. At the same time we do not place any economic value on many of the things that really matter to us. We do not, for example, value our health, leisure, or environmental assets. We do not value work done in the home. Until a tree is chopped down it is of no economic benefit. Once it is in a ship travelling to Japan as woodchips, then we place a real value on it. Until a river is polluted and someone has to clean it up, again it does not register on gross domestic product figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, many things that are negatives do appear on our books and are counted as gains because they increase our GDP; for example, road accidents. The more loss of life, damage to property and associated trauma there is, the more our gross domestic product increases. Another example is drug abuse. As a teacher, I believe the greatest drug abuse problem faced in this country is the twin problem of alcohol abuse and tobacco use by our young people. Again, the greater the medical and associated costs the greater the number of programs needed to undo the damage and the more our gross domestic product increases. </PARA>
<PARA> We need urgently to find another means of assessing our economic progress. We must count the costs as costs and include the positives-those things that we value such as clean beaches, a healthy population, unique and ancient forests, et cetera-and we must take out those things that are negatives. As to my vision splendid regarding legislation and how I am going to vote, I am fortunate that, being a Democrat, I can look at each piece of legislation and ask myself what is the effect on the environment, what is the effect on each and every individual South Australian. I can then vote according to my own decision and my own conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quickly do two things. Firstly, I shall read from this month's edition of the Australian Society magazine a quote which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Janine Haines may have lost her last electoral battle, but her impact on Australian politics is arguably greater than that of any politician elected in March. </PARA>
<PARA>And last, by no means least important, I would like to thank my family, particularly my husband, Keith, and two daughters, Ingrid and Tegan, without whose support and encouragement I would not be here, and certainly would not be able to continue to be here. I would also like to thank the South Australian division of the Australian Democrats, who preselected me for this vacancy, for its support. Also, to my staff, my fellow Democrats and fellow Democrat parliamentarians in particular and their staffs, thank you. A special thank you to all those in this chamber, including you, Mr President, who have already made me feel so welcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated in my speech on the second reading of this Bill yesterday that in the Committee of the Whole I would be moving an amendment to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 2, after clause 3, add the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``4. Section 14 of the Principal Act is amended by adding the following subsections:</PARA>
<PARA> `(5) Grants are not payable to a person in respect of expenditure incurred directly or indirectly in the export of the following films:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a film which has been classified as an ``X'' film or, which under guidelines for the classification of films, would be classified as an ``X'' film; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a film which has been refused classification or, which under guidelines for the classification of films, would be refused classification. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) In subsection (5):</PARA>
<PARA> (a) ``a film'' means a cinematographic film, a slide, a video tape, a video disc or any other form of recording from which a visual image can be produced;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a reference to the classification of a film is a reference to classification by the Film Censorship Board.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to canvass the matters that were dealt with last night. I simply want to indicate that the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that export market development grants are denied to those hard-core porn merchants who have publicly stated their intention of seeking a hefty slice of taxpayers' money to prostitute the image of Australian women overseas by the sale of their hard-core porn videos. I indicated in detail last night in this chamber the fact that this plan had been laid and that, in fact, 13 of those videos had already been produced in Australia. Incidentally, most of the `actors' have American accents. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated last night that the status of Australian women, as well as Australia's international image, is at stake. During the discussions yesterday, some concern was expressed by Senator Walters that if my original proposition were adopted-that is, the proposition which simply denied any export market grant to a producer of a film which has actually been classified as an X-rated film-all that that producer need do is not seek classification of the film. Under the existing law, he would be eligible to receive an export grant. I have taken that matter on board and also another question that was raised by Senator Jenkins late last night in respect of films of educational or scientific value. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the first question. I proposed to include in those films which now will not be eligible for a grant films which have actually been classified as X films or which, under the guidelines for classification, would be classified as X films. I have used the term `guidelines for the classification of films' quite specifically and definitely because it is a term that is used by the Film Censorship Board. Page 18 and subsequent pages of the annual report on the activities of the Office of Film and Literature Classification and the Films Board of Review set out guidelines for the classification of films and videotapes. The term `videotapes' is encompassed in the definition of films in this amendment. So, in fact, there is a legitimate basis for the use of that term in my amendment. Similarly, the second part of the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a film which has been refused classification or, which under guidelines for the classification of films, would be refused classification. </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines are set out in the document to which I referred and in subsequent documents and any person who is considering that question would be able to make a judgment thereon. Of course, if the party concerned, the producer of the material, is concerned about that or if he is refused an export market grant, he has the option of seeking to have the Film Censorship Board classify the material. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that was raised with me by Senator Jenkins in my view is covered by what was a publications ordinance and is now I think the ACT Publications Control Act. Very briefly, it is covered by the fact that the material to which Senator Jenkins referred is not to be regarded as objectionable material and therefore would not be given an X classification. I refer to page 689 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material which includes in part of its appendix the Classification of Publications Ordinance:</PARA>
<PARA>A prescribed authority shall in deciding whether or not a publication is an objectionable publication or is suitable or unsuitable for perusal or viewing by a minor have regard to any literary, artistic or educational merit it may possess and to the general character of the publication including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the films with which we are dealing in this amendment are video pornography. They are films which are designed to arouse the sexual desires of their target audience and therefore to make money for that purpose. Clearly that was understood by the drafters of the Classification of Publications Ordinance and was covered by that clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I remind the Committee that this matter is of some urgency. This Bill seeks to extend the operation of the export market development grant scheme from 30 June to 31 December. The hard core porn merchants have said that they are going to apply for an export market development grant. As per the statements by Senator Button in response to me as I detailed to the Senate last night, the fact is that if they make an application they will be granted it. They will be eligible to receive taxpayers' money for the purpose of prostituting the image of Australian women overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, therefore, the adoption of my amendment is important to prevent the acceptance of such an application now and, hopefully, in the future. As I understand it, the Government is not likely to have its legislation on this subject through this Parliament until late November. Where the Parliament has a threat, as it were, or a promise by the hard core porn industry that it is going to make an application for a hefty grant, we have to be aware of the subject and we need to respond to it. My response is the amendment that is before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this amendment and support the proposition which is being put forward. It is designed to prohibit the Commonwealth from granting taxpayers' funds to support the export of X-rated film or video material. We are not talking just about a hypothetical proposition-`what if' they applied. It is something which is and has been before the Government and clearly the Government is happy to support spending taxpayers' money exporting this material because it has had the opportunity to bring it before the Parliament in that it has been known to it for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As it stands at present, there is nothing to prevent such a grant being made for the promotion of Australia's X-rated video industry. I think all honourable senators would be aware that as a very controversial and emotive issue, it involves questions about morality, public safety, censorship, denigration of women and other matters. It is a debate that has been of continuing interest to the ACT community since 1984 when the Government changed the regulations, when the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, had in mind to have all States agree. All States did agree, but not with Senator Evans and the ACT and the Northern Territory pursued a different path. At that time the ACT was clearly within the responsibility of the Commonwealth and it could have brought it into line with the States had the Attorney intended to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has continued to be disgraceful throughout. He has made no effort whatsoever to bring the Territory into line with the States. It is fairly well accepted that the material is produced in this region as well, although it is significant in this debate that a lot of the material is imported. So the Commonwealth is allowing it to be imported and is now in a position of allowing taxpayers' funds to enable it to be exported again from this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, the ACT Legislative Assembly looked at the issue of banning X-rated material in the ACT. That attempt failed, but there is a possibility of there being support for other changes to the legislation which may determine where in the ACT it can be sold. There does not appear to be any suggestion that as a consequence the mail distribution industry would be affected by such changes. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains an issue in the community. It is not simply a matter which concerns the ACT. Videos from here are sold interstate. It is clear that there is an intention to sell them and export them to Asia with the assistance of a Commonwealth Government grant. Whatever the ACT Assembly may have decided about the presence of the industry here, the Commonwealth has a responsibility. Responsibility on the question of X-rated videos is something, though, that the Commonwealth has been very reluctant to accept. It wants to wash its hands of any responsibility for the matter. It mainly says that it is a matter for the States and Territories, but that in itself is a half-truth. Because the Commonwealth has power over what is imported into the country it can take responsibility and should take responsibility for this particular area. It is within the Commonwealth's powers to prohibit the importation of X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue today, though, is whether the Commonwealth should have an active and supportive role in promoting the industry overseas. In making that determination we should be aware of the decisions around Australia on the availability of the material. Its sale, hire and distribution is banned in all States. While X-rated material is available in the Northern Territory, it must be kept in a separate section of video stores and not be accessible to persons under the age of 18. As I understand it, there is no obvious mail order industry in the Northern Territory and apparently no production. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT and, to an extent, the Northern Territory are the exceptions rather than the rule in Australia. The State governments, all six of them, representing the vast majority of Australian citizens, have taken the decision to ban the material, and that should be the major consideration in the Government's approach to the question of how it should treat any application from an X-rated video industry for Commonwealth money to fund the industry's export prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that we are not dealing with a hypothetical case. It is a matter to which the Government and its agencies have already addressed their attention. A constituent of mine wrote last year to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) expressing concern about any Commonwealth funding for X-rated videos and received a reply from the Minister, which makes it quite clear that there is no legal impediment to such a grant being made. I quote from that letter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . section 10 of the Australian Trade Commission Act of 1985, prohibits me from directing the Commission to deal in a particular manner with a person or claim under the Export Marketing Development Grant Act 1974. Similarly, in February 1986 the Australian Trade Commission received advice from the Attorney-General's Department stating that there is no legislation which limits grant entitlements for certain goods which people might find reprehensible . . . as the production and export of pornographic material is not prohibited, a grant cannot be refused because the material offends some sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to say that all six States are the `some section of the community' to which he refers. The letter from Senator Button continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The export market development grant assistance cannot be denied for pornographic material without legislative change. However, I am advised this would provide enormous legislative and administrative difficulties in terms of differentiating between types of categories of goods which either do or not offend public morals. </PARA>
<PARA>There are several things that arise from that letter from Senator Button. It has been known for some time that what we are talking about today is the case. The Government is clearly quite happy for Australia to become a centre for pornographic material being exported to the rest of the world and to put taxpayers funds towards promoting it and not do anything-not lift a finger to stop that happening. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the letter refers to the difficulty that may arise in a bureaucratic sense of introducing any legislation to do anything about it. I would not have thought that legislative or administrative difficulties should be an obstacle in this case. It must be possible to find the solution to enable this to happen. All six States have banned it, so it cannot be difficult for the Commonwealth to do likewise. I suggest that the Commonwealth has a duty to consider the matter, which is of such concern to a considerable section of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is not the legislative and administrative problems that the Commonwealth is worried about but, rather, the political ramifications. It is with the Labor Government that the ultimate responsiblity for this matter rests. It is dodging its duty and leaving the Australian Trade Commission in an unenviable and unwelcome position. I have a letter from Mr Ferris, the Chairman of the Australian Trade Commission, about the position of the Commission regarding any application which it might receive for a grant to promote X-rated videos overseas. That letter makes it quite plain that the Commission is not at all keen to make grants for that purpose, but that it is precluded by the legislation under which it operates from preventing any such use of Commonwealth funds or taxpayers' funds. In his letter Mr Ferris states:</PARA>
<PARA>The board-</PARA>
<PARA>that is of the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>would prefer that grants were not utilised for the promotion of X-rated video exports. The reality, however, is that the export market development grants scheme is administered by the Commission for the Government in accordance with legislatively prescribed rules. Grants are either eligible or they are not and the fact that the Commission may have a level of discomfort about paying grants for a particular export does not mean it is able to stop that payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, there is some disquiet within the Commission about the prospect of being left with no choice but to grant money to the X-rated video industry. It is up to this Government to accept its responsibilities to support the amendment which is before the Senate today, and make it quite clear that money taken from the taxpayers of this country will not be used to promote the X-rated video industry overseas. What an image it is that this Government is planning to create for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Temporary Chairman, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter from the Australian Trade Commission addressed to me and dated 6 April 1990 and a letter signed by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce of 7 December 1989. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Reid</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 19 December 1989, regarding representations made to you by the Catholic Women's League on possible government financial assistance for the promotion overseas of Australian made X-rated videos. You have asked for advice of how the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE) might regard any such application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board would prefer that grants were not utilised for the promotion of X-rated video exports. The reality, however, is that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is administered by the Commission for the Government in accordance with legislatively prescribed rules.

<PARA> Of course Export Market Development Grants are not payable for activities or services which are unlawful but such is not the case in this instance. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Wright</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 22 November to Senator Reid expressing concern about an application for assistance under the Export Market Development Grant (EMDG) Scheme for pornographic video material. As the EMDG Scheme, administered by the Australian Trade Commission falls within my portfolio responsibility, your letter has been referred to me for response. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand your concern in this matter, however, section 10 of the Australian Trade Commission Act of 1985, prohibits me from directing the Commission to deal in a particular manner with a person or claim under the EMDG Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in February 1986 the Australian Trade Commission received advice from the Attorney-General's Department stating that there is no legislation which limits grant entitlements for certain goods which people might find reprehensible. Grants are not payable for activities which are unlawful, or in breach of other legislation. But, as the production and export of pornographic material is not prohibited, a grant cannot be refused because the material offends some sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> EMDG assistance cannot be denied for pornographic material without legislative change. However, I am advised this would provide enormous legislative and administrative difficulties in terms of differentiating between different types and categories of goods which either do or do not offend public morals. </PARA>
<PARA> Given your concern, I have also sought advice from Austrade on applications for EMDG grants for the 1988/89 financial year. As the program works on a rebate basis, applications are still being received for the last financial year. Despite the press reports in which Mr Lark said he would be making a claim, no applications have been received from any company involved in the production and export of pornographic videos during the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that I am unable to be of any further assistance but I thank you for bringing the matter to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I say at the outset that I was a little bit disturbed by your predecessor in the chair, the Chairman, who gave Senator Reid the call when I was clearly the first person standing. I would have preferred to have made that remark while he was in the chair. In addressing the issue before us, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990, I am somewhat disturbed each time that Senator Harradine speaks on these matters because it seems to me that he does take some voyeuristic interest in matters dealing specifically with sex. I say right at the outset that I have never in my life seen a porn video. I have no interest in seeing one. But many years ago, when such films were banned in this country, I was visiting Sweden and I took myself off to a theatre to see what was then a pornographic movie. I have to tell you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that there were four people in this large theatre, all of whom were foreigners; there was not a single Swede present. If that is the resultant public interest which is shown and the depredation which will occur on the morality of a country through the use of this material, I must say that I have no great concern about the showing of explicit sexual material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, I have a great deal of concern about the showing of explicit violence. The Australian Democrats have consistently opposed-and opposed most vigorously-the showing of violence in any form, whether it is in films, in cartoons or in newspaper articles and the like. Indeed, there is very substantial evidence which shows that the exposure of people-not just children under the age of 18-including adults, to violence in any form increases the degree to which those people will behave violently towards others. The emphasis, we believe, in debates of this sort should be taken fairly and squarely away from sex. I personally find sex between consenting adults in no sense objectionable. Indeed, it is a very beautiful thing. </PARA>
<PARA> But the violence which is shown, and which very often I find Senator Harradine and members of the Opposition simply condone, I find far more reprehensible and far more undermining of the sort of direction in which we believe Australian society needs to move. So that is the first point I make. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I reiterate what I said at the second reading stage. This Bill merely seeks to continue the operation of legislation which is already in place so that the circumstances under which material may be exported or for which the subsidy for that export may occur are simply to continue without change until the Government brings forward its substantive legislation in the Budget session. At that time it would be appropriate, I believe, for Senator Harradine or anybody else to seek to include a clause in the new Bill which would specifically allow, perhaps by regulation, the exclusion from export support of a whole list of things. There are many items the financial support of which we would find very objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, this country has been exporting uranium to a wide range of countries, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We have seen an accident at Chernobyl which many experts believe will ultimately kill as many as a million people. We find it an incredibly violent act for this country to continue to export material which is as dangerous as that, which has laid waste to a whole area of Russia, making it totally uninhabitable for perhaps several centuries and which will impose burdens on generations of people as yet unborn for that long period of time. The thought that Australia, through this legislation when we see it in its definitive form, may allow any subsidy or any taxpayers' support for those sorts of exports we find extremely objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recently seen the Australian Government sell Mirage fighters to Pakistan, a move which clearly has the support of Government and which probably, although I have not heard Opposition members speak on it, has the support of the Opposition. Ever since the separation of India and Pakistan and the independence of those countries, they have been lined up almost itching for war, trigger happy over Kashmir and various other matters. For Australia to intrude into that situation with the export of those planes, again, we find extremely objectionable and of far greater significance than the export of sexually explicit material. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, it would appear as though this Hawke Government is quite committed to an increase in the development of a military industry in this country, which will in part be based on the export of military equipment to other countries, an incredibly violent and internationally dangerous action to which we take very strong objection. But again, we are not suggesting at this time in in regard to this one-clause Bill that these industries should not receive any export support. We believe that the appropriate time to do this is when we have the substantive legislation, when these matters can be properly addressed and a greater number of them included. I would be prepared to give consideration to Senator Harradine's concerns at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other problem in what Senator Harradine has said. He seemed to indicate at one point that the sale of this material overseas would be extremely profitable. Of course, on the onehand if it is extremely profitable it will not attract or need to attract any export subsidy or support. Again, it would fall outside the purview of this legislation. If, on the other hand, as I have suggested, after a short-dare I use the word-`honeymoon', the material is not in any way profitable, then a proper assessment of the export potential of this material would mean that it would not attract any financial support from the Government. The fact that this material is still capable of attracting support does not necessarily mean that it will in any sense attract support. </PARA>
<PARA> My objection to the passage of this type of amendment at this time is simply that this is a one-clause Bill. It extends an existing piece of legislation for a further six months until such time as the whole matter of the range of things which may or may not attract some export support from the Government can be properly considered. We believe that it is appropriate that it be considered at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to Senator Harradine's amendment to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill I would like to support his valid concern over the possible damage to Australia's national image of having the Government subsidise the export of X-rated videos. I would also like to comment on the fact that the amendment expresses concern only over the export of videos of a sexually explicit nature. The point is that the debate is limited to films of a sexual nature. I am concerned about the need for the creation of a category of extreme violence on its own. The current category system does not address this specific concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To exemplify my concerns and the confusion which exists in the community over this, an Australian film called Blood Moon was released around Australia during the April school holidays this year. The film had a mature audience classification, which would allow children of 15 years plus to view it. This Australian made production involved a huge promotional exercise. The film's poster depicted a naked man with a weapon looking at pretty schoolgirls all in a row. The poster caused great public controversy in Western Australia, and I imagine in other parts of Australia as well. The plot of the film involved a male schoolteacher strangling pretty schoolgirls all in a row-presumably a pun on the limerick which ends `and then there were none'-with barbed wire, cutting off their fingers and ripping out their eyes. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the film's promotional gimmickry was a break in the middle of the program for viewers to go and get their money back if they were too afraid to continue watching the film or if it was not exciting or violent enough. Presumably the promoters hoped they would attract a lot of young viewers to the box office. I think they were successful in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that this scenario is extremely distasteful to many Australians and the Government has a responsibility to look into the issue of violent films as well as those of a sexual nature. How could such a violent, ghastly film rate only an M classification? We urgently need a reclassification to sort out the confusion which exists between violence of all kinds and non-violent erotica. </PARA>
<PARA> I support many of Senator Coulter's comments on that line. This is why in the past I have not voted in support of Senator Harradine's various amendments on this issue and why I did not support Senator Walters' private member's Bill-Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988-on this issue. The difference now is that in this situation taxpayers' money could be used to subsidise this unsavoury industry, which I do not support. This is not a question of banning material which individuals should have a choice about, but it is a matter of using taxpayers' money to subsidise the promotion of pornography, which is in many cases especially degrading to women. I feel that to try to build a reputation for exporting such films is detrimental to our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way, I also oppose the use of taxpayers' money for promotion of weapons sales overseas. That certainly is a case of exporting violence if ever there was one. I support what Senator Coulter said on that matter. I am even more concerned about the Government's promotion, in the taxpayers' name, of exporting weapons which are used for repressing citizens of neighbouring countries, in many cases resulting in their deaths. As was said yesterday in this debate, a long list of nasties which attract government subsidy at the moment could be drawn up. Many of us would prefer not to subsidise many of these industries which we find distasteful, especially where violence is concerned. I look forward to a later opportunity to deal with those issues, as Senator Coulter has suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the matter immediately before the Committee, I wanted to put on record my reasons for supporting Senator Harradine's amendment today when I have not supported amendments he has put forward in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just listened to Senator Vallentine's and Senator Coulter's contributions. I do not understand Senator Vallentine's. She said that she did not support my private member's Bill-the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988-`for that reason'. I presume she meant because of her approach to violent videos. But I am sure she must have realised that my Bill specifically dealt with extreme violence in videos. Indeed, my Bill had two aims only. One was to abolish those videos that showed extreme violence. I went to a great deal of trouble. I am sure Senator Vallentine can understand how difficult it is to identify extreme violence. Extreme violence in the eyes of one person is not exactly the same as extreme violence in the eyes of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I went to a considerable amount of trouble to have words framed, which were in line with the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, that specifically tried to get across to the Film Censorship Board at the time scenes that the Australian public would not want shown in videos. Yet, Senator Vallentine says that she would not support my Bill, because it did not condemn violence. I do not understand her. The other side of my Bill dealt with X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Senator Coulter's insulting and unsavoury attack on Senator Harradine. Frankly I was absolutely appalled that he would stand in this chamber, as a legislator and as a voter-knowing that that vote was essential at the time of my private member's Bill-and boast that he had never seen a pornographic video. Yet, he was prepared to vote on the issue. That is absolutely unbelievable. I cannot believe that a senator in this place would stand and say, `I know nothing about this; I have never seen one but I will cast my vote'. I cannot believe that anyone in this Parliament would stand up here and boast that he or she had no knowledge of pornographic videos yet accuse, denigrate and insult a particular senator who had been on the committee that his Party supported and who had been shown these videos, for his desire to have some of those videos banned. It is something I cannot understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine, who is no longer in the chamber, said that she would like violence included in the amendment. It is extremely difficult to include in an amendment such as this videos that are extremely violent. It is very difficult to find the right frame of words. It is unbelievable that the video Senator Vallentine described in this chamber today passed the Film Censorship Board under the present guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen it. I did not know it was available. Had I known it was available then I certainly would have viewed it and asked the Film Censorship Board, in my capacity as a senator, how it could possibly pass such a film-if what Senator Vallentine has told us is right-under the present guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button might well be interested in following that up for us. If Senator Vallentine's description of the mutilation of the schoolgirls in the film was as she stated, the Film Censorship Board could not possibly have passed it for any classification at all, far less an M classification. I agree entirely with her that that is far worse than anything I have heard of in this chamber or seen in some of the videos that our Committee members were shown by the Film Censorship Board that it believed were unclassifiable. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we already have an export industry based on pornographic videos. I would like to quote from an article which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of 26 April 1989 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is poised to become a key centre for the distribution of X-rated videos to the lucrative Asian-Pacific market. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra based distribution firms are already shipping large volumes of the controversial videos to New Zealand, taking advantage of the NZ Government's decision late last year to approve over-the-counter sales. </PARA>
<PARA> And the firms believe that the time is now right to exploit the Asian market, with signs that countries such as Japan and Korea are preparing to ease their censorship laws. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not doubt that Australia is now well in the market. Mr Lark has said very definitely that he will be applying for an export grant. He has said that he has many of the markets tied up already. If we believe that the image of Australia as the porn capital of Asia is appropriate we could allow this sort of thing to happen. But I am quite sure that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) does not want that to occur. I ask the Minister to please take note of this: even if he does not mind X-rated videos being exported, I am sure that he would not want-I wish he would not yawn and pretend that he is not interested because this is terribly important-child pornography produced in this country and exported to New Zealand, the Asian markets and the European markets which Mr Lark tells us he has got sewn up. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present situation-and I have approached the Australian Customs Service which has assured me that this is possible-Mr Lark could produce videos that are not permitted to be shown in Australia and that are quite illegal. If he were given an export grant he could use taxpayer's money to produce them and send them to the countries where no restrictions apply. It is quite possible for him to produce all of the videos that we prohibit in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable senators that what I have just said is right. As I have already pointed out, I approached the Customs Service to verify it. I will wait for the Minister to give me his attention, Mr Temporary Chairman, because it is important that he listens to what I am saying. When we were debating this matter in the chamber last night, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) agreed with me that what I have just said is completely accurate. As I say, I checked with the Customs Service and I was assured that that was possible. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be some limit on what the Government is prepared to support with taxpayer's money in respect of exports. I would have imagined that the Government would have supported the amendment that was moved by Senator Harradine. As Senator Harradine indicated, he has picked up my particular concerns and, for clarity and ease, has included them in his amendment, thereby avoiding the need for me to amend his amendment. </PARA>

I congratulate Senator Harradine on bringing forward this amendment to protect standards in this country. I believe it is good that he saw what was happening with the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill and brought forward this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night Senator Collins, who was the Minister in the chamber, said that it was not an appropriate Bill to which to add an amendment of this nature. I just wonder when it will ever be appropriate to stop the export of X-rated videos from Canberra. The Legislative Assembly in Canberra tried to stop X-rated videos being made in and exported from Canberra but, unfortunately, it was not able to do anything about it. This is of concern to many people. One only needs to take note of the number of petitions that come into this place on the matter to realise that not just a certain number of senators in this chamber are concerned about it, but people right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Harradine said, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that export development grants are denied to hard-core pornography merchants so that they do not obtain taxpayers' money to exploit women. I agree with Senator Reid when she asked: why should taxpayers' funds be made available to support the export of this type of film and why should grants be made available for the promotion of X-rated films? I believe that the Government should not support this action at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly agree with Senator Vallentine's idea, too, about the tremendous amount of violence in films these days, not just on videos, but also, unfortunately, on our television screens. It gives one the horrors to watch them. It is no wonder that so many acts of violence occur in our community by people, particularly young people, who see things on television and then decide to copy them. I think that is rather sad. </PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that Canberra is known as the porn capital of Australia. I think it would be much better to be known as the beautiful capital of Australia. I had an opportunity over lunch the other day to drive around and look at some of God's beautiful handiwork in the lovely colour of the trees around the city. We all realise that this building provides wonderful tourism opportunities-over a million tourists come through Parliament House each year-as does the Australian War Memorial, which honours the dead who fought for our country because they wanted to keep Australia free. I am sure that men and women in those days would not have thought that they would have to worry about standards becoming as low as they are in the country at present. I believe that the hard-core pornography being distributed from Canberra is certainly not doing anything to improve our values at present; in fact, I believe that it denigrates women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government believes that there has been tremendous discrimination against women. I believe that the Government has worked so hard to avoid discrimination against women that it is inclined to discriminate against men. That is my opinion on the matter. This Bill-and I heard Senator Lewis talking about it yesterday-provides many opportunities to help businesses, but we do not want it to help a business such as this that will assist somebody to export hard-core pornography. As a grandmother and mother, I am very concerned about the exploitation of women. That is why I want to place on record my feelings about this matter. Is it any wonder that we are worried about what happens to the future of our country? I want Australia to continue to be a country with good, wholesome Christian standards. That is why I want to put down my position on Senator Harradine's amendment. I place on record my support, and the National Party's support, for his amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I can just indicate the Government's position relating to the amendments of Senator Harradine and Senator Walters. In fact, I understand that was done in some ways by Senator Collins last night when he indicated that the Government would look at these two amendments not without sympathy and attempt to deal with them when the substantial redrafting of the Bill is taking place. There has to be a Bill back here within the next six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the important point, which is one that has been made already by other senators, is how we quarantine this issue. After all, the export market development grants scheme is a scheme which, it is true, provides taxpayers' money to help exporters open up particular markets. It does not continue as an export subsidy; it is a scheme to help the opening up of export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to see Australia become; in some of the ways which have been portrayed in other speeches; an exporter of X-rated videos or anything of that kind. I used the expression `quarantine'. There are all sorts of political influences imposed on this Parliament by various interest groups. Assuming a hypothetical situation, and Australia as a small exporter of tobacco, the anti-smoking lobby could come here the next time this legislation is before us and say it does not believe Australia should export tobacco. Australia is an exporter of beer and other alcoholic products. People could come here and say they do not want Australia to be an exporter of alcoholic products, therefore they do not think the export market development grants scheme should apply to the wine or beer industries or whatever. </PARA>

<PARA> I appreciate Senator Newman's passion on this issue. Other people have other passions about different things which might lead to much the same sorts of conclusions in relation to the export market development grants scheme. We are not as a government treating Senator Harradine's amendment lightly in any sense. We are saying that there have to be a whole series of amendments to the export market development grants legislation. That whole series of amendments will be brought back. I give an undertaking-I will discuss this further with Senator Harradine if he so wishes-that the issue raised in his amendment will be closely examined. </PARA>

<PARA> I am saying to Senator Harradine, the mover of this motion, that this is inappropriate in the Government's view in the context of this legislation. This Bill is designed to extend the existing export market development grants scheme for six months to protect the interests of those who are currently making export plans and using the scheme until such time as new legislation has been brought forward. Perhaps by the time the new legislation has been brought forward this will be an unlawful activity in Australia. If it is not I undertake as the responsible Minister to closely examine his amendment. As I said, and as Senator Collins said last night, very careful and sympathetic consideration will be given to it. I otherwise commend the Bill to the Senate. I think we have had a lengthy debate on this and I recommend that it be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support Senator Harradine's amendment. The attitude of the Opposition is along the lines indicated by Senator Button. We believe that the best solution to this problem would be to prohibit the production of these products in the Australian Capital Territory and throughout Australia. We think that there is massive support for that view right around this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, a little like Senator Button, am worried about the use of an amendment to the export market development grants scheme to achieve the object of this amendment. Nevertheless, like so many things that we deal with in this chamber it is a question of where to draw the line. That is what we are continually being faced with in this chamber. For example, if there were an industry in Australia producing poisonous gas and exporting it to some country which was threatening to use that gas on another country then clearly we would say that that is where another line ought to be drawn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that this industry already exists in Australia. It may very well be that it is not yet receiving the export market development grant which is available under this Bill. Nevertheless, by the time Senator Button comes back with his scheme, which he has been promising since about August of last year-and during the election campaign he told the people of Australia that the new scheme was, in effect, in existence-this industry may already have achieved an export market development grant. Senator Button and others would no doubt then argue that to pass an amendment along these lines would take away something that this organisation had already planned on and budgeted for in order to become established and, no doubt, would be to the detriment of the nation's income from export industries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak after Senator Button. I was hoping that that would be the end of the debate. But several things have been said since that require some comment. Of course, a point that I have made frequently in the past is that under section 51 (i) and 51 (xx) of the Australian Constitution it is within the competence of the Commonwealth to legislate on all matters dealing with trade and commerce and corporations and, therefore, it is within the competence of the Commonwealth to ban the manufacture of this material. The Opposition has been extremely loath to use that section, claiming that States' rights are involved. During and just after the election former Senator Chaney and, I believe, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) both indicated that the Opposition was considering changing its stance in relation to States' rights and the use of the corporation powers. If the Opposition is serious about this matter, let it use those powers and then it can proceed under that particular head of power in the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me also pick up the point that Senator Walters was attempting to make. She claimed that I said I had not seen any of these videos. That is true. I said I had seen one `porno' film. That was sufficient. But I have read extensively in the area. Rather than simply react in an emotional way, I have read extensively on the effects of exposure of people to explicit sex and explicit violence. I ask whether Senator Walters is aware for instance, of the extensive work of Professor Bronsenbrenner in the United States. Professor Bronsenbrenner carried out quite objective work on the consequences of exposing people to violence and he did it in this way: he asked people to cooperate in an experiment in which those people were to help educate an unseen subject behind a screen. They were to do this by the subject being asked questions, and if the subject gave the wrong answer then these people were able to deliver electric shocks to the unseen subject behind the screen. In fact, the shocks were not really delivered, but they believed that they were being delivered. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were a series of buttons and they could deliver shocks of varying degrees from one to 10 depending upon their desire to `train' this person behind the screen. People in this experiment were not told that they themselves, of course, were the subjects. What was done to these people is that before they were put into this experimental situation they were exposed to comics, cartoons, videos, film, writing and plays showing various degrees of violence, and the studies clearly showed that exposing people to violence-and not just below the age of 18-increased the level of violence with which these people behaved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that the Committee looked at this material, but it is clear that a lot of people in the community who respond in the way indicated by Senator Walters to explicit sex are not aware of this extensive research work in relation to exposing people to violence. The evidence is absolutely clear that exposing people to violence increases the level of violence in the community, and what I find disturbing about this repeated emphasis on sex is that the far greater damage being done to the community is through the exposure of people to violence rather than to sex. Overemphasis on the sexual aspects rather than the violent aspects seems to be ignored or downplayed, despite what Senator Walters has said about her private member's Bill, which I believe is doing, as Senator Vallentine has indicated, a great deal of damage to the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel like ignoring what has been said because it displays a degree of ignorance that is almost unbelievable. To almost accuse Senator Walters of not knowing the evidence that is available about violence when she and I and others spent six years on the question of violence and the mediation of the effects of video material, and to accuse me of having a voyeurism about sex, I think that Senator Coulter ought to stand up and withdraw the nonsense that he has spoken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, what Senator Coulter said was that I condone violence. Let me put that to rest right here and now. I go back to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on X-rated Videos. There was very little about violence in the draft report of the Chairman of the Committee. Most of the material, including the analysis of the behavioural science evidence, was developed and written in my office. There was no help from the secretariat of the Committee at all on the area of violence. The report was studied and written in my office and, as a consequence, the majority of the Committee came down with stronger recommendations on violence than the minority of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We recommended that there be a ban on films of relish to violence. Senator Coulter should try to find that in the report of the minority, who were supporting the continuance of the X-rated videos. We were the ones who were strong on violence. We were the ones who studied the evidence. We do not need Senator Coulter to tell us about how behavioural scientists go about their examination of this matter. We had six years of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter gets up here and says that he is not going to vote for this. He has not seen the material, but I suggest that he does not have to see it. He obviously has not read the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Materials because he says of the X-rated material that sex between consenting adults is beautiful. Senator Coulter obviously has not read the description of this material in the Joint Select Committee report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Rather than treating women as free and responsible initiators of human activity, the material in this category, although not violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. Thus, sexual intercourse is typically depicted as a mechanical act, devoid of love or human consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>Does Senator Coulter describe that as beautiful? Does he describe as beautiful material where `women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires'? As the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is sometimes manifest by themes involving work place sexual favours. Women are frequently depicted-</PARA>
<PARA>I will not go on; it is all there, but the honourable senator obviously has not read it. Anal sex is beautiful, is it? That is in this material. Senator Coulter surely has not seen it, and I do not suggest anybody should see it, but I do suggest that people take the trouble and read the Joint Select Committee report on the matter so that they can understand the issues. I will not have any more of this nonsense suggesting that people are preoccupied with the sexual material and are unconcerned about the violence material. In fact, according to a number of behavioural scientists whose evidence was before us, the explicit sexual material engendered `a sexually callous and manipulative orientation towards women'. The evidence stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It mediates in the minds of the habitual viewer a perception of women as being highly promiscuous and therefore available. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that at least four of the behavioural scientists whose work was subjected to the scrutiny of the Committee saw non-violent pornographic videos as being more harmful as to perception than the violent explicit pornography which has already been banned. Is AIDS-related high risk behaviour beautiful? I think Senator Coulter ought to think before he starts talking. He should realise that some of us who have been appointed by this Parliament to successive committees have had the onerous task of wading through the evidence on this material. </PARA>
<PARA> I did think of including the R-classification in the amendment because in R-classified films there is a great deal of violence-too much. I did think of including that, but it would have been almost impossible to isolate those areas of the R-classification which are the violent films. If somebody can come up with an idea on that, I will put it in, but I thought about it and I could not see how one could include it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to say much more about that, but I do take up what Senator Button said. He said that Austrade has got to give a grant if an application is made and it is eligible, provided the undertaking is lawful. He also said that there is a problem with quarantining matters which people consider should not be eligible for an export market development grant. Frankly, Senator Button can do that overnight. He has the power himself. All he needs to do, as the responsible Minister, is draft an amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, and he can do that today. He can get that through Cabinet and wherever it has to go-to the Governor-General-and it can be done overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as he says, he would rather this undertaking were illegal, he can sure make it illegal by amending the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, which would prohibit the export-</PARA>

<PARA> The fact is, the chamber is faced with a problem. The problem is that the hard-core porn merchants have said they are after the grants. There is no guarantee, as the Minister said, that between now and when the matter is next considered by the Parliament, those grants will not be made. In fact, Lark has already had a small export development grant for some of his activities, and that has not come out in the debate. But he knows the ropes because he has made an application previously and has already been granted a small grant for some of his activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990 which is a Bill for an Act relating to the provision of benefits to members of each House of the Parliament. The purpose of this Bill is generally to validate certain parliamentary entitlements which, as a result of a High Court decision, may be invalid, but specifically to validate retrospectively supplementary postal allowances to the members of the House of Representatives which the High Court found to be illegal. The reason for the Bill is that the Labor Government was caught in a shoddy, blatant attempt to use taxpayers' money to pay for an established Labor Party direct mail campaign at a coming election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, I believe quite untruthfully, publicly stated-in an attempt to justify its putting its hand in the till yet again-that the reason for the increase was to enable members to write to their constituents once a year. An example was given that in the United States members are able to write to their constituents at least once a year. What the Government did not mention was that in the United States members are prevented from using their postage entitlements for two months before an election. The Labor Government's purpose in granting this unlawful increase-which it now wished, as I repeat, to validate retrospectively-was to enable sitting members-particularly in marginal seats-to use the increase in the two months prior to the election. So here we have a dishonest statement. Why did the Government not come out in the first place and be honest with the Australian people and say that the reason it was increasing postal allowances quite arbitrarily from $9,000 a year for members of Parliament by an additional $20,000 was that it wanted to use the additional funds for a direct mail campaign in the election that was coming up?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me consider the background to this Bill. In November 1988, as one of its functions the Remuneration Tribunal determined, among other things, that postal allowances for members and senators would be $9,000 a year from 1 January 1989. Of course, the Tribunal considered other items in respect of senators' and members' entitlements such as salaries, electoral allowances, travel allowances, car transport, and so on. In July 1989, the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, withdrew stamp allowances from the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis that they were an office facility and not an allowance. In August 1989, Cabinet-the Executive, not the Parliament-increased postal allowances for members of the House of Representatives from $9,000 to $30,525 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the allowances for the Senate were not changed. The Government itself could have made a submission to the Tribunal for its own determination late in 1989. Why did it not do so? That is a good question. The reason would have to be-and there is none other-that it could not be certain as to what would be the determination of an independent tribunal. The election strategy of the Australian Labor Party was, to a large extent, based on direct mail of the umpteen letters that many people in marginal seats-and, I might say, not only Labor Party marginal seats-received during the election campaign. Direct mail is, of course, a costly exercise and what better place to get the money than from the long-suffering, unsuspecting taxpayer? If the Tribunal itself did not come up with an appropriate figure, the election strategy of the Labor Party was in total disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 September 1989 the honourable member for Menzies, the Hon. Neil Brown, mounted a High Court challenge on the basis that what the Executive did was illegal. At the same time, the then Leader of the Opposition specifically warned that, pending the High Court decision, members should not spend more than $9,000 as determined by the independent tribunal. As anticipated, on 1 March 1990, when the election campaign had started, the High Court found unanimously-five to nil-that the Government's action of supplementing postage by a whopping $20,000 was unlawful. In brief, the Court decided that the Executive could not substitute its own decisions for those of the Tribunal and that only legislation that deals explicitly with change or policy can bring about a change. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the response of the Government at the beginning of this election campaign? Notwithstanding the High Court decision, the then Minister for Administrative Services issued a press release. I might say that, under the decision made by the Cabinet and Government, the $30,500-odd was indexed. However, among other things the press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Members of Parliament can spend the full extent of their $30,982 postage entitlement confident in the knowledge that no reimbursement will be required in the absence of any further order from the court. </PARA>
<PARA>He went further and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor members, and those Coalition members which ignored Mr Andrew Peacock's instruction not to spend more than $9,000 will welcome the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister claimed that he received, and perhaps even sought, friendly opinion which supported an election strategy already in place, including pooling of postage allowances for use in marginal coalition seats. After the election, and after the money had been spent, and apparently on quite different advice, we were all warned by the new Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus)-and he bears no responsibility for the past-that not only should we stop posting letters--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Puplick" NAMEID="TI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick is quite right; it was a Cabinet decision and he was a member of the Cabinet at the time. One can see the gang of four or five sitting there and saying, `We have this great election strategy-direct mail campaigns. We trialled it in the previous election in a few seats'. Curiously enough, I note that the person who discussed the Bill in the House of Representatives was the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), who was one of the people trialled during the previous election campaign on direct mail campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the election and after the money had been spent, on different advice we were warned by the new Minister for Administrative Services that not only should we stop posting letters but that other entitlements that honourable members and honourable senators had received for many years may also be in doubt as a result of the High Court decision. It is not known whether or not they are, but most would agree that the Government was drawing a long bow and engaging in some scare tactics. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do know is that this legislation is before us because the Labor Government knew what it was doing when, to use one of Senator Walsh's favourite expressions, it put its snout in the public trough for electioneering purposes. It may be argued by some that the members, on a Minister's advice-incorrect advice-innocently spent the supplementary allowance. If the Labor Party has any principle at all it is its responsibility to reimburse those members, not the responsibility of the Australian taxpayers. This was an election strategy by a party in government, quite incorrectly, quite unlawfully, snatching taxpayers' money for its own purposes. It is worth changing the words of Scott to read: `O what a tangled web you weave when first you set out to deceive!'</PARA>
<PARA> I have heard it rumoured that the Government has been making noises that if this legislation is amended-I would like to foreshadow at this stage amendments to be put in the committee stage, which I think it is vital should be supported; there are some critical elements-the Government may consider withdrawing the legislation. That, if correct, is nothing more than blackmail and bluff, and my response to that is `so be it'. I do not know at this stage what the Democrats' position would be, but I ask them to consider their own slogans. We all remember the slogan used by a previous leader of the Democrats, Senator Don Chipp, as he then was. He came here, he said, to keep the bastards honest. In the last election campaign their slogan was `give a damn', or words to that effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990 covers a whole variety of matters essential in terms of benefits which are provided to members of both Houses of Parliament. This has been a relatively complex operation involving quite a number of difficult items. For example, I draw the Senate's attention to the schedules which are attached to this Act and which enunciate, amongst other things, a range of items such as papers which are provided in Parliament House and to electorate offices, Australian flags and printed material, postage-which Senator Parer has just addressed-personalised letterhead stationery, the acquisition of books from the Government Bookshop, photographic services which are provided, office accommodation and equipment, travel within Australia and travel overseas by parliamentary delegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Part II of schedule 1 refers to parliamentary officers and Ministers. The matters that interest most senators here are to do with staff and the entitlements of staff to travel. Caught up in this are a number of other entitlements which have been provided outside the Remuneration Tribunal party leaders, deputy leaders and shadow Ministers in terms of parliamentary duties.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is quite an extensive exercise that this Bill is now seeking to cover and to validate retrospectively. I do not intend going over the history of how this came about as I think most honourable senators are well aware of it. However, at the outset I repeat what I said on behalf of the party on 17 August last year. In a motion which was moved by Senator Lewis with regard to the postage element of this legislation I indicated on behalf of my party that we believed that the correct method by which all of these entitlements ought to have been provided was through the Remuneration Tribunal. We believe that the Tribunal was set up to deal with these matters and that it is the appropriate body to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons I put forward for that is that the entitlements of members of parliament are not only of interest to members of parliament but that, as members of parliament paid for by the taxpayers, members' entitlements are also of interest to taxpayers. The Remuneration Tribunal advertises at least once a year, as the words in the Act specify, and at least once a year there is a public inquiry. Anybody is entitled to make submissions with regard to any items that the Remuneration Tribunal is dealing with. So that opens up this exercise and, I think, in a very clear and direct way says to the people of Australia, `There are necessary resources for parliamentarians to be able to carry out their task. We will make a determination on the level of those resources and we seek your input'. As a matter of record, the amount of input has been minuscule but, nevertheless, the operation and the opportunity are necessary so that the system is open to scrutiny by the public. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said last year on 17 August with regard to that one matter, we felt that the correct method that the Government ought to have employed was to seek, as it is permitted to do under the Act, a determination from the Tribunal with regard to postage. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering the attitude that the Tribunal has normally taken, there is probably a reasonable assumption that the postage entitlement could have been significantly increased. The reason I say that is that the Tribunal has been of a mind that the entitlements that it wishes to see, and believes are arguable, for members of parliament have always been at a higher level than those which governments have wished to provide. The Government would not necessarily have had to take fright at going through what I believe was the correct course. It was open to the Remuneration Tribunal not to so determine, and that would have stayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot quite share the Opposition's paranoia about the Government's exercise on this. During the election campaign my party suffered from the use of this exercise, but the Government sought to make those entitlements available only to members of the House of Representatives. Since Democrats are members of the Senate only it therefore follows that they were not involved in that entitlement of up to $30,000. Only members of my party were not involved in that particular item. Members of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party spent more than the entitlement that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> No additional entitlement of $30,000 was provided to members of the Senate. However, from 1 July to 16 November, an additional amount of about $400 was provided to honourable senators. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was $462.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Walters. It was in fact a supplementation with regard to indexation. The item that Senator Parer dwelt on-that is, the postage item-seems to have caught the attention of the media. I draw attention to some material which Stewart West, who was the Minister for Administrative Services at the time, tabled in the House of Representatives yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It makes interesting reading. It puts into perspective some of the items we are talking about. For example, until 1984 the provision of staff was a matter for the Remuneration Tribunal. Staffing was not referred to the Tribunal for its 1984 review. At that time two staff members were provided to each honourable senator. Of course, honourable senators know that the Executive has since increased this number to three. There was no High Court case with regard to that but certainly an analogy can be drawn to the postage issue that Senator Parer raised; that is, the matter was handled by the Tribunal, it was then removed from the Tribunal's control and the figure was then increased, but no item was provided. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the staff travel budget, which is now set at an annual pecuniary limit, is a definite amount of money. Until 1984, that amount was determined by the Tribunal. The matter has now been removed from the Tribunal's control. One can go on. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking over the duties of Leader of my party, I obviously had an interest in the entitlements provided to leaders of political parties. All entitlements are provided by government except the unlimited postage, which is an item mentioned in the Remuneration Tribunal as being provided to leaders and to some deputy leaders, although not ours, and to some Whips, although not ours. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of items are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and a number are determined outside. Most honourable senators would agree that, having got to this point, it makes some sense to regularise the situation. Quite frankly, a very close look needs to be taken at this issue. It cannot be done in the heat of this debate. Obviously, political lines are drawn with regard to the postage items. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Remuneration Tribunal ought to be able to look after that entire range and make determinations. The arguments then would have to be presented up-front and the matter would proceed in that way. There are other ramifications. For a long time my party has supported the idea that parliamentarians' salaries ought to be linked to Public Service salaries and ought to be determined by the industrial tribunals that are available to the rest of Australians rather than by a special tribunal. These matters need to be unravelled, disentangled and to be put on a firm and reasonable basis. I will discuss the issues raised by Senator Parer on behalf of the Opposition about the amendments which have been circulated in the chamber when we get to the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for people, when they want to try to get a correct understanding of this matter, to read all the documents which are available, including the High Court judgment. One thing about High Court judgments-I presume it is because the judges do not have anybody sitting in judgment on them by way of an appeals court-is that one can normally read those judgments; whereas judgments from lower courts are very difficult to follow. This application, which was brought by the Opposition and which was in part successful, sought initially a series of declarations. Amongst those declarations was the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Minister had no power to alter the existing postage entitlement or to apply the public moneys of the Commonwealth in providing an increased postage allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>It was one of the declarations sought but not allowed by the High Court. The High Court allowed the demurrer in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the ground that the defendants have no power to apply public moneys of the Commonwealth by way of postage entitlement, additional to that prescribed by the existing determination of the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>That raises some significant problems. It is a highly specific exercise that is referred to, not a general one. If one reads the later opinions offered after this High Court judgment, one realises that the High Court, having confined itself to that item of something in addition to a determination, because of not granting the other determinations sought, was silent with regard to a vacated field. </PARA>
<PARA> The lawyers could make a great deal of money out of this exercise, undoubtedly already have and probably will go on doing so. It is important to draw the Senate's attention to that distinction. Most of the media reports have managed to get it totally wrong. Most people read the determinations and thought they had been granted. But had they ever bothered looking at the front page they would see that it shows that. Had they turned to the last page, page 20, they would have seen that the High Court judgment said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are difficulties, however, in the way of making the declarations which the plaintiff seeks. Although the plaintiff has an interest in knowing whether or not he is entitled to a supplementary allowance, there may be other persons who are not parties to these proceedings whose rights or liabilities would be affected by the making of the declarations sought by the plaintiff-</PARA>
<PARA>it refers to Australia Post, for example-</PARA>
<PARA>The desirable course to take in these circumstances is simply to allow the demurrer. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a much more limited exercise than the one that has been written about. It opens up the possibility for further challenges to get more specifications. One would hope that we may save both the time of the High Court and everybody else by avoiding that course. In terms of this piece of legislation, the Government has in fact recognised that the correct body to make these types of determinations at the end of the day is the Remuneration Tribunal. Hence, this will now be sent back to the Remuneration Tribunal for a determination. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, in fact, a number of concerns. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that this piece of legislation seeks not only to make changes in respect of retrospectivity but also seeks to make amendments to the Remuneration Tribunals Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I have circulated in the chamber, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, an amendment to Schedule 2 which I think will make clear what I perceive to be the intent of subsection 3 (1) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act and which seeks to leave out subsection 7 (4) of that Act. As that amendment runs across part of one of the amendments that the Opposition intends to move, it may be better to leave debate on my amendment until we reach that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Stewart West tabled in the House of Representatives a number of documents which have previously been sought by the Opposition parties under the Freedom of Information Act. It would seem to make a lot more sense, in terms of the way that the Government operates, if it provided these types of documents in an exercise such as this. The Government does not have the majority in this place. One cannot make a decision without these documents. When one reads them through, one wonders why somebody did not release them in the first place. It is far easier to operate if one has all the information which one needs in order to make a decision. I think it may have saved a lot of heartache if the documents had been provided when they were asked for. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some items in respect of which the Government might think there are some difficulties. For example, yesterday the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) raised a particular problem with a document which everybody in the chamber accepted is something which ought not to be bandied around. In those cases I think there are other forms in which information could be provided-for example, in an edited form or in a confidential manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in the future in these debates the Government will be more open and up-front in providing this type of information to the Parliament and that it will not simply seek to adopt a secretive approach. If there are genuine reasons for not providing a document and making it public, those reasons and the edited versions ought to be provided to the relevant parties for their consideration. If that were done there would be fewer problems for the Government. Indeed, it would be a lot easier for senators to have all the information that they need in order to be able to make a judgment with regard to any legislation and, particularly, with regard to this piece of legislation that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the point that I made at the beginning of my speech. We believe, as will now happen, that these items ought to be a matter for determination by the Remuneration Tribunal. We said that in August and we reiterate it today. The parties and the Government will be able to go before the Tribunal and argue their case in open debate and the general community will be aware of the levels that are set. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the Government-Industry Conference Against Chemical Weapons held in Canberra last year I have continued discussions and correspondence with United States Secretary of State Baker and other world leaders on chemical weapons issues. My officials have worked on an extensive program to bring to fruition the Government's objective of a comprehensive convention to ban chemical weapons and to provide for their destruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have been doing falls into a number of categories. Let me describe them each very briefly. In the first place, in promoting a broad based international dialogue between governments and the chemical industry on the forthcoming convention, we have worked for a representative meeting of international chemical industry figures to continue the momentum generated at the industry forum in Canberra last September. This meeting will take place in Geneva in late June.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, at that Government-industry conference I announced that a national chemical weapons secretariat would be established within my Department to prepare for the implementation in Australia of a convention. That secretariat has now been established, is functioning, and has commenced consultations with Federal and State Government departments and the chemical industry to determine how the convention will relate to existing legal framework and practices, and to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to facilitate our compliance with the convention. I may say that this initiative has, at the time it was announced and subsequently, prompted a great deal of interest from a number of other countries. We will be presenting a report to the conference on disarmament in Geneva which we hope will stimulate parallel approaches elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> In the third place, so far as the negotiations in Geneva for the convention themselves are concerned, I can report to the Senate that in recognition of our leading role in this area Australia was invited this year to be the coordinator for the Western group of negotiating countries in Geneva and the Australian delegation in Geneva has been increased in size to fulfil this task. The negotiations are proceeding well. Useful results have been obtained this year on the order of destruction of chemical weapons, on chemical weapons production facilities, on legal issues, on protective assistance, and on the clarification of that crucial verification and challenge inspections question. Challenge inspections have taken place in the course of developing that regime.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, we are conducting bilateral talks on chemical weapons issues with a whole range of countries, most recently in India just last week during disarmament consultations. I may say that particularly satisfying in this respect have been the very frank and productive exchanges with the United States. I am pleased to note that we have had now United States acceptance of a full mandate for the Conference on Disarmament to commence final drafting of a convention, something that was long missing. We have had the United States willingness revealed this week to consider halting the production altogether of binary chemical weapons after the anticipated bilateral treaty with the Soviet Union due for signature at the summit at the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, we have the regional initiative on chemical weapons launched in 1988 to raise regional awareness. We now have a team of officials visiting regional countries exploring further steps, such as regional participation in a trial inspection of a chemical plant and training cooperation to facilitate implementation of the technical aspects of the chemical weapons convention in our region.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, pending the entry into force of a verifiable chemical weapons convention, which we all want, not only are we cooperating closely with our own industry to ensure that it is not inadvertently linked with the supply of materials elsewhere for chemical weapons manufacture but also we are continuing to chair what is known as the Australia group of like-minded countries meeting in Paris which works informally to harmonise export controls to avoid assisting chemical weapons programs in order to preserve an environment conducive to total chemical disarmament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the Minister aware of recent reports in the media of the New South Wales State Government's refusal to cooperate in the process of creating a national salaries structure for teachers? What is the Government doing to increase the quality of teaching?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="347" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have in fact some information on this matter from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training who is of the view, and I think most people in this Parliament would agree, that most thinking Australians believe that there is a crisis of morale in the Australian teaching profession and that schools all over Australia are concerned about the quality of teaching suffering as a result of low teacher morale. The level of teachers' pay, the lack of opportunities for career advancement, inadequate and uncoordinated provision for upgrading teachers' skills have all, says the Minister, contributed to the declining status of teaching as a career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is concerned also that teaching no longer attracts the highest calibre of school leavers. For instance, in 1986 less than one per cent of entrants to teacher education courses in Queensland had tertiary education scores of less than 700. By 1988 this had increased to over 12 per cent. In its report on teacher quality, from which this data is obtained, the Schools Council said:</PARA>
<PARA> When it is realised that candidates with a TE score of 700 have some 60 per cent of year 12 students rated above them, there must be serious concern that many young people currently entering pre-service teacher education courses . . . do not rank highly on traditional measures of scholastic aptitude.</PARA>
<PARA>While the figures I mention relate only to Queensland, the Schools Council advises that the situation is likely to be no better in other States. The Government is concerned about this and the lack of enthusiasm amongst students to enter teacher courses. Mr Dawkins has therefore invited all parties, State and non-government employers, unions and the Federal Government, to participate in a national negotiation on the quality of teaching. The national negotiation aims to maximise the benefits of award restructuring and to implement lasting reforms in Australian schools which will improve the quality of teaching in our classrooms. He has also indicated that there has been enthusiastic participation from the teachers union in this national negotiation. Teachers unions from both public and private school sectors yesterday presented the Minister with an agreed union agenda. It is an agenda that goes far beyond traditional concerns of adversarial industrial relations. The unions themselves, acknowledging that education plays a central role in the reshaping of the economic future of Australia, have broadened their agenda.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that education is traditionally a State responsibility and the success of these negotiations will depend on the cooperation of State governments. At a preliminary meeting of Ministers last week the majority of States agreed to participate in assisting these particular negotiations. To assist in resolving the key issue of national rates for teachers Mr Dawkins will invite all his State colleagues, when he meets them on 1 June, to put a proposal to unions on the question of benchmark salaries for teachers.</PARA>
<PARA> In the current climate of uncertainty, particularly given the New South Wales State Government's refusal to cooperate in the process, the question of rates of pay for teachers is one that needs to be settled quite urgently and with a degree of cooperation. That lack of cooperation from New South Wales is obviously a major problem towards settlement of these negotiations. If agreement on salaries cannot be reached by the process Mr Dawkins has indicated that as Federal Minister he will set a benchmark for supplementing Commonwealth grants to schools. However, he also believes that it would be desirable to settle this issue as soon as possible without resorting to industrial action to enable the discussions on the more important issues of teacher quality to proceed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation on the waterfront is that work practices and institutions which developed over a century are for the first time now being changed. It is interesting in the debate on waterfront reform to go through the statements that have been made by the responsible Opposition shadow Ministers. I have done that. It is no wonder, having gone through them, that so few of them are ever actually printed. The only consistent theme we find in these continuous statements from Mr Sharp is criticism of the union involved in terms of lack of progress. If we talk to the users in the industry, the people that I am principally concerned about, the end users of the waterfront, there will be as much criticism-in my experience in the four weeks that I have been in this job, more criticism-of waterfront management than there is of the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it was a simple question; they are the only ones that Senator Walters can ask. The point that I was making, and it is a very valid point, is that considerable and legitimate criticism has been made by users pertinent to the ongoing reform process as to the potential danger-and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) and I are very conscious of it-of cosy deals, if you like, being continued on the waterfront, not simply by activities of the waterfront unions but by the monopolistic situation that exists in terms of stevedoring as well. Everyone involved in the process is conscious of that. There is no need to detain the Senate forever in talking about the historical reasons why the extraordinary situation of `them and us' that exists on the waterfront to a degree probably not found in a lot of other industries in Australia is still in existence. Nevertheless, as a result of the initiatives of Ralph Willis, real progress was achieved last year in getting the parties together for the first time ever actually to start talking about how this could be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system of industry based employment that operates at the moment, which is central to getting waterfront reform, grew, of course, out of the horrendous abuses of employees by employers. I was interested to see just recently that Captain Richard Setchell, the Chief Executive of Conaust (Australia) Pty Ltd, the principal employer of waterside labour in Australia, acknowledged that point. Although one should not dwell on the past, it is essential, in terms of having a sensible debate on waterfront reform, to be conscious of how the existing work practices arrived. The old bull system-which was humiliating, degrading and totally exploitative-of selecting waterfront labour led directly to the situation we have now of industry based employment, whose time has ended. There are currently something like 30 unions operating on the waterfronts around Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The 19 awards and dozens of job classifications that currently cover the waterfront will be reduced to one award and perhaps six to eight job classifications. Further, the unions, as a result of an initiative from Bill Kelty, fully supported by me-described by Mr Sharp in a press release as, I think, the `Collins-Kelty farce',-is rapidly progressing to a situation where an amalgamation of those 30 unions will occur. I must say it is interesting, in terms of the Opposition's position on these matters, to note that Mr Sharp, the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, has done nothing but attack that initiative. I was interested to see that the shadow Minister for industrial relations, Mr Howard, welcomed it. Clearly, the Opposition still does not have a fixed position on this very important issue. No doubt it will work it out over the next 12 months or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of all of those negotiations between the parties, under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, an in-principle agreement was arrived at late last year. I stress those words-`late last year'. That in-principle agreement contains the framework for real waterfront reform for the first time in 50-odd years. But it is important to understand, and I have said this publicly ever since taking the job on, that that in-principle agreement is simply a promise, albeit a substantive promise. The effectiveness of it is going to be determined only when that promise is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> The two essential elements to that process are the completion of the award restructuring negotiations to reduce the 19 awards to one and the job classifications down to six or eight, and the negotiations of the enterprise agreements that are also an essential part of the reform process. There is an absolute nexus between these two things; they have to be negotiated together.</PARA>
<PARA> The timetable that has been established by WIRA has been, in many major aspects, adhered to. We currently have a situation where, as agreed, in terms of the reform that has already been accomplished, in excess of 250 gangway watchmen have already been retired from the industry. That involved the Government in an expenditure of something like $9m and will result, in that single job classification alone, in a saving to the industry of $30m a year recurrent, which indicates the extent of the reform process that can be made once these other job classifications are accomplished.</PARA>
<PARA> The program itself involves the retirement over the three-year period of the reform process of 3,000 older employees on the waterfront. These are older people with entrenched, fixed and myopic attitudes towards the way they carry out their jobs-something like Senator Walters.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that an intensified campaign by the Myanmar army has led to a substantial increase in the number of refugees from that country entering Thailand. There are now believed to be about 40,000 refugees in this category in Thailand, of whom about 28,000 are Karens. In addition, of an estimated 10,000 Myanmar students who took refuge in Thailand following suppression of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Yangon in September 1988, about 2,000 to 3,000 remain. Most of the returning students appear to have made their own way home. The Thai Government claims that a small number of refugees, mainly students, agreed to return to Myanmar voluntarily under arrangements made by the Myanmar and Thai authorities. The Myanmar Government denies that any of the students who returned under these arrangements have been mistreated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government is concerned over these reports, which are part of a wider picture of human rights abuses in Myanmar that include the arrest and detention of Opposition leaders, torture, and forced porterage to the army. The Australian Government has done all in its power to encourage an improvement in the human rights situation in Myanmar and has certainly urged the Myanmar Government to accede to the wishes of the population for democratic change.</PARA>
<PARA> Our embassies in Yangon and Bangkok have discussed with both government authorities the situation of the refugees on the Thai-Myanmar border, emphasising the high level of concern that exists in Australia, and I know particularly in this place, over the situation of the refugees, as well as talking about Australia's policy on refugees and human rights generally.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the latter part of the question, we are aware that the United States Senate has voted to ban imports of goods from Myanmar. However, until similar legislation is passed by the whole Congress, that will, of course, have no legislative effect. We do remain ready to consider any further action it might be appropriate to take to underline our human rights concerns. However, I should say that we have never previously suspended GSP preferences as a means of applying pressure to secure internal reform and I doubt that that would be an appropriate step in this instance. We have made it clear that we would give prompt and sympathetic consideration to any requests that might be made for humanitarian aid for the refugees on the border, and it is hoped that one such request that I am anticipating may soon be finalised in that respect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be noted that at the end of January this year there were some 19,400 People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals temporarily in Australia who were here either on 4 June last year or at the time of the suppression of the pro-democracy movement or who had arrived by 20 June 1989, when the PRC Government introduced systematic checks on departing citizens. It should also be noted that, in addition, some 1,100 of those in Australia in June have since departed. The Majority of the PRC nationals temporarily in Australia in June were short-course trainees, mainly here to undertake English language courses. Tertiary students also formed a much smaller group. It should be noted that many of them had already overstayed their entry permits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's response is in fact based on the premise of Senator Jones's question-that of recognition of the problem of the students. The response so far has been fourfold. Firstly, we have made provision for those reluctant to return to China at this stage to remain in Australia until 31 January 1991. Secondly, if they do have long term concerns about returning, they may apply for refugee status. Thirdly, in respect of those who were legally here on 20 June, they may also apply for resident status on humanitarian grounds, provided that they hold an enabling entry permit. Fourthly, it should also be noted that no special provisions have been made for PRC nationals who arrived after 20 June last year. However, some have already applied for refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also notes that several thousand applications have already been received for refugee status and humanitarian resident status from PRC nationals. The further response from the Government will be based on the question of the need to process the applications, which at this stage far exceed normal numbers.

Of course, the Government is pursuing with some vigour the matter of handing over airports for local ownership, which is something I support very strongly as a principle. We were very keen to pursue the proposal that was put up for the Broome airport by Lord McAlpine and Ansett working together to commercially develop the airport. Not surprisingly, apart from anything else, there was a distinct financial advantage for the Commonwealth Government in pursuing that option, as well as for the Broome community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is that as a result, presumably, of the commercial judgment of the people involved-and it was simply expressed as an interest that we were pursuing originally-they have now indicated they are not interested in pursuing it. A decision will be taken by me this week to pursue other avenues of continuing the negotiations, as we intend to do, with the local community in Broome for local ownership of the airport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons for the delay, and it was an important matter, was obtaining a proper valuation of the property. That is crucial to a proper outcome for any government, in order to get the best value for money for its property. If we had not done that we would have been held properly to account in this Parliament and, no doubt, have got a severe hiding in Estimates committees. As a result, a number of valuations were obtained, but people had real concern about the valuation of the property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also fair to say-because it became a matter of some public controversy, as I am sure Senator Panizza is aware-that concerns were also expressed about possible conflicts of interest in respect of the Broome Shire Council, involving particular individuals in the consortium as well. Really, that was the major reason for any delay-not that I think any real delay did occur-in transferring the airport.</PARA>
<PARA> It is likely that the proper course of action that may now be available to the Government is simply to call for expressions of public interest in pursuing private ownership of the airport in conjunction with the Broome Shire Council. Certainly that is one of the options I am currently considering.</PARA>

Has the Minister seen reports alleging that a clothing company operating in the trade development zone (TDZ) in Darwin has withheld from its employees wages and other entitlements provided for in the Federal clothing trades award?

If so, can he advise the Senate what action has been taken to recover from the company the wages and entitlements to which its employees are entitled?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen a report. Indeed, there is a long article in today's Business Review Weekly concerning the Darwin trade development zone. The article is headed `Darwin's disaster zone' and reports a series of quite horrendous human rights infringements. If those allegations are true, they would be quite alien to the Australian way of life and attitudes. The article reports as well allegations concerning underpayment of wages. I am concerned that those allegations have been made in terms of industrial relations responsibilities in that workers have been underpaid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Industrial Relations has conducted a thorough investigation into the claims of breaches of the clothing trades award at Hengyang Darwin Pty Ltd and is currently conducting further investigations into Hengyang Holdings Pty Ltd and Darwin International Textiles Pty Ltd. I should say that Hengyang Darwin and Hengyang Holdings are Hong Kong-based clothing and textile companies. The claims involve underpayments and employment conditions breaches of guest workers who went to work in the trade development zone from Guangdong province in the People's Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA> I should report that the investigations into Hengyang Darwin and Hengyang Holdings have been significantly hampered by a complete absence of the normal time and wages records. Amounts owing have had to be deduced by production figures and export figures, making investigations more difficult. My Department sent a letter, I think yesterday, to the solicitors acting for the two companies acknowledging the companies' admission of award breaches and providing an analysis of the extent of the underpayment of the guest workers. Our analysis suggests that the underpayments are in the order of half a million dollars or more. The officers of my Department will be meeting with representatives of the company in Darwin early next week in an attempt to settle this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government remains committed to the effective development of the industrial base of the Northern Territory and the concept of a trade development zone as such. However, that commitment is not a commitment to support the concept at any cost in terms of industrial relations or human rights. The Federal Government will consider the renegotiation of the suspended tripartite negotiated agreement between us, the unions and the TDZ authority only if the current situation is resolved in line with normal Australian standards. We will continue to monitor the situation in the Darwin TDZ, especially the maintenance of effective industrial relations agreements and arrangements which may allow guest workers into the zone. I should record in the Senate that, along with my colleagues the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, Senator Collins, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, I am appalled at the breaches of human rights that I have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA> The major reason for the breaches of award conditions in the zone has been, undoubtedly, the very lax attitude of the Northern Territory Government in its administration of the TDZ's affairs. This is something that the article in the Business Review Weekly is unrestrained in saying. The Northern Territory Government is responsible, in the legal sense, for issuing licences for foreign companies operating in the TDZ and must accept the responsibility for the situation that has developed. The buck does stop on Marshall Perron's desk. It is not something that the Northern Territory Government can shirk the responsibility for; it must face up to it publicly. We, as a department, will continue to try to retrieve the money owed to those workers and settle at least that part of the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I heard all of the question because Senator Boswell's distant colleague Senator Puplick was attempting to interject at the time Senator Boswell asked the question, but I think I understand the burden of it. It is true that under successive Australian governments various countries which are described as developing countries have been given preference under the tariff system which operates in Australia. That preference used to extend sometimes to 15 or 10 per cent until the Government reviewed the matter about four years ago through a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Helen Hughes, the Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance. It was subsequently recommended that the level of that tariff preference given to developing countries should be 5 per cent and not the various levels it had been in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard it as very important that Australia give tariff preferences to countries such as the Philippines, India and perhaps Vietnam, where there is very genuine poverty and low per capita incomes. I think one of the best things Australia can do is try to assist the raising of per capita incomes in those countries by facilitating their exports. That has been a policy of successive governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In spite of Senator Puplick's noisiness it has been a policy espoused and supported by the Opposition throughout its history. It is a bipartisan policy, and it was this Government, as I pointed out earlier, which reviewed the level of the tariff preference and had it reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For five or six years GATT has been reviewing the system of tariff preferences which are operated around the world, and some countries have argued for what is called the graduation of preferences, that is to say, they would like to take Korea and Singapore out of the preference system. Last year, I think, the United States unilaterally took its preference system away from the four `tigers', that is, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. But that was not done as a matter of tariff policy. That was done to punish those countries for refusing to devalue their currencies. That is what that was about. The United States of America can do that sort of thing; I am not sure that Australia is in a position to do it.</PARA>
<PARA> We certainly have been supporting the GATT review. The last figures I saw-1988-show that per capita incomes in Singapore reached $US10,800 year in 1988. Average per capita incomes in Australia are something of the order of $US12,500. So the gap between Singapore and Australia has closed. The gap between Australia and other countries which I have mentioned, such as Vietnam and India, is enormous, and we will certainly continue that policy for the time being until GATT finally reviews the matter and announces its decision.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the first question, the borrowings by the Wool Corporation do not attract any concession. They are a commercial transaction, as I am advised. The Wool Corporation can presently borrow up to half of its net assets, which is about $1.025 billion. Any additional borrowing beyond that limit will have to be agreed between the Corporation and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. Senator Schacht asked how much has been borrowed. I am advised that the AWC has borrowed about $800m at the present time, but with an estimated borrowing of $1.1 billion at this rate by 30 June this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the element of the question dealing with foreign debt, the borrowings by the Australian Wool Corporation have been mainly, up to this point, local. However, any further borrowings would be expected to come from overseas sources and thus have an impact on foreign debt. As I think honourable senators will know, naturally the Government has already introduced into the House legislation to rectify the problem. Shortly it will be coming to the Senate and no doubt we will have a lively debate about it when it gets here.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently there are 2.4 million bales of wool in stockpile in Australia and if they were sold they would earn-in terms of the export side of our current account-between about $2 3/4 billion and $3 billion and that would be a very useful transaction. But if they continue to stockpile because the floor price is too high to reflect the needs of the market at the present time we could look forward to our stockpile growing to about six million bales and the Australian Wool Corporation's peak borrowing requirement blowing out to $3.5 billion, which would then be $2.4 billion net addition to the total foreign debt. That is on the figures that the AWC itself put out-they are not Government figures. The situation does need to be rectified and we will do that as soon as the legislation passes this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the report that Senator Calvert refers to is the one that was launched by Mr Martin Ferguson, the President of the ACTU. It was in fact a report from the Evatt Foundation the name of which, I believe, was Breach of Contract. It should be noted that local government throughout Australia has for some time been grappling with the question of amalgamation, but essentially it should also be noted that the question is one which is very much at the heart of efficiency of local government, the structure of local government, being one basically of State responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Calvert, with his interest in the area, would know that originally there were about 1,000 councils in Australia, but over time this has declined, although the reduction in the numbers has slowed over the last 15 or so years. Currently we have 836 councils. It should also be noted-as I say in the framework of the fact that we are talking about State responsibility-that from time to time States do examine the question of amalgamation. There was a round of amalgamations in New South Wales in the early 1980s and Victoria also opened up the question of amalgamation when the Cain Government came to power, but the issue was rejected at local level. At an even more local level in my own suburb in Adelaide, a council that could and should have been amalgamated quite recently resisted that amalgamation. As I said, it is fair to say that the issue goes to structural efficiency in local government, but other than to say that we see it as primarily a State responsibility, there is nothing more constructive I can add.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Calvert and the Senate to note that the Federal Government has been involved in a range of issues and provision of services and facilities to enhance the efficiency of local government organisations and also, of course, to enhance the level of management skills in those organisations through different programs that were initiated under Senator Margaret Reynolds and Ministers before her.</PARA>

The honourable senator asked about payments to the company under the bounty scheme. They were about $2 5/8m for the first vessel, $1 2/3m for the second, and so on.

Five more possible orders are in the pipeline. The total value of those 10 vessels will be in excess of $250m. The vessels currently being built in Hobart are up to 74 metres in length.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act, one of this Government's strategies to ensure that women have equal opportunities in status and employment, requires employers to report on the progress of their workplace programs for women. Progress reports from the private sector are due to be lodged with the Affirmative Action Agency by 30 April each year. To date the response to the Act from both the private sector and higher education institutions has been commendable. Last year 97 per cent of companies and 100 per cent of higher education institutions lodged reports with the Agency. The eight private sector companies that failed to do so were named in Parliament by my predecessor in November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year, 1990, is an historic year for the Act, with approximately 2,800 progress reports expected from the private sector. This is the first year in which those companies employing between 100 and 500 employees will be reporting to the Agency on their plans for ensuring that women have equal opportunities at work. As the honourable senator will know, these smaller companies became subject to the Act in early 1989.</PARA>

Whilst it is concerning that so many reports are still outstanding, the reporting pattern this year is similar to that of previous years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the motion. I make one comment. I am absolutely alarmed and mortified to look at the list of committee appointments and to see, under the heading, `Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing', the name of our dear friend, Senator Walsh. I make the plea that he, having spent the last seven years making sure that the Parliament did not get the appropriations and staffing that it ought to have got as a result of his being Minister for Finance, on this occasion sees fit to turn from being a gamekeeper to being a poacher. He will undoubtedly reflect the clear view that if, as he has so consistently said in all of his recent articles in newspapers, something needs to be done to bring the Executive more properly to account, he will become the most active member of this Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing and make sure that the Parliament is provided with the appropriation and staffing that it needs in order to keep the Executive under control. We have to ensure that this is not one of the most intelligent Trojan Horse attempts ever seen in the history of the parliament to make sure that the numbers on the Appropriations and Staffing Committee are loaded against all honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We hope that on this occasion Senator Walsh-not that he is in need of a backbone transplant-will perhaps be given a heart transplant on behalf of the Senate and will discharge his obligations on that Committee in order to get more money for the Senate, its appropriations and staffing, as the Senate undoubtedly deserves. Otherwise, I support the motion moved by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we have caught the Government with its hand in the till of taxpayers' money. There is no doubt at all that this Government knew full well when it decided to take the stamp allowance out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal that it had no right to do so. Because an election was so close it chose, above all else, to try to win the election by fair means or foul. Then the Government chose to give to each Labor member of the House of Representatives $30,500 of taxpayers' money, as a postal allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People do not earn that sort of money. The average wage is well below that. Those who are presently getting the average wage are being taxed to give members of the Labor Government enough money-$30,500 each-to write letters to every person in his or her electorate. It was a disgraceful act and adds to the numerous times that this Government has been called before the High Court by members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We all remember very well the situation during one of the referendum debates early in the life of this Government when Senator Gareth Evans attempted to appropriate special money for the Government's case, the Yes case. He hid that appropriation in the ministerial slush fund. We all remember that well. He thought that he could diddle the Senate, not let it know that special money had been appropriated for his campaign, and attempted, quite illegally, to use taxpayers' money, apart from that allowed by law. </PARA>
<PARA> When we asked why he had not told us where that extra money was stashed, he said, `You didn't ask'. Again, the Government has been caught doing exactly the same thing. When the initial letter was received by all of us, Mr Peacock, as our Leader, knowing that it was wrong, immediately issued a statement saying that we should not use that allowance. He wrote to each member of the House of Representatives saying, `Do not use it'. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when we threatened High Court action, the Government was too clever by half. It decided that the election was on the way and that it must give its members an appropriation over and above that of any other candidate running against it in that campaign. The Government had a majority in the House of Representatives of about 20 members and it knew that it would be a great asset to have an additional $30,000 to spend in respect of 20 dicey seats. The other candidates, of course, were denied any money at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, $30,500 of taxpayers' money. Indeed, when postal rates went up the Government decreed that the amount would also rise. So it ended up with $30,982-nearly $31,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government had made the decision. We decided, once again, to take it to the High Court and we won. The High Court decided that it was illegal, that the Remuneration Tribunal should make those judgments and that the Government had no right to take the matter out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> The High Court ruled a third time against this Government in respect of the Government's over-zealous advertising during the last referendum. The Government used blatant advertising in a, so-called, non-party political way. We took the Government to the High Court and, once again, we won. The Government had to withdraw that advertising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990, and want to go to the question of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal has been set up by the Parliament to look after many functions involving parliamentarians and other officers. That is what it is for, and that is what it does. It has been a very responsible body. I believe that if any body has been irresponsible it has been governments past and present; the Tribunal has not been irresponsible towards government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main issue under debate at the moment is the postage stamps allowance for members of the House of Representatives. Certainly I would agree that a case put properly to the Tribunal would succeed in getting an increase in the allowance, particularly for some of those electorates where there is a large changeover of registrants. I heard one member of the House of Representatives saying that in a particular electorate there was a changeover in the order of 1,200 a month. The stamps used to contact those people just once would be fairly expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> I object to the way that members of the House of Representatives got the increase in their stamp allowance. It is an insult to the integrity of the Parliament for a proposition like this to be put forward and so massively misrepresented. I know, and I think every parliamentarian knows, that over the last few years the Government has been carrying out a considerable amount of research into the question of direct mail as a matter of electioneering. Having moved to get public funding of elections and having decided that that was insufficient to perform the duties that the Government would like it to do, it was then a matter of how we would get around the legislation, of whether there was a possibility of getting an extension of public funding one way or the other. We know what the right way is. The right way starts with coming clean. If that is what the Government wants that is what it should try to do. To achieve this by deception and misrepresentation, as was done, is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The direct mail operation was considered. It was tested and trialled. It was regarded as being satisfactory so it had to be introduced. It could not be done too openly or too early in the peace. It was just not possible for the Government to come out and say, `We have got this brand new system of electioneering and we would like to use it and we need you to know all about it so that you can use it too'. Nothing was further from its mind. The system enabled the Government to see how late it could leave it, how it could get it through and how it could make sure it got an advantage from it that the others would not get. </PARA>
<PARA> The misrepresentation was built around quoting what happens in the United States. Deliberate untruths were told on this question. The matter was raised and the Government said that all it was doing was what had been found necessary in the United States. It had been found necessary that members should have the opportunity of making regular contact once a year with their constituents. If this were to be achieved in Australia it would require a magical figure of $30,000. The difference is that in America it may not and must not be used during the election campaign. There is a strict rule preventing any of that money being used within two months of the election. In this case I venture to suggest that probably 90 per cent of the money that was spent was certainly spent within two months of the election. We are talking about the fact that it was purely and simply an extension of public funding for sitting members. Having a substantial majority of members, say it was 20, at $30,000 each that is an extra $600,000 for the coffers of the Government to fight the next election. That is a fairly good start in times of difficult financial constraints. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government found out that the operation was at risk. We notified the Government from the first day that we thought its actions were illegal and contrary to the law as we saw it. It just became another grubby little exercise. It falls back on the general philosophy that one tries it if one can. If one gets away with it all well and good. If one cannot get away with it one fixes it. Who is responsible? Do we or do we not still have a thing called ministerial responsibility or is ministerial responsibility, as we saw yesterday, one of the things that is unimportant if it means the alternative of covering for ones mates. We have seen this with the Paddington bear issue and things like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we in Australia or is this Colombia, Cambodia, Venezuela or somewhere like that? We need to consider what this Government has done and the basis for it. Is it getting to the stage where the Government says, `We will do anything that is necessary as a means of winning an election'? If the Government passes laws that are invalid, makes decisions that are wrong, and the courts throw them out, the Government says, `We will change the law and make it retrospective'. The next move is to say `Let's abolish the Tribunal as well because it did not give us what we asked for'. That is not the way in which this country should be run; I hope it never has been and I hope it never will be. Frankly, I do not trust the Government. If the case had ever been truthfully stated, if there had been an expose at the time as to what was going on, I think more people would have understood. But the situation was willfully, wantonly and knowingly misrepresented. I am sure that the Australian Democrats understand this. I believe that they, too, would fully appreciate the misrepresentation and the effect that it had on the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no way that I can support, or that the Opposition can support, this particular item. I will deal only with this item. The fact is that it was taken out of the hands of the Tribunal when there was never any justification for that happening. It was done under a cloak of misrepresentation and the figure was grossly excessive, anyway. I will not support the Bill, nor will anybody, I believe, who is concerned in any way about parliamentary propriety.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990-a Bill for an Act relating to the provision of benefits to members of each House of Parliament. The truth of the matter is that we are debating legislation which retrospectively visits upon members of the House of Representatives an entitlement to expend $30,000 on stamps, an increase of approximately $20,000. If it had not been for the naked grab for power by this Government, this legislation would not be before us now. It is before us now because this delinquent, promiscuous Government was prepared to plunder the public purse to help itself get re-elected and, in the process, suspend all the traditional provisions which accommodate members' and senators' entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not without significance to note that the benefit was not accruing to senators-only to members of the House of Representatives. The Bill before us now does not seek to provide any additional benefit in respect of the stamp allowance for senators, but simply to legislate, as I say, retrospectively, for a benefit granted by the Government illegally to members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the logic in increasing the benefit, in the face of disapproval by the Remuneration Tribunal, to members of the House of Representatives and not to senators? Did the Government consider making some additional provision for senators or did it simply wish to give this bag of stamps to members of the House of Representatives? The answer rests in the latter comment: it is simply an increase for members of the House of Representatives. The reason is quite simple. If a party has a majority in either House and imposes a benefit, the majority of the benefit flows to that political party. Because the Government has a majority in the House of Representatives, the Government, on balance, receives the greater benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the Senate was excluded from this appropriation was that the Government has a minority of numbers in the Senate, and if equal funding had been provided to the Senate the Government would not have been so benefited in the granting of the stamps. That is why the Senate was excluded. The reason that it was given to the House of Representatives was to assist in the re-election of members of the House of Representatives. If one happens to be in government, if one happens to have the majority of the numbers and if one is successful in the execution of that pursuit, it means that one will get re-elected-and that is what this was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was advised of the strong disapproval of the Opposition. It was subsequently advised of the Opposition's intention to prosecute its views through the High Court. But rather than set aside for the moment the Government's capricious determination, waiting to see the outcome of the resolution of the High Court action, the Government pursued its endeavour for the purpose of ensuring the re-election of the majority of members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that the granting of these additional funds coincided with the timing of the election? It demonstrates that the funding was not an endeavour to ensure that over a 12-month period or the life of the Parliament members of the House of Representatives had a greater capacity to communicate with their constituents; otherwise, knowing the High Court action was afoot, the Government could have set aside its determination until after the election and allowed that extra communication to proceed. But the Government was determined to jam this money into the offices of members of the House of Representatives to make sure it was expanded prior to the election. I would be very interested to find out what portion of that $31,000 was not expended by Government members in the House of Representatives. Almost without exception, the full amount of money has been spent; it was spent for the purpose of ensuring that members of the House of Representatives were re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning for a moment to the equivalent entitlements to senators, what is the logical, rational argument that might be presented to us against an equal entitlement being given to a senator? Presumably, Senator Bolkus will address himself to that issue when he rises to conclude the debate. But there seems to be some cute and peculiar view in the mind of the Government that senators do not have constituents, they do not have a relationship with their community, they do not have responsibilities in terms of constituents, and they do not have responsibilities towards the wider community-as if they are some discrete group, divorced and isolated from the electorate. That argument seeks to say that there is no political or public accountability by the members of the Senate, elected by the same people who elect members of the House of Representatives, as if, once a senator is endorsed by his political party, the umbilical cord is cut, that he has no intrinsic relationship with his electorate, but a member of the House of Representatives has that. Those of us who discharge our responsibilities properly know that to be quite untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not here to argue the merit of any increase in the stamp allowance. I am arguing that there was no integrity in the Government's endeavours and no balance in the resolution of the determination. The Government simply set aside these funds for the purpose of using public moneys to assist in guaranteeing the re-election of the Hawke Government for a dubious fourth term. It is not without significance to note that the legislation is by its very nature retrospective in its application. A compelling argument can be put that, in respect of the stamps, this legislation should apply from the date of proclamation. Presumably the Government will argue that there are other benefit entitlements that can be included, but they are in a separate and distinct category and in no way impinge upon the determination to provide additional stamps. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to ask the question: why is it that the Government had unilaterally to take from the Tribunal the responsibility in respect of the stamp allowance determination? It was because the Government knew that if it had referred the term of reference to the Tribunal, the Tribunal would not have found in favour of an additional $21,000 for members of the House of Representatives. That is why the Government sat around and had this grubby little debate on how it could guarantee that it could rip off the taxpayers and be immune from any scrutiny. The Government was not prepared to refer this matter to the Tribunal because it knew the Tribunal would not agree to this grab for taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has previously found, rightly or wrongly, for better or for worse, that members of the House of Representatives are required to have an expenditure of only slightly in excess of $9,000 for the purpose of communicating by post with their constituents. This Government, believing that it has some pristine, unique wisdom, determined that they need three times that. The amount of money required for the members of the House of Representatives to communicate with their constituents is about the same amount as average weekly earnings. I do not have the figures before me, but $30,000 represents a lot of letters. One can be certain no member of the House of Representatives would be signing letters to the equivalent of $30,000 postage. What they will be doing is sending out junk mail to their constituents, seeking to persuade them that this is a government that is deserving of being re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government had been honest, it would have increased public funding to accommodate the additional money. But it could not do that because that would not have benefited the Government. For instance, in Western Australia the Labor Party got 35 per cent of the primary vote. Australia wide it got 39 per cent of the primary vote. If it were relying on public funding, it would be disadvantaged. The big advantage the Labor Party has, as I said earlier, in granting to members of the House of Representatives an increase in the allowance is that it is of benefit to the majority of that Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I find it sad that we have here a piece of legislation which seeks retrospectively to legitimise an illegal act conducted by this Government for the purpose of ensuring its return to government. It does no credit to this Government that it finds itself in this situation, a situation it need not have been in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I also will be brief, given the time of the day and day of the week. The last point raised is a good place to start. The Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990 does not do what Senator Crichton-Browne suggests it does. For decades successive governments have proceeded on the basis that they have the power within their capacity and the normal system of government, through appropriations legislation, to actually make services available to members of parliament. I say it has been going on for decades, because it has. It relates not purely to stamps, but to office accommodation in the electorate, parliamentary travel, travel overseas by delegations, spouse travel and even goes as far as the provision of Australian flags.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government and previous governments have all worked on the assumption, on the legal advice available to them, that they were able to make these benefits available to members and senators without the need for specific legislation. The High Court decision earlier this year basically turned around the premise on which governments in Australia have been working for decades. Let us get it in that context. There has been talk about grabbing money, hands in the till and allegations of illegal activity and being caught out by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the High Court found that the system under which governments, from Federation, have been operating has been wrongly based. The advice the Government has had after that High Court decision has been very firm, and that is we have to rectify it. What this legislation is doing is rectifying it, not solely for stamps but for every other benefit that has been available to members of parliament for which there is no specific legislative provision, or which has not been allocated by legislation through the mechanism of the Remuneration Tribunal. That is what this legislation does; and that is the full extent of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am being a bit selective, and obviously, in politics one is not an orphan in doing that. People are being selective. We are talking about validation of what is called legitimate payments. Let us accept that all these services and benefits that members and senators have been receiving over the years have been received and used in the expectation that what every individual recipient has been doing has been within the law. Whether it has been the use of special purpose aircraft, electoral offices or stamps to communicate with their constituents, those benefits have been received by members of parliament, Ministers and office holders in good faith for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation, in respect of stamps as well, is that the advice that was given to government-the advice that was available to the former Minister for Administrative Services, Stewart West-when the primary decision was taken was the same advice as had been received by previous governments of all political persuasions and that was that it was within the Government's capacity to do what was attempted to be done. The advice that came after the High Court decision, as is evidenced in documents that were tabled in the House of Representatives yesterday, was followed by the Minister. The advice that he gave to members of parliament after the High Court decision was received by him in good faith, and received in good faith by those who went off to use this benefit. Therefore, it is inconsistent to draw a political line between one benefit and another. </PARA>

<PARA> The point I am making-I make this particularly for the Australian Democrats-is that it would be inconsistent to draw a line between those members of parliament who have used a particular service in good faith and others who have also used it in good faith. The people involved who have used it-from both sides of the Parliament-have used this particular facility in good faith, and the good faith extends to the decision making of government in this area as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to say much more, but I just repeat a point which has been made in this place and in the House of Representatives continually in the course of all the political grandstanding on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> For the illumination of people who may be listening, let us go to the question of stamps. During 1989, the Government decided-part of the history has been related accurately-that it could make a determination on the appropriate level of postage entitlements for members of parliament. We have been presented this afternoon with a scenario of people lining up to put their hands in the till. We should look at this issue in an international context as well as a domestic context. For instance, in the United States of America members of lower Houses have a postage entitlement in order to send mail to their constituents five times per year. In Canada, it is three times per year. What was attempted in Australia was to allow members of the House of Representatives to communicate with their electorate once a year at Australia Post bulk-mail rates-a discounted rate-as opposed to what happens overseas. That is how the amount of $30,982 was arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA> In the domestic context, let me make just one point about inconsistency. I have sat with Senator Crichton-Browne at meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing at which he has stridently argued-if not in this place-for increased benefits for members and senators. The inconsistency I find now is that not only is Senator Crichton-Browne rejecting the $30,000 postage entitlement for members of the House of Representatives but also by his amendments he is actually taking the $9,600 which would otherwise have been available to senators back to $9,000. He is actually giving himself less. Let us take the issue out of the context of people running for the till. Basically, we are talking about a mechanism to communicate with one's constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has to face two problems arising from the Opposition's amendments. The first is what to do with those people who have acted in good faith and have expended over $9,000. There are a number of them, on both sides of the Parliament, some of whom have lost their seats. The Australian Democrats are not affected. However, if the appropriate validating figure does not come in, the Democrats will be affected because not only are back bench entitlements and the Senate entitlement, which the High Court found to be non-existent, involved, but also the entitlements of leaders of parties are involved. What does one do with those people who have actually used this facility to communicate with their electorate?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, what do a whole range of members of parliament-probably almost half of the members of the House of Representatives-do for the next six weeks without a postage entitlement? Not only will those people suffer but also their electors will miss out on a very vital part of the democratic process-that is, the right to communication. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is not intended solely for the purpose of rectifying the situation arising from the Brown-West case in the High Court. It is basically to address the misapprehension that has been held by government. Based on legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department over decades, that the Parliament needs to enact specific legislation so that the facilities can be provided validly. </PARA>

What I wish to address myself to has an effect on how we might consider some other points. We received the Bill, as the Minister will know, only a couple of days ago. This meant we had very limited time to look over this very important piece of legislation. I am not blaming the Minister particularly for that, but I am making the observation, which I am sure will be shared by Senator Macklin. I would like to ask the Minister a question which goes to the Bill. In clause 9.6 in the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of 1988 it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any entitlement to electronic mail services in respect of the electorate office or Parliament House shall be as approved by the Minister for Administrative Services, the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives as appropriate. </PARA>

In schedule 1 the Bill covers electoral facilities-I agree with that-as they apply in the electorate, but there is no mention at all of facilities in this place. I ask the Minister: What is the status of facilities provided in this place, whether they be telephones, office accommodation or whatever? For example, will the President, who previously had the right to provide fax machines-and I understand they are in train-continue to have that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that the High Court decision goes to the provision of services outside the Parliament and challenges whether they have been validly provided. It does not challenge the validity of the provision of services within the Parliament and, as a consequence, allocation of offices within the Parliament is determined by the Presiding Officers. Of course, we have the Appropriations and Staffing Committee that plays a role in the provision of services within the Parliament. The High Court drew a line between the conducting of parliamentary business within Parliament as opposed to extraneous facilities and services.

<PARA> Another question related to it-because such provision is no longer covered in the whole Bill-is: does it mean that the cost, for example, of operating fax machines comes within the postage allowance as the Government defines it or as we would amend it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The term `parliamentary officer' in the definitions was felt by the Opposition to be too broad and could be taken to cover everyone from the Clerks down. I understand the use of the term `parliamentary office-holder' in lieu of `parliamentary officer' is not disputed. It has however been pointed out that the use of the word `member' in lieu of `person' could cause some problems in that a person such as Senator Haines or Senator Chaney, for instance, could be deprived of entitlements after their resignations from this place while still continuing to act as leader and deputy leader of their respective parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the distant past the same could be applied to Sir John Gorton who, as was provided in the Constitution, became the leader of his party in the Senate and was then required in a by-election to move to the House of Representatives.

Parliamentary office-holders would be people such as the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Treasurer, Leader of the House, Leader of the Government in the Senate, other Ministers, Leader of the Opposition, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Chairman of Committees in the Senate, Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives, and the leader of a recognised non-government Party of at least five members not otherwise specified and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot agree to the amendment. I make two very brief points: firstly, parliaments will always find themselves in difficulty when they amend things on the run and I caution against doing that in this instance. The second point is that, by virtue of the definition applying under Determination No. 13 of the Remuneration Tribunal, by limiting the definition to `member' or `former member' one would exclude Ministers and some of their rights. For instance, the former Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, still maintained the position of Attorney-General after he resigned from Parliament, and could do so for a couple of months under the Constitution, but was no longer a member. He may come within the definition of `former member' but, given the fact that the Government is not trying to bring in a whole gamut of people by this clause and given that the Remuneration Tribunal has a definition that it applies for the term `parliamentary officer', we cannot accept Senator Parer's amendment.

We do not really want to put in there `former member, member, or possible member'. The thing becomes ridiculous. Essentially what we are talking about is any person who performs a said function. I accept Senator Parer's use of the term `office-holder' because that is what the Remuneration Tribunal has spoken about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the compromise offered by the Minister would meet everybody's concern. I suggest that it is the simplest and, seemingly, the least restrictive way to go. If it is of concern to the Opposition that it may include somebody who should not be included, perhaps we might try to think of some. I have been sitting here trying to think of somebody who could get in under the designation `person'. It will mean anybody who has that office and, provided that he is elected or appointed to that office or whatever else is necessary in relation to the Parliament and is recognised as such, and if the Remuneration Tribunal-after all, we are talking about the Remuneration Tribunal-is going to recognise him as such then I do not think we have terribly much to worry about. I do not think that somebody is going to bob up and say `I ought to be getting a remuneration'. I am quite sure that the Remuneration Tribunal would politely ignore him. I think that the compromise offered by the Minister solves the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to Senator Macklin. As a matter of principle, the Remuneration Tribunal has been set up for a specific purpose; that is, as an independent tribunal to look at salaries and other entitlements for members of parliament. Senator Macklin quite correctly said that this Parliament has the opportunity to disallow regulations and to disallow the recommendations of the Tribunal. Our concern is not that legislation would override the decisions of the Tribunal, but that a regulation would override the decisions of the Tribunal. I know what Senator Macklin has said about this. I think this is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin also remarked that some of those independent determinations by the Tribunal have been turned back, probably for political reasons. Many people from both sides of Parliament would say that was wrong. However, that is the Parliament's decision and I will not object to it. As I have indicated, we will persist with the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept what Senator Parer has said and what the intent is. But I point out to him that last year this chamber spent a great deal of its time debating whether or not we ought to have the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal overturned. Certainly, we and the Liberal and National parties were very gung ho to have that done. We considered it an entirely inappropriate and offensive type of regulation in terms of cutting down pharmacists' remuneration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We felt that we were entirely within our rights to seek that, as we were. We were not able to do that because we, unfortunately, did not have the determinations before us. It is not possible to overrule a determination of a tribunal except by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are now suggesting that where regulations are made either to go against or to encompass or to facilitate determinations, this chamber can deliberate-after all, it is only this chamber, perhaps, that ever deliberates on those matters-as to whether that is a good thing. Considering that the numbers of this Parliament are such that the regulations would be made by government and can be disallowed by those who are not in government, I think it is reasonably safe for us to operate in this fashion during this and the next Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>``Amendment of Remuneration Tribunal Act</PARA>
<PARA>13. The Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 is amended by inserting after section 7 the following section:</PARA>
<PARA>Determinations of Tribunal continue in force until varied or disallowed</PARA>
<PARA> `7aa. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that a determination under section 7 continues in force unless and until the determination is revoked or varied by the Tribunal or is disallowed by either House of the Parliament, notwithstanding the omission of a matter from a notice under subsection 7 (4) or the lack of referral of such matter to the Tribunal by the Minister.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this amendment, which is concerned with the avoidance of doubt, is to prevent what has happened on this occasion from happening again. I think the amendment is self-explanatory. Our very strong belief-and it is not shared by everyone in this place-is that the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal in 1988 was on foot and continued in operation. All that the High Court decision did was say that the supplementary amount of money for postage was illegal. The inclusion of this provision within the Remuneration Tribunal Act would ensure that similar circumstances would be covered if they occurred in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats do not support this proposition. It starts off referring to `the avoidance of doubt', and presumably we are all in favour of the avoidance of doubt. But it goes on to talk about the notion that a determination has a life of its own beyond when in fact the Remuneration Tribunal wishes to make such determination. It is a nice idea and it probably fits in reasonably well with subsequent ideas which the Opposition wishes to raise but unfortunately it is quite contrary to fact and certainly contrary to the Remuneration Tribunal Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one examines that Act-and I am quite sure Senator Parer has read it through-one will note that nowhere does it say whether determinations continue or not. I accept that proposition. However, a reading of the Act quite clearly shows that a determination has to be made in under one year. In other words, the Remuneration Tribunal is expected to report annually, and when it has done so in the past it has repeated, except in those circumstances which we will be debating later, every determination it has made even if there were no changes made to those determinations. So, on the basis of what the Remuneration Tribunal's reading of its own Act has been and in terms of the way it has processed itself, it has seen no doubt. But its `no doubt' is exactly the opposite to what the Opposition now sees. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is far better to continue with the way that the Remuneration Tribunal has operated, and doubtless if this proposition is defeated the Tribunal will have a very clear view of the situation. In fact, it will have any doubt that it ever had but never exhibited in the past removed by the chamber showing very clearly that it understands the Act to say that on every item the Tribunal will determine annually what the amounts or the privileges are to be, or what support is to be provided to members and senators or office-holders of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposition incorporates a suggestion I just do not think is true. I think it is misleading of the Act and therefore cannot be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask Senator Macklin to re-think this matter, because it is a matter for doubt. Senator Macklin has a viewpoint as to what the High Court meant, and a lot of other people have a view as well, but it seemed to me on the advice that I received that the key question that was tackled by the High Court was the matter of supplementing a postal allowance which had already been determined by the Remuneration Tribunal some 12 months earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This of course raised the element of doubt. It raised such questions as when really did the stamp allowance run out, forgetting the fact that it went from $9,000-odd to $30,000. My proposal is simply to avoid a similar situation occurring in the future. I do not accept the view taken by the Minister for Administrative Services that it subjugates the powers of the Parliament. I think all it does is to clarify what has been an uncertainty in the past and make sure it does not occur again. I would ask Senator Macklin to review his ideas on the basis of whether it will in any way effect, except for the better, the deliberations and determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Macklin gets up to answer that, and I will defer to him on that particular point, we have just had a debate about regulations overriding determinations. The Senate has decided we should maintain a system where the regulations can override a determination. Senator Parer is now trying to do directly the opposite. If we were to accept this amendment we would have a piece of legislation with two contradictory principles. We have already said that regulations overrule determinations. Now Senator Parer is saying that these determinations will stay in place until disallowed, changed by legislation or varied later on. It is totally inconsistent, and I will now defer to Senator Macklin for the other point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Committee. The point raised by the Minister is correct. This will run counter to the vote we have just taken. The exercise that we are asking of the Tribunal is to make a determination each year. I think we should continue to do that. I do not think we should seek this sliding way out of saying something will stay there until we do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that is a recipe for subsequent governments to seek to bury remuneration decisions; not to have them announced. In 1990 we may say something and in 1998 when somebody reads the Remuneration Tribunal decisions they will not find it and therefore think it is gone. This will not happen if this is carried; it will still be there. We are for having it up front, out in the open. It should be included in the Remuneration Tribunal's determination. That is what we have been holding from the very beginning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose we would have to say that this is the critical clause within the Bill. It is the one which seeks to validate not only legitimate entitlements that members and senators have enjoyed in the past but also, retrospectively, the supplementary postal allowance which the Cabinet, the Executive of the Labor Government, gave to all members of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not repeat at great length the comments made in the second reading speech; I simply reinforce them. Here is a government which took away from the Remuneration Tribunal the functions that it had performed for many years on determining postage allowances for members and senators. It did so even though the former Minister indicated in the past the purpose of increasing postage by an incredible amount from $9,000 to $30,000, an increase of $20,000 of taxpayers money. This was done simply to run an election, not as Ministers have said on numerous occasions, to write to their constituents once a year. This is the key clause in this Bill. It is a very important clause. I am really addressing my remarks to the Australian Democrats because I am unsure of their position. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this Parliament can retrospectively support an increase in postage allowances determined by the Executive which was found to be unlawful by the High Court of Australia. It was a grubby despicable way of running an election campaign. The Australian Labor Party had a plan to run elections based on direct mail programs. It costs a lot of money. The only way it could get it was from the taxpayer. I see the Labor Whip nodding because he knows that is exactly what went on. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we go through this charade of the Government trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public yet again instead of being honest and saying, `Yes, that is what we did but we got caught and now we want to validate it retrospectively'. On behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Page 5, clause 14, subclause (2), lines 10-15, leave out ``the amount (if any) by which:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in the case of a Senator-$9,462; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in the case of a Member of the House of Representatives-$30,982;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking on behalf of the Australian Democrats who will support the amendment of the Opposition. Today we have heard how in its 1988 review the Remuneration Tribunal determined that members of parliament, that is, members of the House of Representatives or senators, be provided with access to the full range of postal services provided by Australia Post subject to an annual limit of $9,000. On 16 August 1989 the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, put out a circular which, in the second paragraph, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Government has decided that the existing postage entitlement limit applying to Members of the House of Representatives will, with immediate effects, be increased so as to significantly improve their capacity to communicate directly with their constituents. The limit on the entitlement has been increased by the equivalent cost of sending a letter once each year at the bulk mailing rate applying from 1 September to each constituent in an average sized electorate (ie 70,000 in the electorate). The new postal entitlement of $30,525 will be indexed to movements in the mailing rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing entitlement available to Senators will also be indexed to the mailing rate. </PARA>
<PARA>This postage increase for members of the House of Representatives was challenged in the High Court by the Hon. Neil Brown. I quote from a memorandum which was subsequently put out by the former Minister for Administrative Services:</PARA>
<PARA> Senators and Members will be aware that the Hon. Neil Brown QC MP initiated action in the High Court to restrict the postage entitlement of Senators and Members from 1 July 1989 to that determined by the Remuneration Tribunal in its 1988 Review. The matter was heard by the High Court in Canberra on 9 February 1990 and the Court's decision was handed down on 1 March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Attorney-General's Department that the effect of the High Court ruling is that there is no doubt that the Executive has the power to provide facilities necessary for the functioning of the Parliament but the High Court has questioned whether the power extends to benefits having a pecuniary value. This power is of course subject to the proviso that funds for that purpose have been appropriated by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>And therein lies the rub. Mr West went on to say in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Attorney-General's Department that the High Court has ruled the Supply Act 89/90 does not serve as a sufficient source of appropriation to support the Government's decision to supplement the postage entitlement determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>In a press release issued on 1 March 1990 by the former Minister for Administrative Services-just three weeks before the last Federal election-the former Minister made this statement, which the Senate will find very interesting:</PARA>
<PARA> But at this stage my preliminary view is that the High Court decision means that postal expenditure incurred in excess of $9,000 from 1 July 1989 to 16 November 1989 was outside the entitlement determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and could not be supplemented by Executive action. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Legal advice is being sought whether recovery of this money is required. </PARA>
<PARA>Incredibly, he than states:</PARA>
<PARA> Members of Parliament can spend the full extent of their $30,982 postage entitlement confident in the knowledge that no reimbursement will be required in the absence of any further order from the court. </PARA>
<PARA>That is said immediately after the statement: `Legal advice is being sought whether recovery of this money is required.' I find that an incredible juxtaposition of two statements which simply contradict each other. Because the challenge by the former shadow Minister was successful, the Government has introduced this clause in the legislation that is before us now which, if passed unamended, would retrospectively allow members of parliament the postage allowance increase despite the High Court's finding that the increases were illegal or, at least for the most part, doubtfully illegal. </PARA>
