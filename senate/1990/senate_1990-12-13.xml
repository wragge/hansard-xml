<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported;</PARA>
<PARA> that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the Australian Capital Territory Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material;</PARA>
<PARA> that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>2. Exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) ``The adoption of the upgraded Income Tax-File Number proposal, to compel every Person to quote the number for many ordinary business dealings, would be an intrusion on the traditional liberty we have enjoyed under the Common Law and our Parliamentary Federation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) ``The databanks and surveillance methods that would probably increase under this proposal would tend to provide a constant unwarranted threat to the privacy of Citizens, Residents, and perhaps Visitors and Tourists.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) ``There are other parallel threats to our privacy and liberties, such as: The move to give police in Australia and overseas access to our Income Tax File details, and to provide computer-based information to an international bureau in Brussels, Belgium; the proposal that the power to listen to our telephone conversations be extended from the Federal Police to the State Police; plus the financial dossiers arising from the Cash Transactions Reporting Act.</PARA>
<PARA> THEREFORE your Petitions pray that the Parliament defeat any Bill, or repeal any Act, to establish the compulsory use of Tax File numbers for the various transactions outlined by the Government or others. AND your Petitions, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>We, the members of Wesleyan Women in NSW, wish to advise that we strongly oppose some of the proposals set forth in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that parents have the privilege and duty to train children in responsible citizenship and in Christian living. We believe in the freedom of the individual to exercise his right to conscientiously express his Faith, his opinions, his philosophy, within the limits of law but within the wider responsibility of obedience to Christian principle.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that by implementing the complete proposals of this Convention, the basic rights of parents as Australian citizens are being eroded, and our freedom to raise our children as we would is being strictly limited.</PARA>
<PARA>To extend the rights of the child by denying rights of the parent is undemocratic, unthinkable and unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>We would strongly urge that this Government think again, and decline to sign the aforementioned Convention statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present to the Senate the following petition, from 320 petitioners, which is not in conformity with the Standing Orders as it is not in the correct form:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As a citizen of Australia, I wish to bring your attention to my TOTAL OBJECTION to the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior therapeutic goods and devices, the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 will . . .</PARA>
<PARA>* prohibit advertising of vitamins, minerals, organic produce, herbal and homoeopathic medicines to practitioners and to the public;</PARA>
<PARA>* will impose exorbitant fees and charges on manufacturers thereby increasing the cost of natural medicines to the consumer and putting many people out of business;</PARA>
<PARA>* will have the effect of restricting freedom of choice of customers in their choice of medicines, health care and severely prohibit the right to self treat with home remedies;</PARA>
<PARA>* this Act breaches the freedom of speech, as this Act will severely fine anyone who wishes to share with another person a natural remedy; books and any printed information will also be banned by this Act. Natural remedies have a proven heritage of thousands of years and do not have to be proven by research experiment-we know they work;</PARA>
<PARA>* this Act is a breach of freedom of Religion as the Act will ban 44 plants plus many species. The Bible says in Genesis 1.29 that every plant is given to man for his use; and in James 5:16, ``pray for one another that you may be healed''. (If anyone is claiming healing through faith or prayer of Schedule 1 item, then it means they are making a prohibited representation which is a breach of the Act.)</PARA>
<PARA>I know it is my duty to keep you informed of my WILL on all matters that come before Parliament. Accordingly, it is my will that you register my concern about the Therapeutic Goods Act and the regulations to that Act. I am in favour of Natural Therapies, and it is a fundamental right to be able to exercise FREEDOM OF CHOICE in my method of health care.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it is further MY WILL that you act to protect this FREEDOM OF CHOICE by rejecting the Therapeutic Goods Regulations which are due to be represented at the next session of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Also, as a large number of Australian citizens object to this Act, (this we know from the media, and public debate), then I ask that this Act be annulled. It is my request that this Act be completely repealed.</PARA>
<PARA>I request a speedy reply to my letter, that you will be acting as my representative, to repeal the Therapeutic Goods Act at the next session of Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to my contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of standing order 142 be suspended as would prevent debate taking place on the motion. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak to the motion that standing order 142 be suspended because 142, as it stands at the moment, requires the motion that has been moved by Senator Robert Ray be put without debate. Today is a dark day in the history of the Senate when an enormous number of Bills are being sought to be declared urgent Bills basically as a result of the incompetence of the Government in the management of its business. </PARA>
<PARA> We warned the Government at the start of this session that it was getting into an appalling mess in relation to its program. You might recall, Mr President, that we gave notice of motions to that effect. We suffered the indignity of the Senate having to conclude its business on days without Government business before it. </PARA>
<PARA> We could see what was ahead with important packages of legislation foreshadowed, including: telecommunications reform, extension of the tax file number system into areas of social security, the corporations package, and the Commonwealth Bank reconstruction-not just the normal program of Bills but major pieces of legislation that clearly require careful consideration by this chamber. That is why we voiced our frustrations so early in the session that, if the Government could not get its program in order, then there was going to be trouble at the end. Such trouble has come upon us now. I have not had time to count this number of Bills. What is it?</PARA>

<PARA> Just consider for a moment the corporations package. This is a major package of legislation that is having to go through the Senate now because the Government did not take the advice of its constitutional advisers before and the last Corporations Bill was defeated by the High Court. We now find the situation where the corporations package has to go through the Senate today. Why? Because the Government then has to get the royal assent and then issue regulations that still have not been seen. I might say that the corporations package is pursuant to an agreement between governments that still has not been signed. Once the regulations are put down, they have got to be distributed. Practitioners have got to become aware of the law and advise their clients. Consumers of corporation law have got to become aware of their obligations. When is that package due to take effect? It is due to come into effect on 1 January. </PARA>

He heard the Business Council of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the Law Institute of Victoria all putting down their concerns about the flaws in this legislation, but this Government does not care if they are passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are over 50 pieces of legislation before the Senate today that deserve proper and careful consideration in accordance with the standards that this Senate has sought to reach in the past. It is a matter of great regret that the Government has decided that it has no choice, as a result of its incompetence, but to seek to move the guillotine on this day. Therefore, we will oppose it. We will oppose it with all the vigour that we can muster, because the one thing that this chamber has traditionally done is to treat the legislative process seriously and endeavour to give each Bill its proper and due consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just make three or four points. When this has been done previously in the Senate-and it was consistently done between 1975 and 1980-no such debate as this occurred because the gag was moved the moment a person moved a contingent notice of motion. I do not seek to do that. I think it is reasonable, both on this and a later motion, that we have debate. The second point I want to make is in terms of Senator Hill's accusation that this chamber did not have legislation. Of course it had legislation to debate in that period in which I was absent.</PARA></TALK.START>

That has occurred on several occasions in the life of this Parliament. But if that is the only occasion that the Opposition can refer to, a few hours, then it does not really meet Senator Hill's point. This chamber has spent an inordinate amount of time on non-legislation-most of it, I have to say, productive but some not so productive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In spite of the new committee procedures, we spent 37 1/2 hours in Committee of the Whole repeating what had already been done in Estimates committees. Also, many hours were spent on the appropriations debate. There have been two other reasons why the legislative program is somewhat delayed this time: firstly, it was an election year with an abbreviated autumn sitting. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that some of the recidivists here have intervened. We have heard from Senator Walters about the guillotine. Here are the Hansards from 1975 to 1980. How many times does Senator Walters's name appear, to support not only the guillotine, this sort of debate, but a gag on the debate on the guillotine? Time and time again the following Opposition senators have supported a guillotine: Senator Durack, Senator Teague, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Walters and Senator Archer. Senator Herron there puts his hand up. Senator Herron comes with clean hands; he can say what he likes and moralise to me; and I have to accept it because he is not on the record as ever supporting a guillotine. Some of our refugees from the House of Representatives are here today. How many times did they vote for guillotines in the House of Representatives?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This guillotine is as generous as we can make it. It is also a rolling guillotine. That is why it is introduced today, not on the last day of sitting, when those opposite have wanted to whack 30 Bills through in two hours. That is why it has been introduced today. </PARA>
<PARA> Some weeks ago, I revised the legislative program and kicked every Bill that we could sacrifice off the list. That was done to notify the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the independents here of exactly what the task was between now and the end of the year. Instead of doing it last week, we did it weeks ago. This chamber has tended to meander on and on in respect of a lot of this legislation, without any discipline and without any approach. I am not going to go on the record and say that I think a guillotine is the best thing since sliced bread-if you will pardon the pun. It is not. But these are urgent Bills that are required by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also indicate-although I daresay that when the time comes I can expand these remarks-that I hope that, having put the guillotine down, the Government will not remain inflexible. If we are coming to the end of a debate-and this is not on every Bill-and more time is required, we will try to fit that in. It is not a guillotine, for instance, that excludes matters of public importance. It is deliberately framed so that most of the other activities that occur in this place can occur. It is nowhere near as ruthless a guillotine as former Senator Withers and his cohorts used to introduce in the period between 1975 and 1980 when absolute numbers applied in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> To reiterate, it is hard for anyone opposite to point to day after day when there was no legislation to deal with. There was a brief period around 8, 9 and 10 October when for half a day or a day there was not sufficient legislation to be considered. I also indicate that the Government has tightened up deadlines by which legislation has to come in. If the drafting instructions are not now lodged for the autumn session, the Bills will not be considered, with one exception, of course-Budget related Bills and economic and appropriation Bills, which are always drawn up at the last moment. The Bills we are discussing are urgent. There is no need to suspend Standing Orders to disprove that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that the Australian Democrats are going to support the Government's guillotine. Apparently they are not even prepared to debate the excessive use of numbers in this chamber. Senator McLean is waving his finger and arm around, as we have got used to in the last few weeks, when he himself has added to the inordinate length of debate. The Government has to take responsi- bility for the problem which has been created this session. We are programmed to sit until next Friday, 21 December, which is much later than normal, although it has occurred occasionally in the past. We are being kept here by this Government to deal with legislation which has been mounting as this session has progressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that, when the Government was elected in March this year, it had no real program to place before the new Parliament. It never expected to be elected at all and it never had any plan about what it would do if it were elected. It has fumbled and bumbled around as a government for months and months. In about October this year, a sudden flood of legislation was introduced into the other House and it has now found its way here. That legislation was dealt with in the House of Representatives in the fashion which has become quite usual under this Government, by putting through 39 Bills in one week under a guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA> In this chamber, it has not been possible for the Government to behave in this arrogant way, because in the past the Democrats took the view that they were not going to be party to it. But, as we have now seen demonstrated time and time again in this Parliament, the Democrats-under their new leadership and with their new members-are simply, as somebody has rightly said, the fourth faction of the Government. They have become totally subservient to the Government's whim and wishes on all major issues. What greater proof of that could there be than their support today of the outrageous guillotine proposed by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) to put 52 Bills through the Senate over the next week?</PARA>
<PARA> There may be the need for a guillotine from time to time. If an Opposition is being thoroughly obstructive regarding legislation, a guillotine may be justified. But it should be justified only in the case of certain Bills and in certain circum- stances. Here we have a situation which the Government has created for this chamber, for itself, where totally inadequate consideration will be given to 52 Bills. It is not as though these Bills have been given any adequate consideration by the Parliament. As I have said, they were guillotined in an even more draconian fashion through the House of Representatives only a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem is not due to any obstruction by the Opposition or to any excessive and unnecessary debate by this chamber. It is due, as I said, entirely to the Government's mismanagement of its own program and the fact that it has not been able to get its own house in order. It has not known what it has wanted to do. It did not know what legislation it wanted to propose to this Parliament until it had had its special conference in September to get its riding instructions from the party organisation. This Government did not know what it wanted. Since it got its orders and permission from the special Labor conference in September, it suddenly decided that it wanted to show some activity and it has rushed through this Parliament all this legislation. That is what we are now being called upon to give effect to in totally inadequate debate. </PARA>

It is interesting to hear Senator Walters in full flight on this. I point out to members of the coalition that it will be Christmas the week after next and some of us do have homes and families that we are welcome to go back to. Senator Durack says that there is a time and a place for a guillotine, and the Christmas period has to be one of the motivations. It certainly is for me.

That is one of the reasons why we have brought in the new procedures whereby people get five minutes each and at the end of half an hour the question is put. But I will remind speakers that they are supposed to be debating why Standing Orders should be suspended.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. Senator Hill has moved his motion to suspend Standing Orders because he believes that this declaration of Bills as urgent should not be occurring, it being, in effect, a rolling guillotine for the next week. The Australian Democrats are pursuing this particular line, as I have said, because we believe that this is the time and the place for this kind of procedure to be imposed on the Senate-for some discipline to be imposed on the Senate-unlike the performance during the appropriations debate where we had 11 hours of second reading debate and 37 hours in committee, in spite of the Estimates committees' time. There was not any change at all, even given the new committee procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of the Bills which have been proposed by Senator Ray to be declared urgent have been subject to extensive debate under the new committee system under which we have been operating. Several of the significant Bills and packages have been the subject of a great deal of debate and can be and should be dealt with expeditiously by this chamber. It is interesting to note-and maybe this is part of the motivation for Senator Hill's motion and for the Opposition's plan to oppose the effective rolling guillotine-that my spokespeople tell me that in many cases Opposition shadow spokespeople still cannot tell our people what they want to do with these Bills. Clearly, the Opposition is not doing its work. There is one opposition in this place, and that is the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if those shadow spokespeople know what they want to do with those Bills, they should let our people know and stop lobbing amendments on at the last minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will get a chance to test the bona fides of the Opposition in this place in the next session. There are at least two dozen Bills ready to be debated and they will be lobbed on us at the beginning of next year. It will be interesting to see how expeditiously they are dealt with. The practice and performance of this sitting period has been abominable. Two days ago, over two hours of the time of this chamber was taken up with a matter of public importance. Certainly, the rates of unemployment and bankruptcy are important, as is the proposed urgent legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this is the time and the place for this kind of procedure. It will enable students and farmers to get their levies in place and social security recipients to get their payments-a great deal of other important things can be done. The Democrats put on record their opposition to the Government's plans for the privatisation of Aussat Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and its plans to sell off the Pipeline Authority. We will oppose the Government on many things on this list of urgent Bills. We want the chance to show that we are the only real opposition in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the contingent motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) to suspend Standing Orders. In the last two or three weeks the Opposition has debated only two matters of public importance. A matter of public importance was submitted to the Senate for discussion on Tuesday as the Opposition felt it was important to discuss the 16,030 businesses that have gone into receivership. A total of 52 Bills will be passed by guillotine. This has never happened in the eight years I have been in this place. We have had guillotines in the past, but certainly not for 52 Bills. This is a record that the Government cannot take any pride in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious to me, and to everyone in Australia, that the Government is running its business in exactly the same way it is running the economy. It has caused many people to go bankrupt and it is going to bankrupt the democracy of this place. </PARA>

I am absolutely surprised that the Australian Democrats support the guillotine. I shudder to think what their founder and former leader would say. He always said that it was the job of the Democrats to keep the Opposition and the Government honest. Today they have vacated that position as the honest brokers of this Parliament. They have decided to take away the rights of all democratically elected senators in this place to debate the Bills coming before the Senate. </PARA>

If I went down the list-they are all here-of those opposite who voted in divisions on gag-guillotines with no debate allowed it would be embarrassing for them all. It was particularly cheeky to hear the sanctimonious claptrap from Senator Durack this morning. I will remind honourable senators what Senator Harradine said on that occasion. The reason I do so-I was interested to see it-is that it might save Senator Harradine the trouble of repeating what he said to Senator Durack. When Senator Durack moved a gag-guillotine Senator Harradine said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I do not know what the threat implied. Perhaps Senator Harradine will have the opportunity to say it again. I simply make the point, as Senator Robert Ray has already done: between 1975 and 1980-the Hansard record clearly shows this-the behaviour of those opposite when they had the numbers in this place was a disgrace. Regrettably, this is the first time in eight years that this has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> There has only been one sensible contribution to the debate from the opposition benches this morning on this urgency motion. To my amazement it came from the person who is significantly individually responsible for the mess that we are in-Senator Walters. She wastes more time in this chamber than most people. She made a very sensible contribution to this debate when she said to Senator Powell, `Why don't you go home?'. We moved this urgency motion for two reasons: firstly, there are important Bills on this list that the Senate has to deal with. Unless we can perform miracles and turn 24-hour days into 50-hour days, the only way-I would like to hear one person opposite suggest another-of dealing with these absolutely essential Bills--</PARA>

<PARA>The list does stipulate the amount of time. As much as possible, I will try to allocate the time having regard to what I know of the amendments that are coming and the number of speakers that have been forwarded to us. If, on some of these Bills, Opposition or Democrat amendments eventuate and that particular stage of the debate has not been reached, each of those groups have contingent notices of motion that allows those amendments to be voted on. We will certainly not be trying to obstruct the use of that, if we get into a situation where we are not in the committee stage. It will allow for some sensible planning of speakers in the second reading debate and for time for the committee stage. This particular guillotine and the allocation of time is quite unlike many in the past. </PARA>

So Senator MacGibbon should not come in here and start preaching to me about guillotine motions. His hands are not clean on this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the real irony of the guillotine-and I might as well put this on the record-is that in the next hour we will hear a lot of argy-bargy debate from the Opposition. Some of that will come from senators with clean hands because they have never voted for a guillotine; others will be recidivist. There is only one reason why Senator Hill never voted for a guillotine, and that is because he was not preselected in 1977; he was preselected in 1980. That is the only reason he never voted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many times have I done it? I have not looked up the record. But I have never resiled from doing it. I want to put the reality on the record. We will hear a lot of argy-bargy from the Opposition about the rape of democracy and the abuse of this chamber. The truth is that 80 per cent of the Opposition senators will walk out of the Senate door and be pleased that the guillotine motion has been passed. In their deep heart of hearts, Opposition senators know two things: they will say, firstly, `It is going to get me home on time at Christmas'; and, secondly, `We know the disciplined way in which the debate is going to go'. Opposition senators will not have this terrible nagging at the back of their heads that their delaying tactics will cause them to miss their Christmas turkey. That is the reality of it. They know it and I know it; they cannot say it but I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the consideration of legislation in this chamber, it is a reality that in modern times there will be more legislation than there was 20 or 30 years ago. The complexity of today's society is reflected in the need for legislation. It is not a philosophical position. I think it is a reality of the complexity of the late 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing is that this year has been an election year and there has been an abbreviated autumn sitting. Even though I hear people say, `You should have had a longer autumn session', I guess that if we had called for volunteers opposite they would have been very few in number. The third aspect is how this chamber treats legislation. It is readily admitted by me that a weakness on the Government side is that legislation does not come in on time. I have admitted that and that we are trying to address that by changing the cut-off point for instructions to draftsmen, and Ministers who do not comply will have their Bills dumped. Opposition senators should acknowledge that the House of Representatives is passing 20 to 25 Bills. The Bills are not coming to this chamber this session; they will be ready and available in the autumn session. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to admitting that there is some guilt on the Government side generally in terms of programming, it is also true to say that honourable senators in this chamber do have a tendency on occasions to meander. Five hours was spent debating smut on 0055 numbers. We get off when someone gives a trip report. It takes an hour and a half to relate how they have swanned around the world somewhere. This session we have had more ministerial statements than normal-and I really think it helps this chamber-and that will continue into the future. It has been a complaint of the Opposition that, too often, major announcements are made outside the chamber or at Question Time. So, on the very major issues, we are making sure that ministerial statements are available. We have gone on with disallowance motions; we have had committee reports debated at length; and we have had all sorts of Government responses to committee reports, because the more committees we have the more reports we have and the more Government responses we need. All those sorts of activities impinge on the time available to discuss legislation in this chamber and, because they impinge on that time, there is always a rush towards the end. </PARA>
<PARA> Later on people may ask, `Why don't you try to let goodwill work? Let the system work itself out and you will probably get most of the legislation'. I took that approach weeks ago when I detailed the amount of absolutely essential legislation that has to be passed by the end of the year. I knocked 15 to 20 Bills off the agenda then. That is normally done in the last week, but I did it well in advance so that everyone knew. There has been no concentration of the minds of honourable senators on what is a realistic timetable; that is regarded as someone else's problem. We could get up here every day and draw attention to the fact that time is slipping away and we should move on, but what good would that do? This chamber, to its credit or otherwise, is not disciplined in terms of the allocation of sensible time. What worries me about the guillotine and the rush at the end of the year is that some people are prohibited from speaking on issues about which they feel deeply and which are often very important to them. One reason they have to make that sacrifice is that earlier on, just for the sake of ego trips or whatever else, hour after hour was wasted on what most people here would regard as irrelevancies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the motion. I will not speak at length because a number of my colleagues want to raise specific issues about the time allotted to particular Bills. In some instances they are Bills on which honourable senators have been working for many months in an individual capacity and through the committee system in this place. One has only to glance at the list that has been put before honourable senators to appreciate that the time appropriated to particular Bills is totally unsatisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the suspension motion I did not get an opportunity to say that while I am not surprised the Government is in the business of restricting debate, which is really what this amounts to, it runs contrary to everything the Australian Democrats pledged when they were established and came into this place. As one of my colleagues colourfully reminded us the other day, the Australian Democrats came in here under the pledge to `keep the bastards honest'; the Australian Democrats were never going to support a gag, a guillotine or a limitation of debate because this chamber was the chamber of debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the other place is not a chamber of debate; it is simply a chamber of numbers where legislation gets rubber-stamped. There was no better demonstration of that than the 37 Bills which were rubber-stamped through the House of Representatives in the last day or two of its sittings this year. There was no reason for that to have happened. The Senate is sitting weeks longer and the House of Representatives could have done so also. Since the Government has the numbers in the other place, it was not prepared to so do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not want to debate the legislation. Once the Government says it is in the interests of the nation, that is the end of it and the parliamentary process can be damned. That is the attitude of this Government. Had the Government the numbers in this place, we would not be sitting these extra days. There would not even be the opportunity for the limited debate we have been given. These Bills would have been rubber-stamped already and the Senate would have risen. The Australian Labor Party simply sees the parliamentary process as an impediment to government. That does not surprise me because the Government has applied the guillotine before. Senator Collins was wrong when he said this is the first time in eight years that the Government has sought to apply the guillotine. The Government has applied it before. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this is the only opportunity for the Australian Democrats to contribute. Apparently they were elected by their constituents to contribute on these issues. I think it is appalling that they are now prepared to enter into a deal with the Government to restrict debate. I can tell the new generation of Australian Democrats that I cannot imagine Chippy being prepared to enter into a deal like this. The Australian Democrats may well want to get home early but they have an even greater responsibility, and that is to their constituents. Members of the National Party and the Liberal Party are prepared to give the proper time necessary to deal sensibly with the legislation to the best of our capacities in order to produce a better product than the Government has put up to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray said that in his view some speeches by honourable senators are irrelevant. Everyone has their particular interests; they bring to this place particular expertise and particular areas of responsibility, and that is what makes this place work, when it is allowed to work well. Senator Robert Ray might regard some contributions as irrelevant but to other honourable senators and their constituents they might be highly important. Today is a disappointing day. The Government is doing what it would do so readily had it the numbers in this place-that is, simply applying a rubber stamp to the decisions of its factions and its Caucus. </PARA>

I remind the Senate that not only at the end of the year but also at the end of every parliamentary session it is said that there are too many Bills to go through in the time allotted. However, through the application of commonsense that can always be achieved. The Government does not have to go over the edge in the regulatory process in the way it is seeking to do today. The program would have been achieved and the Senate would have got through it. The Opposition has always indicated that Bills necessary to be passed in a session will be passed by this side of the chamber. We are not in the business of blocking that type of legislation, but we are in the business of seeking to do our job properly.

Although it has been said before, I would like to underline the fact that this year the Senate had to get up early because the Government was so incompetent it did not have legislation ready for it to debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all remember that we had an election in March. When did we sit? We did not sit until May. The last period of sittings is the shortest time in the history of Australia that the House of Representatives has sat. This is what the Government thinks of the Parliament of this country. We are all well aware that it is the policy of the Government to abolish the upper House, so it really does not surprise me. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not tempt me to quote Senator Gareth Evans. Without any doubt, the abolition of the upper House was written into the Government's policies. Gareth Evans said, `Well, that does not go down too well with the people, so let us make it our aim but take it out of the written policy'. We all remember that. The Government does not have to remind us. That is the way it treats the Senate. It treats the Senate as though it were totally unnecessary and, as Senator Hill said, as just an impediment to the Executive of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the added blessing of the new committee system. I know that Senator Zakharov will agree with me when I say that her chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has worked extremely well. We were able to avoid hours of debate at the committee stage of one of the Bills that we looked at by saying in the committee stage that we had already gone through all that in the committee system that operates on a Friday. There was no debate at the committee stage. I would say that it saved the Government hours of debate that would have normally taken place on such a large Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had the cooperation of the Opposition. It is totally the Government's fault that it is now proposing to use the guillotine.

What sort of a leader do the Democrats have? Ye Gods! For Heaven's sake, bring Chippy back. I have never heard of anything so pathetic. Do the Democrats not know why they were voted for? Are they unaware of their responsibilities in this House? Are they unaware that what they are meant to be doing is scrutinising legislation, instead of saying, `I want to go home. It's Christmas and to heck with the legislation. It does not matter that we have only an hour for the corporations legislation and only three hours for the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill. That does not matter at all. We want to go home'? This is my invitation: please go home and allow those people who want to carry out their responsibilities to do so. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at the reality. The second reading stages of debates are not debates at all. One comes in here with prepared speeches and positions, and nothing whatsoever is changed. As Senator Powell pointed out, we have spent hour after hour, day after day, on the appropriation debates, so-called, and not one thing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition simply votes, with a rare exception, as a bloc. Today we have an adequate opportunity to deal with important legislation. It may well be true that the second reading stages of Bills will be truncated but, as I have indicated, nothing happens in them. The second reading stage is not a debate. That occurs in the committee stage. Even there, since I have been in this chamber, very rarely have we had real debates. I recall the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission debate, which was a real debate. It went on for a very long period of time, and people changed their position. That is very rare. </PARA>
<PARA> Will there be any change in position at all on the majority of Bills that are before us at the moment? Because of the committee system that Senator Walters has drawn attention to, mostly the positions are known, the positions can be put. We will see Government and Opposition vote as blocks, and nothing will change as a consequence of that. Senator Ray indicated in introducing this motion that the Government will look at changes to times. As we go along, some extra time may be needed on some Bills. It seems to the Democrats that that situation is perfectly adequate to deal with the Bills which are before the Senate, particularly bearing in mind the enormous procrastination and waste of time which has gone on in this chamber in this session on the part of the Opposition. </PARA>

I am probably being a bit unfair to Senator Ray. It is not just Senator Ray; it is the whole of the process of government that led, in the early part of this session, to us almost having to walk out of the Senate because there was nothing to debate, because the Government had not been able to produce even one Bill for us to debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a drift in this place over weeks and weeks now. There has been no evidence of any form of planning of the legislative program. Now we are being forced to guillotine legislation that is worthy of much greater debate. Senator Ray magnanimously said that he is going to be fairly flexible on this, that he will allow for sensible planning over the next six days. I asked, `What does that mean?'. He said that if we are running a bit late on a Bill he will give us another 10 or 15 minutes in which to debate it. As I said, big deal!</PARA>
<PARA> There are many important amendments to very important pieces of legislation to be considered over the next few days. In the tax area, for example, there are some major pieces of legislation affecting a large number of Australians. Senator Watson, if he gets a chance in this debate, will say something about that. For example, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill is going to be debated with two other important tax Bills. The total time for debate on all of that is 1 1/2 hours. There are fundamental flaws in that Bill which require amendment and require proper consideration. That is not going to take place at all, given what has now happened today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill, the biggest package of measures dealing with the law and the administration of corporations in Australia, has been allotted one whole hour for debate and consideration. The Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, a major Bill, will get three hours. It will get more, I think, than any other Bill. One of the reasons for that is that it was such a cataclysmic and traumatic exercise for the Government even to be able to get its left wing power brokers and its trade union dictators of what it does here to allow it even to sell 30 per cent of the bank. The Commonwealth Bank should be 100 per cent privatised. The issues involved in the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill go to the whole heart of a large part of public sector management and aspects of ownership and control in Australia, and it is being guillotined in three hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is going to get 45 minutes; it got even less in the House of Representatives. That is a Bill to set in train the privatisation and the sale of the Moomba to Sydney Gas pipeline. So badly has the Government handled this whole exercise that it has been in the courts for months and the processes it has been following have been found by the courts of Australia to be illegal. The Government is going to try to push that Bill through this Parliament. I hope the Democrats are going to stick with what they said last week and oppose it. There are fundamental issues there that need to be debated and we are going to have 45 minutes to deal with that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill is going to get 30 minutes. That Bill is about corporatising the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, turning it into quite a different animal. That fund deals with something like $6 billion of superannuation funds, and there are faults in that Bill as well. All that is to be pushed through this place in 30 minutes. Other major asset sales, relating to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in particular and some other related aspects of further asset sales, will receive 45 minutes. Again, there are major issues there to be debated. </PARA>

I could have written the speeches for all of the sanctimonious claptrap, nonsense and hot air that has been delivered in this debate this morning, all of it anticipated, because I have written such speeches in the past when in opposition. I have made this observation on past occasions: on matters of political principle there is a huge gap between government and opposition. But I have noticed over the 14 years that I have been in this business that on certain issues, particularly issues of parliamentary procedure, for some strange reason absolutely separate from the political complexion of whichever party is on the government side of the House, governments tend to sound like governments and oppositions tend to sound like oppositions. I notice from the smile on Senator Bjelke-Petersen's face that she probably agrees with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that guillotine and gag motions were moved on a fairly routine basis in the House that I spent 10 years in. The only substantial difference in the speeches I have heard from the Opposition this morning and what I used to say in the Legislative Assembly is that I used to do it better. I have said it all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) has pointed out repeatedly in the debate this morning, without getting a response from the Opposition-I, too, tried to get a rise from the Opposition and failed-that a number of people, most of whom have spoken already in this debate, really have no right to speak. Senator Walters is certainly one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Ray, with all of the abuse that has been heaped on him this morning, had attempted to apply a gag-guillotine in the routine way it was applied by the Opposition when in government, then the Opposition would have something to complain about. In respect of my experience in the Senate and the democratic process being impeded by putting in a bit of discipline on time spent on legislation, if the quantity of debate was directly relative to the quality of the end product, without doubt this chamber would produce the best legislation in the world. I think it is probably arguable whether it does or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The harsh reality is-to use an expression much favoured by Andrew Peacock-that we in the Senate tend to debate everything in front of us to death; we bludgeon it to death with debate. Very little discipline is exercised by the Opposition in respect of debates with its own members. Senator Ray has made an allusion to it this morning and I share with him the regret that he has expressed. I believe that these are chambers for debate. If people have strong views on a subject they are entitled to debate them. I have the same irritation when people on both sides of this chamber get up in debate-and they have certainly done plenty of that this parliamentary year-and simply talk for the sake of talking. </PARA>
<PARA> This is truth time. Senator Ray has delivered the most substantive contribution to the truth debate this morning, the Realpolitik of this debate, and I intend to add to it. To the credit of Senator Durack, he tried to exercise a bit of gentle discipline with his own side. He stood up in the second reading debate on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and remonstrated very gently with members of his own side that perhaps there was no need to prolong the debate unnecessarily. It availed him nothing. We had hour after hour of absolutely useless debate in respect of that particular legislation, which has been repeated.

The one criticism that could not be routinely levelled at this chamber is our lack of capacity or willingness to debate subjects, which is second to none. The application of this kind of guillotine is a rare event. A much gentler guillotine is being applied on this occasion. As we have not voted on it as yet, I should say that this is a much gentler guillotine than has been applied in the past. The early stages of the debate this morning were led by Senator Durack. He has moved guillotines in this chamber on previous occasions. This just shows how hollow and sanctimonious this debate really is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contributions have been made this morning regarding Senator Ray's alleged lack of involvement in attempting to get some rationality into the debate on an earlier occasion. He did precisely that: lists were produced and discussions were held weeks ago, much earlier than in past years. It availed the Manager of Government Business in the Senate nothing. It fell on deaf ears, which is why we are in this position at present. As I said before, it is easy for Senator Walters. In defence of Senator Powell, I want to inject a bit more truth into this debate. Senator Powell was attacked rigorously by Senator Walters this morning for dereliction of duty and not fulfilling the role to which she has been elected-and various other claptrap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is dead right. A little bit of truth in this debate is a breath of fresh air. It is easy for some senators in this chamber-I will not single out Senator Walters-to say that they have no difficulty in sitting here week after week and month after month. But some of us are not in that position; some of us have responsibilities. To be fair, only two responsibilities concern most senators-the Senate and their family. A few senators in this place occasionally need to get home.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter of judgment, it is a matter of looking at the Hansard and seeing how much time was taken. If one looks at the time that was taken on questions asked by me and by other senators, one will see that in so far as 0055 is concerned, it was around about an hour and 45 minutes. That was for questions. Senator Collins, on the other hand, was the one who was at fault because he obviously could not understand what the implications were, and if one studies that document one will see that. Senator Ray glibly made that statement. He obviously did not know that I raised this issue in the Estimates committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the officer of Telecom Australia, Mr Stan Fish, Manager of the External Relations Branch of the Office of the Corporate Secretary, was present at the Estimates committee, and the Minister indicated that there was no-one present at the Estimates committee who could answer the questions. We had present the man who was writing to my constituents about 0055 and the Discovery service. The Discovery service was an important issue, similar to 0055. The real issue was whether the Federal Government should permit Telecom to act in effect as the publisher and agent of sexploit profiteers undermining the status of women in Australia. If Senator Ray thinks that is of no interest then let him be judged on that. If Senator Collins thinks that is of no interest, let him be judged on it-and he will be. Whilst I am on that subject, certain questions were asked by me in the Committee of the Whole which have not been answered. Senator Collins said that answers would be obtained, and those questions have still not been answered. </PARA>
<PARA> The same goes for the Attorney-General's Department portfolio. Senator Tate was asked questions about the role of Justice Elizabeth Evatt on the international committee on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Those questions have not been answered. With regard to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans has not yet answered questions that I raised at the Estimates committee. I put the Government on notice that I am getting sick and tired of not getting the answers to the questions. I have been waiting and waiting. So far as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is concerned, I have been waiting two years for answers to questions that I have been raising with Senator Evans on violations of human rights in China and various other places.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unrealistic allocation of time by the Government in guillotining important Bills currently before the Senate is a reflection of a lack of communication between members of the Executive Council. When undertakings are given by responsible Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, reasonable people should be entitled to rely upon those undertakings being honoured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party coalition, on the understanding that there would be adequate time allocated to the Tax Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill, decided that the Bill could be fully debated in this chamber-we were given that undertaking-rather than be referred to a Friday Senate standing committee. Because of the importance of the issue, we now ask that tomorrow be allocated so that undertaking can be fulfilled. A request should be made by the Government that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration be convened to examine the committee stages of what is a very important piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If I can speak to just one Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill comprises the most complex set of amendments ever to find their way into taxation laws. These amendments mask even the momentous capital gains changes which the courts have described as confusing, unintelligible, badly drafted and a nightmare for interpretation. It is important that we discuss the issues involved so that the wider community can take on board the matters that are going to be raised within this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the coalition was ready for this debate weeks and weeks ago, perhaps even months ago, but because of the Government's priorities the Bill has slipped down the debating order of importance, and now a sensitive and important Bill is going to be guillotined to 1 1/2 hours. This compares with three hours for the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, and that Bill has already been to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Surely the Government should be prepared, within this guillotine arrangement, to set aside tomorrow. This would be at some inconvenience to members, but I am prepared to sit and I hope others are, and I hope the Government can in this way honour its undertaking to the people of Australia and particularly to this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must be impressed, to some extent, with the discipline that the Liberal-National Party coalition has exercised in relation to taxation debates. The issues of irrelevance that Senator Collins has raised could not be pointed in this direction. I refer to the debate yesterday, for those who have short memories, on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), when the three contributors on this side deliberately limited themselves to the issues for which they have personal responsibility. I also express some disappointment in the attitude of the Australian Democrats in supporting this guillotine motion. Perhaps it would be more appropriate if they called themselves the `New Democrats', because what they are doing today is a far cry from their original charter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we look at the issues involved in the debate subject to guillotine so that outside contributors can come in and focus on those issues in those Bills. Is it all that important that all the guillotine legislation is passed? It is more important that we get the Bills right. The coalition has assured the Government that it will give priority to getting through Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) expeditiously because that Bill involves, among other issues, tax cuts to ordinary people which were announced on 20 November. That is not a Bill that has been declared urgent. The Government is seeking to create a precedent to set up those tax changes effected through regulations. We understand that this procedure has received some sort of authority from the Attorney-General's Department. I regret that, despite requests, this information and this brief have not yet been given to the Opposition. We believe this is a denegation of the rights of the legislature and again reflects the position of the Executive vis-a-vis the Parliament. It is indeed a sad day for democracy when we have to resort to that sort of practice which overlooks the rights of the Parliament. In the guillotining of this sort of legislation, important issues and important rights are being sacrificed. We cannot afford to sacrifice democracy, rights issues, et cetera, merely for the personal convenience of honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about management. It is about whether or not the Government has ordered its business in such a way that there can be proper debate and discussion of important legislation that comes before this chamber. What we have seen in fact is incompetence. What we have seen is lack of management. In this particular list of so-called urgent legislation-and, indeed, this and perhaps other pieces of legislation that are not even listed could be termed `urgent' in the concept of legislation which is required-are two Bills that concern me particularly. Firstly, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 and, secondly, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 concerning computers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What makes a piece of legislation urgent in the eyes of the Government? As far as the bounty Bill is concerned, the Government before the end of the financial year forgot about that scheme and forgot that it required new legislation. In the interim, we have had press releases and a promise to bring in the legislation. The question arises whether any of the payments that are made between the expiry of the scheme and the passing of legislation will indeed be valid. Yet we have been given a very short period of time in which to debate this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a management question. We have seen incompetence by the Government. It is concertinaing debate through this chamber, and the price of denied debate is poor legislation. We have seen plenty of poor legislation coming from the Government, and we have to subsequently remedy the mistakes that the Government makes. This concertinaed program that we have been presented with today simply means that, once again, we see a government that is not in control of its own business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concluding my remarks on the second reading on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 to which the Opposition has moved a second reading amendment. The amendment seeks to give effect to a decision which was handed down by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). I exhort members of all parties in this chamber to carefully consider the consequences of not supporting this amendment. The Government has moved the goalposts while the game was still in play and honourable senators, who in this case are acting as the umpire, must act to ensure the goalposts are moved back to the place where the contest started, otherwise it will be impossible for justice to be done for the players who, in this instance, happen to be the Bass Strait partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this amendment is not supported, every citizen and every business will be on notice that they can no longer expect certainty with our laws-and worse, that by this type of legislation they can, and will, be prevented from mounting any sort of successful and effective challenge to that legislation. The purpose of this amendment and the subsequent committee stage amendments is simply to allow an appeal to the AAT to be given effect and not aborted by legislation which is blatantly retrospective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to two of the Bills very briefly: firstly, the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 and, secondly, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, to which Senator Parer has directed so much attention in relation to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd's (BHP) exploitation of wells in Bass Strait. The Australian Democrats do not oppose the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill. We recognise that the amendments contained in this Bill are necessary since the principal Act, as it now stands, applies only to offshore petroleum production areas and the Government, quite correctly, seeks to incorporate onshore areas into the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Act, as it was initially drafted, failed to anticipate at that time that any onshore petroleum production operation would ever reach the 30 million excise-free barrels limit in this country. Accordingly, the Democrats agree that these amendments are necessary so that the definition of oil producer is expanded to include onshore producers as well as those operating in an offshore capacity. The Democrats have been advised that cumulative production from the Jackson oilfield in south-west Queensland will exceed the 30 million barrel excise-free limit early in the new year but, as Senator Parer has already pointed out, even with this field this amendment may not apply for other reasons. In the spirit of the principal legislation, it is absolutely appropriate and proper that production from the Jackson oilfield and other onshore producers become liable for petroleum excise. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the retrospective commencement dates under clause 3 of this Bill, the Democrats have a longstanding opposition to retrospective legislation. Nevertheless, we believe that under certain circumstances that is not an absolute impediment to retrospective legislation. In this case, we believe that the commencement clause being backdated to 26 December 1987 is justifiable, since it involves bringing all producers onto a level playing field-something much touted by the Opposition as a desirable goal, as was clearly intended in the original legislation and as is appropriate. Significantly, this legislation will not prejudice or unfairly affect any person's rights or legitimate expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The operation of this amending legislation is prospective in its application. It is important to stress that the regulations under the Act will not operate retrospectively. This is the essential point of debate on this legislation. The Senate must appreciate that the regulations will operate prospectively and not retrospectively. The Democrats remain opposed to legislation that includes elements of retrospectivity within it, but it is important that we judge each Bill on the reasons it has been introduced. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats will not be opposing this Bill; nor will we be supporting any Opposition amendments in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, which is the one in greatest contention. I thank Senator Parer for making several comments in relation to greenhouse and several in relation to former Senator Chipp, whom he quoted as saying that he found retrospectivity repugnant and that there should be substantial reasons for accepting retrospective legislation. We believe that there are substantial reasons in this particular case. BHP has been paying excise with respect to several wells in the Bass Strait region at the old oil rate since 1980. This amending Bill seeks to correct an error which crept into an amending Bill which was passed in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, no-one likes retrospective legislation. The Government should be very closely scrutinised when it proposes retrospective legislation, particularly when legal action has already begun under the law as it stands and prior to a case being adjudicated on before the courts in which the Government seeks to change the ground rules, as it were. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, I believe, the Government has been negligent in its responsibility in not properly scrutinising over the last six years, that is, between 1984 and March 1990, the sections of this legislation in which BHP found that there was a defect, which defect it sought to use before the courts. It seems to me that the responsibility is fairly and squarely on government to continually scrutinise its own legislation and to attempt to discover loopholes and defects and to close them before matters come before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, the Customs officers have had six years to find this drafting error and correct it. It was left to BHP to find the error and to bring a case, as Senator Parer has pointed out, before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It was only at that stage, unfortunately, that the Government chose to correct this error. I believe that, as far as possible, this should simply not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I have already indicated, our opposition to retrospectivity is not absolute. I point out, as Senator Spindler has already, that the Opposition accepts that the public good is more important than the retrospective law concerning the legitimate confiscation of dangerous weapons, which goes back much further than 1984. I understand that the Opposition is quite prepared to accept that piece of retrospective legislation, which will legitimise an action which the courts have already ruled was illegal. There we have an instance where the court case has already been held. The Opposition quite clearly is prepared to accept retrospectivity, under certain circum- stances. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw a parallel with a piece of legislation recently passed in South Australia, because the principle on which we rely in this case to support this retrospective legislation is best illustrated by that example. In the case of the proposal to build a tourist development in the Wilpena Pound National Park, the South Australian Government acted contrary to several laws in South Australia, including the laws under the national parks Act and the planning Act, which required the preparation of environmental impact statements. As a consequence of that illegal action, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Conservation Council of South Australia sought to take action against the Government of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as in the case of BHP in relation to this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, the legal advice was that both those conservation bodies had an extremely good chance of success and that indeed the Government had acted illegally with respect to two quite separate pieces of legislation. In that instance, the South Australian Labor Government sought to pass retrospective legislation to change the legislation and essentially to pull the rug from underneath the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Conservation Council of South Australia. The Liberal Opposition in South Australia jumped up and down about that just as much as the Opposition in this place has jumped up and down about retrospective legislation but, when it came to the vote in the upper House in South Australia, the Liberal Opposition collapsed completely and supported retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it needs to be put absolutely fairly and squarely on the record that the Liberal Opposition in the Legislative Council of South Australia took a totally different position with respect to the important protection of a national park in the Flinders Ranges in South Australia-an area, incidentally, that has been suggested for World Heritage status. </PARA>
<PARA> In that particular instance-and this is the reason I use this example-everybody in the South Australian community, including the Government and the conservation groups, believed that the law meant a certain thing and operated in a certain way. The legislation there changed the way in which the law was understood and the way in which the law was expected by everybody to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the particular case before us today, we have retrospective legislation which does not in any sense change the way in which the law was intended to operate or was interpreted prior to 1984, or has been interpreted from 1984 right through until March 1990. Everybody believed that the law meant a certain thing and operated on that assumption. Indeed, BHP con- tinued to pay the excise at the old oil rate. It was only when a technical defect was discovered in the amending law of 1984 that BHP believed that it had a loophole which would allow it to claim that this oil was new oil and not old oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is not honest of Senator Parer to have claimed that everybody agreed that the oil was new oil and not old oil. Everybody agreed that the oil was new oil, based on the wording in the amending 1984 Bill. There is no contention about that. The point is that right throughout the period everybody believed-the Government believed and BHP believed-that the oil was not new oil but old oil. If BHP had believed it was new oil, for six years it had a perfectly legitimate mechanism by which it could have objected to that. That did not happen until this technical loophole in the law was discovered and action was taken in March 1990. In the present case, we have an amending Bill which retrospectively changes the wording of a 1984 Bill but does not change the way in which that Bill was intended to operate and the way in which everybody believed it should operate and the way in which everybody operated under that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wilpena legislation, which, as I indicated, the Opposition supported, not only changed the legislation but changed the intention of the legislation, changed the way everybody understood the legislation would operate, and effectively changed the way in which the legislation did operate. It pulled the rug from underneath the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Conservation Council of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that BHP in its letter made a considerable point that it was concerned primarily not about the amount of money involved, but about the principle of retrospectivity. At this stage the retrospective legislation in South Australia had not yet gone through the upper House. I asked BHP whether it would write a letter to the Advertiser saying, `Here is this piece of legislation which is retrospective. We think the principle is important and we object to this on a matter of principle'. </PARA>
<PARA> I said to Senator Parer, `Here is this retrospective piece of legislation which your people in South Australia are going to support in the South Australian upper House. You believe this is a matter of principle; will you simply write a letter to the Advertiser expressing your abhorrence on this important matter of principle?'. Both BHP and Senator Parer took no action on that matter. The Opposition is clearly not interested in protecting national parks; it is interested in collecting--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. At present we are operating under a guillotine which has been imposed on the Senate by the Government and the Democrats. One hour has been allocated for the remaining stages of this Bill, as I understand it. Any way you look at the number of senators, either at the total of 76, or at the Democrats' share of eight of the total, it seems to me that Senator Coulter is being extremely greedy having taken 15 minutes of that hour already. There are other speakers on the list. There are committee stage amendments. I wonder where we are going and how we are going to get there if the Democrats seek to take this length of time. Senator Spindler spoke previously in this debate. I would have thought 10 minutes was more than a fair thing and I would like to know where we are getting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a couple of moments and a few brief points to make. The situation is that the Opposition has already had three-quarters of the time which has been used so far. We have pulled one speaker off the speakers list. Senator Bourne will not be speaking. I have told the Opposition that it will have, as far as I am aware, all the remaining time, which is two-thirds of the hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that I am stressing is that we will not be supporting the amendments in either form being put by the Opposition. Therefore, the committee stage can be considerably truncated because our position is quite clear. The principle on which we are not supporting this retrospective legislation is that the way this legislation was intended to operate, the way it was understood to operate and the way it did operate and was accepted by all players until March 1984, is not being changed by this Bill. It is simply a technical change in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is one section of this Bill which imposes a 5c a litre-I think it is better to express it in that form-excise on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). I express some concern that at this time, when many people are having motor vehicles changed from petrol to LPG as a cost saving measure and as a measure which will address the problem of imports of foreign oil and also the problem of greenhouse to some extent, the Government is seeking to increase the price of LPG by as much as 5c per litre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 with very limited time as a consequence of the Australian Democrats having agreed with the Government to guillotine legislation. I will try to keep my remarks as brief as I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation has been outlined reasonably clearly by earlier speakers but for the benefit of those people who may be listening on this broadcast day and the people in the gallery I will explain the situation with respect to one aspect of this Bill. There is some oil in the Bass Strait that excise has been paid on since 1984 as though it were old oil. The Government passed legislation in 1984 intending to describe and classify that oil as old oil. That is what the Government thought it had done. It now finds out that is not what it has done. This particular oil in the Tuna oilfield is actually new oil. That means that the producers have been paying excise at a much higher rate and now they want some money back. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to say, `Hold on, you can't have this money back because we thought all along it was old oil. The fact that we didn't make it old oil by legislation does not matter; we are going to make it old oil by retrospective legislation'. The Democrats are getting into this ugly little plan on the basis of saying, `Well, the producers thought it was old oil as well'. That is not what the producers are saying. They do not say that they agreed that it was old oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline the basis on which the Government and the Democrats say that the producers should be judged as having agreed that this is old oil. It says that they have not complained, as if there is some responsibility on a private citizen-because it happens to be a company in this instance it is no different-to check out Government legislation, to thoroughly scrutinise legislation and to point out to the Government when it is wrong. The cost of not doing that is to have the legislation operating on citizens as though it said what the Government meant it to say. It sounds like Richard Nixon-`I know what I said and I know what I meant to say'. It is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA> The law is meant to be like a map-hopefully we will get it in plain English one day-that we can follow. We are meant to be able to follow it to the letter of the law. If the law says that we can go up alleyway A the Government is not entitled to say, `Hold on, we meant to call that alleyway B'. We are entitled to rely on what the law says. The Democrats say that we can throw that out. I suspect that part of the reason they say that is that the citizen being affected in this case is a corporate citizen and a big one. If this were one of their constituents that they are constantly seeking to bestow favours on it would not be the case. But because it is a big corporate citizen somehow this principle changes-big corporate citizens can afford to lose money; they can afford to be told that the law was that but now we are going to change it back to something else. That is what we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with one aspect of what Senator Coulter said; that is, retrospectivity is not something that we dislike per se. There is a reason we dislike it. It is not as though we have opened a fridge to find a container we do not like the colour of so we will never look at it again. There is some reasoning behind this. The reasoning is that if we have retrospective legislation we take peoples' rights away retrospectively. They operate on a certain basis for a period of time and then all of a sudden the Government says, `We're going to go back before that time and we are going to change what you are entitled to do'. The Government is going to take rights away. That is one of the reasons there is almost a unanimous agreement that retrospective legislation is generally a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason is that for the community to operate-I do not mean by that just the business community-and for citizens to follow the law they have to have some certainty as to what the law is. How are they to have that certainty? They do not go and ring up departmental officials and say, `What did you mean to say?'. They go to the legislation and see what it says. That is what the law is-what the legislation says. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government makes a mistake, as it has done in this sense, that is bad luck. Let the Government bear the burden of it. If we are getting to the stage where, if the Government makes a mistake we will decide in the Senate whether the citizens can afford it and we will make them pay, we are going down a very sorry road. It is all too easy to say that because it is BHP in this instance, a big corporate citizen, we will for some reason take a different attitude, forgetting that BHP is made up of lots of little shareholders. </PARA>

Then the corporate citizen, some time down the track says, `Hold on, you've got it wrong; the law is A'. Now we have the Government and the Democrats getting into bed with each other and saying, `Ha, Ha, we're going to change it back to B anyway'. That is exactly what we are doing in this particular instance. We are changing the law to the cost of a citizen. Some people in this chamber imagine this is a fair thing, simply because it is a big corporate citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This sort of thing has happened from governments on both sides. I will not pretend that it has not happened on my side of the chamber. There was a big debate in 1965, again in relation to a set of customs regulations. Customs seem to make a lot of mistakes. The last bit of retrospective legislation that was discussed, in relation to some machine guns, was a Customs one. We cannot blame the current officers because that may have happened before they were born-or not long after, in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter I want to talk about today relates to Ipec Transport Group. Remember the two-airline agreement? Ipec wanted to import some planes and run a freight business between the States. Ipec was originally refused permission by the government of the day, a government of my political persuasion. It appealed and said that permission was improperly refused on two counts. On one of those counts it was successful and permission was granted to trade a freight business between the States. On the second ground it was unsuccessful and it lodged an appeal to the Privy Council. At great expense it got to the Privy Council. What did the Government do? It met Ipec at the door of the court and said, `Ha, ha, we have introduced a regulation and now someone else has to give the permission, so all this is a big waste of time.'</PARA>
<PARA> That was an appalling thing to have happened. It was changing the rules when someone had gone to the umpire and gone to the court. All governments have done and it and every parliamentarian should speak against it when it happens-as certain Labor senators did at that time. Senator Turnbull from Tasmania was moved to look up some words of Sir Samuel Griffiths, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am sometimes inclined to think that in some parts of the Commonwealth the old fashioned traditional and almost instinctive standard of fair play to be preserved by the Crown in dealing with subjects, which I learned a long time ago to regard as elementary, is either unknown or thought out of date. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what seems to be the case now. Because we are dealing with a corporate citizen, we somehow think that the manner in which the Crown can deal with that citizen does not need to be as fair as it would be in dealing with anyone else. Let me paraphrase what another senator said and just insert BHP for Ipec: `What can be done to BHP today can be done tomorrow to any citizen. The Government is setting up a precedent of injustice to citizens and it is all the worse when that injustice is perpetrated by Ministers of the Government. It is no credit to them, it is no credit to the Cabinet which endorsed the decision, and it will not be to the credit of this Senate if it approves of the Government's action.'</PARA>
<PARA> The original speaker of those words was Senator Lionel Murphy, a judge much revered by many on the other side and in the community and a man who played a very significant role in setting up the Senate committee system. If he were here he would not, in my opinion, approve of this retrospective piece of legislation. Prior to that, Senator Murphy said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we are to have the rule of law in this community it should be applied not only as between citizen and citizen but it should be applied as between the Government and its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me move towards concluding because I know that we do not have much time. The situation is this: the Government admits it made a mistake; it thought the law said one thing, and it did not say that. As a consequence of that, one of our corporate citizens has been paying excise at a higher rate, and now the Government wants to get out of paying it back. </PARA>
<PARA> That corporate citizen has been to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). There were some very ugly manoeuvres on the other side of this chamber trying to get this Bill through, as I understand it, before that hearing was held. Then the Government decided to agree. There was not really a hearing in the AAT yesterday; there was a consent order filed, as I am informed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a case of the Government denying that it was wrong. I think the Minister admits that the Government made a mistake. Of course he does; otherwise it would not need the Bill. The corporate citizen was in effect denied its day in court by the Government coming along and getting consent orders filed. Why was that done? I could be wrong; I see the Minister frowning but that is what I was told. The Government went along to the AAT yesterday and said `Yes, we were wrong; this oil was the sort of oil that BHP says it was. Yes, there should be a refund', and that is that. Yet it comes in here today and says, `You should join with us in passing this Bill to make sure that refund is not given'. How can we put up with that? It is manifestly ridiculous if citizens cannot rely on the letter of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat it. The reasoning that the Government and the Democrats are using to say it should be okay today-in club, entre nous-to quietly slip this through and deprive a corporate citizen of the money is that they say the corporate citizen went along with it. All the citizens of Australia can now know that if they follow the law, perhaps believing that the law is as the Government says it is, and then they find out it is not, tough luck; the Government will be justified in changing the law because the citizen took the Government's word for it. We all know now that we cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA> What a disastrous situation. What the Government is saying and what the Democrats have been saying is that, because BHP did not complain, we can take their silence to be assent: `BHP agreed to this so it is all right; we will just change it back to what we thought it was'. I cannot stress strongly enough what an obligation the Government and the Democrats are seeking to put on citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The obligation now goes much higher than simply knowing the law. Heaven knows, there are plenty of people who say that being assumed to know the law is an unfair assumption because it is such a difficult task. Now we are going beyond that. We are saying that not only are people assumed to know the law but that they are assumed to know when the Government has made a mistake and that, if people do not know that, they can bear the financial cost of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be all right for some to say `That is okay in this instance because it is BHP and they can afford it', but I invite the Democrats to consider two things. Firstly, it is a mistake to think of BHP as just a corporate giant who can afford it. There are shareholders-165,000, Senator O'Chee tells me-who have an interest in this matter. That is the first reason. The second reason is the precedent that is set. Surely we must stick by the appropriate interpretation of the law -and that is what it says. If we shift today from the law being taken to mean what it says and as it is written; if citizens can no longer go along, look up a law and say, `That is what it says and that is what it means'; if we today endorse a decision that says, `No, the law does not mean what it says; it means whatever the Government thinks it meant it to say', then we are in very big trouble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there is the pressure of time, so I will be as brief as I can. In other circumstances I would not sum up in the second reading debate at all, but there are a number of important principles that I wish to refer to. The broad thrust of that--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I promise the honourable senator I shall not use much time. The broad principles that I wish to state have essentially been set down in the extensive committee hearings in response to debate between Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp, Senator O'Chee and me, and I will not take time to reiterate them now. I certainly will not enter into any of the rhetorical flourishes about when the Opposition voted for retrospectivity before and all those sorts of things which I would otherwise enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I do think it is important to put briefly on the record that the Government and, I am sure, every member of parliament shares the concern that retrospective legislation is not a matter to be taken lightly. It is, on its face, something that one should not do, and it requires very extraordinary circumstances to justify. Governments of all political persuasions around the world from time to time find themselves in circumstances where not so to act is worse than to act and, on balance, they take that action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government collectively has not taken the decision lightly and I, individually, have not taken my role in the debate lightly. But we do have a situation where it is not a citizen who has merely failed to protest. We have a circumstance in which the people paying this excise have paid it more than 200 times without protest in the sure and certain knowledge of what the mechanisms for protest were, because they were simultaneously paying another payment under protest on the same form, on the same day. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are dealing with an informed citizen, and we are dealing with a law-as this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill amends that law-under which everybody thought they were operating. I think it is fair in that sense; people are not having actions which they took rendered illegal or even made inappropriate retrospectively. All the decisions and judgments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator wants to interject, I can respond. We did deal with that. I acknowledged in the Committee that obviously there are adverse consequences for Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. It will be worse off if this legislation is passed than if it were not. I acknowledge that. I was skipping over it for brevity, but I do acknowledge that point, obviously. I simply say that, on balance, I think it is fair in the circumstances, but it is not taken lightly. There is a lengthy argument that I feel ought properly to be made, but I have had an alternative opportunity to make it and other senators have forgone their time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two points I make in conclusion. One is that this is in a drafting sense a minor Bill, although it is major in principle. It is what I would call a technical corrections Bill in its substance, although I understand its impact is significant and worthy of debate. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal in considering its matter said nothing new; it merely confirmed what we all knew as to what the law now says-and that is why the Government sensibly agreed yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the other two pieces of legislation, the Volware legislation is a very technical matter and nothing more needs to be said about that. I simply confirm for the record that the Government has circulated and will move an amendment, which I also understand is non-controversial, to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 December last on the adjournment I raised a matter concerning the Australian Customs Service, specifically a case entitled Oxford Clothing Co. and the Comptroller-General of Customs. I said that this case was to be determined on 11 January. I said also that it was a most important case because it was a test case concerning the practice of the Australian Customs Service of registering an error against not only the person who signed the form but also the owner of the goods if that was not the person who signed it, as well as the Customs officer who in fact did sign it. This particular case of Oxford Clothing Co. was a matter involving only $300, but both the owner and, as I understand it, the Customs agent were sufficiently concerned about this as a matter of principle, and about the way the Customs Service had behaved, that they proceeded to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to use this as a test case. This morning, around lunchtime, I called the AAT and spoke to the Deputy Registrar to ask him if that case was still scheduled to be held on 11 January, because I intended to be in Adelaide on that date to hear that case argued, as I too believe it is an important test case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I am very concerned to hear the following: the Deputy Registrar tells me that a preliminary conference was held between the owners, the agent, and indeed the Customs Service and that the Customs Service has offered a 100 per cent remission. It is highly questionable whether that is a legitimate thing for it to do, but of course it does have one serious consequence. Once the Customs Service offers a 100 per cent remission, no longer is there a dispute, and therefore the AAT is no longer seized of jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about this case for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is an important matter of principle. Secondly, I am most interested to know the amount of money, that is, taxpayers money, that has been spent in preparing this case both in terms of the initial penalty imposed and with regard to the AAT case. I am particularly concerned about this case being settled in this manner. I do not know whether or not the company or the agent concerned wished to have the case settled, but, of course, once the Customs Service makes the offer, there is no longer a dispute and therefore it is taken out of its hands. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the purpose of this settlement is simply to remove this case from scrutiny. In light of some of the other behaviour that has been going on, I could be well tempted to believe that that is the real reason for the settlement being offered. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the Deputy Registrar that documentation for this settlement must be filed with the AAT by the end of this week. I will be most interested to see the documentation. I will also be most interested to ask some questions about the costs that were incurred prior to this settlement offer being made. I would not want the Australian Customs Service to think that it would be possible to camouflage or conceal the costs, which may or may not include the cost of flying people over to Adelaide, putting them up in hotels and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> It is highly important, given the important question that was to be determined by this case, that I have found that the case has suddenly been pulled off. It opens up all sorts of questions rather than answers any. I simply want to inform the Senate that this case that I raised on 6 December and said was to be an important case has now been dealt with in this way by the Australian Customs Service and I shall be watching subsequent procedures regarding this matter with great interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate very long on this matter of public importance. I do not think honourable senators will be surprised that I am still sticking with the theme of imprudent lending practices by banks. In recent times there has been much publicity relating to imprudent banking practices by bankers and the huge losses occasioned by banks by the adoption of these practices. I propose to illustrate those practices by reference to Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd, a case which I have previously cited in reference to other aspects of banking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Miss Donna Batiste, the principal of Huon Valley Springs, applied to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for finance to purchase the lease of a penthouse at the Regent Hotel. The application was approved. The bank provided Miss Batiste a fixed rate bill endorsement facility for $1.1m, terminating on 28 March 1988. The interest rate was quoted at 15.1 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank did not waste any time before defrauding Miss Batiste. In a memorandum dated 12 June 1985, a Mr P.B. Herden, District Manager, New South Wales southern division, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Only the amount of the fixed interest rate is to be advised to borrowers. The following entries are to be passed in your branch's books:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. At the time of discounting:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the entries required was:</PARA>
<PARA>c) credit Discount Account . . . . with the amount of discount;</PARA>
<PARA>Another entry required was:</PARA>
<PARA>d) credit Accommodation Bill Fees Account with appropriate `endorsement fee'. This fee will be advised by Money Market Dealing Section and must not be advised to the borrowers;</PARA>
<PARA>Another entry required:</PARA>
<PARA>e) credit borrower's account with net proceeds after deduction of c) and d). </PARA>
<PARA>What this means is that the endorsement fee was to be charged to Miss Batiste but disguised as a part of the net discounted amount representing the interest. </PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, while Australia's leading bank was prepared to defraud Miss Batiste, it was not prepared to inconvenience its own branch. The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA>For purposes of Branch Contribution Reporting (BCR) a fee approximating all up fees will be passed on so as not to disadvantage branches. To sustain this, bills will be discounted at a lower rate than advised to borrowers thus enabling branches to retain income . . . . This arrangement is internal and under no circumstances are details to be advised to borrowers nor the fee debited to borrower's account. </PARA>
<PARA>Bills will be discounted at a lower rate than advised to borrowers! Mr Acting Deputy President, I would suggest that such practice is blatant fraud on the part of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more, however. Honourable senators will recall that in the case of Tony Rigg, which I have outlined in this place on several occasions for other reasons, the bank carried on the business of dealing in the bills to the overdraft account of Rigg's company. What that meant was that the bill rollover costs, representing interest and fees, increased the debit balance standing on the overdraft account, thereby incurring overdraft interest as well. That is what the bank did to Miss Batiste. The bills were rolled over to her personal overdraft account. That is naked greed on the part of the bank. The effective rate was far in excess of the quoted 15.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that in the case of Tony Rigg the bank purported to cancel the bill facility and issued proceedings out of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to obtain summary judgment for the face value of the last bill together with the roll-over costs and fees. That is what the bank also did to Miss Batiste. In the proceedings against Mr Rigg, an officer of the bank committed perjury. In the proceedings against Miss Batiste, an officer of the bank committed perjury. In an affidavit sworn on 15 December 1986, the Chief Manager of the New South Wales branches administration deposed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The initial bill of $1,100,000.00 . . . was due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on 30 September 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The defendant failed to pay to the plaintiff on 30 December 1985 the amount of the initial bill drawn under the Facility. </PARA>
<PARA>The allegation that Miss Batiste failed to pay the $1.1m on 30 September 1985 implies that Miss Batiste was in default to the bank. That allegation is false. Miss Batiste was not obliged to pay the $1.1m upon maturity of the first bill because it was part of an ongoing facility. The senior officer well knew that the first bill was part of an ongoing facility. Annex D to his affidavit, which is a copy of the application for the fixed rate bill facility dated 21 June 1985, stipulated as such. The application discloses the facility termination date as 28 March 1988 and states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank may determine the tenor of each Bill provided that no Bill except the initial drawdown Bills shall have a tenor of less than 85 nor more than 95 days. </PARA>
<PARA>What that means is that, during the term of the facility, bills would be rolled over on a periodic basis. Upon the maturity of a bill, any liability to pay the amount of the bill would be discharged save for the roll-over costs upon the drawdown of the fresh bill. I have previously explained the mechanics of bill roll-over facilities in relation to the Tony Rigg case. In any event the affidavit gives the lie to the allegation. Clause 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA>On or about 30 September 1985 the plaintiff rolled over the amount of the initial bill and endorsed and discounted a further bill of exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>A banker of this senior officer's standing should have known better than to make the misleading allegation. However, there is more. The senior officer went on to allege that the facility was granted by way of a single bill. Clause 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The plaintiff granted accommodation to the defendant by endorsing and discounting a bill of exchange with a face value of $1,100,000.00 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was not so. There were three bills, two with a face value of $500,000 each and one with a face value of $100,000. I will seek to table copies of these bills later. The bills were consolidated in one bill at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is yet more. Clause 8 of the affidavit goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Interest and other costs charges and expenses associated with the rollover of the initial bill were debited by the plaintiff to another account of the defendant with the plaintiff.</PARA>
<PARA>Nor was that so. The bank carried on the business of dealing in these bills to account No. 2018-291-941, that is, Miss Batiste's overdraft account at the Park and Castlereagh streets branch in Sydney, and to no other account. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be seeking leave to table bank statements as follows: page 1 showing the initial drawdown on 21 June 1985; page 14 showing the maturity of three bills on 30 September 1985, and drawdown of a fresh bill on that date. The difference between the face value of the initial three bills of $1.1m and the net discount amount of the fresh bill of $1,060,091.20 represents the `interest and other costs charges and expenses' referred to by the senior officer. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will see that, by the very nature of the roll-over transaction, the interest and other costs, charges and expenses could not be charged to another account. </PARA>
<PARA> The senior officer goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>The defendant failed to pay to the plaintiff the face value of the bill due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on 30 December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that allegation is false. The bill was rolled over and I will seek to table bank statements as follows: page 35 showing the maturity of the fresh bill on 30 December 1985; and page 36 showing the drawdown of the last bill on 30 December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter which I will raise at this time and which I will return to in greater detail at a later time. I table a copy of an account card for Ms Batiste's overdraft account. Written on the card are the words, `Destroy original of statements'. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Attorney-General for New South Wales to investigate these matters and I seek leave of the Senate to table the documents referred to. I apologise for the fact that, due to shortage of time, I have not extended the normal courtesy of allowing the perusal of these documents but, if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, wishes me to do so, I will make them available immediately and seek leave to table them at a later date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 principally amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Circuit Layouts Act 1989. It corrects a number of technical defects in the Acts Interpretation Act, the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act, the Family Law Act, the Federal Court of Australia Act, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act, the Marriage Act, the Racial Discrimination Act, the Service and Execution of Process Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Statutory Declarations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As many of the amendments are minor and technical in nature, I do not propose to comment further on them other than to say that the Opposition is not opposing them. I will confine my remarks to the more substantial amendments to the Bankruptcy Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the present economic climate, in this recession that we `had to have', this is an appropriate time for us to be talking about the issue of bankruptcy. In the September quarter this year there was a 32 per cent increase in the number of bankruptcies in Australia as compared to the September quarter last year. In the State of Victoria bankruptcies increased 70 per cent during the June 1990 quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. So it is somewhat encouraging to note that the Government is at least considering the issue, albeit in a piecemeal fashion, by way of this Bill which amends the Bankruptcy Act in several respects. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more significant developments is that, pursuant to the amendment to section 139d, the court will have a wider power to make an order in relation to property which is not strictly owned, but is at least enjoyed, by a person who is a bankrupt. This addresses the quite legitimate concern in the community that people who have been declared bankrupt often seem to enjoy a high standard of living. This amendment will allow some of the proceeds which might have been lost to the creditors to be brought back into the estate to be divided among the creditors. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important provision is that all bankrupts will be entitled to be discharged after three years, unless a valid objection to the discharge has been entered. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) assured the Opposition during the second reading debate in the other place that this provision was designed to remedy the undesirable situation where a large number of active bankruptcies cannot be finalised because in many cases of multiple bankruptcies the people cannot afford to apply to the court for a discharge order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the amendments relating to the interaction between creditors' petitions and debtors' petitions, which will allow the court to supervise the date of bankruptcy and prevent a debtor lodging his own petition to defeat backdating the date of bankruptcy on a creditor's petition. Another change which the Opposition welcomes is that search and seizure warrants, which may now be issued by judges or magistrates, will only be able to be issued by `an eligible judge'. </PARA>
<PARA> The main points I would wish to raise in relation to this Bill concern the significant changes which it makes to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The Bill introduces three principal amendments: a definition of indirect discrimination is inserted; the existing `dominant purpose' test is removed; and vicarious liability for discriminatory conduct is created. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have apparently come about as a result of recommendations made to the Government by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to bring the test for discrimination in the Racial Discrimination Act in line with the test in the Sex Discrimination Act. Firstly, in relation to indirect discrimination, the Racial Discrimination Act contains a definition of direct discrimination in subsection 9(1). Direct discrimination arises if a person treats another person less favourably than others would be treated in comparable circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to introduce a new section 9 (1a) containing a definition of indirect discrimination with the following elements: the discriminator must require the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition; the requirement or condition must be unreasonable; the aggrieved person must not be able to comply with the requirement or condition; and the requirement to comply has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the enjoyment of rights of equality. At present, the Racial Discrimination Act is the only piece of equal opportunity legislation not to have an indirect discrimination test. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in relation to the issue of a dominant purpose test, section 18 of the Act provides that conduct can be discriminatory where it is done for two or more reasons provided that a person's race is one of the reasons for the conduct, and that that reason is the dominant reason for the carrying out of the conduct. By way of contrast, under the Sex Discrimination Act, a person's sex, marital status or pregnancy does not have to be the dominant purpose for the carrying out of the conduct for the legislation to apply; it need be only one of the reasons for doing the act. Pursuant to this Bill, section 18 will be repealed and replaced with a provision similar to the one in the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in relation to the issue of vicarious liability, the Bill provides that, where an employee or agent of a person does an act in connection with his or her duties which is unlawful under the Act, the person or employer will be taken to have also done the act-in effect, a joint liability. However, there is a proviso that, if the employer or person took all reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of such an act, the employer would not be liable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has concerns about the phrase `in connection with his or her duties'. It may mean that, should an employee do an act which is not specifically authorised by the employer, the employer could be liable notwithstanding the proviso. It was held by the Commonwealth Human Rights Commission in a 1986 sex discrimination case, Boyle v. Ishan Ozden, that an employer can be liable without having knowledge of the relevant conduct; for the qualification to be invoked it is necessary to show that the employer took active steps to reasonably prevent the discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> We would prefer that the vicarious or joint liability be confined to situations where the employee is carrying out acts within the authority, both apparent and real, of the employer. However, we recognise the desirability of the two pieces of legislation, that is, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act, being uniform; for this reason we are not proposing an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General raised several matters during the brief opportunity he had for debate on this Bill in the other chamber. I have just received a copy of the letter which the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, has today written to Mr Peacock in relation to these matters, principally the constitutional implications of extending the definition of racial discrimination and the matter relating to vicarious liability to which I have just made a brief reference. However, I have not had time to consider the arguments advanced in this correspondence and nor has Mr Peacock. We will therefore have to trust that the issues lend themselves to satisfactory resolution by correspondence of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite these concerns, as I have said, the Opposition is supporting the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill and, indeed, welcomes a number of the changes which the Bill seeks to introduce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. As Senator Hill has said, and as the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) said in introducing the legislation, none of the amendments in this Bill are major new policy, although some are fairly important, and none of them have direct financial impact. The Government has had the opportunity in second reading speeches and otherwise to express its view, so I will add only one point to that, which is to comment on one part of the legislation about which I have been concerned for some time. The Bill creates the capacity to extend to the Australian Capital Territory the cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. It has been a matter on which the cooperation of the ACT Government has been a little bit slow in coming, but I am delighted that both sides are now proceeding to what should be a satisfactory resolution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is a large Bill which proposes a number of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 and a consequential repeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The Opposition will be supporting this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will principally be dealing with the major amendments to the two Acts and regulations with which this Bill is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 3 to 38 of part 2 of the Bill contain amendments to the Custom Act 1901. The main changes proposed concern the repeal of the export return scheme and the introduction of EXIT, which is an electronic entry and cargo reporting system for exports. The commencement date for the EXIT provisions will follow proclamation early in 1991, although the scheme has been up and running in a limited way since 1988. EXIT is an EDI scheme-that is, an electronic data interchange system-which will result in exports being reported prior to departure. Presently under the export return scheme, exporters lodge an entry manually, shipping and airline companies present a manifest for acquittal to obtain clearance and, after processing, copies of export entries and returns are forwarded to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of problems have been identified with the present paper based system of reporting exports. They include failure to report quantities, lodgment of late and inaccurate export data with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and a difficulty in controlling restricted goods. In addition to having the latest and more accurate statistics as an aid to facilitate economic planning, there is also the matter of being able to oversight the international trade regulations and customs law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a well established principle that nations can control the entry of goods into their countries and, of course, customs laws are one of the processes by which rights of entry are controlled. Following a prototype trial which commenced in Sydney on 23 October 1987, we now have the three-phase EXIT scheme which is designed to capture this export data prior to shipment. I might say parenthetically, having watched the export scheme, that it has not been without some high degree of criticism from a large number of users. Part of that, of course, results from the fact that costs are involved in setting it up. To be quite blunt about it, part of the problem has been the marked inflexibility of the person in Customs who fathered the scheme to enter into much or any debate about its shortcomings and to modify it accordingly. Nevertheless, it started, as I said, from a prototype trial on 23 October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Phase one of the scheme commenced on 12 December 1988. I should note in passing that the manual system is still available to operators. The intention of the scheme is to link exporters or their agents, depot operators, consolidators, freight forwarders and airline and shipping companies with the Australian Customs Service and, through the ACS, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and other government agencies having control over restricted or prohibited control goods. Exporters or their agents will be able to dial up the ACS and have the option of either manually keying in an export entry and having basic editing performed or automatic transmission of export data prepared on in-house software, using electronic data interchange standards or a manual entry. The Australian Customs Service will allocate an export clearance number which will in effect preclear goods for export. </PARA>
<PARA> The system will operate a third party communications network to connect users to the Australian Customs Service. In EXIT bulletin No. 3, users were informed that the ACS had selected OTC Ltd to supply the electronic store and forward facilities to be used for EXIT. There are costs involved with the scheme; this, of course, was one of the objections raised when it first came on line. The exporter will need a personal computer which is IBM compatible. Certain capabilities in that system will be required to access the software programs and do the communication required, and I do not propose to go through those. </PARA>
<PARA> As with anything the Government does, there is a cost. There is a registration fee of $33 per mailbox password for users who require one. Larger organisations have an option of registering and paying a corporate account of $300. Then there is a service fee, which for business accounts will be $20 per month for mailbox password; for corporate accounts it will be $150 per month. Next there is the transmission charge, with each connection to the EXIT network attracting a transmission charge at Telecom Australia commercial rates plus a 7c charge per kilocharacter for Austpac. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, there are the transaction charges. Business accounts will be charged at a single tariff rate of 89c per kilocharacter; a corporate account will have three tariff levels applied. As I said earlier, it is a three-stage change. Stage 2 participants have been or are still to be connected to the ACS mainframe via a third party community network. Tradegate Australia, of which the ACS is a founding member, is supplying the infrastructure for this second phase through the PAXUS ComNet network. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Customs Service's annual report for 1989-90, approximately 1,000 users are connected, with about 40 per cent of Australia's exports now being reported via the system. I note in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) that over 65 per cent of our export trade is being reported electronically. The difference between this figure and the one I cited earlier obviously relates more to the time period than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with these changes, clause 10 provides for the advance electronic reporting of ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew. Clause 12 provides for the tightening of Customs control over the unshipment of imported goods, especially when no cargo report has been provided or where it has not been provided in advance. These clauses also repeal sections 64 and 74 of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will tighten Customs control over unshipment of imported goods and aid in targeting risky cargo. At present, reporting must be done within one day of arrival. Forward warning, as imposed under clause 10, will allow more effective surveillance of incoming aircraft and vessels, their cargo and their crew. This will be an invaluable administrative aid because Customs resources are understandably very stretched at the present time. It will allow a higher standard of intelligence gathering and subsequent surveillance activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration first report on an inquiry into aspects of the Australian Customs Service commented, following its appraisal of the work of contraband enforcement teams, that the teams thought the following would assist the effectiveness of their operation:</PARA>
<PARA>Mandatory earlier notification of vessels entering Australia, including such data as crew lists, would provide timely advice for the arrival of vessels and crew fitting particular profiles. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Customs import-export control and inland revenue subprograms through the documentation examination role make a significant contribution to the interdiction of drugs and other prohibited goods. </PARA>
<PARA> In an Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report on passenger and crew processing, tabled in September 1989, a number of deficiencies in passenger and crew processing were identified. Of particular importance to the discussion today was the fact that ANAO identified inadequate checks of airline crew and found, further, that there was a lack of sufficient data on the extent and nature of prohibited goods carried by passengers and crew, and this insufficiency makes it very difficult to assess the effectiveness of any control programs. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment to the principal Act provides for four separate reports: first, the impending arrival report for ships and aircraft; an arrival report for ships only; a cargo report for ships and aircraft; and a crew and passenger report for ships only. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal briefly with the other amendments to the Customs Act. There are, in addition, three sets of amendments to the principal Act which deal with offences relating to the control of narcotic goods. The intention here is to correct deficiencies identified by the courts and the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 39 to 47 of part 3 seek to amend the Excise Act 1901 in relation to entry of goods for home consumption, delivery for export and delivery of certain goods for home consumption without entry. These changes are consequent upon the change to the EXIT system. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to deal with the amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. This third substantial body of amendments, which is contained in clause 49 of part 4, seeks to save the prohibited import status of dangerous goods under the second schedule of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Item 18 of this schedule was declared invalid by the Federal Court. As a result, goods understood to have been prohibited and therefore able to be seized by Customs are not, in fact, prohibited goods. This item was introduced by regulation in 1956 and prohibited the importation of goods which are `of a dangerous character and a menace to the community'. Goods included in this category are machine guns, land mines, toys contaminated with dangerous levels of lead, flick knives and other unsafe children's toys. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause, therefore, relates to the period 13 December 1956 to 11 October 1990. It covers goods seized by Customs during that period which were believed to be prohibited imports and which Customs believed it had the power to seize. The period from 11 October 1990 is covered by statutory rule No. 324, previously moved by the Government as part of its changes in this area of control of dangerous goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairly coincidentally, we have had a lot of debate about retrospective legislation this morning, before what would have been the normal luncheon break, on the preceding Bill, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill; and this clearly involves retrospective legislation by the Government to control what were formerly thought to be prohibited goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia do not normally look very kindly on any attempts by this Government to introduce retrospective legislation, particularly when the legislation is going to be retrospective by so many years, as in this case. But we recognise that there are special circumstances that apply in this case and we will not be opposing the use of retrospectivity at this time. I say that as someone who has had a very strong record of opposition to retrospectivity, even when it was proposed on one occasion by my own Party when it was in government. It is only under the most extreme circumstances that I can personally countenance its use, and I am satisfied that in the circumstances that apply in this Bill it is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> We do think that this Government uses retrospective legislation far too frequently. It is really forced into that position by some of the bad legislation that it puts forward. While I did not get a chance to speak on the suspension of Standing Orders or on the imposition of the gag and the guillotine in the debate today, the one good thing about it is that a large number of the 52 Bills that are going to be jack booted through this Parliament without any debate at all are certain to be fatally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the view that it is not always the duty of the Opposition to save the Government from its own stupidity and inaccuracies with legislation. The Christmas present that it will get will be a heap of unworkable Bills among these 52 that will be run through in the next 10 days. The community will make its judgment on that. But the community deserves it because it elected this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to this Bill, we recognise the fundamental problems which would arise if all the goods which have been collected since 1956 had to be returned to their owners; in many cases those goods would have been destroyed or disposed of. It would simply be quite impossible to do that. There is also the other point, that it would be highly undesirable to return to the people who sought to import them in the first place instruments that are lethal to the human race. I am not saying that all the instruments seized under this section of the Act since 1956 fall into that category; quite clearly, a large number of weapons, rifles, that were imported for legitimate target shooting and sporting purposes have been seized and apprehended and lost to their owners through that, and it is regrettable that that did occur. But overall there were a large number of dangerous items that have no part in community hands. Taking the whole thing together, we are left with a situation where we simply cannot make restitution for what has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes three sets of amendments to the Customs Act-provisions dealing with offences relating to the control of narcotics goods. The intention here is to correct deficiencies identified by the courts and the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very substantial Bill in that it legitimises the use of EXIT, which is going to be a new scheme which will cover pretty well all the exports from this country-which, hopefully, will be an increasing task in the years to come as we try to work our way out of the economic mess that the Hawke-Keating regime has got us into. The Bill also involves retrospective powers, which I have discussed. It changes ship reporting procedures and various other amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party and the National Party support this Bill and wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

Given that a jump of this magnitude in a single month has not been experienced for more than four years, I ask: has the Government now revised upwards its unemployment forecasts for the remainder of this year? Does the Government now expect unemployment to go to over 10 per cent? If not, what is the Government's forecast?

It was anticipated that unemployment would rise in the latter portion of this year-certainly in this quarter-and that is a matter of regret.

<PARA> In terms of Senator Short's question about revising forecasts, let me say that the forecast is a Budget forecast and it is not normally the practice in the course of a year to revise forecasts about any of these matters. After all, it gives the Opposition the opportunity to say, if it is true, that the Government did not meet its Budget forecast. I do not think a government should be in a process of continual revision of forecasts about anything of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked additionally whether it is anticipated that unemployment will reach double digit figures. It is extraordinarily difficult to indulge in any speculations about that sort of matter. We believe that some factors are in place that will help moderate adverse labour market conditions. I guess the main point there is the postponement of any general wage increase, a factor which greatly exacerbated unemployment during the period in government of those opposite, and which will not happen now. Certainly, I think Ministers think that the current economic downturn is likely to be a little more protracted than originally thought. However, I do not think there is any point in trying to make a forecast arising from that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of media reports about Iraqi claims of milk shortages causing hardship, including the deaths of babies. As some honourable senators would have heard on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio this morning, our Ambassador, Peter Lloyd, said that he has been doing his best to check out what information is available on death rates of infants. While it is impossible to draw any conclusive opinions at this stage, at least one set of available figures that has turned up indicates that, comparing the 1985 figures for infant deaths with those that are currently claimed to be running, the figures are about the same. To that extent, there is no evidence of any variation from normality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said in response to a question from Senator Bourne in this place on 28 November, most assessments of the general situation in Iraq indicate that the main impact of sanctions has been on Iraqi infrastructure and industrial production rather than on food or medical supplies. Certain foodstuffs have been rationed to ward off serious shortages and prices of some products have apparently risen. Otherwise, at this stage food supplies still appear adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> Security Council resolution 666 provides a framework for the provision of food under UN auspices if and when the humanitarian circumstances exemption to sanctions is determined by the UN Security Council to exist. If the Iraqi allegations were well founded, it would be expected that the Iraqi Government would, under those circumstances, be prepared to facilitate the procedures provided for in that Security Council resolution to verify that the hardships that it is claiming do in fact exist. The fundamental point to bear in mind in this respect is that Iraq has not allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), other recognised international humanitarian agencies or the UN Secretary General's special representative to visit Iraq to assess the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi authorities recently confirmed to our Embassy in Baghdad that there is still a firm policy that the ICRC cannot expand its role in Iraq to address the food and medical supplies problems which it claims sanctions have caused. The authorities also continue to reject any inter- action with the UN sanctions committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Avenues are available to the Iraqi Government to substantiate its claims and, if necessary, for action to be taken to address the situation. But Iraq has not chosen to use them. In view of such intransigence it really is very difficult not to conclude that the Iraqi Government's claims about the adverse impact of sanctions on children and other vulnerable groups in Iraq are yet another propaganda ploy by the Iraqis.</PARA>

Despite the horrific economic record in the latter years of the Fraser Government, because of the Hawke Government's achievements, Australia still compares favourably with the first 10 years of the Thatcher period. Comparing the period 1979 to 1988, the latest period for which Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures-the recognised international measure-are available, real gross domestic product (GDP) in Australia grew by an average of 3.1 per cent compared with 2.2 per cent in the United Kingdom; employment rose in Australia by an average of 2.2 per cent annually compared with 1.5 per cent in the United Kingdom; the volume of exports of goods and services in Australia increased by an average of 4.5 per cent whereas in the United Kingdom the increase was 2.7 per cent; and unemployment was at an average rate of 7.7 per cent in Australia while it was 10.3 per cent in the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>

Despite the disastrous record this Government inherited from the previous Government, our figures by comparison to those of the Thatcher period turn out to be vastly superior.

<PARA> We will be seeking to participate actively and constructively to ensure that the amendment conference makes a substantive contribution to the objective of the conclusion of an effective and fully verifiable comprehensive test ban treaty. We do not, however, expect this amendment conference to achieve a short cut to such a comprehensive treaty. All present indications are that quite substantial disagreement continues to exist about converting the partial treaty to a comprehensive one, and we do not expect the amendment being sought to be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA> The depository powers of the partial treaty, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, have a veto over any amendment to the treaty, and we expect that if the amendment is put to a vote the United States and the United Kingdom will vote against it. We hope, however, that the amendment conference can make progress on the nuclear testing issues. In particular, we will be seeking to further the development of work on the verification of a comprehensive test ban treaty. We and New Zealand are submitting a joint paper on verification for consideration at the amendment conference.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe that the conference should be extended or adjourned. Although we will do our best to make a success of the conference, we believe that the working body in Geneva, the Conference on Disarmament, is the appropriate forum for the detailed work required for the early conclusion of a comprehensive treaty, including verification, scope and compliance. The re-establishment this year in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament of an ad hoc committee on a nuclear test ban is a very important step forward in this respect, and we would not want to do anything to prejudice the ongoing effectiveness of its work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Teague for that confirmation. Perhaps he would like to table the document on which he bases his question at the conclusion of my reply. I invite him to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conversation was preceded, of course, by substantial discussions with me about what would be put to Prince Sihanouk, and was followed by a substantial report to me on the substance of that conversation. My recollection is a little hazy as to the detail. It is the case, I think, that Mr Costello would have indicated to Prince Sihanouk a theme which has been a recurring theme in all our conversations this year; that is, that there is a body of opinion in the West, which believes, short-sightedly, that the quickest way of achieving an appropriate resolution of the Cambodian problem is for there to be de jure recognition of Hun Sen. That is a short-sighted view for all the reasons I have put at length in answer to a question from Senator Teague earlier this week and, indeed, that I spelt out in detail in my statement in the Senate on 6 December.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe there would have, or could have, been any possible conclusion conveyed to Prince Sihanouk about the imminence of some armed intervention again in the situation in Cambodia because it is not my judgment, Mr Costello's or anyone else's whose advice I take or listen to that such a response of armed intervention is remotely likely in the event of the situation deteriorating and the Khmer Rouge reassuming some authority in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA> I spelt out the reasons for that, again in my statement last week. What I say in public on these important respects on this and on all other occasions is exactly the same as what I say in private. I do not have two agendas. I do not practice deceit in any respect in that way. It is my belief that the Western world, and indeed other regional countries, would be very slow indeed to get themselves immersed in such a situation in Cambodia, bearing in mind that there were 200,000 Vietnamese there for 11 years who were utterly unable to deal conclusively with the Khmer Rouge in a situation where they were supplied by an external power.</PARA>
<PARA> That situation would, I fear, be the case in the future. All of which points conclusively, once again, to the fact that if the tragedy of Cambodia is to be resolved, if the civil war in Cambodia is to be resolved and if a solution is to be found which enables all the parties in Cambodia to live in harmony, each with the other, then the only solution is the United Nations' peace plan devised by Australia, assiduously pursued by Australia and now adopted by the United Nations General Assembly Permanent Five and by all the regional countries and which we are now trying, with no help at all from Senator Teague or the Opposition, to bring to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Mr Finch said this on radio in Darwin, I could not believe what I heard. As the responsible Minister for this particular area in the Northern Territory, Mr Finch's statements are not only outrageously inaccurate but they irresponsible to the point of actually effectively putting people at risk. Lives could be lost as a result of the statements he has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made some strenuous efforts, both inside and outside this Parliament, to stress upon all mariners the great success of this new system of EPIRBS, and the facts speak for themselves. The emergency position indicating radio beacons have directly saved in excess of 60 lives since this system was established last October.</PARA>
<PARA> I am astonished by the statements made by Mr Finch. I cannot understand the basis for them. In fact, I asked my staff this morning to dig out the statement by Mr Finch in the Northern Territory News of the time boasting about the fact that Alice Springs was going to be used as the base for the ground station for the system, and saying:</PARA>
<PARA>NT Transport and Works Minister, Mr Fred Finch, said beacons would cost boat owners about $150 to install-``a very small price to pay for safety''.</PARA>
<PARA>There are State governments around Australia who are now moving to make the carrying of these emergency beacons mandatory-I would have hoped that would have included the Northern Territory-if people cannot be persuaded to carry them voluntarily, because, as I said in this House yesterday, these beacons dramatically save lives. The three most spectacular recent rescues of people using EPIRBS were all made off the coast of northern Australia in recent weeks-two of them in one day. So I do not know where the Minister has been on this issue. We are trying to persuade people to use them, not publicly persuade people not to use them on the grounds that they are ineffective. That statement is absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the chamber the other day, and a recent event in the Northern Territory due to a cyclone has demonstrated this, not only does the failure to provide oneself with a $200 beacon endanger one's own life, but also, as shown in the case of this recent rescue in the Territory, it means that rescuers, who place their own lives at significant risk-as they did in that case, flying around in cyclonic weather conditions-have to spend several more hours searching for the vessel than they would have to if the vessel had an EPIRB. So the carrying of these EPIRBS does not just save the lives of the people in the boat; it also exists to preserve the lives of people who might go out and rescue afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA> I absolutely reject the statements made by Mr Finch. They really were very irresponsible. I hope he retracts them, and I hope that he encourages people in the Northern Territory to actually use these beacons and not to not carry them.</PARA>

Mr Kazak has been told on a number of occasions that there is no inhibition or constraint on employing Australian citizens in the office because the office has no official status, and there is no inhibition that we can legitimately place upon him in that respect. But there is a degree of significance attached to anyone coming from overseas for that.

I ask the Minister whether he is aware of reports emanating from East Timor that after Pope John Paul II's visit, a large number of pro-independence protesters were arrested and tortured? How many reports of such human rights violations and related requests for assistance has he received since October 1989? Can the Minister advise what action the Australian Government is taking to assist people persecuted in this manner? Lastly, can the Minister advise how many of these people he has been able to assist?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5632" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that Australia supports the universal observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights. We are concerned about abuses of human rights wherever they occur. It is our practice to make representations about such abuses-or possible abuses-not on a selective basis but in every country where we judge it productive to do so. In the case of East Timor, it is sadly clear that there has been something of a deterioration in the human rights situation over recent months, although it must be said that the situation has vastly improved on that which prevailed in 1989 and, in general, it is significantly better than at any time since 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the more specific questions that have been asked, I am of course aware of the reports which emanated from East Timor after the visit of Pope John Paul II in October 1989 that a large number of pro-independence protesters were arrested and tortured. Those reports developed some currency at the time and have generated quite a lot since. But there was no conclusive evidence advanced to support what were very serious allegations. The Australian Ambassador to Indonesia led a team from the embassy in Jakarta to East Timor two weeks after the visit of the Pope, and he was specifically tasked by me to report on those allegations of human rights abuses following the papal visit. The Ambassador did have very wide-ranging discussions with Government officials, military authorities and prominent church and civilian figures in East Timor. The Indonesian Government did not hinder the latter discussions or act against those involved-a point which has been confirmed on subsequent visits to the province.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ambassador reported to me that he had not seen or heard any evidence to support reports of torture; that approximately 15 youths had been detained by local authorities for questioning following the demonstration and there was evidence that three of them may well have been beaten while in custody. The Indonesian authorities in Dili advised on 27 October that all persons detained from among the students who were involved in the demonstration at the papal mass had been released. That is as much as I can say on that question.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second question about the number of representations on these matters that I and my Department have received, there has certainly been quite a regular flow of such representations since the papal visit in October 1989. Those reports come from a variety of sources, including parliamentary colleagues, ministerial correspondence and meetings with human rights groups. It is simply not possible to give an exact figure; all I can say is that it is quite a substantial number and quite a continuing flow.</PARA>
<PARA> As to how we react when confronted with these suggestions of abuse, as I have already said, we do maintain a close interest in developments in East Timor as elsewhere when these questions arise. We have certainly continued to raise with Indonesian authorities these questions on human rights in the province. I have raised them very regularly during my contacts with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta also regularly raises particular cases and, as I said, visits East Timor as often as possible. For example, the Australian Ambassador has registered Australian concerns about the human rights situation in East Timor with the Indonesian Government on three occasions in the last six weeks alone.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last question, it is obviously very difficult to quantify the kind of success that flows from these representations and action. But we can, I think, claim fairly that we have very much raised the level of awareness in the Indonesian Government of the existence of such problems in East Timor and, certainly, the concerns held in Australia and the wider international community about their continued occurrence. Personally, I have no doubt that this enhanced awareness on the part of the Indonesian authorities generally has had a directly beneficial impact on the situation of those in the province who have either been victims or would have been victims of human rights abuses if we had not contributed to that consciousness-raising process. Further, I believe strongly that the substantial improvement in the bilateral relationship generally, which has occurred over the last couple of years, has greatly increased the preparedness of the Indonesian authorities to undertake a dialogue with us on human rights and investigate, on a regular and substantial basis, matters that we may raise with them.</PARA>

Mr Condon did seek advice from the Government on policy implications and he was told, through Mr Kerin, that we would not stand in his way on the basis that he would not be engaging, of course, in any commercial negotiations, and that he would take such opportunities as arose to make the case for the release of all hostages, not just the Australian Wheat Board staff.

<PARA>The invitation to go to Iraq was issued by the Iraq Grain Board while I was on business in the Middle East. We had been having ongoing discussions with our contacts at the IGB about securing the release of the hostages and they believed it would be valuable if I could discuss the situation personally.

At no time however was there any request, formal or informal, suggesting that the Government wished me to conduct discussions on their behalf.

Can the Minister inform the Senate of the current human rights situation in Vietnam and what Australia is doing to help improve the situation? Secondly and more specifically, can the Minister inform the Senate of the up-to-date situation regarding two Vietnamese Buddhist leaders, the Most Venerable Thich Nhuen Quang and the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has developed a dialogue on human rights issues with Vietnam and has raised, and continues to raise, individual cases with the Vietnamese authorities. As recently as 10 December, a couple of days ago, Australia raised specific human rights cases with Vietnam's ministry of foreign affairs. However, I have to say that, although our dialogue is more substantial, I think, than that enjoyed by any other country in this respect, we are disappointed at the limited responses to our representations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although a series of reforms and policy changes affecting human rights in Vietnam has occurred in recent years, we do remain concerned about the human rights situation in Vietnam. Judicial procedures often fall short of internationally recognised standards, and regulations providing for detention without trial remain in force. I am also very well aware that Amnesty International continues to report allegations of torture and ill-treatment in detention.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning the two individuals mentioned by Senator McMullan, the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do and the Most Venerable Thich Nhuen Quang, the Australian embassy in Hanoi was advised by the Vietnamese authorities in mid-1989 that both had been released and were freely practising their religion in Nghia Binh and Thai Binh provinces respectively. We certainly have nothing to suggest that that is an inaccurate response. At least in respect of them, the news is good.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that two years ago the Treasurer made a boast that in Australia families now have two or three incomes? Is the Minister also aware that his colleague Minister Dawkins said today that a cause of the current unemployment rate is that `the participation rate is extremely high'? Besides taking action to relieve enormous interest rates burdens on industries, individuals and families, what steps does the Government intend to take to financially recognise the value of homemakers' work and to give a true economic freedom of choice to those who, through economic pressure, have been forced out into the paid work force?</PARA></TALK.START>

I do recall the Treasurer saying, two or three years ago, that many families were enjoying two or three incomes. I was not familiar with Mr Dawkins's remark about the participation rate, but if one looks at today's figures one will see that the participation rate has scarcely declined at all. I think the point about unemployment figures now compared with eight or 10 years ago is that, if we had the same participation rates in the work force eight or 10 years ago as we have now, the unemployment figure would be considerably lower.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is a matter which is hotly debated and, if I might say so, not supported by the evidence. There is no doubt that in many countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development participation rates have grown considerably in the past few years. As Senator Vanstone once said, correcting some people in her Party, that was a proper and sensible thing to happen in the view of the Opposition.

The increase in the participation of women in the work force has taken place irrespective of the economic circumstances which have applied.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Taxation Office taxation statistics 1988-89 is of course an annual presentation to the Parliament. It is a very voluminous document but therefore a very comprehensive one in terms of the taxation statistics for the nation. It gives some very interesting data about the operations of the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The document and the statistics give a very clear indication of just how complex the tax administration and collection procedures of the Government have become. One of the great concerns for pretty well all Australians nowadays is both the bulk and the complexity of the tax legislation that confronts us. One of the clearest indications of that is the fact, so I am told, that about 70 per cent of all Australian taxpayers-although this may change with self-assessment procedures-in order to understand their taxation position, have required tax accountants to prepare their taxation returns. I am not sure whether that figure is accurate, but certainly an increasing number of taxpayers have had difficulty with the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Institute of Chartered Accountants, in a report released just a few days ago, was highly critical of several practices of the Commissioner of Taxation. Some examples are worth mentioning as they relate very closely to the statistics that the Australian Statistician collects. The report of the Institute is a very small one. I recommend that honourable senators read it. On page 5 of that report the Institute comments on the performance of the Australian Tax Office and expresses its concern that a very high level of administrative error, which is extremely expensive to correct, is made by the Tax Office. In the end that cost is usually borne by the taxpayer concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute also draws attention on page six of its report to the fact that the Commissioner refuses to accept that the Tax Office is culpable for the per annum component of incorrect return penalties. The Tax Office seems to see penalty tax as a revenue measure rather than as a compliance instrument. That is a matter for serious concern if the Institute is correct, and I hope that the Commissioner will look at it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute has also commented on the increasing complexity of tax legislation, particularly with respect to the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and the provisional tax provisions. They radically increase the cost of compliance, forcing a greater workload upon tax agents. There is also reference to the delays in legislation and the odious practice of legislation by press release, which is a compliance nightmare in any area as complex as taxation. This clearly demonstrates, particularly in the area of indirect tax, that there is a great deal to be said-from the point of view of tax simplicity alone let alone all the other reasons-for having a goods and services tax of the type now being proposed by the Liberal and National parties. Such a tax will greatly simplify the tax system. It will reduce compliance and administrative costs; it will remove an array of inefficiencies caused by the wholesale sales tax, including the distortions to consumer choice, producer inputs and company structures; it will remove major burdens from our export and import competing industries; and it will enhance the integrity of the tax system by making inroads into the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the Australian Taxation Office taxation statistics for 1988-89 which have been tabled today. In particular, I refer to table 6.5 on page 284 of that report, which dissects the sales that led to the collection of $10,000m in sales tax in that year of record. One of the things that comes out of that table is that, while the sales tax is imposed at rates of 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 50 per cent in the case of luxury goods, at the moment there is no tax on food in Australia. The food area is completely exempt from tax, with some very minor exceptions. When one looks at that table and goes through the great detail of thousands of millions of dollars of sales of items in Australia one can see that, as well as there being no tax levied on food, no tax levied on clothing or footwear is documented in that table. I think it is very important to note that the present sales tax in Australia, which is levied at those four rates, basically exempts most food items and totally exempts clothing and footwear items from tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the same token, tax is levied at a higher rate on luxury goods, such as expensive motor cars, which are taxed at 50 per cent. Tax is levied at a higher rate on things such as diamonds, jewellery and furs-luxury goods which are presently taxed at 30 per cent. Dr Hewson and Mr Reith, the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in the other place, want to replace the tax system that I am now talking about with a goods and services tax. Senator Short has tried to put forward some of the reasons for that particular tax today. The reality is that the areas which I have documented-food, clothing and footwear-will be slugged by the Liberal's proposed tax if they ever get into government. </PARA>
<PARA> The farming sector of Australia-the food producing industries-will be hit by a 15 per cent tax. If the Liberals bring in a tax levied at that rate the price of food, clothing and footwear will then increase by 15 per cent. I am surprised that members of the National Party of Australia who claim to represent the agricultural and rural sectors have not yet woken up to this tax and what it would do to the food producing industries of Australia when previously and currently tax exempt food items have a goods and services consumption tax imposed upon them. The reality is that staple items such as bread, groceries, fruit and vegetables and meat as well as all other food items will face this goods and services tax. If it is levied at 15 per cent, that is the price rise that will occur on those particular items. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to clothing. At the moment items such as general clothing, school uniforms and children's shoes are all tax free in this country. If the Liberals get into office and levy a 15 per cent consumption tax on those items their price will increase by 15 per cent. They will put a tax on the basic necessities, but meanwhile the price of luxury goods will be brought down in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out with regard to table 6.5 of this report, it is only the luxury goods in this community that are taxed at 30 per cent or 50 per cent. One needs only to look at the price of luxury motor vehicles, for example. At present under this Government a motor vehicle retailing for over $97,400 is taxed at a 50 per cent rate of sales tax. Under Dr Hewson and Senator Short that particular tax will probably decrease to about 15 per cent. So there will be a tremendous boost to the purchases of luxury cars under this Opposition if it ever gets into government, and the price of those particular vehicles will fall by about $20,000 at the same time as the price of fruit and vegetables, milk and bread goes up. </PARA>
<PARA> The people opposite want to boost luxuries. They want a Rolls Royce-or a limousine-led recovery in Australia as they replace the present equitable and fair sales tax with an unfair general goods and services tax at a rate of 15 per cent. They will give a tremendous boost to imported luxury goods-most luxury goods are imported into this country. I ask them: how will that improve the current account deficit and the balance of payments? How will a boost to luxury goods boost the balance of payments?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the major problems facing taxpayers nowadays is coping with the new idea of self-assessment, which has been introduced by the Government and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The other big problem facing companies nowadays, and indeed all taxpayers, is the problem of being certain of what the tax law really means and how it applies to their own particular affairs. There is also concern about the application of that law, because nowadays it appears to be a moving feast as some precedents which have been established over many years are suddenly being thrown out the door. The justification given for this by the Administration is that law evolves over time and people's understanding of the meaning of law constantly changes. But that is really not good enough in terms of certainty of taxation law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other big problem facing people is the problem of compliance-especially the cost of compliance which has been growing quite dramatically in recent times. In light of that and the statistics now before this Senate, I draw the Senate's attention to the need to start revising some of this voluminous information that is currently placed before it. This information is prepared not without considerable cost, both to the Taxation Office and also, more importantly, to taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the time has come to re-evaluate the significance of some of the collections that are contained in this report that is before us today. For example, does it really tell people a lot about the collection of income according to districts, parts or areas of cities or towns? Also, while it might be important to know the level of income derived from sheep and cattle grazing, sugar growing or vegetable production, for example, I wonder whether it really is significant to be informed about that income from the various forms in which business is conducted, whether it be as partnerships or corporations, et cetera. Surely what is really needed is the overall figure. Whether a person conducts a sheep and grazing business in corporate, partnership or sole trading form is really not important. We should be interested in the total amount of money derived from sheep or cattle grazing and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I further take this opportunity to ask the Australian Taxation Office to look a little more closely at its own internal operations. I say that in a constructive rather than critical sense because I think it is important that such an examination should reflect the high professional capabilities of Australian Taxation officers and the need to lift the public perception of the Taxation Office. I know that the McKinsey report and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia have addressed this issue, but I think it is time that the ATO devoted more resources to improving its public perception. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is overdue for the Government to ensure that there is proper balance between taxpayers' rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis the Commissioner of Taxation. We all know and acknowledge the rorts that took place during the 1960s and 1970s and the problems of the High Court of Australia in taxation matters. But perhaps we have now gone too far in the other direction and have put at risk the rights of honest taxpayers, rather than the rights of those who, in the past, have been scheming to their own advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the continual erosion of taxpayers' rights. Yesterday or the day before, regulations provided before this Parliament denied taxpayers some further rights. I know that the regulations reflect the 1986 change to legislation, but now if a person is lodging an objection he or she must lodge it with the Taxation Office within the prescribed time not post it within the prescribed time. It is no longer good enough to be able to prove post, by post, certification or substantiation of the objection. </PARA>
<PARA> That is just another example of extra costs, and I believe that we could save money and a lot of time in the preparation of the additional information that must go on the back of the return. I think a lot of money is spent just for the purpose of preparing that document, and some of that material is not relevant. We must collect information, not data. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address the annual report of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), noting that here is clearly an opportunity to redirect government funding for energy research, expressing my concern over the future of the two reactors which will need decommissioning before long, if not immediately, and raising again concerns about the disposal of radioactive waste, which does not rate a mention in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also contains nothing about the controversial export of fuel rods to the disgraced Hanford facility in the United States of America (USA) for reprocessing. These will be transported in casks of controversial manufacturing standard through suburban Sydney to get to the port for shipment. There have been no answers to all the questions outstanding on this issue nor to the questions relating to medium and low level waste. No mention is not good enough in an annual report of this nature. I am also concerned about the new collaborative program with the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute and the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding with the China Institute of Atomic Energy and the China National Nuclear Corporation. Likewise I note that ANSTO represented Australia at the First International Conference for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia which was held in Tokyo in March this year, and that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) is involved in the administration of funding bilateral nuclear assistance programs in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman's report deserves to be strongly criticised following his comment that public attitudes and perceptions relative to nuclear matters remain very negative, and he blames the media for concentrating on the negative aspects of nuclear science and technology. That is hardly surprising. I would turn such comments around by asking how we can justify the continued funding of Lucas Heights while there are legitimate concerns about every aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle and while 46 per cent of Australians remain opposed to the mining and export of uranium and only 35 per cent are in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Gulf crisis forcing us once more to think about the price of oil and the over-consumption in which we indulge, it might make more sense to decommission the two reactors at Lucas Heights and use the money from its nuclear component to develop alternative energy research. The report informs the Government and the public about the money earned from exports arising from ANSTO's work. Equally we could export products developed and manufactured in Australia relating to renewable energy resources. The world desperately needs further development of renewable energy resources as well as a reduction of oil consumption by the advanced industrialised countries. It is a furphy to argue that nuclear power is the alternative as oil is rarely used to generate electricity and never to propel transportation systems such as private cars, locomotives, trams or buses. </PARA>
<PARA> The report does not seem to mention the future cost of maintaining the reactors or what the decommissioning costs will be. These are costs the nuclear industry world wide never wants to admit to. It is clear that Lucas Heights is not a suitable site for such a facility as the southern suburbs of Sydney sprawl even closer and there are frequent allegations of contamination of the water systems around Lucas Heights. Again there is no mention of anything controversial like that in this report. The Chairman might criticise the media for concentrating on the negative aspects of nuclear science and technology, but he makes no attempt to refute allegations of the `wall of secrecy' made by Dr Arthur Tucker, who retired in 1985 after 21 years as the medical officer at Lucas Heights. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this kind of obsessive secrecy which has laid the nuclear industry open to similar criticism around the world. The more that is revealed, the more reason the world has to be alarmed about nuclear power. There has been escalating criticism of Soviet nuclear power programs since glasnost and perestroika allowed for such open debate, while in the United States there is growing evidence of the appalling long term damage caused around nuclear sites such as the Hanford reservation in Washington and the Rocky Flats plutonium facility in Colorado. There is also growing criticism of nuclear power in Asia, despite the repressive nature of many of the regimes there which are prepared to allow neither full and open debate on issues such as nuclear power nor access to information. That is why I expressed concern about ANSTO's links with Korea and China, where there has been criticism of nuclear power programs despite the disapproval of the authorities to that criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not critical of all the work carried out at ANSTO's facility at Lucas Heights. For example, I applaud the acquisition of the cyclotron facility at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. I urge that the next ANSTO report deal with issues such as commissioning dates and costs and the disposal of radioactive waste, and I urge the Government to phase out the dominant nuclear role of ANSTO and replace it with a body committed to developing renewable energy resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation report for 1989-90 and to pick up one of the aspects of ANSTO touched upon by Senator Vallentine a moment ago. I refer to the development of synroc by ANSTO, a proposal developed initially with the Australian National University. Honourable senators will recall the enormous publicity and ballyhoo that surrounded the proposal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Australian public and indeed many people around the world could be forgiven for believing that synroc was an up and running technology, which could be slotted straight into the long term storage of radioactive wastes. Those of us who followed the developments more closely knew very well that synroc had not been tested with fully radioactive material. We find in this annual report, on page 66, that the construction of the synroc demonstration plant commenced in 1982-83:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . on a non-radioactive demonstration plant to demonstrate the SYNROC fabrication process as a medium for the immobilisation and disposal of high-level radioactive waste. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to describe the way in which that plant is simply designed to make synroc, a simulated rock, but a substance that will not contain radioactive material. We read also that synroc in 1989-90 cost $1.5m and the year before it cost $1.9m, but on page 66 we read that the synroc demonstration plant, in 1990 dollars, cost $8.8m. If we go back to the section on advanced materials on page 15, we find that again there is an admission that the plant is simply a simulation plant. It is not as yet designed to make synroc containing any radioactive material at all. Rather alarmingly, one finds:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Synroc Demonstration Plant has processed, cumulatively, 5.2 tonnes of Synroc. It is now operated in short campaigns designed to provide information for the conceptual active plant design study. </PARA>
<PARA>That study is scheduled for completion in June 1991. We go on with the development of a proposal actually to put proper radioactive material into synroc to see how it stands up under those conditions. We read also that the non-radioactive containing synroc is being tested, and the report refers to the `study of the long term durability in hot ground water of Synroc containing radioactive material'. Yet the material which has been made so far in the synroc plant does not contain radioactivity.</PARA>
<PARA> The importance of this is that a scientist who is now retired but who still works in the Department of Physics in the University of Adelaide demonstrated some time ago that materials such as glass and indeed synroc when exposed to high levels of radiation and subsequently to moisture underwent quite rapid deterioration. A significant question mark hangs over the viability of synroc to contain high levels of very radioactive material over long periods of time, and that is what is being expected of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have many millions of dollars being spent on this technology, which is as yet unproved in the long term, but at the same time we have insufficient money being spent on alternative energy technologies. I make a plea again and back up Senator Vallentine's plea that this Government substantially shift its priorities and put money into those things which are viable and can make a very significant contribution to energy in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 7 of the annual report of the Grape and Wine Research Council is a reference to the major revenue raising of the Grape and Wine Research Council. That is derived from what was a 50c per tonne levy on grape growers in this country, a levy which increased to $2 per tonne from 1 January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the impressive aspects of this report is that it does outline in very great detail the various research projects that have been undertaken by the Council and a total expenditure in the last year of some $1,472,000. Details of that are located on page 23. The report outlines in considerable detail some 50 projects that are being undertaken by the Council, and I place on record the good work that this Council does in trying to foster the development of a very important industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have two concerns about the report and the projects being carried out by the Council. Firstly, if we look at the various aims and objectives and the plan of the Council, they do not, in my view, place sufficient emphasis on the need to ensure research projects that encourage the export orientation of grapes and wine in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Some weeks ago I spoke on the annual report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and I highlighted to the Senate the absolutely disgraceful levels of importation of overseas beverages, particularly French champagne and mineral water. Over the last 10 years, imports of these beverages have soared from $9m or $10m to some $50m. I think it appropriate that the Grape and Wine Research Council places greater emphasis on ensuring an export orientation of our wine and, particularly, champagne industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the report of which I am a little critical is that, despite the fact that the Council had at its disposal some $1,400,000 in grape levy funds from growers, it spent a miserable $10,742 in my home State of Tasmania-that is detailed on page 41-on one project out of some 50 projects that were undertaken over the last year. The project was carried out only in part in Tasmania; some part of the project was carried out also in the Eden Valley in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A very small proportion of the total expenditure of the Council is spent in Tasmania. I certainly believe that it would be more appropriate, as I drew to the attention of the Senate in my speech on the annual report of the Wine and Brandy Corporation-given the doubling in the output of wine production in Tasmania over the last year, the need to reorientate our economy towards export industries and the rapid expansion of the production of wines in Tasmania which, I might say, are the finest wines in the world-to spend much more than $10,742 in Tasmania. I will certainly be writing to the Council and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). </PARA>

<PARA> (1) That a joint select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> The practice and application of the following aspects of the Family Law Act 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether Parts II and III of the Act have been found to provide adequately for effective counselling and independent mediation;</PARA>

<PARA> (2) That the committee confine its inquiry and report to the terms of the Family Law Act 1975 and associated relevant policy matters. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That provisions relating to the powers, procedures and composition of the committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a motion, of which notice was given by Senator Brownhill on 29 May of this year, that a joint select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975, be appointed to inquire into and report upon a number of different matters. Senator Brownhill's motion refers to whether parts II and III of the Family Law Act have been found to provide adequately for effective counselling and independent mediation; whether part VII of the Act has been found to provide for fair and equitable resolution of custody and access matters and, in particular, whether the interests of children are being effectively safeguarded; whether part VIII of the Act has been found to be effective in arriving at fair and equitable maintenance and property settlements; whether the enforcement provisions of part XIII of the Act have proven in practice to be effective and how the operation of this part has been affected by the introduction of the Child Support Agency scheme; and whether, in the abovementioned parts of the Act, excessive discretion has been conferred upon the Family Court and, if so, how that discretion may be better defined. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill, having put down that motion, was then required by the Senate to undertake responsibilities outside the country. He is currently representing Australia as a parliamentary adviser to our delegation to the United Nations. I assure the Senate that Senator Brownhill has been in constant contact with us from New York regarding the progress of his motion. If one reads his speeches to the Senate on the adjournment on 21 December of last year and 21 May of this year one will understand Senator Brownhill's very deep and genuine concern about aspects of the Family Law Act and matters of administration and practice concerning family law in this country. It seems that in fact a very large number of those persons within Australia who have been disappointed by aspects of family law or family practice have adopted Senator Brownhill to voice their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the Parliament has made a major contribution to the development of family law in this country through several previous joint parliamentary committees. I think it is not disputed that those committees have provided valuable input in this very difficult and often stressful area of law and administration. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Brownhill said was that there are now on the record so many examples of failure or inadequacy in relation to the current legislation or practice-I am not going to go through all the examples that he has put down in the adjournment debates, because under this arrangement we do not have time-that it is incumbent upon the Parliament to meet its reasonable responsibility, and that is to review again aspects of both the law and practice. The honourable senator gave a guideline in the form of the detail of his motion that I read a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has supported the concept of an inquiry into family law for a long time now. It was a policy which the Opposition had when it went to the last election. In particular, the Opposition said that there should be a public inquiry by virtue of a parliamentary committee to look at three aspects: applications before the Court concerning custody and access-the fact that they can be needlessly protracted and extremely expensive; enforcement of court orders, when a party deliberately flouts an order, when it is found to be frequently both ineffective and an unsustainable financial burden to the parties seeking enforcement; and the fact that property disputes can be delayed for up to three years before being heard. The Opposition says in its policy statement that such delays can impose real hardship on both parties to a dissolved marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Having put down this motion in this chamber and the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, having put down a motion in similar terms in the other chamber and having stated in his address in support of the motion that our preference would be an adoption of the previous methodology in this area-that is, that there be a joint parliamentary committee rather than just a committee of the Senate-the Opposition naturally enough entered into a process of negotiation with the Australian Democrats and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler will be speaking in this debate today and he will no doubt indicate that the Australian Democrats took the alternative approach of putting to the Government a series of specific concerns that the Democrats had to see whether the Government would be prepared to meet those concerns. I think the Democrats were looking at that as an alternative to another parliamentary inquiry. I understand Senator Spindler will indicate that in some areas the Government has been prepared to come to the party but in other areas it has not. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler informs me, and will no doubt inform the Senate, that the Australian Democrats believe, on balance, that a parliamentary inquiry is now warranted. The Democrats want to provide an input into the detailed terms of reference of that inquiry because there is no point in inquiring into the aspects of their concerns that the Government has already been prepared to accept.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition will be seeking at the end of the debate today is an adjournment of the debate on Senator Brownhill's motion. Our position obviously has been on the table: we want a parliamentary committee. The Democrats, as I understand it, are going to indicate that they accept there should be a parliamentary committee. Hopefully, in the next month or so, particularly upon the return of Senator Brownhill, detailed negotiations can take place between the Opposition parties, Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats and, by then, I hope the Government-Senator Tate-to look at the terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> We presume that, once the Government is aware-as it is going to be aware today-that a parliamentary committee is going to be set up, it will also want to look at the alternative structures of such committees. I repeat, for the benefit of the Government, that we think the previous precedent should be adhered to and it should preferably be another joint committee. We presume also that the Government would then want to participate with us in determining the most appropriate terms of reference for that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are specific issues that can be put in a more precise form in terms of reference than currently appear in Senator Brownhill's motion. That would facilitate those within the community and the specialists-lawyers, academics and others who practise within the field-to give very specific advice and to help the Parliament in its law reform process. There is also the difficulty that the terms of reference must not be so specific that those in the community who feel they have had a particularly bad experience through the application of the law or practice are excluded from participating in this process. Part of democracy is to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for the community to participate in the development of the laws that ultimately govern aspects of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is probably no more difficult an area in which so much stress is created within the law as in the area of family law. Unfortunately, family break-ups so often bring with them tremendous emotional stress. When that emotional stress has to be handled through a regulatory mechanism, which of course there has to be under any family law regime, there are times when the law is found to be inadequate or frustrating. It is important that members of the community who feel that they have suffered have the opportunity to express their concerns and frustrations.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that at the end of this half-hour debate the result will be that consideration of Senator Brownhill's motion will be adjourned; that over the next month or so, we can sit down with the Government and the Australian Democrats and determine the terms of reference. I hope this will result in a joint parliamentary committee and that upon returning to the Parliament at the beginning of the next session in the early weeks of February, in both Houses of the Parliament, by agreement of all parties, there is put down a motion setting up a joint committee to investigate these areas of family law. I think that would help us meet our responsibility to the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has generously allowed me five minutes to put a position and support Senator Brownhill's motion. I know that today would be a very happy day for Senator Brownhill because he has taken a great deal of interest in this issue. I believe it was Senator Brownhill who initiated, through the Liberal-National Party coalition, the first resolution to put down a notice of motion. It has now come to my attention that the Australian Democrats are going to support the motion in principle, but they will seek some input into the terms of reference. The main thing is that we are going to get a Senate inquiry into the problems caused by the Family Law Act as it stands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate that this matter has come before the Senate today. It is very important for the National Party. One of the major planks in our policy is that the family is the basic unit of society and all legislation should stem from and be based on that premise. I am pleased for Senator Brownhill, who is overseas on parliamentary duties at the moment. I am very glad that when the honourable senator comes back he will have this inquiry on foot. </PARA>

Although we would like it to do so we know that this inquiry will not address all the problems that are faced as a result of marriage break-ups. However, we do believe it is a step in the direction that will alleviate some of the hurt that, unfortunately, people have to go through when their marriages break up and afterwards. Mr Acting Deputy President, I agreed to take three or four minutes. I will stick to that agreement with Senator Spindler. I thank the Democrats for their support of this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter arose with the notice of motion given by Senator Brownhill, which was described in some detail by Senator Hill and Senator Boswell. The Australian Democrats at the time supported it in principle but deferred the decision because we felt that it was not necessarily in the best interests of those people who were concerned and hurt by the operation of the Family Law Act to enter into a 12-month period of a parliamentary inquiry, at the end of which no action may be taken, although a report may be produced that would once again gather dust on the shelves, or at least it would take some months before we could get any results. We thought it would be advantageous for all parties if we first tried to get the Government to take some action in those areas we had identified in consultation with people and groups who approached us with concerns in the family law area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will list some of the details of the concessions that the Government has agreed to and has made. We believe they have warranted the three months delay, but we do not believe they are substantial enough to prevent a parliamentary inquiry to ensure that the issues are properly canvassed and that action is then expedited. I am pleased that this matter has not been made a political football and that it has been possible to reach agreement with the Opposition parties to develop a set of terms of reference for this inquiry which I think will make it a constructive one and one that can bring some real relief to people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some 14 matters to which we drew the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). Several have yielded some positive responses. One of the important matters that we put to him was mediation centres. We asked for a 20 per cent increase in funding. The Attorney-General was able to demonstrate that in the current year the Government was instituting a program on the basis of a 103.8 per cent increase on top of the grants made in 1989-90 for eight existing family mediation services and for new services in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. We were pleased with that response. We have also got a commitment to continue that level of funding in real terms at least, with some possibility of an absolute increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The second request was for a duty lawyer to attend at family courts. We had specified five registries as ones of priority, namely, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Parramatta, and possibly Dandenong. This is an area where the Attorney-General was not able to give us any firm commitments. Therefore, that remains very much on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter was the funding for a family assistance bureau to be attached to the Family Court. Following extensive discussions, we reached the conclusion that the `Network' system being used in Victoria, attached to the Melbourne Family Court, was a useful model. Our approaches coincided with some doubt about the funding of Network. We were able to obtain an assurance from the Attorney-General only a fortnight ago that the funding for Network will be continued, with funding assured until 1992 and 1993. We are disappointed that he was unable to make a commitment to extend that service to the other States.</PARA>
<PARA> In the matter of Family Court judges, we asked for six. The Attorney-General was prepared to appoint two, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales. It is a start. While we take some cognisance of the arguments put forward by the Attorney-General, namely, that better management of cases and mediation services and alternative dispute resolution will reduce the load on Family Court judges, we believe that, if the system is to work to the satisfaction of people who are going through an extremely traumatic stage in their lives, the Government must agree to provide a further increase in Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> The next item is matrimonial property. The Democrats basically agree with the Australian Law Reform Commission's proposals and suggested that we should move towards implementation of those proposals. We are conscious, however, that there are some problems as yet unresolved, particularly in the area of how to deal with superannuation when a couple divorces, and some problems where a business or farm is involved. These problems are still awaiting resolution. We have assurances that the Government will move in this area as quickly as possible. We understand that a draft paper has been under consideration by the Attorney-General. We expect to receive some response as quickly as possible on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area on which we approached the Attorney-General was marriage education. Our proposal here was that the Government should increase funding for marriage education by at least 20 per cent. The Attorney-General was able to demonstrate that he has met a commitment to increases of 93 per cent in 1990-91 to peak bodies and 54 per cent to existing marriage education services. We are pleased with that because it is an extremely important area. Clearly, prevention is much better than cure, as anyone who has gone through the family law system could testify. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also been given firm assurances that funding for the Family Law Council and the Institute of Family Studies will be maintained in real terms. That is the extent of the firm commitments which the Government was able to give to us. We believe there are quite a number of other areas which, though difficult, require resolution. It is for that reason-since we were not able to get firm assurances in the other areas-that we believe a parliamentary inquiry is now required and justified to give some impetus to the necessary reforms in the family law area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important areas is that of child sexual abuse. While the Senate will be dealing with a Bill which will enact some amendments in that area, it is far from being a complete solution. We have obtained an assurance from the Attorney-General that there will be a review by the Family Law Council after 12 months operation of those amendments, provided they are passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other issues that are difficult but require a determined effort to resolve. They include the independent representation of children; the supervised access situation where it has proved difficult for parents to agree to have access to children in a civilised manner; and the videotaping of counselling interviews. With the latter matter, we were met with the concern that costs would escalate, that the extent of videotaping could be doubtful and that, in some cases, the legal process may be prejudiced by the videotaping of counselling interviews and, therefore, the evidentiary process could suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not necessarily accept all these arguments, nor do we accept the wait and see answer that we received to one other request, which was to drop the cost of transcripts of court proceedings from $7.50 a page to $2 a page, which we believe the Family Court should charge. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Family Court has a particular constituency which is quite different from that of any other court, and we believe there is a case to make a distinction between that and other courts. That is the extent at the moment of the issues that were discussed with the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I once again put on record my satisfaction at the fact that we are able to tackle these issues in a constructive manner and that we are not making them into a political football. If we did, we would do great harm and disservice to the people who are going through a traumatic period in their lives. I understand that Senator Harradine would like to say a few words, and I am pleased to give up my remaining time so that he may do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion by Senator Hill, moved on behalf of Senator Brownhill, for the establishment of a select committee to be known as the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975. My view is that if the Committee gets off the ground it will certainly have very important tasks to perform. There is probably no other piece of Commonwealth legislation which has produced such continuing animosity from ordinary people who have come under its operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is: if we are to have a parliamentary inquiry into the Family Law Act, do the proposed terms of reference permit a consideration of those subject areas of concern to many people? Since the Family Law Act came into operation there have been over 600,000 divorces and something like three quarters of a million children have been directly affected. The Committee should operate against that background. The parameters of the proposed inquiry are drawn and relate to certain matters. I should like to pose a couple of questions. For example, will paragraph (1) (a) permit a thorough examination of the reconciliation and counselling, bearing in mind that the consideration of reconciliation is one of the basic principles under section 43 of the Act, to which the court is supposed to have regard?</PARA>
<PARA> Will the implementation of all of the principles contained in section 43 be a matter for consideration by the committee for the purposes of ensuring their implementation? One should have thought so because paragraph (2) of the terms of reference refers to `associated relevant policy' and states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Committee confine its inquiry and report to the terms of the Family Law Act 1975 and associated relevant policy matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, section 43 of the Act deals with relevant policy matters, and that deals, inter alia, with the point that was raised by Senator Boswell. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their welfare; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that is an essential feature of any inquiry and to see whether those principles are being given proper effect to in other areas of the legislation. I am advised by practitioners in the family law area that the equitable and just treatment of spouses, the counselling and mediation procedures and the difficulty about property settlements are all areas warranting investigation. To the extent that the motion covers these areas and the others that I have mentioned, it will certainly be helpful. </PARA>
<PARA> I, together with, I suppose, every one of us in this chamber, and probably everyone in the House of Representatives-probably more particularly in the House of Representatives-have received constant representations from constituents concerning the operation of the family law legislation. As I said, it is a piece of legislation which has produced continuing animosity from ordinary people, more so than any other that I can think of. I hope that this committee will get off the ground and serves good purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish very briefly to speak to that motion. In the judgment which has been tabled, one of the learned judges, Mr Justice Northrop, had this to say about the failure of the Government to apply proper procedures to this election:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no material before the Court explaining why the Regional Council election rules were not laid before the Senate in conformity with the requirements of s.48 of the Acts Interpretation Act. Nevertheless, this failure illustrates an arrogance by the Executive-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by this Government-</PARA>
<PARA>which borders on contempt for the Parliament. The failure is very serious. It is to be condemned. It cannot be condoned. It is a fact which has occurred but it is not for this Court to investigate why it occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no more serious comments by a learned judge about the impropriety-the misbehaviour-of a government than those remarks. `It cannot be condoned', he said. `The failure is very serious. It is to be condemned'. When His Honour said, `it is not for this Court to investigate why it occurred', he was clearly indicating to the Senate, to the Parliament, that the Parliament should very seriously examine this disgraceful behaviour by the Government; this behaviour which, as the judge said, cannot be condoned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is reasonable in these circumstances, when we have evidence of treating the Parliament with contempt, to ask: what is the Government doing about it and what is the Government doing about the Minister who was in charge? When the judge says that it was displaying, `an arrogance by the Executive which borders on contempt for the Parliament', it is reasonable for us to ask: is it this Government's policy to continue the commission of a Minister whose `arrogance borders on contempt for the Parliament'? If it is not the Government's policy, what steps does the Government intend to take to replace Mr Tickner as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs?</PARA>
<PARA> The failure is very serious and is to be condemned, as the judge says. We want to know what steps are being taken to guarantee that the Senate will not in future be denied the opportunity legitimately to scrutinise such legislation. Quite frankly, we want to know what steps are being taken in relation to Mr Tickner's demonstrated avoidance of ministerial responsibility in this matter. We are also entitled to ask if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will ensure that in future all his Ministers comply with their legal obligations and suggest to them that it might not be a good idea to seek to blame departmental officials, as Mr Tickner has done in this instance. There is a thing called ministerial responsibility, and a failure to meet it in the past had very serious consequences for the Minister. Apparently those standards do not apply any more. </PARA>
<PARA> This Senate cannot simply ignore these very serious, critical remarks by a judge. I do not want to pursue this matter now because we are acting under a very short time pressure under a guillotine. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Like Senator Baume I, too, am under a very tight time constraint and so I want to take just a couple of minutes to say a few words about the Auditor-General's report No. 18 of 1990-91, Specific Purpose Payments to and through the States and Northern Territory. At this stage I draw the Senate's attention to some of the key findings of that important audit report. The report has come up with four key findings. The most important read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>* while the arrangements for all SPPs required adequate assurance to be provided to the Commonwealth that its funds were being expended on intended purposes, delay in the provision of statements of expenditure and independent certification indicates a failing in accountability by Commonwealth departments to Parliament. For those SPPs where this assurance was required, 49% of the statements of expenditure and 70% of the independent certificates for 1988-89 payments had not been received at the time of the survey-</PARA>
<PARA>of which this is a report-</PARA>
<PARA>* in July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very considerable time delay. Another key finding reads:</PARA>
<PARA>* 12 per cent of programs did not have clear objectives established, and</PARA>
<PARA>* there was a reported absence of performance indicators for 56% of SPP programs and this brings into question the value of the performance review which is reported as undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about small funds here; we are talking about 48 per cent of the total payments that the Commonwealth makes to the States each year. That 48 per cent translates, in dollar terms, into $12.6 billion of specific purpose payments. So we are talking about a major item of government expenditure. I am sure that many honourable senators and others would be surprised at the findings that there is in so many instances a lack of proper accountability for those funds and significant delays in the reporting on their usage. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises various questions. First of all: how could this have occurred? There are important recommendations by the Australian Audit Office, which I think the Parliament would do very well to examine carefully, as to how a repetition of this may be prevented. It raises a couple of important issues of a conceptual nature which the coalition has been raising for some time. This will be subject to further consideration in the series of Special Premiers Conferences that are in train at the moment, in support of which the coalition has been joining the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the critical points that come out of this is that if, in fact, 12 per cent of the specific purpose programs did not have any clear objectives, and if there was a reported absence of performance indicators for 56 per cent of the specific purpose programs, then why have specific purpose payments at all? Why not incorporate or encompass specific purpose payments-section 96 of the Constitution payments is what we are talking about-into the general purpose payments that the States receive from the Commonwealth without strings attached?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the great problems that the States face today is the fact that an increasing amount of funding that they receive from the Commonwealth Government is in tied form through these specific purpose payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a great deal of politics in this-Senator Michael Baume says that there is political grandstanding-but there is also the ever increasing central control by Canberra on the purse strings of the States. That has a great deal of political and economic importance as well, because it hamstrings the operations of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another thing that emerges from this report is that the specific purpose payments seem to involve a great deal of administration in their carriage. This is another important reason why we should be looking at the whole question of specific purpose payments relative to general purpose payments and the whole question of duplication and overlap that arises. It is a far too detailed and important subject to go into any further today. I draw the Senate's attention to what I believe is a very important report by the Auditor-General. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>On 2 November 1990 I received in audience followed by working lunch H.E. Costello of Australia. According to H.E. Costello the increasing tendency in Australia and the Western world is towards the de jure recognition of Hun Sen regime and even to a new armed Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia to liquidate the Khmers Rouges. I replied that the west was free to do whatever it wanted to do but patriotic nationalist Khmers no matter now anti Khmers Rouges they may be shall not hesitate to fight against great Vietnamese Army side by side with the Khmers Rouges because Vietnamese colonialism represented by Phnom Penh regime is absolutely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the following brief comment: the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) still needs to address himself to the question that I put to him today and that Senator Hill and others have been putting over the recent weeks and months. The Minister has a singular hold for his unique proposal for a solution in Cambodia. Whilst 12 months ago all sides of the Parliament wished that rather ideal solution very well-and many of us still wish it well-we are seeking to encourage the Minister and this Government to consider second and third options in order to be realistic and see a solution to the problems of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because the Minister, so trenchantly, arrogantly and with unjustified criticism of the bona fides of members of the Opposition, has decried any alternative that we ask questions that he needs to answer. This is material that the Minister needs to address himself to-as to whether or not his representative, his chief negotiator, is putting views to one of the Khmer faction leaders, and indeed to others, that are in fact not consistent with the statement he put down in this Parliament last Thursday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly because we are conscious that if some time can be saved on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill, bearing in mind that it had 3 1/2 hours before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last night, that time can be appropriated to another Bill that did not have that extra consideration. The Committee report of course was put down in the chamber this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My first point is that to some extent that procedure served a worthwhile purpose; that is, it enabled some practitioners, some specialists, particularly representatives such as Professor Austin, who appeared for the Law Council of Australia, as well as representatives from the Law Institute of Victoria and from business and commerce, in particular the Business Council of Australia, to put their current concerns on the parliamentary record. It gave the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) the opportunity to answer some of those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> This was particularly important in relation to this Bill because of the ridiculous timetable that the Government has allowed for the passage of its corporation package. I remind you, Mr Chairman, that this highly complex piece of legislation, based on a novel experiment in constitutional law-a new way of attempting to interpret federalism to produce what is perceived to be a national corporation law package-clearly requires very detailed and careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> These people were able to put their concern on the record. The Minister was given an opportunity to provide answers; some he provided last night through his officers who were present and some he will provide today. I think that Senator McMullan will cover the concerns expressed by the Law Council and the Victorian Law Institute as well as another range of legal issues raised by Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd, whose concerns came in only last night. </PARA>
<PARA> The time frame really was ridiculous. This package is to come into force, to be law, on 1 January next year. Here we are, half-way through December, and the legislation is only now before the Parliament. After it has passed this process it will of course receive the royal assent. The Government then moves into its regulation phase. Regulations will be critical to implement this package. Those regulations have not yet been made; we certainly have not been afforded the opportunity to see them. They have to be made, then printed and distributed, and all this has to happen within the week before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the point during the second reading debate that this is quite inappropriate law making. In those circumstances it is impossible to expect legal practitioners to be properly aware of their obligations under the legislation and in a position to properly advise their clients. Even more so, it is totally impossible to expect consumers of corporate law, businesses in particular, to be properly aware of their new legal obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent, some aspects have been overcome by a moratorium that Mr Hartnell from the Australian Securities Commission was prepared to give in relation to aspects of the new corporate number system and the endorsement last night by the Minister of Mr Hartnell's moratorium. It is fair to say that there are still many aspects of that which are unclear. Mr Hartnell has undertaken to have published further explanations. A number of issues raised last night will be included in those explanations. Hopefully, they will be of some assistance to the business consumers. Nevertheless, it is clearly unsatisfactory, even in that aspect, that companies have to try to get on top of the extent of the moratorium that has been given during the week preceding Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> The more difficult questions-the questions of law-raised by the legal bodies I mentioned have now been answered by the Government, but of course not answered in a way that they can be properly debated. That was not possible within the committee system, given the very short time frame for the hearing, given also that some of the legal concerns came before us only an hour or so before the committee hearing, and given that the responses to some of those were received from the Government only in the last hour or so. </PARA>
<PARA> While the committee process was useful, it could have done a better job if the Government had afforded a more appropriate time frame for the passage of this legislation. As I indicated during the second reading debate, the result will be many legal failings in the package. History demonstrates that that will be the case. The history of the Government's attempts at corporate reform over the last few years, even to the extent of the corporation law being defeated in the High Court on constitutional advice that the Government had before it had it passed this chamber, is a further demonstration of law making in this area that has not received the attention or the care that it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA> These issues of differing legal interpretation are now on the table; they are on the public record. The best I can say is that the professional bodies and the Government will continue arguing and presumably will come back in the new year with another amendment Bill. I suspect that it will be larger rather than smaller, containing amendments which the Government now says are necessary-amendments which may not have been necessary if the Government had put more time and care into this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the question of law there is also the question of the difficulty that comes about from the fact that, although it is designed to be a national scheme, one of the States-Western Australia-is not presently a party to it. The very major obstacles that that will present were put very clearly to the Committee last night, particularly by the Law Institute of Victoria. Most of those concerns remain unanswered and there is no doubt that in the ensuing months it will be very difficult for businesses that cover Western Australia and other States. </PARA>
<PARA> I also said in the second reading debate that I wished that the Commonwealth had approached Western Australia earlier in a more conciliatory way. I wished that even in the latter stages it had accepted our advice and asked the shadow spokesman, Mr Costello, to confer with the Opposition parties in Western Australia. But the Government was not prepared to do so, and we find that we are in the current impasse, the Western Australian Parliament having risen for the Christmas break and the legislation not having been passed there. I hope that an accommodation can be found with Western Australia in the near future because we have recognised as the goal of this legislation a national type scheme with aspects of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have argued in previous speeches we have given on earlier Bills-not in detail; the details varied over the years-that the Commonwealth should look to resolving a difficult federalism issue through goodwill and cooperation. That is what we put to the Government a long time ago. As I said, it has taken the Government years to get to the stage where it has now got the State governments to come to the party within a new cooperative venture which largely provides for a national type scheme. It is just a pity that it did not go one step further and look to embrace the party that controls the Western Australian Parliament through the upper House. But our experience is that this Government is a slow learner when it comes to cooperative federalism, and so we now have to go, unnecessarily, along another path of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report of the Committee. I commend members of the Committee who participated, under difficult circumstances, in the debate last night. It has enabled a modestly more thorough examination of the legislation by the Senate. We have certainly done better than the House of Representatives, which was given only one hour in which to debate this total package. Through the mechanisms that are available to us in this chamber, we have been able to extend that time by some hours. I therefore reiterate in the committee stage the Opposition's support in principle for the design of the package that has been proposed. I indicate the Opposition's support, albeit that we worry about the detail and the fact that it has not been given adequate care and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that our concerns are not demonstrated to be as well founded as I suspect they are. Practitioners in this field have had to work in areas of great uncertainty for too long. It is time that there was some certainty in the area of corporate law in this country. That can only help facilitate Australian business. It can help facilitate our becoming nationally and internationally competitive again in business, and that will be in the best interests of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief statement at this stage on behalf of the Government. I will then seek leave to incorporate two documents, which I understand have been distributed and to which Senator Hill has referred. I think it would be useful to do that at this early stage. The statement is a brief one, but I wish to clarify one matter in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so as to avoid any confusion in the minds of honourable senators. At the end of paragraph 13 of the report it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Minister referred to the 6 month `period of grace' that would operate immediately following the commencement of the new legislation and said Mr Hartnell, as chairman of the ASC, would exercise his discretion accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make it clear that, as honourable senators who were on the Committee will recall, the six-month period of grace refers to the moratorium on the Australian company number. The period of grace refers to the announcement by the Australian Securities Commission, with the support of the Government, that it would not enforce for six months from 1 January the requirements of section 219 (3) of the corporations law for companies to place the Australian company number on their public documents and eligible negotiable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> The discretion that is referred to in that paragraph concerns the powers of the Australian Securities Commission under section 1084 of the corporations law to provide exemptions from the prospectus and other fund raising provisions in appropriate cases. Having put that statement on the record, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two documents, the first entitled `Response to Part B of submission of Victorian Law Institute to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs' and the second entitled `Response to the submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by Perpetual Trustees W.A. Ltd'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE TO PART B OF SUBMISSION OF VICTORIAN LAW INSTITUTE TO SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL AFFAIRS CONCERNING THE CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>The meaning of commercial documents may be altered by updating of references from the existing Law to the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA>* The purpose of s. 80 of the Corporations Act is, amongst other things, to facilitate commercial convenience by avoiding the need for parties to alter instruments and documents to take account of the replacement of the existing co-operative scheme law as the substantive law, governing companies and related matters, by the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA>* The provision also updates relevant references to the Corporations Law in other legislation and regulations, thus avoiding the need for substantial consequential legislative amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>* The effect of the provision may be modified in appropriate cases by regulation, for example to remove any unintended effects. </PARA>
<PARA>A 20% shareholder is deemed to have a relevant interest in all shares held by directors. </PARA>
<PARA>* This was a policy change included in the original drafting of clause 33 of the Corporations Bill as introduced in May 1988, and was identified as such in the Explanatory Memorandum (paras. 272-273). It is therefore not a random defect. It is designed to reflect the fact that a shareholder who holds over 20% of the voting shares in a company not only has a considerable influence over that company but is also in a position to exercise control over the directors of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>A company may be able to disavow a sealed contract by failing to include its company number in the seal. </PARA>
<PARA>* A failure to comply with the formal requirements of s.219 (1) to include the Australian company Number on the company's seal would not appear to render invalid any company document executed under such a defective seal. </PARA>
<PARA>* In Westpac Banking Corporation v Dawson (1990) 2 ACSR 316 the NSW Court of Appeal decided that the failure of a company to use the seal required by the provisions of the existing law which corresponds to s. 219 did not make invalid the execution of the document under seal by the company. The Court considered that such a non-compliance would go to penalty but not to validity.</PARA>
<PARA>* This decision is consistent with the traditional approach of the Courts to avoid, in the absence of a manifest legislative intention, rendering invalid commercial documents for regulatory infractions. In a similar case it has been held that the failure to correctly set out the name of the company on a contract as required by the company law provision corresponding to s. 219 did not render the contract void or illegal: Moreland Metal Company Ltd v Cowlishaw (1919) 19 SR (NSW) 231. </PARA>
<PARA>No reference to indebtedness is s.324 (3). </PARA>
<PARA>* Paragraphs 324 (1) (e) and 324 (2) (f) refer to a person or a body corporate in which the person is a substantial shareholder who `owes' more than $5000 to a particular company or body corporate. While these paragraphs do not specifically use the term ``indebtedness'', the references in those provisions to `owes' are clearly the references to indebtedness to which subsection 324 (3) relates. The word `owes' was used in sub-sections (1) and (2) in the interests of plainer and more effective drafting. Section lO9k of the Law indicates that changes to the style in which a provision of the Law is expressed are not intended, merely for that reason, to indicate any change of meaning. </PARA>
<PARA>A co-operative company cannot ascertain whether its shares are being acquired by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA>* Part 6.8 of the Corporations Law deals with the power of a company and the ASC to obtain information from a registered shareholder as to the beneficial ownership of the shares held by that shareholder. The equivalent co-operative scheme law provision is s.261 of the Companies Codes. </PARA>
<PARA>* As explained in paras. 2216-2217 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporations Bill 1988, the existing provisions have been open to abuse by members and companies seeking to obtain strategically important information. In particular, the provisions had been used by shareholders or Boards of Directors in some companies whenever a minor change in the share register appeared. A package of reforms was included in the Corporations Bill to alleviate these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>* The Companies Code provisions are available to any company as defined in s. 5 (1) of the Companies Code, ie any company incorporated or deemed to have been incorporated under the Companies Code. This includes several primary producer cooperative companies that were incorporated under the Uniform Companies Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>* The Corporations Law provisions, as a response to the abuses noted above, enable the ASC to seek this information and, as a result of a recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on the Corporations Legislation, the right of the company to seek the information was reinstated. However, because of the abuses of the existing provisions, especially in relation to unlisted companies, the provisions now only apply to listed companies or other companies declared by the Minister for the purposes of that Part. </PARA>
<PARA>* Any unlisted primary producer co-operative company registered under the Corporations Law may, therefore, gain access to these provisions by seeking a declaration from the Minister. However, automatic access in the legislation was restricted to listed companies as a result of the abuses of the current provisions noted above. </PARA>
<PARA>Substantial shareholders may not need to lodge a notice under the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA>* A person who is a substantial shareholder for the purposes of s. 261 of the Companies Codes is not required to lodge a new substantial shareholding notice, notifying the company of his or her substantial shareholding, upon commencement of the Corporations Law, provided a notice was lodged with the company under the co-operative scheme law (s. 758 of the Corporations Law). This is because notices lodged under the co-operative scheme law are kept in a register by the company, which can be accessed by the public. There is a corresponding requirement under the Corporations Law for the company to establish and keep a register of substantial shareholding notices, and by virtue of ss. 152 (2) of the Corporations law a company that kept a register for the purposes of co-operative scheme law is deemed to have complied with the requirement under the Corporations Law to establish a new register. </PARA>
<PARA>* There is, therefore, no need to put substantial shareholders to the expense of having to lodge a new notice upon commencement of the Corporations law. </PARA>
<PARA>* However, an existing substantial shareholder will be required to lodge a notice if that person ceases to be a substantial shareholder or if the person's entitlement to voting shares increases or decreases by more than 1% since lodging a notice (sections 710 and 711 of the Corporations Law). These requirements apply to all substantial shareholders whenever they become one. </PARA>
<PARA>Private business trading trusts will require a prospectus and a trust deed that are appropriate to a unit trust. </PARA>
<PARA>* Interests in private trusts and other private business arrangements were to have been exempted from the fundraising provisions by virtue of an exemption for offers to up to 20 persons over a period of 12 months in s.66 of the Law. This exemption was made inapplicable to prescribed interests on a recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on the Corporations Legislation which was adopted by Parliament when the Corporations Act 1989 was enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>* In accepting this and other recommendations, the Government indicated that it would be considering the making of regulations to provide exemptions from the fundraising provisions where the interests of investors are adequately protected. Private business trading trusts are such an instance. </PARA>
<PARA>* The Government is presently considering regulations to address this difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>* Interests in private trusts could be declared to be exempt rights and interests by a regulation pursuant to the definition of `prescribed interest' in s.9 of the Corporations Law. Accordingly, interests in such trusts would not be prescribed interests and thus none of the provisions of Pt. 7.12 of the Law concerning prospectuses and approved deeds would have any application to such trusts. </PARA>
<PARA>Translation from `Act' to `Law' have not been effected. </PARA>
<PARA>* We cannot comment on this matter as the Institute does not indicate any cases where it claims the translations have not been effected. </PARA>

<PARA>CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE TO THE SUBMISSION TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS BY PERPETUAL TRUSTEES W.A. LTD</PARA>
<PARA>Note: In the letter dated 12 December 1990 from Perpetual Trustees W.A. Ltd to Senator Ian Campbell, most of the references to `the Corporations Law' should be references to `the Corporations Act', ie. the Corporations Act 1989 as proposed to be amended by the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1990. In reproducing below the headings used in that letter, the necessary corrections have been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new Parts 1-13 in Chapter 1</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment on numbering is misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> - It overlooks the headings and sections 1 and 2 of the Corporations Law that are inserted on pages 33-34 of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 (`the Bill'). </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 6 (2) in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * This comment appears to overlook subsections 6 (3), (4) and (5). </PARA>
<PARA> - Those sub-sections prevent the regulations (including the regulations as applied by the laws of another jurisdiction) from affecting the rights of any person (other than the Commonwealth, a State, the Capital Territory or an authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or the Capital Territory), being rights existing at the day of notification of the regulations, from being affected in a manner prejudicial to that person. The subsections also prevent the regulations from imposing liabilities on such a person in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the day of notification. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 13 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * This comment is misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> - Subsections 13 (2) and (3) are merely definitional provisions for the purposes stated in subsection 13 (1)-ie. for the purposes of a Commonwealth Act, a law of the ACT, or an instrument made under such an Act or law. For example, if some Commonwealth Act refers to `the Corporations Law of Victoria', subsection 13 (2) provides the meaning of that expression. Any questions about constitutional validity would relate to that other Act, not to subsection 13 (2) or (3). </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of section 14 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * This comment is misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> - It appears to be based on a misreading of section 14 and to show a failure to understand the basic legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> - Sub-section 14 (1) is not a provision `deeming there to be a ``single national Corporations Law''. It states the object of section 14-ie. to help ensure that the ACT Corporations Law operates as if, together with the Corporations Laws of the other jurisdictions, it constituted a single national Corporations Law. Section 14 is one of a number of Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory provisions designed to achieve that object. In my opinion, it is clear that none of those provisions exceeds the relevant constitutional powers. </PARA>
<PARA> * As to the comment on sub-section 14 (2), it is true that the definition of `instrument' does not expressly include an instrument made under a law of a State or Territory other than the ACT. However, such an instrument would be included under paragraph (h) of the definition. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new sections 18 and 20 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment expressing doubt as to the Commonwealth's constitutional power in this respect is unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> - As to the Crown in right of the Capital Territory and Norfolk Island, section 122 of the Constitution clearly provides a constitutional basis. </PARA>
<PARA> - As to the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, sections 18 and 20 will be within the various powers supporting the activities of the Commonwealth to which the various Corporations Laws will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> * An alternative approach to sections 18 and 20 is to regard them as waivers of relevant Commonwealth constitutional immunities from State law, and as removing any relevant statutory impediments, so as to allow the Corporations Laws of the States and Northern Territory to operate of their own force in relation to the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, the ACT and Norfolk Island. That approach does not raise any constitutional problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 30 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * If the comment is intended to suggest that the delegation of legislative authority is so broad as to be invalid, then it is clearly misconceived. Similar provisions already exist in the Securities Industry Codes and the Futures Industry Codes (subsections 150 (2) and 165 (4) respectively). </PARA>
<PARA> * The regulations would, of course, be subject to scrutiny and disallowance by each House of the Parliament (s.48 of the Acts Interpretation Act). </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 37 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * See the remarks above concerning section 14. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 42 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment that the deeming provisions are `fraught with difficulty' is unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> * The comment does not specify any suggested difficulties. It is clear, for example, that subsection 42 (1) enables the arrest provisions in s.8a of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) to be used in the ACT in respect of a person who has allegedly committed an offence against the Corporations Law of a State. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 45 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * The suggestion in the comment is unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> - Paragraph 45 (1) (b) should not give rise to any difficulties. It would apply, for example, where an ACT law provides that a person is disqualified from holding some ACT office if the person has committed an offence against the law of a State. Because of paragraph 45 (1) (b), a breach of the Corporations Law of a State would not result in disqualification under the ACT provision. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 52 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> - Subsections 52 (1), (2) and (3) would be read down within the limits of Commonwealth constitutional power (see section 15a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901). The provisions would validly apply in relation to appeals in matters within federal jurisdiction (see sections 75-77 of the Constitution) or within ordinary or cross-vested Territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6-Insertion of new section 64 in the Corporations Act</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is unfounded-see the remarks above concerning section 52. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 11-Insertion of new section 1d in the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is misconceived-see the remarks above concerning section 14 in the Corporations Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Schedule 1-Amendments to Chapter 1 of the Corporations Law</PARA>
<PARA>Heading to Chapter 1</PARA>
<PARA> * This comment overlooks the heading inserted on page 33 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>New section 58</PARA>
<PARA> * The word `to' where it last appears in the second line of subsection 58 (2) is correct: the substitution of `in', as suggested in the comment, would not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA> * The comment that there appear to be a number of typographical errors does not specify what they are, and merely speculates that they may have substantive effect. If any do appear, they can be corrected in due course. </PARA>
<PARA>New subsection 66a (4)</PARA>
<PARA> * The reason is that friendly societies are not expressly exempted from the definition of `corporation' in section 5 of the WA Companies Code. As to any exemptions under other WA laws, see section 6 of the model State Corporations Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>New subsection 69a</PARA>
<PARA> * The reason for omitting the bodies in question is that they are not expressed to be exempt under section 552 of the WA Companies Code. As to any exemptions under other WA laws, see section 6 of the model State Corporations Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>New section 76</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> - Section 76 serves obvious definitional purposes concerning expressions referring to corporations incorporated `in' a jurisdiction or in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>New section 100a</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is not understood. Section 100a must necessarily be effective to prevent the operation of any provision of a specified kind if that provision would have operated in the absence of s.100a. </PARA>
<PARA>New subsection 105 (3)</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is obscure. </PARA>
<PARA> - I see no difficulty in applying subsection 105 (3), including cases where subsection 58b (2) applies (cf. subsection 36 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901). </PARA>
<PARA>New section 109j</PARA>
<PARA> * The comment is misconceived if it is intended to suggest that extrinsic material derived from State sources could not be used in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA> - That suggestion would overlook the fact that subsection 109j (1) refers to `any material not forming part of this Law' and that subsection 109j (3) provides that the material that may be considered under subsection (2) is not limited to the materials (Commonwealth and international) of the kinds listed in subparagraphs (a) to (h). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I wish to place it on the record immediately that the Australian Democrats support the passage of this Bill. The Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as stated previously, on Tuesday, 11 December, and the Committee meeting took place last night. It was a public hearing held in Parliament House, Canberra. Evidence was given by Mr Hartnell, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC); Professor Austin, Chairman, Companies Committee, Law Council of Australia; Ms Schiftan, QC, Mr Gardini and Mr O'Bryan from the Business Council of Australia; and Mr Greenwood from the Law Institute of Victoria. In addition, the Committee received written submissions from a number of organisations: the Victorian Employers Federation, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Bankers Association, Diskrom Australia, Computer Services of Australia and Coles Myer Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main issues discussed at the Committee hearing included the Australian company number, inadvertent breaches of the law-especially in the early days of its operations, the commencement date, a national business names register, difficulties in implementing a national regulatory scheme which did not include Western Australia, parliamentary accountability, the relationship of the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory with regard to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, and the operation of the company law in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> While it was agreed that some difficulties might indeed arise in the early days of the new legislative regime, all present at the hearing were generally in favour of the proposed commencement date of 1 January. Certainly, the Australian Democrats believe that it is imperative that this be so. In particular, we would join those who rejected at the Committee hearing the submission by the Law Institute of Victoria that the legislation should be deferred until mirror legislation has been passed by all States. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind the situation in Western Australia, clearly that would have deferred the implementation of this important piece of legislation almost indefinitely. It is understood the companies operating in Western Australia will suffer from these arrangements, as will the Western Australian business community as a whole. It is to be hoped that the Opposition in the Legislative Council, the upper House, in Western Australia can be moved to change its stance on this issue. I trust that the bodies concerned, which stated at the Committee meeting that at least privately they have been pressing the Opposition parties in Western Australia to do so, will be given a commonsense hearing by those parties. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Committee hearing certain technical matters were discussed, as were the difficulties that were expected with the Australian company number and the prospectuses. In the latter case, the discussion focused on the liability of a person that is named in a prospectus straddling the two periods of corporate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hartnell said that the obligations of people named in a prospectus would be much more onerous after the introduction of this legislation and agreed that the new corporate regime would indeed set a much higher standard of disclosure. In answer to concerns expressed on that point, the responsible Minister stressed that the six-month period of grace that would operate immediately following the commencement of the new legislation would give Mr Hartnell as Chairman of the ASC the opportunity to use his discretion positively. Mr Hartnell said that he would look over the administrative arrangements which had been put in place and attempt to clarify any point about which there was confusion. In view of these concerns I am pleased that the Minister and Mr Hartnell accepted the principle that close monitoring of the legislation is necessary. This is a task that the new standing committee to be established under this legislation will undertake on behalf of the Parliament and it will report to Parliament at regular intervals. It is clear that such a complex and far-reaching piece of legislation will require some finetuning as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context it is important to note that the two amendments moved by Senator Kemp, which would have reduced the discretion of the ASC, were lost. The Opposition is to be commended for not persisting with these amendments because the effective implementation of the Bill depends on some flexibility in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe this is a significant development in company law in Australia. It introduces a period for the Australian business community when the country is treated as one nation rather than a conglomeration of States with differing regulations and resultant higher costs for the business community. The Australian Democrats support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I get swept up in the moment as I hear contributions made by Australian Democrats and by other honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will pick up a point made by Senator Hill in his contribution to the debate. He talked about a national scheme. That is the proper description-it is a national scheme; it is not a Federal scheme. In the past we had a Federal scheme. Senator Tate always took exception to that. He was always terribly offended when he read in the newspapers that the Council of Ministers was proposing a piece of legislation to amend the Act and that it was a fait accompli. I have said before that I well remember him, as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, standing up very indignantly one day and moving a reference to that Committee because he was not satisfied that the State Attorneys-General and the Federal Attorney-General could meet to resolve the proposing of an amendment which in many ways was imposed on the Federal Parliament and about which we could do little other than agree because of the cooperative system. The truth of the matter is that it had an intrinsic virtue. That was not enough; we had to have a centralised national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I will touch on some of the logical arguments put in favour of that, but I suspect it is because the Australian Labor Party believes, and has an obsession, that all wisdom, knowledge and divine inspiration comes from Canberra. It believes that the poor, mendicant States do not have the intellectual capacity, rigour or responsibility to deal with matters such as corporate powers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill-it has something like 300 pages; I do not know how many clauses-has been foisted upon us. In the normal course of events it will come into effect on 1 January 1991. Western Australia led the way on the cooperative Federal scheme, which has worked thus far. A former Liberal Government Attorney-General, Ian Medcalf, was instrumental in stitching together a cooperative scheme which, in my view, was a model for other legislation and for other powers where there was a need for a contribution to be made by each State and Territory and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that this body was not sufficiently funded. We have seen from recent revelations-and I suspect from future prosecutions-that there was not sufficient diligence or dedication in terms of pursuing breaches of company law. Those breaches are no more, and no less, serious than breaches of common law or criminal law. To that extent, and because of the events of recent years, I am sure that we will see greater endeavours in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty for Western Australia and for the Western Australian Parliament is that they believe in a cooperative Federal scheme. However, the reality is that a cooperative Federal scheme can exist only if all the States are players. Western Australia now finds itself the only player on the field, the rest of the players having departed. Inevitably there will have to be a compromise in respect of the Western Australian position. If there is no such compromise by the Federal Government, that will have enormous implications and dislocations for corporations which do business in Western Australia. It is inevitable that a meeting of minds will have to take place further down the track in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The great sadness for me is that I look at States such as New South Wales, which were opposed to the scheme originally and which went to the High Court to demonstrate that the Commonwealth did not have the power, and I see that since they have been given a bag of money by the Federal Government and a head office in their own States their altruism and their belief in the devolution of power and responsibility in a federal system has flown out the window as the money has flown in. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Western Australia is now in the position where it cannot be party to a system when the rest of the players have departed from the field. It is not simply that Western Australia has been bloody-minded about this; it is simply that it has stuck rigidly to a philosophic belief that power is best exercised by those closest to the people who are most directly affected by it-in other words, a simple process of devolution of power and responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> However, that is clearly not going to be the case now. I very much hope for corporate Australia that there is a sensible and satisfactory resolution as quickly as possible. Once the other States took the money and ran, withdrew from their High Court challenges and did their grubby deals with the Federal Government because dollars and cents were more important that the proper exercise of power at the appropriate places, the cooperative federalist system could no longer prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this legislation is going to be a classic example of an Act that will for the next 12 months to two years require continual amending. I suspect that major parts of it will be rewritten because the Government, in its headlong rush to get this legislation passed by 1 January, has not allowed for proper parliamentary scrutiny, public scrutiny, corporate scrutiny or scrutiny by the various States which are required to be parties to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I only regret that we find ourselves now in this chamber with a guillotine hanging over our heads, being unable to debate the Bill clause by clause; unable to prosecute a proper, reasonable debate on this issue; unable to have the Minister go through the various clauses; and unable to know at the end of the day that we have satisfactorily discharged our responsibility as senators in the second chamber of the Parliament, ensuring that the headlong rush by the House of Representatives, which is now simply an extension of the Executive, in some way has a further check and balance on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Because this Government crudely and bluntly rammed through the guillotine this morning, which prevents the proper processes of a parliamentary system, this debate has been sufficiently curtailed as to deny us all a proper forum for expressing our views and for pressing the legislation to determine whether or not it requires proper amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Crichton-Browne has put the case quite well. It is not only the guillotining of the debate on this matter that has made it impossible for the chamber to give proper scrutiny to this complex package of legislation-a guillotine that was enforced upon this chamber by the Australian Democrats-it is indeed the whole way that this legislative package has arrived in the Parliament of Australia and the parliaments of the various States around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the heads of agreement document that was signed in Alice Springs in June, the Federal Government and the States agreed on a legislative program to prepare the legislation and have it in the parliaments in September of this year, which would have provided many months for this Parliament, for senators, for members of the House of Representatives and for parliamentarians around Australia to have considered the quite broadly reaching consequences of this legislative package. Indeed, as I said to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last night, had that legislative program been abided by, perhaps the situation in Western Australia would not be as it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Committee, as I said before: the situation in Western Australia cannot be blamed upon the legislative councillors in Western Australia because clearly the Legislative Council is one of the few chambers around the whole of this nation which has actually done its job. Opposition members have been prepared to say to the Federal Government and to the corrupt Government in Western Australia that they are not prepared to get a package of legislation like that, to look at it and to pass it through without proper scrutiny. They have told the doctrinaire centralists of the Australian Labor Party that they can take their legislation and shove it. That is what they should have done. </PARA>
<PARA> That has created problems, but they are problems that have been created by this Federal Government and by this Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who plucked a starting date out of the air after the High Court case earlier this year, saying, `We will have it up and running by 1 January'. He had no idea then of what he was doing. He has created a political imperative which he has been unable to meet logistically. </PARA>
<PARA> If one saw the tired figure of the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Tony Hartnell, last night having to wade through the enormous logistic problems, which I have gone through on a number of occasions in this chamber before, to try to get his organisation up and running by 1 January, one would really wonder at the logic, the principle and, indeed, the sensibility of trying to have this whole scheme up and running by 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the people who made submissions to the Senate Standing Committee last night went through some detailed, complicated, practical matters. Even though they said that they did not support the idea of delaying the setting up of the Australian Securities Commission, they said quite clearly that there were grounds to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of the Western Australian business community has been clearly made known today in a letter which was only recently provided to Michael Duffy, the Attorney-General. The head of the Western Australian Opposition Group, Laurie Shervington, representing the Law Society of Western Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Australian Stock Exchange in Perth, the Confederation of Western Australian Industry, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia, the International Association of Financial Planning and the trustee companies of Australia, have, in a very clearly, concisely worded letter, said that it is just impossible and outrageous to try to set up the Australian Securities Commission by 1 January. There are just too many logistic problems, not to mention the problems caused by the lack of mirror legislation in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Committee received, as Senator Spindler and Senator Hill have said previously, some very detailed submissions from a number of business groups, including one from the Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry, which was sent to me by Michael O'Connor, a former head of the Corporate Affairs Office in Perth, now the Assistant General Manager, Corporate Services, for Perpetual Trustees (WA) Ltd, and others from the Law Institute of Victoria and the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do give credit to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), the Attorney-General and the officers responsible for preparing what are fairly detailed responses to some of the concerns, as was promised last night at the Senate Standing Committee, but, as Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, said here today, it is a bit hard for senators to go through those responses in much detail when they were delivered to our offices only a few minutes ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the responses do point out the concerns raised by industry and professions last night. I will quote one as an example because, as I said, I have not had time to go through in detail the responses and indeed the submissions because time has been just too short. I think we all agree on that. On page three of the response prepared by Mr Dennis Rose, the Chief General Counsel in the Attorney-General's Department, he refers under section 6 to some constitutional problems that were raised by Mr Michael O'Connor from Perpetual Trustees and says at the end of it:</PARA>
<PARA>In my opinion, it is clear that none of those provisions exceeds the relevant constitutional powers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is his opinion. The fact of the matter is that the whole constitutional underpinning of this legislative package has raised doubts in many people's minds. Many of the procedures that are used are doubtful. The complexity of this legislation has basically not allowed time for people even of the eminence and with the knowledge of this issue of Professor Bob Austin, who was before the Committee, to come to grips with in such a short time. It is just impossible for anyone to contemplate the problems that can arise by legislating in this way. I think that is the only real point that we can make here today in this debate, given the constraints that we have upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Austin told me last night after the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee that the response he had received to his submission still left many doubts in his mind. I think all of us would agree that Professor Austin is one of the most well-versed people outside the various offices of Solicitors-General and Attorneys-General in Australia in relation to this legislative package. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters that were raised of specific detail last night concerned the Australian company number (ACN). I think, for the third or fourth time, my doubts and fears about the way this system is going to work failed to be allayed. The concerns of Coles Myer Ltd as to whether this company number will have to appear on the receipts in their checkouts was not answered last night. I suppose the Minister can respond to that today. The concerns about the abbreviations of the Australian company number as they appear on company seals was discussed last night and has been discussed at length. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the Australian company number and the effect of the moratorium on civil action that may be taken in relation to companies that do not have the ACN on their business documents are all matters that still, and quite rightly so, concern the vast array of corporate Australia, the some 800,000 companies out there which are totally confused about this whole package. I think the point that the Senate and this Government must understand is that to legislate in such an important area for Australia in this way is unacceptable and should never happen again. Senator Crichton-Browne made the point that we are likely to be back here in the Commonwealth Parliament making amendments to this package for the next couple of years. I think, with my only brief consideration of these Bills over the last few minutes, that is quite evident.</PARA>
<PARA> The other important matters that were raised last night were, of course, the transitional period and problems perceived with that. I think the concerns of both the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia, which were referred to by Senator Spindler, were not allayed last night. There are problems with prospectuses, rights issues, the liabilities of directors of those companies and the exemptions for disclosures. If I remember correctly, Mr Hartnell said that those disclosure problems will not affect any companies that he is aware of. The business representatives tended to say to the Standing Committee that there may be many companies, rights issues and prospectuses affected by those transitional provisions. These are all matters which have not been dealt with and which cannot be dealt with properly because of the legislative program this Government has imposed upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> The last issue I raise is in relation to the Western Australian position and the way this issue is being handled politically by the Government. I think Senator Crichton-Browne referred to it. The Western Australian Opposition has, for the last two or three years, been at the forefront of trying to cut down on corporate crime, to uncover corruption and to force a royal commission. It has been at the forefront of exposing the corrupt dealings of Western Australian Government Ministers, former Premiers and the involvement of government in business. The Western Australian Opposition has been at the forefront of the fight against corporate crime and the involvement of corporate criminals, corrupt government Ministers and government officials. These matters have all been well and truly exposed in the newspapers. It is the Western Australian Government which has been at the forefront of corporate crime and its own involvement in corporate crime. </PARA>
<PARA> For this Government to take the side of the Government of Carmen Lawrence and the Attorney-General, Joe Berinson, who himself is implicated in some of the WA Inc. dealings, is quite laughable to me. The Western Australian Government's new-found will to clean up corporate affairs in Western Australia is an absolute joke. It is quite outrageous to think that we have the Western Australian Government accusing the Opposition members of the Legislative Council of protecting corporate criminals and trying to make a safe haven for corporate criminals, because most of the corporate criminals in Western Australia are to be found in the Cabinet of the Western Australian Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate this afternoon, which concludes a somewhat truncated process of parliamentary consideration of this important Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. For example, I believe the Senate was greatly aided by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs under the very able and sometimes somewhat eccentric chairmanship of Senator Barney Cooney, whose style permitted a great variety of views to be expressed. As the Minister at the table, I found that extremely helpful and have undertaken, as a result of some very weighty submissions put forward, to take into account certain matters, particularly in the drawing up of regulations, including section 1034.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general, I believe that we have reached a stage where, having completed this parliamentary process, this chamber will have done what it set out to do several years ago in responding to a Senate committee report, where in Australia we had a situation where companies and securities legislation was devised, composed and drafted by a committee of Ministers and then put into the various parliaments around Australia for automatic passage. There was no sense of final political responsibility in any one chamber of any one parliament throughout this Federation for the laws which were controlling and purporting to regulate companies and securities throughout this great Commonwealth. We now have a situation where this chamber pre-eminently, together with the House of Representatives-certainly this Parliament-will have to take true political responsibility for the formulation and moulding of those laws which are so essential to ensure that we are properly served by an adequate company and securities legislation package. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that will be wedded to an Australian Securities Commission (ASC) which will have the resources and the responsibility to properly undergird the regulation of companies and securities throughout Australia. It will have a very important role in restoring the confidence of domestic and overseas investors, who must look askance at Australia as the corporate activity-this was alluded to by Senator Campbell-now leads to various charges being laid against those who played a most prominent role in the corporate life of Australia during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is because of that general impression, both within the Australian community and overseas, of this area of our commercial life that there is an absolutely imperative need for the earliest possible putting into place of this legislation and the accompanying administrative structures. But I believe it would be completely wrong if those structures bore any of the centralist tendencies which were pictured as being their necessary character by Senator Campbell and Senator Crichton-Browne. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, it is absolutely essential that we get away from the stereotypes which have sometimes characterised the debate. It became evident last night that, for example, on the part of Mr Tony Hartnell of the Australian Securities Commission-I think this was acknowledged by Senator Campbell-there was evident goodwill towards the regional areas of Australia. The various Attorneys-General at the Alice Springs meeting, and the heads of agreement which flowed from that meeting, made it absolutely clear that it would be intolerable if the regional areas of Australia were left in a situation where the levels of service available to the business communities in those districts and important provincial and non-eastern seaboard areas of Australia were neglected and not provided for adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that those heads of agreement, particularly the Western Australian clauses which found their way into it, through the insistence of Attorney-General Joe Berinson but with a background of pressure from the Western Australian opposition group and no doubt the political pressure that was also apparent from the upper House in Western Australia, will lead to a situation where the regional needs of the business communities of Australia will be very adequately and better served by the ASC-if it does what it has promised to do. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great unfortunate factors in the chronological situation we have got into, with so little time left before 1 January, is that, if there is not the passage of this legislation in Western Australia, there will not be the early establishment of the Office of Regional Commissioner and the early operation of the Regional Liaison Committee whose role it would be to sit down with Mr Hartnell and other officers of the Australian Securities Commission to compose those performance indicators which would be the basis of a true, practical assessment and effective measurement of whether the levels of service promised to the regions were being delivered. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason alone, I think the business community of Western Australia would be well served if the Legislative Council were to pass this legislation, reluctantly, and castigating, as it would and must, not only the Federal Government but necessarily all other governments of Australia because all other jurisdictions have participated in coming to the conclusion that this Australia-wide package is essential to restore integrity and efficiency to companies and securities regulation throughout Australia. It would be wrong to try simply to caricature people as centralist socialists in this matter because, quite clearly, with Mr Greiner and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Marshall Perron, whom I know and respect-he was recently re-elected to that high office and I greatly respect the contribution he makes to rational debate, for example, on firearms control in this country-it is a question of many political minds of different persuasions coming to the common conclusion that the marketplace in Australia must be regulated by laws made by a parliament which takes full responsibility for their creation and amendment and which is responsible to the Australia-wide electorate, because we are talking about an Australia-wide marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I am beginning to reiterate many points which I made both at the conclusion of the second reading debate and extensively last night in the very valuable session held under the auspices of Senator Barney Cooney. In conclusion, I pay tribute to those officers who have worked so diligently and hard, not only in the last 12 hours or so to provide the responses which that Committee required to certain complex documents which were forwarded by the Law Council of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria and Perpetual Trustees Western Australia Ltd, Mr Bernard Collaery and others, but also over the last several weeks in briefing me and no doubt the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and many others. Mr David Edwards, Mr Brian O'Callaghan, Mr Jim Murphy and other members of the working group have performed in a way which shows the excellence of the quality and dedication of some of the public servants who are available to any Australian government of any political persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we ought to record our indebtedness to those who have been prepared to put in such a major effort, under huge political constraints, and have served the elected representative of the people-by which I mean not only the Government but also this chamber-so well in providing the material that was sought and giving advice. I wish this Bill a final passage through this Parliament. I believe that in years to come, some with misgivings and some with more enthusiasm than others will look upon this particular vote as marking a new era in the regulation of corporations and securities in Australia. I commend the third reading of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I disagree with one thing that Senator Tate said in particular-and this has to be on the record-that is, there is nothing sterile about the fact that under the old cooperative system the legislation had to be mirrored in each parliament. That does not mean that there was no source of responsibility, as Senator Tate would have us believe. It means that the responsibility was shared equally and carried by each Minister and each parliament. We now have a new system where the numbers are in the pocket of the Attorney-General. Senator Tate referred to the heavy responsibilities that this chamber will have, together with the House of Representatives. What he did not say was that the House of Representatives is now but a mere weak, limp extension of the Executive. The House of Representatives never, but never, disagrees with the Executive, because it is the Executive, by the very nature of the Caucus system of the Australian Labor Party and the parliamentary system we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we put the votes in the pocket of the Attorney-General and the Government controls the decision-making. It is this Parliament that will dictate the processes of reform, the processes of legislation and the direction that the Act will take in future. I would not want it thought that there was some meandering, pointless process that was undertaken previously simply because each State and Territory and Federal Attorney-General had a very special and proper responsibility unto his own constituency and parliament-that in some way it was a headless system. Quite the contrary: it was a classic example of a cooperative system that could operate constructively and properly with an equal and fair distribution of power and responsibility. This will not be the case under the new system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to conclude with a few points that I forgot to mention in my first contribution. I will not say anything politically upsetting to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) so that we do not delay matters. There were only two matters that have not been put on the record in this chamber. One is the performance indicators issue, which the Minister referred to a couple of times. He said that the Alice Springs heads of agreement referred to performance indicators and the regional liaison committees, which I have already publicly supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Had we been able to develop performance indicators-and clearly, that would have been possible to do; the Western Australian opposition group has already come up with a set of performance indicators on the key issue of the delegated powers it wanted for the regional commissioners-and had there been some discussion about that many months earlier, then the Western Australian business community and, indeed, the members of the Liberal and National parties in the Legislative Council would not have that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem we have, which I failed to mention in my initial contribution to this committee stage debate, concerned the regulations and the whole issue of business having to comply with a law which it does not understand and regulations which we know the Government is working very hard to have printed and published before Christmas Day. I cannot see many corporate lawyers sitting down over the Christmas-New Year period to read the regulations and try to come to grips with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the two matters. I do not believe they deserve a specific response. Again, they reinforce my point that, had things been done in a more timely manner, perhaps the confrontation and confusion that we are visited with at the moment would not have been necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now debating the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, a major Bill which deals with the merger of two of the biggest banks in Australia. It sets the framework in place for the sale of the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at a cost of $1.6 billion, which is actually $2 billion when one takes into account the related tax measures. In meeting this primary goal, the legislation converts into public companies the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill essentially implements the deal worked out between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Premier of Victoria, Mrs Kirner, back in August of this year. That deal involved a purchase bid of $1.6 billion by the Commonwealth Bank for the State Bank of Victoria; $170m to eliminate tax loss write-offs from Tricontinental, the failed merchant bank arm of the State Bank; a $243m reimbursement to Victoria for tax revenue which in future will go to the Commonwealth rather than to Victoria; the separation of the State Bank from Tricontinental; and the fact that Tricontinental assets, including tax losses, will not be used to reduce Commonwealth tax receipts. The Bill essentially implements the deal that was worked out. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that this Bill has everything to do with the Hawke-Keating Government bailing out the Cain-Kirner Government in Victoria and has nothing at all to do with what it should be rightly directed at, that is, privatisation. Indeed, the Treasurer got a good deal out of Mrs Kirner in one sense in that he bought her vote at the special Australian Labor Party conference on 24 September to implement the 30 per cent sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the deals that were worked out within the Labor Party on the privatisation of Australian Airlines Ltd and the part sale to private interests of Qantas Airways Ltd. But it was a vote that was bought by the Treasurer at very considerable cost so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only was the deal done in an attempt to save the doomed but unsavable Labor Government in Victoria; it was also done in an attempt to retain any professional credibility that the Treasurer may still have had. Of course, it is now quite clear to all Australians that this architect of our deliberately engineered recession has not one shred of credibility left. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the reason why the deal was done in the way that it was, in other words, to legislate to sell the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank rather than saving the State Bank of Victoria by direct intervention from the Budget-and honourable senators should remember that this deal was done two days after the Federal Budget was brought down on 22 August. The politics of it, so far as Mr Keating's credibility are concerned, are very well set out in the debate on the Bill that took place in the other chamber on 14 November. A member of the Government, Mr John Scott, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The sell-out of the Commonwealth Bank will stand as one of the greatest betrayals of the Australian Labor Party. Those who allowed this to happen cry crocodile tears and say that they did it to save the Government and the people of Victoria. The false tears and argument add insult to this great injury. The need for action to salvage the State Bank of Victoria was never an issue. The funds could and should have been found from within the Commonwealth Bank and/or from the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Budget was never contemplated as a vehicle by the Treasurer was that he has as his icon a thing called the public sector borrowing requirement. He was producing a Budget with a surplus of $8 billion. He knew that to handle the bail-out of the Kirner Government in Victoria through budgetary measures would have blown his $8 billion surplus, which is being blown day by day anyway-it is now down probably to $5 billion. That surplus made the Treasurer look good. Again, as his colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh, Mr Scott, said in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . history will judge the Hawke-Keating Government on the sell-out of the Commonwealth Bank . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition, let me hasten to add, does not support Mr Scott's view. We say that the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill does not go far enough and that what we should be seeing here is a 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank because that is the only way that that bank is going to be made increasingly competitive and able to raise the necessary funds for its growth and development on behalf of all Australians in the period ahead. In other words, it ought to be placed on the same footing as any of the other major privately owned banks. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, I want to deplore the lack of time given to debate this very important Bill in the House of Representatives. The Government's mismanagement of the parliamentary program is a recipe for bad legislation as it cuts time for consultation and debate. This Bill went through the House of Representatives in something like 40 minutes; it may have been a little longer but it was subject to the guillotine procedures-procedures which are again applying to the Bill here today. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the legislation is evident in the fact that the merged organisation will be the biggest bank in Australia. It will employ some 50,000 people. The State Bank of Victoria alone has over four million depositors. The merged organisation will have 26 per cent of deposits and 23 per cent of bank lending in Australia. It will also be the dominant operator of superannuation roll-over funds, with more than $2.5 billion of deferred retirement benefits under management and control over approximately $1 in every $7 in the superannuation business. </PARA>
<PARA> The mismanagement of this very important legislation has of course continued in the Senate. I will be proposing when we get to the committee stage certain amendments which were discussed by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Administration last Friday. That debate was supposed to take place only after the second reading of this Bill had taken place, and even that we could not get right. It is not surprising that the Government does not want a meaningful debate. The Bill relates to a merger of convenience which has torn the Labor Party asunder because of the divisions within it on the ideology of State ownership. Nothing could be more evident than that from the fact that members of the Government-and I think Senator Tate was one of them-voted against its own policy proposals here in the Senate in September. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Government in the Senate, including Ministers-and I think Senator Tate was one of them-voted against a motion put by the coalition supporting the selling of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. The failure to support that motion directly, of course, contradicts the substance of the Bill which is before us today. But the confusion is even deeper than that. One has only to look at the Caucus resolution of the Federal parliamentary Labor Party of 28 August, which imposed 17 of the most draconian restrictions surrounding the sale even of this 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. It was the only way that the leadership of the Party could get the agreement of Caucus to even this small step. That again is indicative of the very deep divisions that this Bill has caused within the Labor Party and within the Government. Hence, it is a clear reason for the Government not wanting to see this Bill debated at any considerable length. But the confusion, I think, is even deeper than that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is official policy, as I assumed Senator Tate would have known. Why on earth would one not sell 100 per cent? Why, if one was really serious about assisting the Commonwealth Bank, would one sell 30 per cent of it with no change in the operation of the bank and no considerably greater access to the finance and the necessary inputs and so on that it needs if it is going to be a great competitor bank with the other major banks in Australia? The Government is in a halfway house. It has fallen between two stools. It has achieved nothing other than to try to sort out a squalid political deal to save the Kirner Government in Victoria, which, as I said, is an absolutely unsavable Government. That is what it is on about in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The confusion is even deeper than that. Conflicting statements by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are further evidence of a party not knowing what it is doing. In 1985 both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were out whipping up a scare campaign for all they were worth when it came to privatisation of any sort. The Treasurer said in May of that year:</PARA>
<PARA>No matter where one looks, whether it be at TAA or other authorities, there is no case for the Opposition's-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Liberal and National parties-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . argument in economics, except simply to indulge ideologically in a Thatcherite, vandalistic splurge to try and destroy these authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Also in 1985 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . privatisation would be an expensive and disastrous experiment. </PARA>
<PARA>The political nature of that opposition to what is the only rational and economically sound argument on the treatment of assets such as the Commonwealth Bank was highlighted by a letter from the Prime Minister to the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association just before the last election in March of this year. In that letter the Prime Minister said that the Labor Government was opposed to privatisation. It knew that it did not believe that. It made that statement, knowing that it was untrue, in a sordid, blatant attempt to buy votes at the election in March. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not object to the backflip made on Government policy if the Government itself had not gone out and blatantly misled the public about its intentions. If the Government had come to accept the coalition's policy in total rather than going halfway with a partial privatisation to satisfy purely political ends, and if the Government was now prepared to say it had adopted this new stance for the right economic reasons rather than to find some compromise which had to be jammed down the throats of the warring factions within the Labor Party, then this situation might look very different. </PARA>
<PARA> In stark contrast, the coalition has a policy position to which it is unwaveringly committed and has been for a considerable time. We find the Government's continued shifting of position dishonest and destabilising. It is nothing more than a blatant politicisation of an issue which should always have been won or lost on the real economic arguments involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us today is typical of a Government only prepared to approach sensible policy options kicking and screaming. It is ironic in the extreme that the gross mismanagement of one Labor government has helped at least partially to rationalise the policies of another. The Bill before us shows that the Government was left with a mishmash of compromise and a half-baked privatisation. The coalition will attempt to limit the damage of compromise in amendments that I will move at the committee stage, which have already been circulated. Those amendments, in essence, involve deleting the section which seeks to retain 70 per cent of the bank in the hands of the Government in perpetuity, deleting the section which disallows foreigners from purchasing shares in the initial sale, and altering the section specifying the 5 per cent ownership limit and have the Commonwealth Bank instead subject to the same 10 per cent and 15 per cent limits applying to other banks under the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972. That Act allows unrestricted ownership of up to 10 per cent, between 10 and 15 per cent requires approval from the Treasurer that it not be contrary to the national interest, and ownership in excess of 15 per cent must be deemed in the national interest by the Treasurer to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments address issues which the Labor Party was very deeply divided on. The other irony is that I am sure that there are members on the Government side-Senator Tate may well be one of them-who would totally support these amendments of the coalition but are unprepared to do so publicly because of the divisions on the issue within the Government. I will discuss those amendments further at the committee stage, given that the guillotine has restricted the length of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to raise a number of issues concerning the propriety of the way that this sale has been handled. As the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has pointed out on a number of occasions, there seems little doubt that the tender process in this case was of a very questionable nature. Participants in the tender were given only four to five business days in which to finalise their bid, which is hardly enough time for due diligence. In fact, there is no time in a situation like that for adequate due diligence. The announcement of the successful bidder was also made only one day after the bids had closed and the successful tenderer was not the highest tenderer-Westpac was. Again, one day is hardly enough time for the alternative offers to be properly assessed or for the Government to make an informed and objective choice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's hypocrisy is also exposed again, since he chose to reject the ANZ-National Mutual merger on the basis of a 15 per cent national market share but, under the terms of this Bill, the Commonwealth will end up with 25 per cent national share, and in Victoria its share of the market will be 33 per cent. The Treasurer certainly uses his discretion on these matters in very strange and inequitable ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell has a similar situation in Western Australia. It is clear that in this instance the Treasurer was happy to manipulate the situation in such a way as to place the burden of a Victorian problem onto depositors of the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian taxpayer in general. ``It seems that the Labor Government of South Australia was also involved in the whole fiasco. The South Australian Government Financing Authority invested $300m in the State Bank of Victoria late in 1989 when the State Bank of Victoria was experiencing financial difficulties. It was only after examination through Estimates committees of the State Parliament in Adelaide that an additional $100m deal was also revealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the Government proposed in the Senate Standing Committee discussion of this Bill, that it will be making some technical amendments of its own. They relate to the superannuation conditions which will apply to transferred employees. Those amendments have now been circulated, but it is another example of the haste with which the Government is attempting to push through its legislative program, at risk of getting it wrong. The amendments that have now been moved at this very late stage are typical of the incompetence that this Government is bringing to the handling, programming, preparation and content of its legislative program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to contribute to this debate because I, like the previous speaker, Senator Short, have been an advocate of privatisation for many years. I remember back in 1984-85, at a time when I was helping to develop privatisation policies for the Western Australian Liberal Party-I think it was leading up to the 1986 campaign-that the Australian Labor Party seized upon the Liberal Party's privatisation initiatives at that stage. If I remember correctly, it spent millions of dollars employing people such as Graham Kennedy in some quite amusing television advertisements to lampoon privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is quite right and proper for the Opposition to applaud the shift in the sea state of policy in the Labor Party towards privatisation, albeit an incomplete shift. It is a shift that is perhaps motivated by the serious economic circumstances of Australia and the problems that the Federal Government has with its own accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank can clearly not be supported on any logical basis, except that someone has made a rough estimate-probably on the back of a packet of cigarette papers-that 30 per cent will roughly equal the $1.6 billion needed to bail out the State Bank of Victoria and the Labor Party cronies of this Federal Government down in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The same can be said about the Government's announced policy decisions to sell 49 per cent of Qantas Airways Ltd and 100 per cent of both Australian Airlines Ltd and Aussat Pty Ltd. All these figures are not based on any philosophical or policy logic; they are purely based on what the Government could get through its Labor Party conference earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties' commitment to privatisation is based on providing a better service for the customers, more competition between the entities and a more internationally competitive economy. It is also designed to maximise the once-off effect of the sales. None of those things are mutually exclusive to the other. </PARA>
<PARA> In any privatisation program there needs to be a balance of those objectives. Leaving aside the once-off effect of the sale and once-off effect to the Budget of the sale revenue, the key objectives are the effects that these sales would have on the Australian economy, the level of competition and the level of service that both the entity and the industry provide. Of course, the sale of 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank cannot do anything to enhance any one of those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that is of concern in relation to the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank-this deal that was done in a few short days to solve a political situation in Victoria-is that the program for its privatisation has been rushed through, as we have seen with the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which we were dealing with earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom, the Conservative Government has been privatising for most of the past 10 years. The United Kingdom has developed more expertise in privatisation programs than anywhere else in the world. Many countries, such as Australia, are following a long way behind. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that some of the privatisation programs earlier in the Thatcher Government's period did not meet some of the objectives that we have developed today. I still have severe doubts about the value of privatising an organisation such as Telecom Australia where one really creates a private monopoly instead of a public monopoly, because it does not achieve the competitive effects that really give service advantages to consumers of the service. However, the Thatcher Government, with a whole new professional industry set up around the privatisation programs-for example, the divisions in their merchant banks, the accounting and legal fraternity that have developed expertise in the privatisation area-learnt how to do it properly. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of us would have read in the Australian on Monday that the sale of the British Electricity Utilities has been a great success. It has oversubscribed. The amount of money the Government believes it will raise out of the float is much higher than expected and it has been a total success. The lesson to be learnt is that the program was put together over many years. The Government looked into how to do it; decided how it should be sold; looked at how the shares should be broken up; and set aside a certain amount of shares for the employees, a certain amount of shares for the consumer-share limits that were suited to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> After questioning the relevant Minister, Senator Button, in the Senate Standing Committee that dealt with this Bill last Friday, it would seem that the amount of thought that has gone into how to structure the share placements is not there and could not hope to match the sort of detail that the British Government and its advisers have gone into. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit on individual shareholdings in this package is five per cent. There are limits on the first-up sale of those shares, in that those people who buy them initially must be Australian. But there is nothing to stop, within the first five seconds of the float taking place, all of the 30 per cent capital in the Commonwealth Bank being transferred to foreign ownership. I am sure that is of concern to left wing members of the Labor Party and possibly even the Australian Democrats. I am not sure of the Democrats' position on that particular issue. I would say there are probably provisions whereby some friendly companies could get together and buy five per cent each and amalgamate further down the track, and that is something the Government may not have looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point is that by selling only 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and by not designing an effective privatisation program to meet the objectives, even the once-off effect to revenue, the once-off effect to the Budget, will not be maximised. There is no way the Government can get a maximised price per share if no effective control and no voting rights go with those shares. I think that is true in the case of Qantas, where the Government is selling 49 per cent. There is no way the Government is going to get the same price per share it would get if it were selling 51 per cent and providing some control for the people purchasing the shares, and this is a matter of concern. The trouble is that once the Government has sold 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, it cannot sell it again. It is a once-off effect, a once-off policy error. The many millions of dollars this Government short-changes the Australian taxpayer by choosing to compromise and sell only 30 per cent will be lost for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, this privatisation is to be applauded in that it is moving in the right direction. The Government has moved a long way since 1984 when it was totally opposed to privatisation. I understand the political problems that the economically rational Ministers in the Cabinet have trying to move the left wing and the Centre Left of their Party towards these rational proposals. To the extent that the Opposition can blaze a policy trail and have the Government tag along many miles behind, we will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We will encourage the Government to sell the whole of the Commonwealth Bank for those objectives that I have stated before, that is, to increase service, to increase competition and to maximise the return to the Australian taxpayer. This legislation does not do that; it is a compromise deal. It is a deal to help the Victorian Government and it is going to cost the Australian taxpayer millions of dollars in revenue that can never be recovered. It is therefore partial privatisation, which we are opposed to in principle, but we will support this Bill because it is certainly moving in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is discussing the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990. The Bill proposes to provide, with the support of complementary Victorian legislation, for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's succession to all the rights, property, staff and liabilities of the State Bank of Victoria. The takeover will make the Commonwealth Bank the biggest bank in the domestic market, holding a quarter of all dollars deposited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In Victoria, the Commonwealth will control 33 per cent of the market with a branch network of approximately 800 outlets.

The Commonwealth Bank will be deemed to be a public company and will be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Some existing provisions will be retained. These are: the Commonwealth guarantee on all liabilities of the bank; the charter of the Commonwealth Bank; the residual power of the Government to overrule the bank board in a matter of policy; a power for the Treasurer to intervene in the bank's dividend policy, although it must not exceed 45 per cent of the consolidated profits of the group; and the existing exemption of the Commonwealth Bank from State taxes. </PARA>

This appears more certain now, given the recent statements of the major private banks concerning job losses and staff retrenchments in their establishments. </PARA>

Before discussing in detail some of the particular provisions of the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill, it is appropriate to consider the history of this most symbolic of all publicly owned businesses. To save the time of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary of the history of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HISTORY OF THE COMMONWEALTH BANKS:</PARA>
<PARA>Although there was increasing philosophical movement during the l9th Century towards State control of banking and finance it was the economic decline in the early 1890's which laid the foundation for the creation of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>In aggregate between mid-1891 and mid-1893 of the 64 institutions which called themselves banks only 10 were not forced to close or refuse payment for some period. </PARA>
<PARA>Of the quasi-bank institutions (building societies and land and mortgage companies) only one out of 36 was not forced to close. </PARA>
<PARA>The crash was occasioned by a fall in land prices which followed the enormous boom period of the 1880's. </PARA>
<PARA>The pressure filtered through the quasi-banks to the banks as confidence was eroded. In an uncanny resemblance to contemporary events the worst failures occurred in my home state of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>Many lost their life savings and the loss of purchasing power by the general community caused great hardship and had a very depressing effect on business. One of the major problems was that the banks would not support each other. </PARA>
<PARA>This disaster showed that the people still had faith in the state as a banker with the colonial post office savings accounts becoming the only ``haven'' during the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>The call for Australia's own Bank of England intensified even though that institution was still private at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>Suddenly, there was movement for uniform banking regulation which could only occur as a result of federation of the colonies. </PARA>
<PARA>The early Labor Party platforms contained a policy of a national bank although the specific purposes of the institution were nebulous. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the colonies debated the state bank question-indeed Queensland actually took over the issuance of currency notes, yet apart from this nothing of major significance was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>However, a Victorian Royal Commission did suggest a model which closely resembled the actual composition of the Commonwealth Bank when it was finally formed 15 years later. </PARA>
<PARA>Such an institution was made possible by the banking power granted to the Commonwealth Government under the Australian Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>All of the first seven Federal Governments between 1901 and 1910 had a banking plan-none of them were implemented. Meanwhile a strong movement for bank nationalisation had arisen. </PARA>
<PARA>The flamboyant King O'Malley led the call within the Labor Party to establish a Commonwealth Bank. This culminated at the Federal Conference of the Labor Party in July 1908. </PARA>
<PARA>Here O'Malley outlined his plan to create not only a banking institution, but also a mechanism to revolutionise Federal-State fiscal relations. Although the conference merely resolved to create a Commonwealth Bank which will be a bank of issue, deposit, exchange and reserve, O'Malley's plans were detailed and certainly practical. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed O'Malley detailed his proposals in a five hour speech in the other place in 1909-we are only being allotted that amount of time to deal with this whole piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Peoples' Bank would take decades to evolve into the institution that O'Malley envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fisher Government won the 1910 election and commenced the implementation of its Platform. However, the function of currency issuance was given to the Federal Treasury. Whilst a reasonable decision it was contrary to the O'Malley vision for the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Bank Bill was introduced on October 25th, 1911; it became law on December 22nd, 1911. </PARA>
<PARA>Incredibly the Bank did not require any initial capital, although there was provision in the legislation for a 1,000,000 pounds debenture issue for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gave the Bank power to:</PARA>
<PARA>* carry on business as a savings and a trading bank;</PARA>
<PARA>* make loans and issue bills;</PARA>
<PARA>* to deal in assets. </PARA>
<PARA>It did not create a central bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed the Governor, Mr. Denison Miller went out of his way to not attempt to dominate either savings or general banking. He was appointed on June 1st, 1912 and completely dominated the policy of the Bank until his death in 1923. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Savings Bank opened in Victoria with the other states following progressively. Andrew Fisher opened the first account, King O'Malley the third. The Bank did obtain a market advantage by occupying the post offices which had formerly been used by the various State Savings Banks. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Commonwealth took over the State Savings Bank of Tasmania on January 1st, 1913 there was no attempt to dominate savings banking. Whilst it was thought that eventually all the state banks would become redundant, such a policy was not pursued. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed the Governor set the rate of interest to be paid on accounts at a rate below that on offer from the state banks. </PARA>
<PARA>As well as the Savings Bank the Commonwealth commenced general banking business as well. The head office was located in Sydney not Melbourne, quite a controversial decision at the time. The first deposit was by the Commonwealth Government. The Government transferred its business in each State and in London. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the Bank commencing business, all of the private Trading Banks charged half yearly account keeping charges on all current accounts. The Commonwealth abolished fees on accounts that were overdrawn (and hence incurring interest) and on those with a minimum balance of 50 pounds. </PARA>
<PARA>The accounts of local government bodies, friendly societies, churches, charities, non-profit associations and State and Commonwealth Government accounts were completely exempted from fees. </PARA>
<PARA>Even Senators' and Members' accounts were exempted. </PARA>
<PARA>Lower interest rates were charged on loans to social organisations and governing bodies, and Friendly Societies and other similar bodies were granted the flexibility of current account facilities whilst their deposits accrued interest at the savings bank rate. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus right from the start the Commonwealth Bank has provided competition which only a public institution can do. </PARA>
<PARA>World War I really showed the value to the nation of the People's Bank. When war broke out there was great fear that runs would commence on every bank in Australia. The Commonwealth averted this by a simple yet brilliant strategy. Extra tellers were put on and instructed to pay out all withdrawals as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>This extraordinary action prevented large queues forming and hence averted a crisis of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, whilst all British banks other than the Bank of England were closed during the banking moratorium which occurred in London, the CBA remained open. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank even provided funds to the Federal Government to purchase necessary horses for the Australian forces before the relevant Supply bills had been passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the armed services were provided with a variety of services including savings facilities, exemption from any fees including telegraphic transfer fees for ``diggers'' or their families, emergency money-even financing holidays in Britain, France and Italy for those on leave. </PARA>
<PARA>All prisoners of war who were repatriated back to Britain were met by an officer of the Bank on arrival to ensure that they should not be even temporarily short of money. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Bank's major contribution was to raise massive war loans to assist in the financing of the war effort-what would have happened if the ``People's Bank'' had not existed?</PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Bank played a key role in financing the export trade. Trade was predominantly with Britain and was dominated by agricultural commodities-wool, wheat, meat, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>Pooling arrangements were devised to guarantee orderly marketing of these products. Financing these pools was a combined banking operation in which CBA acquired a central role. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst these were purely pragmatic wartime measures, such control of commodity marketing was a function the socialist elements envisaged for the CBA. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank was also instrumental in Billy Hughes' astounding acquisition of a shipping line for the Australian Government. To further Australia's interests, Hughes decided to create an Australian shipping line to sever our reliance on the British controlled fleet. </PARA>
<PARA>With CBA finance Hughes secretly acquired 15 merchant ships which he subsequently convinced the British Government he should be allowed to keep. This was the birth of the Commonwealth shipping line-unfortunately the Coalition also sees no benefit in maintaining a public shipping line, and hence proposes to sell Australian National Lines. </PARA>
<PARA>Meanwhile the Bank was assisting to establish BHP and the Trans Australian Railway. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank was also progressively picking up the banking business of the smaller states-with Tasmania transferring in June 1914, Western Australia in October and South Australia in March 1916. In December 1920 the Queensland Government Savings Bank was acquired by CBA as was the business of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank was heavily involved in the post war transition and played a leading role in the provision of housing for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed the British Labor Party became very impressed with the CBA and began advocating an English State Bank. Such a proposal caused problems in the City of London which then determined to attempt to starve the radical Labor State of Queensland from raising funds through the CBA. </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Government simply went to New York which forever broke the finance monopoly the City of London had on Australian Governments. Obviously this transition was brilliantly managed-the outcry which arose when the Whitlam Government attempted to bypass the existing finance markets (New York and London) and borrow directly from the Arabs shows how politically dangerous such a move can be. </PARA>
<PARA>The note issue function was transferred in 1920 from the Treasury to the newly created Note Issue Department in the Commonwealth Bank. This department was run by a separate Board. This was the front runner of the full Bank Board which was created in 1924. </PARA>
<PARA>By the time of the 1922 election campaign the Country Party had become a force in politics and Earl Page adopted the O'Malley policy that the Commonwealth Bank should</PARA>
<PARA>``become a Central Bank by giving it control of the currency under an independent Board of Directors and making it the Bank of Exchange, Discount and Reserve''. </PARA>
<PARA>After the election a Coalition was formed and Page became the Treasurer. In 1924 a package of reform measures was enacted. These principally being</PARA>
<PARA>* the creation of an independent Bank Board which consisted of business leaders;</PARA>
<PARA>* empowering the Bank to effect interbank exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government acceded to the request of the Private Banks to remove from the legislation the necessity for the private banks to keep their reserves in special accounts with the Commonwealth Bank-thus this fundamental element of a central bank was still denied to the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1925 a Rural Credits Department was created to provide farmers with short-term finance to assist them in marketing their produce-this greatly enhanced the Bank's standing in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>To allay the fears of the private banks, the Commonwealth abandoned active competition for trading bank business. In 1927 Legislation was also passed to constitute the Commonwealth Savings Bank as a separate institution, although still managed by the same Board. </PARA>
<PARA>In April 1930, the Scullin Government introduced into Parliament a Central Reserve Bank Bill to provide for a fully fledged central bank, separate from the Commonwealth Bank. The Opposition controlled Senate sent it to die in a Select Committee which, in due course, it did. </PARA>
<PARA>Although Australia emerged from the Depression without a formally constituted central bank, important central banking functions were undertaken during that period. The Bank gained control of Australia's domestic gold reserves and arranged gold exports to ease the nation's international liquidity problems. It secured a Mobilisation Agreement from the private banks to ensure that adequate foreign exchange was available to meet Government commitments. It coordinated the underwriting of Government loans and the take-up of Treasury Bills, assumed control of exchange rate determination and acted as adviser to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The battles between the Bank and the Government during this period were legendary and show the possible dangers of a too independent central bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The savings bank business of the Commonwealth Bank also received a fillip due to the demise of the Government Savings Bank of NSW. After a succession of crises a major run on the State Bank occurred on 22 April 1931 and it had to shut its doors. Negotiations continued for months between the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank with an agreement finally being reached in December. </PARA>
<PARA>The takeover was not total with the State Treasury retaining the advances of the State Savings Bank's Rural Bank Department and the business of the Advances for Homes and Government Housing Departments. In 1933 these became part of a newly established Rural Bank of NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>No compensation was paid, although under the agreement the profits and losses of the former State Bank were split between the NSW Government and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>During this time the CBA also became involved in similar negotiations with Western Australia. These culminated in a takeover by agreement of the State Savings Bank of Western Australia in October 1931. </PARA>
<PARA>By the end of the Depression the Commonwealth Savings Bank had become the dominant savings institution whose only competitors were the State Banks in Victoria and South Australia and the two trustee savings banks in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1936 a Royal Commission into banking and the monetary system was established-it reported in 1937 although none of its recommendations were put into practice until the second world war. Ben Chifley gave a dissenting report which argued for complete Government control of banking. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1938 legislation was introduced to implement the less controversial recommendations of the Royal Commission. King O'Malley started a `save the People's Bank' campaign from what he saw as the legislation's attempt to deliver the Bank to the private bankers. It is unclear exactly how this could have come about but it involved the proposed power to issue debentures to private interests. Larry Noye (a noted authority on the Bank) claims the legislation was an attempt by the Treasurer, R. G. Casey, to privatise the Bank. In any event the legislation lapsed and a modified Bill was aborted by the outbreak of World War 2. </PARA>
<PARA>During the war the Bank was given comprehensive powers of exchange control, foreign exchange transactions monopolies and a formal power to fix exchange rates under the Defence power of the Constitution. In addition the ``special account'' procedure was introduced and supplemented by the power to licence private banks, control bank interest rates and to obtain information from banks as and when desired. </PARA>
<PARA>To control total bank credit the Commonwealth Bank was also given power on bank lending policy, the control of bank profits and the control of bank purchases of Government securities. </PARA>
<PARA>Again the Bank was a key institution in the war effort, providing service to the troops, developing local industries, financing capital works, arranging the war financing effort and managing the private banks. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1943 a Mortgage Bank Department was created along the lines recommended by the Royal Commission. In 1945 a further department, the Industrial Finance Department, was created to meet the needs of small business. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the wartime controls were enacted in the 1945 Commonwealth Bank and Banking Acts of 1945. In addition the Bank Board was abolished, and the Bank was instructed to pursue trading bank business actively. The Bank also received additional specialised trading departments. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation was opposed bitterly and a constitutional challenge by the Melbourne City Council resulted in Section 48 of the Banking Act being declared invalid. The provision made it illegal for private banks to conduct business for a State or State Authority, including Local Government Authorities, without Australian Treasury approval. This apparently motivated Mr. Chifley into full bank nationalisation in 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as we all know, the conservative High Court accepted Sir Garfield Barwick's reasoning and section 92 of the Constitution was held to invalidate the legislation. Given current judicial interpretation a different decision would probably now prevail. </PARA>
<PARA>In March 1950 the new Government honoured its election promise and introduced legislation to repeal the nationalisation legislation and reintroduced a Bank Board. The Labor controlled Senate blocked the legislation and a double dissolution ensued. Menzies won control of both Houses and in 1951 the legislation passed. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1952 the Board restructured its General Banking Department along the lines of private trading banks and issued comparable financial statements. It also voluntarily complied with the Special Account reserve deposits. </PARA>
<PARA>Further concessions were made to the private banks by the Menzies Government in 1953 and 1959. In 1953 the Commonwealth Trading Bank was created out of the General Banking Division and was subjected to income tax to level the playing field with the private banks. The new Trading Bank was also subjected to the same regulation as the private banks. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1956 the amalgamation agreement with the Western Australian Government was terminated and the State Government established a Savings Bank Division of its Rural and Industries Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The major reform of the period was the 1959 legislation which formally split the Commonwealth Bank's major functions by separating the trading and central banking operations. A previous Bill had been stalled by the Senate until the 1958 elections. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth (Central) Bank, the Note Issue Department and the Rural Credits Department, were transformed into the Reserve Bank of Australia. All the commercial and savings bank subsidiaries were removed except for the Rural Credit Department which only provided finance to (mainly government) marketing authorities. The Statutory Reserve Deposit scheme also replaced the special account requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>The trading section of the Bank was also restructured. The existing Savings Bank and Trading Bank were joined by the new Commonwealth Development Bank (CDB) which was created by merging the Mortgage Bank and the Industrial Finance Departments. These were all parts of the new Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Since January 14th, 1960 these three banks have carried on business as separate legal and accounting entities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Trading Bank joined with the Reserve Bank and the private trading banks in 1964 to form the Australian Banks' Export Re-Finance Corporation Limited (ABERC). In 1967 a similar arrangement was concluded for the commencement of the Australian Resources Development Bank to foster the development of Australia's natural resources. ABERC was taken over by the Resources Bank in 1980. The CTB was also a founding shareholder in the newly established Primary Industry Bank of Australasia (PIBA) and the Development Bank has a special relationship with PIBA. </PARA>
<PARA>CSB and CTB also jointly started a finance company (CBFC), a travel company and a property company. </PARA>
<PARA>In March 1969 the Corporation became the first Australian banking organisation to introduce `on-line' computer processing of savings bank transactions. The Trading Bank was also a founding shareholder in the Merchant Bank and the Australian European Finance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1984 the Commonwealth Banks were restructured into a structure similar to the private banking groups. The Commonwealth Trading Bank reverted to the original name of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. A $15 million capital injection was provided by the Government and some of the reserves of the Development Bank were transferred to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The Savings Bank became a subsidiary of the Trading Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements requiring half of the after-tax profits of Trading Bank and half of the profits of the Savings Bank be paid to the Commonwealth were repealed and replaced with dividend arrangements. The Savings Bank and the Development Bank were subjected to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 the Development Bank's charter was broadened to allow it to provide finance for all business purposes and to provide equity finance. This was accompanied by the removal of interest rate ceilings on loans under $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>A further restructuring of the Commonwealth Banks occurred in 1988 when the charter of the Savings Bank and the CBA were expanded in the areas of banking, insurance and investment. A dividend requirement was also instituted for the Development Bank. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The takeover of the State Bank of Victoria is part of the restructuring and, indeed, the continuing evolution of the bank. The State Banks of Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales have already contributed to a stronger Commonwealth Bank, and certainly the State Bank of my own State will do so if this legislation becomes law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there are certain aspects of the Bill which are matters for concern, and there are certain matters which the Australian Democrats will oppose. One matter of concern is the compensation to my State of Victoria for its loss of the revenue stream which the State Bank would have provided to State revenue. The Bill appropriates an amount not in excess of $243m for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Kevin Davis of the University of Melbourne has pointed out that this amount of compensation grossly undervalues the stream of tax currently received by the Victoria Government. The present value of any annuity paid in perpetuity can be established by dividing the annual value of the annuity by the real rate of interest which applies during the period. Hence, if tax was paid at the rate of $80m per annum, and the real rate of interest was 5 per cent, the present value of such an income stream would be $1.6 billion. Clearly, the compensation of $243m is grossly inadequate. Admittedly, even a solid government guaranteed profit earner like the State Bank does not carry quite the certainty of an annuity, but even if one cuts the present value in half, fair compensation would still amount to approximately $800m. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter is the method used to finance the purchase of the State Bank. We are totally opposed to the decision to issue shares to private and foreign investors. This legislation purports to guarantee government majority control of the Commonwealth Bank group, and that the subsidiaries of the Commonwealth Bank will remain 100 per cent owned. However, to be fully effective the people's bank must remain in full government ownership. If private equity were necessary, then an employee share ownership scheme and subscriptions from superannuation funds would be the preferable means of raising funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The sell-out contemplated is simply not necessary, in our view. There are other forms of finance which could be and should be employed. The Federal Government could dip into some of the hollow logs which its authorities have accumulated in recent years, just as it has forced the State governments to do in recent years. As an example, I refer to the $500m transferred from the earnings of the Reserve Bank of Australia under section 78 of the Reserve Bank Act in the last financial year. The combined reserves representing provisions for the effects of movements in market yields and in exchange rates stood at over $1.8 billion at 30 June 1990. The total call on these provisions during the last financial year was $200m, so there was a net addition during that year alone of $300m. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is clear that it is prudent to have a strong central bank, it is also clear that section 78 provides a perfect opportunity to park surplus funds which would otherwise revert to the Commonwealth for a rainy day. Such a rainy day has arrived. One of the greatest public assets in the country is threatened with partial privatisation. This strategy was adopted to influence the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to authorise the privatisation and deregulation agenda of the Cabinet in this and other areas. That purpose has now been served and the fate of the Commonwealth Bank should be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could raise additional revenue to pay for the purchase. Indeed, there are many possibilities. Our alternative budget lists over 20 options. Ending the section 128F withholding tax exemption, and raising the withholding tax rate on payments of interest to residents in countries which do not have double taxation agreements with Australia alone, would provide the revenue needed within a couple of years. A 40 per cent excise increase on tobacco and alcohol would raise in real terms $1.1 billion. Apart from the health benefits which would result, in real terms a cigarette is now considerably cheaper than it was in 1949, when a single cigarette cost 16 cents, compared with 10.5 cents in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, the Government could simply apply some of the existing surplus, as Mr John Carson explained in an excellent letter which appeared on page 14 of the Australian Financial Review on 2 September 1990. The letter points out that the surplus will be spent in repaying debt. However, at the current rate of debt repayment there will be no Commonwealth debt in existence after three or four years. After that, the Government must buy assets with the surplus. What a fantastic opportunity to build the kind of facility and infrastructure this country needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Government should keep the Commonwealth Bank as a good investment, if for no other reason. But there are, of course, several other reasons which I will go into later. In terms of investment, if one looks at the last two years one sees returns of between 13 per cent and 14.6 per cent on average equity. An investment carrying that sort of return, backed by government guarantee, must be an investment that Australian taxpayers and the Australian community should retain. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Carson also noted that asset sales and investments should not affect the Budget surplus. The only reason Australia treats such investment decisions as within the Budget is that we adopt the International Monetary Fund system of public accounts. The United Nations system of national accounts is the alternative measure. This system excludes assets sales and public investments; that is, it treats such transactions as capital transactions, which is of course what they are-they have no place in an income and expenditure statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development uses this system when comparing the fiscal policy of member countries. Indeed, Glen Milne, in an excellent article in the Australian of 30 August, pointed out that in November 1987 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) referred to the United Nations system as `the most respected basis of comparison for total government deficits'. The whole basis of the Government's crying poor in this regard simply arises because of the system of national accounts we use in Australia. Indeed, commentators always exclude asset sales when determining the real or underlying surplus or deficit which is predicted by a Budget. So basically this assertion that we cannot afford such assets being publicly owned is absolute ideological balderdash. Alan Kohler in the Sunday Age of August 1990 wrote on the takeover as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I'm a shareholder of both banks, so I've got a conflict of interest to declare. It means I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would love it if the Commonwealth Bank bought the State Bank, although I'm torn about the price: as an Australian I hope it gets it cheap, but as a Victorian I want it to pay through the nose.</PARA>
<PARA> But what I really oppose is a cheap dilution of my shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank to pay for it, and I wish Paul Keating would stop acting like a politician and think more like a shareholder's representative.</PARA>
<PARA>This comes from a self-confessed pro-privatisation journalist. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Hugh Stretton has also condemned the proposed dilution of public ownership. He points out that a fully public bank can be used to provide services which a private bank would not otherwise provide. In addition, apart from performing specific functions, publicly owned banks may also reduce the need for detailed regulation of the private institutions by being a force for implementing public policy and, indeed, by keeping them honest. The Commonwealth Bank could be used as an instrument of government policy to force certain behaviour from the private banks such as in the area of home interest rates, where the Commonwealth Bank is usually the first bank to drop and the last bank to increase rates. Mr Keating has recently been critical of the banks rather than the Government running monetary policy. Why then would the Government choose to partially privatise its own bank and give up an instrument of public policy? There is simply no consistency in that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it incredible that nobody has simply suggested the absolutely obvious option of financing the takeover by the Commonwealth Government, assuming the debt is to be retired by the State Government. Such an arrangement is not simply a bail-out of Victoria, but merely a sensible financing option of a major purchase. There is no doubt that the increased Commonwealth Bank group will be extremely profitable. Why not make the investment that Westpac Banking Corporation was prepared to make and repay the debt so incurred when the investment provides the return to do so? The issue of public, and indeed ALP policy, is at least as important. The sell-out by both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer is a betrayal of Labor Party history-they are, with this legislation, creating for themselves a position of infamy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson was reported in the press recently concerning the rapid loss of members which his Party is suffering. Is it any wonder, given decisions such as this, which are really implementing Liberal Party policy? Most significantly, the Government is in breach of the undertakings in the Caucus resolution of 28 August which sanctioned this legislation. At that conference the Treasurer obtained Caucus approval for the 30 per cent sale of Commonwealth Bank shares only on the condition that no further privatisation and no sales to foreign interests took place. </PARA>
<PARA> However, both undertakings can be circumvented by the government of the day through loopholes in the legislation as it now stands. Ostensibly, the sale to foreign interests is prohibited by proposed new section 27k. However, subsection (11) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of shares is not affected by the fact that the application for the issue was made in contravention of this section. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, under subsection (4), regulations could be enacted to provide for exceptions or modifications, as the Government decides. Finally, proceedings for an offence under this section could not be instituted without the consent of the Treasurer in writing. Also, the sale to private interests beyond 30 per cent is ostensibly prohibited by proposed new section 27l. However, the issue of non-voting shares is not prohibited. This could be used to increase private shareholdings. Most importantly, subsection (5) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> A contravention of this section does not affect the validity of any act or transaction involved in the contravention. </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, contravention of the section is not made an offence and there is no provision for anyone to have standing to challenge any breach of the provisions by the Government or the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if a contravention could be accidental; it must be by way of a deliberate action. Either the Commonwealth must transfer some existing shares or the bank must issue some shares or the voting rights attached to existing shares must be altered. Clearly, this must be a deliberate act. This provision, therefore, envisages that deliberate acts in contravention of this legislation and the undertakings that the Government made to its Caucus can be circumvented at will. A further proviso is found in point 13 of the Caucus resolution. This states that non-government equity will not be introduced to the subsidiaries of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 36 proposes to insert new section 74a into the principal Act. Subsections (11) and (12) of the section ensure that the Development Bank will remain a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. This is essentially the same as the provisions providing for retention of the Savings Bank as a 100 per cent subsidiary. However, what about the Commonwealth Investments New Zealand Ltd group, the Commonwealth Bank Finance Co. group, the Travel Service group and the life insurance business of the group. Clearly the legislation contravenes, or at least does not implement, this part of the Caucus resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting effect of the legislation concerns the restructuring of the board of the Commonwealth Bank. Clause 9 of the Bill inserts many new provisions into part II of the principal Act. Proposed new section 8a will grant to the Treasurer the power to appoint the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury to the board of the bank. Such an appointment is revocable without reference to this Parliament. However, what the explanatory memorandum does not say is that clause 18 of the Bill abolishes the current provisions determining the constitution of the board. These provisions state that the Treasury Secretary shall be a member of the board. Thus there is no requirement for the presence of the Treasury Secretary nor for any other representative with the specific responsibility for the public interest and the bank's community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> We see that this legislation does not even conform to the undertakings given to the parliamentary members of the Labor Party, let alone to the wishes of the Australian people. The Senate currently has a Bill before it for the membership of Australia in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Commonwealth Bank, as has been shown earlier in my remarks, has a proud history of assisting the development of this nation. How ironic it is that we are selling off part of our bank whilst at the same time contributing to an institution which will help to rebuild and modernise the ex-communist states of eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> However, before closing my remarks I would like to address the comments about this Bill made by the shadow Treasurer in the other place. We all know about his impressive performances lately. Mr Reith said that if the coalition is elected to government at the next election it will expect the support of the Australian Democrats in fully privatising the Commonwealth Bank. He stated that it would be undemocratic if we did not support his Party's privatisation policies. The Australian Democrats do not support privatisation of profitable government businesses. No apology is needed for that and none will be forthcoming, particularly not for a public utility with public policy and community service obligations-not that we need to deny our support to the coalition; the Government will in fact do it for the coalition parties and make it impossible for them to proceed. The London Times, hardly a left wing newspaper, on 30 August, 1987 reported:</PARA>
<PARA>Of all the plums waiting to be picked by the privateers, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the juiciest. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Opposition wish to enrich their stockbroking, banking and advertising mates and impoverish the national Government. They will not succeed and we will have the support of the people of Australia in stopping them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reith issued a press release on 13 November 1990 detailing the coalition's support for the Bill and the amendments it seeks to make. In brief, the amendments provide for 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and for its unrestricted sale to foreign interests. These amendments are purely ideological and they continue the Opposition's policy of selling off the farm-an Opposition attitude which, for Australia's sake, I trust will fail. Certainly, we will ensure that the coalition fails in its efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the Opposition the words of the founder of the Liberal Party. Shortly after introducing the 1952 Commonwealth Bank Bill, the then Prime Minister Menzies stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth is no more willing to damage the Commonwealth Bank than it is to damage the trading banks. I think there is abundant room for both. The Government is pledged to fair competition, not to destruction. I think that the public will agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA>Rest assured that the Australian Democrats will seek to ensure that no such vandalism will be allowed-either by the Opposition or by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the pressures of time upon this Senate because of the application of the guillotine process and the fact that the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990 has been referred to the appropriate legislation committee, I will indeed be brief in speaking to it. Regrettably, this important measure was shunted through the House of Representatives in a mere 90 minutes. As my colleague Senator Short has indicated, the coalition will be putting forward several important amendments to this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several aspects to this deal between the Federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, and the Victorian Premier, Mrs Kirner, to sell off the State Bank of Victoria (SBV) to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) that do require critical comment. Firstly, on a large number of occasions the Treasurer, Mr Keating, has publicly spoken against privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and other government owned businesses. However, when it comes to a politically opportune moment to dabble in a bit of privatisation and thus save a State Labor government from complete disaster, the rules are changed, and thus we are here debating the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill-a Bill which perhaps could be more aptly called the Commonwealth Bank (Part-Privatisation) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not oppose the Commonwealth Bank paying a market price for the Victorian State Bank, I do object to the use of Australian taxpayers' funds, under the stewardship of the Federal Treasury, to supply $430m to the State of Victoria. I thus disagree with the basis of compensation not reflecting the current earnings performance of the bank and its subsidiaries, which currently reflects loss situations. The compensation, therefore, is overgenerous. It does not reflect the current trading or financial position of the bank and its current ability-or should I say inability-to contribute to State revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has used taxpayers' funds, in the words of the Commonwealth Government, to `restructure and expand the activities of the Commonwealth Bank'. It is a grand socialist objective, partly at taxpayers' expense. I believe that is objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not privy to the details of the tendering process which was undertaken by the Victorian Government in determining the new owners of the State Bank. However, most people would be aware that the Westpac Banking Corporation, the other official contender, made an initial proposal that was $55m higher than the $1.6 billion value placed on the bank by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The Commonwealth-the Commonwealth Government, mind you, not the Commonwealth Bank-then sweetened the deal by providing extra compensation for forgone tax revenue, a figure inflated by the difference between the Federal tax returns from the CBA and Victorian rates. </PARA>
<PARA> There was then a further $170m to reflect the tax losses of the Savings Bank of Victoria arising from Tricontinental Corporation Ltd, since those should not be used in future tax deductibility, given the commercial problems in utilising such tax losses. Because of the application of the tax business test for the takeover by another institution, I would contend that this $170m calculation is indeed a generous allocation of taxpayers' funds. In a normal situation such losses would have been amortised over a long period and hence this figure, I believe, should have been further discounted for the time value of money. I would suggest that the market value of the SBV should have been the basis for determining its purchase price to the Commonwealth Bank. If Westpac was not willing to compensate the State of Victoria for its tax revenue losses, nor should the Commonwealth have been. Such a move is a market distortion which was made purely for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst part privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank will pay for the purchase price of $1.6 billion, taxpayers will have to pay the additional $433m promised by Mr Keating. As a taxpayer, I object to this. The decision was also an interesting one in light of the decision made by the Treasurer only a couple of weeks prior to the SBV takeover announcement. I am of course referring to the Treasurer's decision to disallow the merger of the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria will make the Commonwealth Bank the dominant player in the domestic banking market, holding $1 in every $4 deposited. In Victoria the combined bank will control 33 per cent of the market, with a branch network of nearly 800 outlets. This takeover produces more market combination than the ANZ-National Mutual would have created. This would appear to be a case of double standards and certainly a conflict of interest on the part of the Treasurer, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> Having thus had the takeover of the State Bank of Victoria by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia virtually decreed upon us, we now have the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill before us today for debate. The Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill is to put into effect the Commonwealth Government's decision for the Commonwealth Bank to purchase the State Bank of Victoria for $1.6 billion, to be paid for by the sale of 30 per cent of the share capital of the resulting enlarged Commonwealth Banking Corporation. While not reflecting at all on the current management of the Commonwealth Bank, this whole concept of privatisation should be designed to get business enterprises out of the hands of government and into the hands of people in business who have a real motive and interest to promote efficiency and better administration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, this is a messy partial privatisation which will not result in all these privatisation objectives being fully achieved. Some of the flaws in this legislation which will prevent the objectives being met have already been brought to the attention of this chamber, but I wish to reiterate a few of them: firstly, the Commonwealth Government is to maintain majority ownership and control of the Commonwealth Bank in perpetuity; secondly, a limit of 30 per cent private ownership is proposed by this legislation; thirdly, other banks, including foreign banks, will not be permitted to acquire original shares in the merged bank; and, fourthly, individual shareholders will be limited to a five per cent interest. Such requirements are not typical of banks operating in the real world-they are artificial and messy-nor should they be adopted in this legislation or by the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration I raised with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) the need for an aide-memoire as to the Government's use of the reserve powers to intervene in matters outside board structure issues, including changes and amendments to the corporate plan. On the other hand, the Government has perhaps lost an opportunity on this occasion of the restructuring of the Commonwealth Bank to widen the charter of the operations of the bank to allow it to compete with other banks for the collection of savings within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the new role of superannuation as a vehicle for diverting savings, such as industry superannuation schemes, much of the traditional role of savings and trading banks will now decline and will be redirected to superannuation funds. I must admit to being of the opinion expressed by Des Keegan in his column of 25 July, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Why not let the Victorian Government sell the crippled State Bank off for what it is worth? Then, why not sell the sound Commonwealth Bank off for what it is worth?</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's philosophy supports this Bill. Despite the fact that it is based on partial privatisation, it is certainly a step on the very long road to complete privatisation. It is not complete privatisation; I reiterate that in this case the privatisation is only partial. It is also messy. Despite these reservations, with our amendments the coalition supports the legislation. </PARA>

They have seen the past, and it does not work. I will also comment on other aspects raised by Senator Spindler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I agreed with him on one aspect: this is a very important and historic piece of legislation for a number of reasons. By bringing this legislation before the Senate, the Hawke-Keating Government has in effect dumped Labor's philosophy, platform and election promises. As Senator Watson pointed out, this is a small step for privatisation. To paraphrase Commander Armstrong's comments, this is indeed a small step for privatisation but it is a mighty step for Labor. With this Bill, Labor has conceded that the privatisation approach of economic management advocated by the coalition is the way ahead. If one likes to use a Labor Party analogy, it is the light on the hill. It is certainly not, however, the light on the hill that was spotted by Ben Chifley. It is certainly not the light on the hill to which Mrs McLean, a delegate to the recent Australian Labor Party special conference, referred when she called Mr Hawke `Comrade Bob' and quoted the words he spouted during his now notorious Chifley speech in September 1987, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas? As the people of Australia come to realise the extent of the economic and social vandalism proposed by our opponents-</PARA>
<PARA>the vandalism he was talking about was the selling off of the Commonwealth Bank and Australian Airlines Ltd-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will be necessary for us, Ben Chifley's great heirs and successors, to keep fresh and green the memory, the example and experience of this great Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Comrade Bob Hawke in 1987. By bringing this Bill before the Parliament the Government has conceded the pathetic nonsense its own Prime Minister spouted just three years ago. Of course, the Labor Government went to the last election making promises such as the one it made to the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, as my colleagues mentioned, that the Commonwealth Bank would not be privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hindmarsh, Mr John Scott, at least had the decency to stand up and defend what I believe is an outdated philosophy. Mr Scott happens to believe it, as do quite a number of people on the Labor benches, but not one of them will speak in the debate tonight.

Does he not remember the promises on child poverty, higher living standards, low interest rates, low taxation, no capital gains taxes and no extensions to the tax file number?

I bet Senator Maguire said that in the last election campaign. While they said that there would be no recession they were actually engineering one. What a great effort! Remember that Hawke promised to retire at the next election. I suspect that Mr Keating believed that promise. The broken promises of the Labor Government are endless. Despite its importance, the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill was debated for only an hour and a half in the other place. As a result of the deal done by the Australian Democrats, we are allowed to debate the Bill in this chamber for only three hours. That is only four and a half hours in total for the Commonwealth Parliament to consider one of the biggest deals in Australian corporate history, worth about $1.6 billion, and to consider a number of important related issues such as the tendering process for the State Bank of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short pointed out, after this deal goes through it will be the biggest bank in Australia. This Bill, together with the Government's proposals on Qantas, Australian Airlines Ltd and Aussat, represents the first major privatisation package brought into the Parliament by the Labor Government. With this Bill the Government has failed to carry through effectively the management and ownership philosophy it has recently adopted. Senator Spindler is right in saying that the coalition's policy is in favour of 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. Nevertheless, this legislation represents a step forward from the reactionary approach to management which has dominated this Government virtually from the day of its inception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some 80 countries around the world have carried out privatisation activities. They have carried them out for the simple reason that it is a method of providing better services to customers and better deals for employees. Only the Australian Democrats now wear ideological blinkers on privatisation. The Australian Democrats must be one of the few parties in the Western world, Eastern world and Third World which resolutely oppose every measure of privatisation. Is it possible for a Democrat at some stage to stand up in this Parliament and tell us whether we can privatise anything? Can we contract out government cleaning services? The ideological blinkers Senator Spindler wears when he comes into this place and discusses privatisation are unbelievable. </PARA>

The Labor Party, as must be expected from a party which has dumped its history and not discovered any new coherent philosophy or principles, finds it difficult to come up with a privatisation approach which is consistent and logical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill represents a desperate attempt by the Labor Party to adopt a more rational economic structure while at the same time placating the Labor Party's left wing. Somehow it is appropriate to fully privatise Australian Airlines Ltd and Aussat Pty Ltd, but only 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. Therefore, the coalition believes in many ways that while this legislation heads in the right direction it still does not go far enough and, to that extent, it is poor legislation. As has been flagged, we shall be moving some amendments which will help to improve this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> From the ALP's point of view, there are very good reasons to guillotine this Bill through Parliament. The Labor Party is hopelessly divided on this issue and on this legislation. The Government has forced this legislation through its party room for one reason and one reason alone--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should point out to Senator Macdonald that Senator Spindler belongs to the Australia Democrats, not the Labor Party. In view of the way the Democrats voted in the last three days, we find it hard to believe on this side; nonetheless, that happens to be the case. The Government has been able to force this legislation through its party room for one reason and one reason alone: so that the Government can bail out the State Bank of Victoria which, in effect, has been destroyed by the disgraceful management of the Cain-Kirner Labor governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, Senator Button breathes a sigh of relief that no Government senators will be speaking on this Bill. By bringing this Bill into Parliament, the Treasurer may have earned the undying enmities of his left wing colleagues and his branch members. Nonetheless, by making what in Labor Party terms is a huge concession to a different philosophical approach, can we now hope for a more rational basis for economic management of public enterprises in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> No longer will the Labor Party be able to indulge in privatisation scare tactics. Is Senator Maguire going to go out in the next election campaign and say, `Be careful. The Liberal Party is going to start privatising government assets. We have already privatised 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. The percentage of ownership by the private sector may rise still further'. So it will go on. After four or five years of these disgraceful tactics, we are happy to note the concession which has been made by bringing this Bill into this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I look forward to voting with Senators Bolkus, Cook, Beahan, Zakharov and other members of the Labor Party Left when this Bill comes to the final vote. It will be a great pleasure to vote with Government members but in a sense their hearts and minds will be crossing over to the other side of us. I will conclude there. This is an important and historic day. It is a great pity that this chamber has not had a proper chance to debate the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> The Democrats believe that to privatise any part of the bank is essentially the thin end of the wedge. These amendments seek to ensure that the 30 per cent privatisation which the Government seeks to enact in this Bill is not possible and that no foreign interests are able to purchase any shares in the Commonwealth Bank either at original issue or later at any stage. As well, the amendments seek to ensure that the Treasury Secretary at all times remains a member of the board and that there are no shares issued which carry differential voting rights. The whole range of amendments 1 to 7 of alternative A in summary seeks to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank remains a people's bank. </PARA>

<PARA>(1) Clause 12, page 4, proposed subsection 8a (1), lines 25 to 27, omit the subsection. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Clause 12, page 4, proposed subsection 8a (2), line 28, omit ``While a determination under subsection (1) is in force,''. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Clause 22, pages 10 and 11, proposed section 27k (3), (4), (10) and (11), lines 30 to 36 (page 10) and lines 13 to 16 (page 11), omit the subsections. </PARA>
<PARA>(4) Clause 22, page 11, proposed paragraphs 27l (2) (a) and (b), lines 27 to 33, omit the paragraphs, substitute the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(a) that the Commonwealth no longer holds shares in the Commonwealth Bank that carry the rights to exercise 70% of the rights attached to the shares in the Commonwealth Bank;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the Commonwealth no longer controls the exercise of 70% of the rights attached to the shares in the Commonwealth Bank.''. </PARA>
<PARA>(5) Clause 22, page 11, after proposed subsection 27l (2), insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(2a) In subsection (2), `rights' includes voting rights, the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the Commonwealth Bank to its shareholders on winding-up and the total rights to distributions of capital or profits of the Commonwealth Bank to its shareholders otherwise than on winding-up.''. </PARA>
<PARA>(6) Clause 22, page 12, proposed subsection 27l (5), lines 4 and 5, omit the subsection, substitute the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(5) Any act or transaction in contravention of this section is void.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have mentioned before, these amendments seek to ensure that the Government's commitment to its own Caucus is kept. The first two amendments seek to ensure that the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury remains a member of the Commonwealth Bank board. The amendment that the Government has moved seeks to give the Treasurer of the day the power to remove the Secretary to the Treasury from that particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, it is essential to have the Secretary to the Treasury a member of the board. We believe that the Commonwealth Bank has a public policy role as well as a role to provide community services. We believe that the Secretary to the Treasury should be there to ensure that that role is performed. We would be even more pleased if we had representatives on that board who were members of the community, charged with the duty of protecting the interests of consumers. However, with this amendment, we are moving to ensure that the Secretary to the Treasury remains a member of the board but not at the will of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 3 deals with clause 22 and proposed section 27k. This section seeks to ensure that no shares are issued to foreign interests. There are four clauses which we shall seek to remove by these amendments. In the first instance, proposed subsection (3), as submitted by the Government, seeks to interpose a discretionary trust or similar structure which, in turn, would be able to have up to 40 per cent of foreign interests amongst its shareholders. We believe that that is an open invitation to contravene the commitment that no foreign interests may take up shares in the Commonwealth Bank. Just to make sure, proposed subsection (4) says that exceptions or modifications to the prohibition to have shares held by foreign interests may be made by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee sittings, the Minister admitted that there were ambiguities in the legislation. When he was challenged by me to remove those ambiguities by agreeing to the amendments that the Democrats were moving the answer was, `We can fix that by regulations; we do not have to put it into the legislation'. What we have here is an open sesame, carte blanche to the Government to use regulations to ensure that the undertakings the Government, through the Treasurer (Mr Keating), has made to its own Caucus can be overridden. Proposed subsection (10) is another feature of the Government's plan to ensure that these commitments need not be kept. The proceedings for an offence against this proposed section can only be instituted with the consent in writing of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a position here where the Treasurer is the most likely person to be involved in a contravention of the section. Yet his approval in writing must be available before any proceedings can be taken for an offence against this section. Finally, the Government must have instructed the draftsmen to make absolutely sure that it had a completely free hand in selling shares to foreign interests. Subsection (11) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of shares is not affected by the fact that the application for the issue was made in contravention of this section. </PARA>
<PARA>If one takes those four sections together, it is clear that the Government has no intention of keeping its commitment not to issue shares to foreign interests either immediately or later. </PARA>
<PARA> While at first I was prepared to give the Treasurer the benefit of the doubt, and suggested that it may have been a drafting mistake and that it left the way open for the Government to make its provisions watertight to ensure that commitments would be met, we now have no choice but to assume that the Government all along wanted to make sure that it did not have to keep its own commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to amendment No. 4, which deals with clause 22, page 11. It seeks to ensure that by changing the wording the Government in fact will sell no more than 30 per cent of the shares of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 5, dealing with clause 22, subsection 27l (2), seeks to remove one other possibility: to weaken the shareholding still held by the Government in the Commonwealth Bank by removing the possibility of issuing shares without voting rights. It might be argued that there is no harm in issuing shares without voting rights because they have no power over decisions made by the board. However, it is clear that even non-voting shares have a financial interest in the level of dividend and in the level of loans taken up. It is also clear that people holding such shares would use their influence to ensure that they can affect the direction of the bank and the decisions made by the board. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 6, dealing with clause 22, page 12, proposed new subsection (5), seeks to ensure that there is a let-out if the Government decides that it does not wish to comply with the requirement not to sell shares beyond 30 per cent. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(5) Any act or transaction in contravention of this section is void. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply plain English. We have met with various arguments about these provisions, saying that they need to cater for various issues of shares that may be made in lieu of profit pay-outs or some other issue of shares with or without rights, but it seems to us that in the first instance we are entitled to look at the plain words of a section. If it says, `Any act or transaction in contravention of this section is void', that is plain language. If, however, it says, `Any contravention of this section does not affect the validity of any act or transaction involved in the contravention', it is also clear that such action can be taken, and that the Government hopes to retain the possibility of taking such action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe the evidence is on the table: the Government was not interested in making this legislation watertight to meet the commitments that it made to its Caucus. We believe we should try to keep the Government honest and at least put these amendments on the table. We do not have much hope that the Government will support them. We know that the Opposition wants to privatise the bank 100 per cent and sell it to foreign interests--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wishes to have a division on each of the three. In the Labor Caucus's resolution of 28 August which related to the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990, with which we are now dealing, and which gave authority for that Bill to proceed, there was included the following decision:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The caucus unequivocally rejects proposals to remove Government control of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and to privatise the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>It also included the following:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Government introduce to the Parliament legislation requiring majority government ownership and control of the Commonwealth Bank in perpetuity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has abided by this decision. It can be found in clause 22 of the Bill. The proposed new section 27L of the principal Act, the Commonwealth Banks Act, states that the proportion of voting shares to be held in aggregate by persons other than the Commonwealth will be limited to 30 per cent. In addition, the Commonwealth will be prohibited from selling any of its shares in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious from the debate earlier this evening that this clause is quite contrary to the policy of the Liberal and National parties of a 100 per cent privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. It has obviously been put in this legislation to appease the wishes of those in Caucus who consider that, even if, or when, the coalition wins government in the future, we may not gain control of the Senate and therefore would be unable to change the legislation to allow the sale of the remaining 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The future, of course, will test the validity of that argument. I do not accept that argument because there is no doubt that after the next election there is every possibility-probability, I would hope-that the Liberal and National parties will control not only the House of Representatives but also the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether it does or whether it does not, I think Senator Powell will be fairly irrelevant because, given the performance that she and her Party have put on in recent days, particularly its disgraceful support of the Government this morning in terms of the guillotine, I think she will be but distant history after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those reasons we have very strong objections to the existing clause 22 and, in particular, to proposed new sections 27k and 27l of the Bill. In my third amendment, we also have an objection to the proposition that foreigners will be prohibited from subscribing to the first public issue of shares in the Commonwealth Bank. We disagree with that proposal. The disallowance of foreigners purchasing shares in the initial sale will more than likely distort the value of shares, keeping them lower, of course, than would be the case if foreigners were permitted access in the initial subscription. It will also open up the potential for staggering gains to original purchasers when they on-sell to a deeper market which does include foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA> That just does not make any sense at all to us, because it means that the public purse will be the loser as a result of the restriction imposed on foreign applications in the first instance. It makes no sense at all to say that foreigners will be prohibited in the initial float but that they will be allowed then to acquire shares that are on-sold by those who are lucky enough to get shares out of the initial float. So we are opposed to that proposition. We are also opposed to the section of clause 22 which-again reflecting the Caucus resolution-contains the provision that individual shareholdings in the bank should be limited to 5 per cent. That is reflected in the Bill and, more particularly, in the schedule to clause 62. But I raise it here because I think that it has relevance in this context as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for this proposition is not clear when it is considered that the rules pertaining to other banks under the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 stipulates tests of 10 per cent and 15 per cent. In other words, the existing Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 stipulates that ownership by foreign investors of up to 10 per cent is permitted, that in excess of 10 per cent but less than 15 per cent requires approval from the Treasurer unless it is contrary to the national interest, and that ownership in excess of 15 per cent can proceed only as long as the Treasurer is satisfied that it would be in the national interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has expressed the view that its motive for having this provision is that only 30 per cent of the bank will be up for sale, so adherence to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act would open the potential for just two or three big institutional purchasers, if the 10 to 15 per cent rules of that Act applied. Whilst I understand that point, because we are opposed to the 30 per cent limitation of private ownership that is the essence of the Bill, we therefore oppose also the clause which is contrary to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act, which applies to all other banks. We believe that the Commonwealth Bank should be no exception. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, therefore, I intend to move on behalf of the coalition the amendments that have been circulated in my name. As I said, amendments (4) to (9) are consequential on the amendment in relation to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act. In effect, the coalition will not be pressing a vote on amendments (4) to (9) because, I think, they will in effect fall out from the votes on amendments (1), (2) and (3). I formally move:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Clause 22, page 10, proposed heading to Division 3, line 18, omit the heading, substitute the following heading:</PARA>
<PARA>``Division 3-Issue etc. of Shares in Commonwealth Bank''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now witnessing the Opposition complaining that the Government's provisions and amendments are too watertight. What the Opposition would like to do is to make sure that all of the Commonwealth Bank can be sold, and it does not care a tinker's cuss if it is sold to foreigners. If the people's bank falls into foreign hands, that is just fine by the Opposition as long as sufficient money is being paid for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does not care about the values that the Commonwealth Bank represents. It does not care about the public policy objectives, the community service obligations, or about the fact that currently the bank is owned by every Australian. That does not concern the Opposition one bit. It is impossible to express the disgust that one feels at this position that the Opposition is taking. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it; on this particular issue we have the Opposition, as well as the Australian Labor Party Government, making common cause. We have seen that here more often than not in the last few weeks, when we have seen the ideology which says that the free should decide what our values are; the free market should decide where this nation is going, what the direction should be, and what the aspirations of Australians should be. That seems to be what is now governing the actions of the Opposition as well as of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Both parties, I believe, have abdicated their responsibilities for their function, which is to implement the aspirations of the Australian people. I do not believe that the aspirations of the Australian people are the bottom line of the balance sheet. I believe they lie in a combination of concern for the environment, concern for social justice, and a future for our children that is better than we have now. That is the sort of future that we will not get if we simply abdicate our responsibility, sit down, put our hands to our sides and do nothing and leave it all to the market. As long as the Australian Democrats are here, we will be voting against such attempts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to enter into a lengthy debate with Senator Spindler at this stage of the night, but I cannot let him get away with the misrepresentation that he has just made of the Opposition's position. He said that the Opposition would happily let the Commonwealth Bank of Australia fall into the hands of foreign ownership and control, or the hands of foreigners. That is quite patently not the Opposition's position. The Opposition's position is that the Commonwealth Bank should be treated in no different a way from the other major banks-the Westpac Banking Corporation, the National Australia Bank Ltd, and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd-and in relation to foreign shareholdings in those banks, there are very strict provisions applying in the form of the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 that I have just been debating. There is the 10 and 15 per cent rule that Senator Spindler knows as well as I applies and which imposes very rigid restrictions on foreign investment in banks in Australia. It is simply a gross distortion and misrepresentation. I am very surprised that Senator Spindler would attempt to pull that one; to suggest that we are advocating a carte blanche for foreign investment in the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat: in our view there is no reason why the Commonwealth Bank should be treated any differently from the other major banks in Australia at the moment. Senator Spindler does not agree with that. He is so jingoistic that he does not see any virtue in foreign ownership or foreign investment in Australia at all. If he takes that attitude, then he has a problem, but he should not come in here and try to misrepresent deliberately the position of the Opposition. </PARA>

Senator Short rises in high dudgeon saying that his position has been misrepresented. There have been a lot of misrepresentations going on between the two senators tonight.

<PARA> Senator Short is right in saying that under his amendment to the relevant foreign takeovers legislation, a foreigner could buy a 10 per cent or 15 per cent share of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as is the position with private banks.

Here we have a shadow Treasurer, a hobgoblin of such frightening countenance that, if he were ever in government, he might allow the military bank of Iraq to take a 10 or 15 per cent share in the Commonwealth Bank in a fit of aberration. That is a horrifying thought which Senator Short did not advert to as a possibility, but has to concede-I do not want to be tautologist-as a possibility. No doubt he would deny, in all confidence, the possibility of Mr Reith having a moment of aberration. But the point remains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy of the Government in respect of the Commonwealth Bank has been spelt out again and again-in the second reading speech, when we dealt with this matter in committee, and so on.

I do not want to follow the Australian Democrats down to the shed at the bottom of the garden, which is something nasty in their imaginings, but the fact of the matter is that Australian institutions will get first go at a share in the Commonwealth Bank.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think perhaps Senator Powell does not understand the policy of the legislation-it is to sell 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank so that it will become a bigger bank. The Commonwealth has only 8 per cent of retail banking in the State of Victoria and will get a substantial extra slice of the retail banking business. The Commonwealth Bank will be a much stronger bank as a result of this transaction. None of those naughty private shareholders will influence the capacity of the bank to comply with its charter which is in the legislation now and will remain in the legislation. None of those naughty foreigners, the bogeyman in the Democrats' shed at the bottom of the garden, will be able to influence the policy of a great Australian institution. That is why the legislation is couched this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this lot opposite got into power, we might have a different situation. Looking at the last few years, who could say with confidence that we want a great institution like the Commonwealth Bank to behave like Elders-IXL or some of the private sector banks have done?

<PARA> I am further confused by the contribution of Senator Short. He expressed frustration that the Government's 30 per cent privatisation would not allow the full privatisation envisaged by the coalition parties if ever they achieved government. He then accused the Government's proposal of 30 per cent privatisation of being insufficient and an attempt to frustrate full privatisation. These things did not make any sense at all. One is a nonsense and the other one is a confusion about what the Government is trying to do. I cannot see any sense in sitting around listening to any more of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the second reading of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, I would point out that, as the Bill is subject to the guillotine, there has been an agreement between ourselves, the Australian Democrats and the Government to limit our speeches to 10 minutes for Senator Button, myself and Senator Spindler and five minutes for Senator Panizza in order that we may deal with the Bill in the 55 minutes allotted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to note that this Bill, which has been called urgent, grew from the report of Professor Helen Hughes and that, indeed, the Government had that report for 15 months before any legislation came forward. It is interesting that in May this year the Government introduced a Bill to extend the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme, as it then was, temporarily-or so it said-for five years. When the Opposition took singular exception to the concept of a five-year extension to the scheme, the Government agreed that it would be extended only until December 1990. But the Bill that is before us will be retrospective in effect to 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the history of the export market development grants scheme which was set up some 15 years ago. There have been five reviews of the scheme which have finally resulted in the situation we are presently in. Firstly, there was the report of the national export marketing strategy panel in 1985; secondly, in 1987 there was the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which dealt with the submissions from Austrade following an audit report; thirdly, in 1988 there was the Bureau of Industry Economics report; fourthly, there was a Price Waterhouse-commissioned assessment by Austrade and, finally, there was the report of the Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance. Prior to the 1987 Federal election, the Government led industry to believe that there would be no tampering with the scheme at all. Indeed, in June 1987 the then Minister for Trade, Mr John Dawkins, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have written to all recipients of EMDGs, that is the export market development grants scheme, assuring them that the Hawke Government regards the scheme as an integral part of Australia's export effort . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I have also assured them that we will not undermine that effort by chipping away at the spearhead of Australia's export drive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It did not take long for that promise to be broken because by May 1988 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), having given an assurance as well in 1987, had broken that promise and the changes were announced. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that occurred in 1988 were: exports to New Zealand were excluded from the scheme; an increase was made to the eligible expenditure threshold from $5,000 to $10,000 a year; the maximum grant payable was reduced to $150,000 and to $100,000 for those in receipt of a tenth or subsequent grant; and it was decided to treat affiliated companies as one unit in the assessment of the grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates committees, over a period of time, have found that estimates have always been inaccurate and that little research has been carried out on the likely effect on exporters from the changes to the scheme. No answers could be provided to questions on what percentage of grantees would be likely to be first year applicants, nor to the fundamental question of how many applicants would be exporters without the EMDG scheme. Surely those are fundamental questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the final spectacle-one that I do not think any of us will ever forget-occurred during the last election. That, of course, was the sight of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, huddled together with a group of journalists and television cameras, struggling to work out what the figures were and doing his sums on the back of an envelope. It was an occasion on which the Minister managed to alter his position no fewer than four separate times. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that we have a piece of legislation which we had to consider urgent because somehow the Government, in the 15 months that it had the Helen Hughes report in its possession, was unable to come up with any legislation to implement that scheme, I think just highlights the points that were made during the debate earlier today when we simply said that the reason that the guillotine is being applied and that we have 55 minutes in which to debate this Bill-bearing in mind that in the House of Representatives honourable members had only 40 minutes and were denied a committee stage and, accordingly, were unable to move any of their Committee of the Whole amendments-is that there has been simple mismanagement by the Government of its business. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, at the committee stage we will be moving two amendments which will be circulated in the course of the second reading debate. We will be moving amendments to effect a change which will result in small business people who are applying to the scheme for the first time being able to combine eligible expenditure which occurs in years one and two, if they see fit. This will give them the same advantage as occurs for people who are in the scheme in subsequent years to combine two years of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is quite interesting that I was informed that during the briefing given to the staff of our shadow Minister in this area, it was the understanding of the Government that this was provided for in clause 16a of the Bill. In fact, upon it being explained to it that it was not, I suspect that these amendments may be acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one other point in regard to those amendments. A drafting error appears on page 33 of the Bill, where a colon is in the wrong position and the words `the claimant' should be in a different position. Should the Government choose not to move an amendment to clear up that drafting error, I have amendments drafted that could, if necessary, take care of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in dealing with EMDGs, simply did not follow all the recommendations of the Hughes report. The Opposition's proposed amendments were recommended by the Hughes report. The question of the threshold and the Government's requirement that the first $15,000-worth of expenditure in any one year is not reimbursable were also deviations from the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, one can only say that the sorry plight of our export industry is compounded by the fact that the law in this area has remained uncertain. I repeat the history very quickly: the Government really forgot about the scheme and dealing with an extension of it properly. Although the Government had the report for some 15 months, it attempted, as I said, to introduce a temporary extension of five years but, after our rather loud cries of protest, agreed to make it temporary only to the end of this calendar year and then to introduce fresh legislation which would be retrospective to 1 July 1990. That is the situation we are now in-debating a Bill with some degree of urgency, according to the Government, but which we contend has simply been done because the Government has mismanaged the preparation of legislation, its drafting and its presentation into both chambers. That has resulted in the spectacle of this complicated area of law having in total only 95 minutes of debate between the two Houses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate tonight is discussing the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, which is to amend the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 on the basis, mainly, of recommendations from the Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed amendments were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Button in February this year in rather unusual and embarrassing circumstances. The amendments are made retrospective by the Bill to 1 July 1990 in accordance with the then announced commencement date. Earlier this year, the existing scheme was extended until the end of 1990. The Government said that this was to enable consultation with exporters in relation to the proposed changes. Despite these discussions, it appears from the legislation that the original recommendations remain substantially unchanged. It is obvious from the representations my office has received that a large number of exporters are not happy with the legislation, but the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) does not appear to see merit in their views. One reason for that might be that the Bill is also intended to be a cost-cutting measure, saving some $30m in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed revised scheme follows the main recommendations of the Hughes report to alter the targeting arrangements and to focus more on new exporters demonstrating a substantial commitment to export development. The Bill follows the recommendations of the Hughes Committee except for a few points. The main provisions of the Bill increase the minimum expenditure threshold from $10,000 to $30,000, with the first $15,000 being ineligible for a grant. This is the main provision to which the Australian Democrats are opposed. We believe that it is false economy to lift the thresholds, thereby depriving small exporters of achieving a foothold in the all-important export market. </PARA>
<PARA> My main amendment will be directed towards rectifying that by tapering that proposal of the Government. We believe that single firm exporters should remain at the threshold level of $10,000, but where consortia can be formed-and this is part of the provisions that we welcome in this amendment Bill-we believe the threshold should be $20,000. We welcome the various amendments in this Bill which target the funds better than was the case before; for instance, allowing firms to claim a nominal $200 per day as eligible expenditure for a maximum of 21 days for overseas visits in lieu of the openended expenditure on hotels, meals and entertainment which in some cases has been rorted. We believe it is a positive measure to increase the maximum payment from $200,000 to $250,000 and to extend the cut-off limit from $20m to $25m of export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> We also do not see a great many negative results in the measure to cut the rate of grant from 70 per cent to 50 per cent of eligible expenditure. We believe that indicates a true partnership between Government and the exporter. We believe that, if exporters mean what they say and are intent on expanding their export markets, they should be prepared to carry 50 per cent of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum of eight incentive payments-in other words, incentive payments over eight years-has been criticised by some exporters, but we will not oppose it strenuously, believing that eight years is a long enough time span for a company to develop its export trade, bearing in mind that it then has the possibility to enter the international trade enhancement scheme at the discretion of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a mixture of measures. While we believe it contains some positive ones, we are strongly opposed to the increase in the minimum expenditure threshold, which would keep some 350 companies currently eligible for the scheme out of it. The cost saving in that is not great, and we believe that the Government in this case is saving at the wrong end. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these facts were put clearly before the Opposition, it has refused to support my proposed amendments. I believe that is a very strange decision, particularly as Opposition members claim at every opportunity to support small business and profess concern for our poor export performance. The small business community will be disadvantaged by their lack of concern in this area. Indeed, a similar situation arose last year when the Opposition refused to support former Senator Haines's amendment to exempt most small businesses from the accelerated payment of company tax, which is currently causing problems in the community and which will really bite next July. Opposition senators should reflect on this and not maintain their opposition to my proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is supposed to be directed at the small to medium sized exporter. It seems that most of the amendments contained in this Bill will actually work against the small importer to some extent. In order to access the scheme, they will have to increase their levels of eligible expenditure or they will be forced to join consortia, approved trading houses or approved joint ventures. We believe the formation of consortia and joint ventures is not necessarily a negative trend, but it may disadvantage small companies that work in a geographical area where they find it difficult to access such consortia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this scheme grants are paid in respect of the prior year's expenditure. Payments under the new scheme will not commence until 1991-92, when it is expected that claims of around $134m will become payable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is estimated that the amendment to the scheme will save $31m in the 1991-92 financial year and $44m in the 1992-93 financial year. It must be asked why the Government is proposing to save money in respect of an export incentive scheme when the current account is and has been in crisis for years. The savings take into account the cost of the new discretionary scheme, the international trade enhancement scheme, of $31.3m for both the 1991-92 and 1992-93 financial years. The trade enhancement scheme is due to run for four years from 1 July 1990 and will be administered by Austrade. I hope that the scheme is a success and proves the worth of Government intervention to improve trade performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes to widen substantially the export market development grants scheme to include legal, health and other services to inbound tourist operators. We have no problems with this, although we are wary of institutions in the search for export dollars neglecting to provide these services to residents. Such concern is not limited to this scheme but relates to the general question of the export of health services. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop has referred to the amendment that she will be moving at the committee stage of the debate. The Australian Democrats will be supporting her amendment but we clearly see this as a bandaid measure and very much as a second best option. Indeed, one must say that, while the amendment will extend eligibility because it allows the entitlements to be added up over two years, it does not do the same for the actual grants to be paid and the high grant excess levels will remain. Thus, the actual payout to exporters will be very measly indeed under this amendment. We will be monitoring closely the operation of the Bill during the coming year. I foreshadow that in 12 months time it may be necessary to have another look at the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of government action in the field of trade is a complex and exceedingly political one. The horrendous debacle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions underlines the complexities and difficulties associated with world trade. We must not pursue the naive free trade direction of the 1980s in a unilateral fashion. Such schemes as the one we are dealing with tonight must be massively expanded unless the Europeans and Americans start to level the world playing field in their favour-and I am using the term `level' ironically. </PARA>
<PARA> I wait with great anticipation for Senator Button's forthcoming industry policy statement. I hope that sufficient attention will be paid in that statement to the massive growth industries of the 1990s, such as solar and other alternative energy technologies, waste management technologies and other environmentally friendly industries. As time does not permit me to extend this debate to a full discussion of the issues involved, I will conclude my remarks. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Geraldton, Carnarvon, Bunbury, Albany and some areas in South Australia are in the same position. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 is another piece of legislation by press release. As has already been pointed out this evening, the legislation was announced on the run by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Button on 28 February during the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A lot of problems have been created for companies because the announcement was made so far ahead and because amendments to the Act will be made retrospective to 1 July. Companies will need to work within the existing law. They will have to keep an eye on what the new law may be, be aware of the implications of original media release and then monitor any adjustments. The legislation puts them in quite a pickle-especially the smaller companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seems to punish success rather than reward it. The number of grants are to be limited to eight. The reality is that exporters have to compete every year. I know that they should be getting stronger every year so that they are able to continue to compete but, unfortunately, with the state of the economy at the moment, that is hard to do. The need to compete does not stop after eight grants have been allocated. Exporters have to continue to defend, to expand and to diversify their exports and markets. The limit of eight is seen as another blow to small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases exporters who have developed a market have lost their grants. This allows someone else to come in and capitalise on work that they have already done. The Bill will remove assistance from the initiator and assist a new Australian competitor. I believe that it is false economy to argue that the Act should apply only to newcomers. The Government seems slightly reluctant to acknowledge that a successful exporter may continue to require assistance in remote areas, such as the ones which I have already spoken about, because of certain logistic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) indicates that there was wide consultation with the industry, but what was said does not seem to have quite measured up. That view has been expressed to the Opposition and, no doubt, the Government. I believe that this development scheme is based on too narrow a perspective. We should have a wider look at other basic objectives, such as labour costs, work practices, waterfront inefficiencies and tax system problems. We know what problems there are with the tax system, especially with the new system under which, as I said the other day, two years of tax will have to be paid in seven months. Excessive regulations need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the continuing problem of inequitable tariffs around the world. I think everybody has probably heard about this and the lobbying that has occurred. For example, Australia has a 15 per cent basic tariff; developing countries, 10 per cent; Indonesia, 40 per cent; Thailand, 80 per cent; and Korea, 100 per cent. We cannot compete with that. It is critical that we take a much broader perspective and encourage our own manufacturers. I am especially interested in manufacturers who are based in remote areas. I believe that, because the Government has not done enough, we will be looking at this Bill again in 12 months time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not wrong; right. As far as the legislation itself is concerned, other senators have referred to the various inquiries into the scheme which have gone on for some time. This is a response to the committee of inquiry chaired by Professor Hughes. That committee of inquiry recommended the eight-year cut-off point. This is not intended to be a subsidy forever for importers. It is not an export subsidy; it is an export market development grant scheme. That is to say, it covers expenses and costs associated with the setting up of an export market. It is not an export subsidy. I think honourable senators should be clear about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the threshold is concerned, the view of most small businesses is that we have to spend this sort of money in this sort of legislation if we are going to establish an export market. One cannot really do it for less. The Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance recommended that certain trading houses or consortia of small businesses should be eligible under the international trade enhancement scheme for support in setting up new export markets. It is very difficult and perhaps wrong to encourage a very small firm into an export market on its own without some support from other firms operating in an export cluster or from a trading house or something of that kind. That has been very much the experience over a number of years. That is the essential purpose of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hughes Committee recommended a cut-off threshold of $50,000. The Government, after hearing representations of the kind that honourable senators have referred to, made it $30,000. I indicate now that I am quite happy to accept Senator Bishop's amendment. We will not divide about that. Her amendment relating to the punctuation or syntax is, I think, a good amendment.</PARA>

Subsequently, we also wish to amend the eligible expenditure levels to $10,000 and $15,000 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of these amendments, as I have said previously, is to make sure that small traders are given a go in developing their export markets. We are all very concerned to say nice words about small business, and in fact it employs some 80 per cent of our work force. The Democrats believe that we should give small business the opportunity to develop the export potential which undoubtedly they have, and we think it is wrong of the Government to try to put barriers in their way. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government should seriously consider these amendments. I do not believe that a large amount of money is involved.

<PARA> The Hughes Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance found that success in exporting is considerably enhanced if firms are willing to expend a reasonable amount of money. Professor Hughes found that currently less than 50 per cent of firms accessing export market development grant schemes survived to year three when the performance test cut in. It is also interesting to note that approximately 50 per cent of year one to year eight firms currently in the scheme incur less than $50,000 in eligible expenditure. The Opposition's amendment, rather than the Democrats', achieves the appropriate balance of supporting small business on the one hand and on the other encouraging firms to spend realistic amounts on export promotion to enhance their prospects of success. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of how much notice of this Bill was given, as I said in my second reading speech, when the Bill was introduced into the lower House only 40 minutes were made available for the debate of that Bill and no committee stage was allowed to proceed, so no amendments were able to be moved in the House of Representatives. The delay in circulating the amendments as I have proposed them was because amendments (3) and (4) as have been circulated by me as distinct from (1) and (2) were errors in drafting and properly were the responsibility of the Government. I note that Minister Button was not in the House when I made my speech in the second reading debate so would not have heard this. </PARA>
<PARA> As I had the amendments drafted, I offered to circulate them in my name. The circulation of the amendments was held up because I was waiting for confirmation from the Minister's office, with which I had consultations; indeed, I have had consultations with the Democrats since 14 November, so our position was well known. I am pleased that the Government has seen that our amendments fairly and equitably improve the legislation. It has seen fit to make a similar judgment about the Democrats' amendment not being in line with the recommendations of the Hughes report. </PARA>

<PARA>4. Clause 9, page 33, proposed paragraph 14 (1) (a), line 18, before ``has incurred'', insert ``the claimant''. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the effect of amendments Nos 1 and 2-the substantive amendments-is to allow a first entrant into the export market development grants scheme to combine two years of eligible expenditure to meet the $30,000 threshold. At the same time we are amending the formula set out in clause 10 of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment (No. 2) Bill to subtract two years at $15,000 per year so that a new entrant would not be advantaged unfairly as opposed to other participants in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were compulsory to combine those two years it would be possible to disadvantage a claimant who wished to rely only upon the expenditure in the second year, so under the amendment it is necessary for the claimant to elect in writing to combine the two years to protect his or her position. It is important to apply the $15,000 limit to both years and that is the reason for the amendment in addition to the one set out in the Bill, so that there would not be an unfair advantage given to someone who chose to combine those two years. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments offer small business people an opportunity which they were previously denied. We are delighted that both the Government and the Opposition have seen the wisdom of the argument and support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the adjournment debate on an issue that affects all Australians-their standard of living. It has become and continues to be a matter of debate because it is one of the justifications that Senator Cook and his colleagues put forward to justify their so-called accord with the union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook also used to talk about the value of the accord in promoting job growth. It has to be said that in recent days Senator Cook has shown a disinclination to use that particular argument. While Senator Cook and Mr Keating were publicly running the line that the accord equals job growth, apparently privately Senator Cook, Paul Keating and probably Senator Button and other senior colleagues decided that what this country needed was an engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA> As any grade 1 economist knows, an engineered recession results not in job growth but in job losses. The figures released today show that unemployment is rising at frighteningly high rates, and it was interesting that Senator Button was very careful to avoid indicating today just how high unemployment might rise in the engineered recession that, in Paul Keating's words, we had to have. It is worth reflecting on the point that probably no other government in Australia's history has actually felt proud that a recession has hit the economy during its term in office. Certainly no other government that I am aware of has regarded it as a badge of honour. </PARA>
<PARA> To my mind, it is astonishing that this Government is prepared to trot out the phrase `an engineered recession', which leads us to ask, quite reasonably: if it is engineered, how well engineered is it? Therefore, we would be entitled to know-and, indeed, the public would be entitled to know-what the consequences are, including the consequences for unemployment and dole queues. But when we pressed the Government on those matters today, no answers regrettably were forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> The other leg that Senator Cook has used to justify the accord is that household disposable income has risen, the implication being that workers and other employees are better off. Senator Cook has conceded a number of times in this place that wage rates under the accord have fallen. In the last two months Senator Cook has answered some 10 questions or so which have looked at the issue of workers' remuneration. Senator Cook tells union members, `Don't worry, you are better off despite falling wage rates; household disposable income has increased'. </PARA>
<PARA> I naturally felt that these claims by Senator Cook needed further analysis so that we could ascertain whether union members were in fact better off under the accord. After all, I think that even the Minister at the table, Senator Robert Ray, will admit that with the Labor Government's record on broken promises, which seems to grow longer day by day, it is reasonable to check carefully the statements by senior Ministers. However, let me state at the outset that Senator Cook is correct: wage rates have fallen during the term of the Labor Government. Household disposable income, according to statistics prepared by the Department of the Parliamentary Library, has in fact risen by contrast. This is not a bad start for Senator Cook in a period when credibility of Labor Ministers is highly suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the issue of household disposable income on which Senator Cook rests his case to prove the value of the accord to trade union members. Household disposable income is in fact a summary of all incomes received by households. As well as wages and salaries-the typical remuneration of union members-it also includes income of small businesses and farmers. One would have to say that these people are not typically trade union members. Farm income, for example, has grown very rapidly during the period of the Hawke Government, in part because the 1982-83 period was a very low base, reflecting the worst drought for 50 years. It is possible that farm income during 1990-91 could show some very poor trends indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that household disposable income, which is the statistic which Senator Cook regularly throws about this chamber to justify the accord, also includes the income of higher paid groups in the community-senior managers and corporate directors. These are the two groups that Senator Cook likes to castigate regularly for their rapid increases in income. Household income as calculated by the Commonwealth Statistician includes large sums for rental income, interest and dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> The superannuation component of household disposable income has also increased rapidly. This is not money in the pocket to the average union member, because it goes directly towards the superannuation fund. It is therefore not really disposable income in the sense that workers can use the money to help pay mortgages, school expenses and so on. Household disposable income also includes social security benefits and pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, roughly over 40 per cent of household disposable income does not derive from wages and salaries-the main source of income for trade union members. If it were possible to exclude the higher paid groups, the wages and salaries components of people who are typically union members would possibly be less than 50 per cent of the household disposable income that Senator Cook quotes. </PARA>
<PARA> The wages, salaries and supplement section of the household disposable income has also been affected by the very sharp rise in female participation rates in the work force. For example, in 1982-83, female participation rates were around 42 per cent. Today, it is around 52 per cent-a very significant rise over eight years. In some cases this increase in participation reflects demographic factors; in other cases it reflects the priorities of women who wish to enter the work force. I suspect that Senator Cook would not argue that it would also reflect the need for married women to supplement household income in a period of record mortgage interest rates and falling real wages of husbands. In these cases it is possible that many of the women may not see it as a benefit to be forced into the work force in order to ensure a reasonable living standard for their families. Nonetheless, the fact that these, can we say, unwilling workers have been required to enter the work force also, in a paradoxical sense, helps boost household disposable income. In fact, this large boost of 10 per cent of families where wives have entered the work force hides declining incomes among the other 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, for all these reasons, household disposable income is not a complete and satisfactory measure to indicate how trade union members have fared under the accord. We must ask ourselves: is there a better measure to test the benefits or otherwise of the accord to the average worker? I think a better measure is average weekly earnings, because average weekly earnings are based on survey examples of all employees in the country. Unlike household disposable income-the statistic that Senator Cook uses-they are not distorted by incomes which do not typically affect the average income available to many trade union members, such as dividends and business and farm income. Average weekly earnings are not perfect. Nevertheless, they are a better indicator of the likely trend of incomes of trade union members than household disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures which are available for average weekly earnings since the advent of the Hawke Government show that there has been a very dramatic fall in after tax annual earnings. In 1982-83, average male weekly earnings after tax totalled-and these are in real dollars-$475 per week. Today-eight years after the original accord; eight years after all the promises of improvements in living standards to Australian workers; eight years of a Labor Government whose main interest one would have thought would have been the welfare of Australian workers-the comparative figure has fallen by $23 per week after tax. That latest figure is based on Budget forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA> If we convert those figures into annual totals, in 1982-83 the after tax income of a person on average weekly earnings has fallen from $24,800 to $23,580-a fall of $1,220. That is eight years after the advent of the Hawke Government; eight years after the accord; and eight years after all those promises that Mr Hawke and his colleagues made to trade union members. This is a huge fall in earnings available to the average member of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> There will always be a debate about statistics. I suggest that if Senator Cook, Mr Kelty and Senator Robert Ray, sitting at the table, wanted an indicator which was more likely to represent the trend in trade union member incomes-incomes which they, above all, should be most concerned about-they would be better advised to use the average weekly earnings statistics than the household disposable income statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, at the end of the day, trade union members will make their own judgment on this issue. They will make a judgment as to whether I am correct in suggesting that their living standards have fallen, or whether Senator Cook is correct in saying that their standards have risen. I suspect that if any happen to be listening tonight they can ask themselves this question: am I better off after eight years of the Hawke Government? Perhaps a leading indicator that workers themselves feel worse off is that Labor Party support is collapsing amongst blue collar workers. It is not surprising that more blue collar workers support Dr John Hewson's Liberal Party than the Hawke-Keating Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that Labor Party members, before asking Senator Cook dorothy dixers on living standards, which they do tirelessly almost daily, satisfy themselves that they are being given appropriate statistics. After all, their future depends on whether workers' living standards are rising or falling. In my view, they should look very closely at these statistics before they stand up and give Senator Cook a chance to cite figures which, I think, are highly suspect to the extent that they seek to represent how trade union members have fared under the accord. In my view, living standards have collapsed under the accord. I sustain that view by pointing to trends in average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook has a slight fall-back position. In fact, when one reads his answers one finds he talks not only about household disposable income but also about the social wage. People in the 1960s and 1970s used to talk about the social wage. I sometimes regard it as an approach which does not meet realities. The social wage is paid for by taxes. With the tax rates under the Labor Government, trade union members make a mighty contribution towards the social services that they receive. There is no doubt that the accord has failed to protect employment, as it has failed to protect workers' incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this is a debate which we would like to have. When Senator Cook gets up in this chamber in Question Time and makes these claims he should be very careful in outlining what he believes to be statistics which represent the reality and feelings of the average worker. In my belief, the accord has been a disaster for Australia. It has been a disaster for workers' living standards; it has been a disaster for employment, and it is one of the major reasons that the Labor Government-Senator Robert Ray and his colleagues-will be changing sides in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Ferguson</PARA>
<PARA>You will recall the urine substitution incident which took place in Belfast on June 30, 1986 involving Miss Jane Flemming and Mr Maurice Plant, then Assistant Manager for the Australian Track and Field Team. </PARA>
<PARA>You will recall that this matter has attracted considerable publicity since it was referred to the Interim Report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment Recreation and the Arts and subsequently in a Second Report of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>You will also recall Miss Flemming on a number of occasions publicly claiming to have appeared before the Committee voluntarily and that particular claim was referred to by the Australian Sports Commission when responding to the Inquiry's findings in providing the then Minister, Senator Richardson, with a Report to be tabled in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>You will be aware of course from having read Miss Flemming's submission to the Committee that there was no reference to the urine substitution incident and in fact as Miss Flemming said in her public evidence on 13 February 1989, and I quote, ``I am basically here to support the Institute of Sport on some of the allegations that have been made against it. I have been at the Institute for four years.'' The Chairman, Senator Black, particularly asked Miss Flemming inter alia, ``Do you have any knowledge . . . of the provision of clean urine samples by athletes for others?'' Miss Flemming responded in the following terms: ``I have heard of that sort of thing going on and I have also heard of people who have been tested and have had a positive result. Not in Australia, but internationally.'' The matter was pressed with no indication from Miss Flemming of her own personal experience until the Chairman subsequently asked, ``Have you ever been asked to provide a clean urine sample for anybody?'' at which point Miss Flemming asked that her evidence be taken in camera, which evidence has subsequently by resolution of the Committee been published and tabled in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Miss Flemming in response to a question from myself as to who the official involved was, said, and I quote, ``He was a gentleman by the name of Maurie Plant and he is a friend of mine, too, and so I would not have said anything about this but I know that Merv was going to say something tomorrow.''</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently I asked of Miss Flemming, ``The reason you are telling us is because you know that if you do not, tomorrow . . . '' at which point Miss Flemming interrupted me to respond, and I quote, ``That Merv is going to say something, and I just wanted to be able to tell you what the story was from first hand and let you know.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman asked Miss Flemming, and I quote, ``Why did you not want to say it publicly before Merv did?'' Miss Flemming replied, and I quote, ``Because I do not want my name to be even associated with it. I have got contracts with sporting goods companies and things like that, and if they think that I am even slightly related to drugs, then I will lose my contracts.''</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought even with the most vigorous and fertile imagination it would be inconceivable to believe that Miss Flemming appeared before our Committee in a voluntary capacity to provide information in respect to her involvement in the urine substitution incident. </PARA>
<PARA>This incident was first brought to light as a result of a letter written by Mr Kemp-then one of Miss Flemming's AIS coaches who, on 19 August, 1986 wrote to the Australian Athletic Union. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee has been advised by the Australian Athletic Union, as it was then known, that on 6 October, 1986 the General Manager of that Union met with Mr Kemp and Miss Flemming at the Australian Institute of Sport. However, Miss Flemming declined to comment on the matter other than to say that she had produced a sample and according to the Union she advised that she would not put anything in writing regarding this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Miss Flemming in her evidence to the Committee advised that in response to her correspondence from the Australian Athletic Union, and I quote, ``I did not know what to do and I decided that I would not write back and I would see what happened and they have never, ever contacted me again about it''. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked Miss Flemming, ``Have you heard no more?'' and she responded, and I quote, ``No, I have heard no more.'' Miss Flemming further advised the Senate Committee in her evidence, and I quote, ``But the Australian Athletic Union, in its letter to me, said that if I had any light to shed on this subject I should write back to it. I did not write back to it.''</PARA>
<PARA>I asked Miss Flemming, ``Do you have any concern that the Australian Amateur Athletic Union might have a view about it?'', referring of course to the incident, and Miss Flemming responded, and I quote, ``I do not know what it thinks, to tell you the truth. I do not even know whether the same people are still working there that know. I do not know who knows there.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Athletic Union's correspondence to the Committee went on to observe that as a consequence of the problems that arose with Miss Flemming not prepared to make a written statement, a mail vote to associations conducted at that time amended the law regarding investigations to read, ``If the person, or club, or association concerned fails to respond to the request for a Statutory Declaration within the specified time, the person, club or association shall be suspended forthwith till such time as the response is received.''</PARA>
<PARA>I have bothered to set down the circumstances of Miss Flemming's disclosures of this matter and the subsequent steps which the Australian Athletic Union found it necessary to take because of the clearly wrong information which has been provided to the media, Australian athletes, sporting officials and the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the part played by Mr Maurie Plant in this incident. To my knowledge the Australian Athletic Union, or more recently Athletics Australia, have never interviewed Mr Plant about his role and involvement in the incident but have relied exclusively for that judgement upon correspondence received by the Senate Committee wherein Mr Plant, while not acknowledging he had made any error by way of his involvement, simply acknowledged that he had committed a potential error of judgement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Neil King, General Manager of Athletics Australia, has advised the Committee on 27 August of this year that since Mr Plant has indicated that he did not subvert the collection or testing process it is probably reasonable to reclassify this as a potential error of judgement rather than an error of judgement. I find that a quite remarkable conclusion by any measure, not the least one from the General Manager of a publicly funded amateur sporting body.</PARA>
<PARA>I still await Athletics Australia's response as to what inquiries they personally made into Mr Plant's involvement in this incident. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of Mr King's view, I propose when dealing with the appropriation of funding for sport in 1991 to establish what criteria and minimum standards of conduct Athletics Australia expects from its officials and office bearers. </PARA>
<PARA>My further interest in Mr Plant's present role and association with young Australian athletes travelling overseas has been stimulated by the knowledge that Mr Plant was referred to in a bulletin of the Athletics Association of WA as an Australian athletics promoter and athletics representative on the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) Athletes' Commission for the Grand Prix Circuit. </PARA>
<PARA>I have subsequently been advised by Athletics Australia that Mr Plant is a Member of the IAAF Grand Prix Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>On 22 August this year, the Secretary of the Senate Committee wrote on my behalf requesting of Athletics Australia the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. what is the process by which appointments are made to the Grand Prix Commission by the International Amateur Athletic Federation Council?</PARA>
<PARA> 2. what extent is Athletics Australia involved? and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. do appointments bear any relationship to the nationality of the appointee?</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant part of the General Manager of Athletics Australia's response was:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the IAAF Council decides, from time to time, in its discretion both to establish Commissions and to determine the membership thereof; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Athletics Australia is not involved whatsoever. Consultation is not sought. Further, Australia is not represented on the IAAF Council. </PARA>
<PARA>However, on 16 November the IAAF wrote to me stating in clear and unambiguous language that Mr Plant was nominated by the IAAF (and with the approval of Athletics Australia) as a Member of the IAAF Grand Prix Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The General Manager of the IAAF went on to say that, amongst the criteria which are applied in appointing members to the position Mr Plant presently holds, is that of the ability to keep confidences, to be one hundred per cent trustworthy and loyal. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quite unable to reconcile the contradiction by the IAAF of the assurance given to me by Mr King of Athletics Australia that Athletics Australia was neither involved, nor consulted, about Mr Plant's appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure you will appreciate the significance of my inquiries and the response by Athletics Australia as to their involvement in the appointment of Mr Plant. </PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary of the Senate Committee has further been advised by the General Manager of Athletics Australia in respect to Mr Plant, ``that the IAAF, which is Athletics Australia's governing body, and the British Amateur Athletic Board have both investigated these specific matters and have resolved to continue their professional relationship with Mr Plant.''</PARA>
<PARA>Mr David Prince, President of Athletics Australia Inc, in correspondence to myself on 26 October, styling himself as President of the National Sport of Athletics and a Board Member of the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Olympic Committee, assured me that ``both the IAAF and the British Amateur Athletic Association have concluded that no further investigation is warranted.''</PARA>
<PARA>However, I am advised by Mr John B. Holt, General Manager of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, ``that IAAF has not specifically discussed the incident in Belfast. It would not be appropriate for us to do so, as the meeting concerned was not one conducted directly by IAAF. We have been assured by our member federation, Athletics Australia, that there is no breach of IAAF rules, and that they have satisfactorily dealt with the matter in this light.''</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Holt went on to say, ``that it should be noted that except in extreme circumstances where there has been a clear breach or flouting of IAAF rules, it is not the practice of the IAAF to intervene in the Federation's management of its affairs.''</PARA>
<PARA>These statements are of course again, in total contradiction to the claims made and information provided both to myself and the Senate Committee by both the General Manager and President of Athletics Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The IAAF further advised me, ``We have been assured by our Member Federation, Athletics Australia, that there was no breach of IAAF rules, and that they had satisfactorily dealt with the matter in this light. </PARA>
<PARA>``We have again discussed this matter with Neal King, the General Manager of Athletics Australia, and we are satisfied that Athletics Australia carried out a proper investigation.''</PARA>
<PARA>I still wait advice as to evidence of any investigation whatsoever by Athletics Australia of Mr Plant's involvement by the simple process of that body even interviewing Mr Plant. </PARA>
<PARA>Much seems to have been made in Australia of the fact that neither Mr Plant nor Miss Flemming contravened any sports regulations. However, I draw to your attention the particular words of the code of conduct signed by Miss Flemming as a scholarship holder at the Australian Institute of Sport and refer you also to the criteria of the IAAF in appointing people to the Grand Prix Commission. They include ``the ability to follow closely rules and guidelines relating to the Grand Prix'' and ``the ability to keep confidences, to be one hundred per cent trustworthy and loyal.''</PARA>
<PARA>You will of course know that the conduct of Miss Flemming and Mr Plant is now in clear breach of sporting regulations and obviously the fact that those regulations were not in place in 1986 was not due to a belief that such conduct was acceptable or proper, but rather that the appropriate bodies had not conceived that such a process would be undertaken to subvert proper testing of athletes so as to determine whether or not they were competing fairly or by means of cheating. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the IAAF have relied upon a proper and responsible investigation by Athletics Australia into the conduct of Mr Plant. Mr King and Mr Prince have also both assured myself and the Secretary of the Senate Committee that the British Amateur Athletic Board have investigated the specific matters relating to Mr Plant and concluded that no further investigation is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA>The extent of the British Board's inquiries are at this moment unknown to me save for correspondence from the Australian Athletic Union which states that the British Board have written to Athletics Australia following Mr Kemp raising a matter of doping control undertaken at a meeting held in Birmingham some time following the Belfast incident, wherein the British Board stated that on that occasion, ``the identity of the person presented for testing was never in doubt.'' That would appear to be a totally unrelated matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Amateur Athletic Union in the same correspondence advised the Senate Committee that the British Board had categorically stated that the identity of athletes at all testing under their jurisdiction was never in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA>Even a casual observer of this incident will at once of course appreciate that it was not the identity of the athletes at the testings which was in question but rather whose urine sample was provided for testing. </PARA>
<PARA>In pursuing this matter with the IAAF I asked of them that they provide details of the deliberations of the IAAF with respect to Mr Plant and correspondence which ensued between the IAAF, the Australian Athletics Union (Athletics Australia) and the British Amateur Athletic Board. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised by the IAAF that a study of the Australian file in London reveals that there was no correspondence on this subject among the three bodies mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for the protracted nature of this matter is at once obvious. </PARA>
<PARA>I have written to the President of Athletics Australia Inc, and asked for the reasons for the apparent contradiction in the advice of Athletics Australia and that provided by the IAAF. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will summarise, in hopefully a succinct and articulate way, this ongoing saga which is now becoming quite painful to all of us, not least to myself. Evidence was taken by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in respect of one particular athlete and one particular official-the assistant general manager of the track and field team, Mr Maurice Plant-at the Commonwealth Games when Mr Plant solicited from an Australian athlete a urine sample so as to substitute that for the purpose of cheating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have written this letter seeking a final resolution to the matter. It has been written finally as a result of the fact that the Committee wrote to Athletics Australia asking for certain information. It was written ultimately because it was brought to my attention that Mr Plant is a member of the Grand Prix Commission, appointed by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) Council. I wrote to Athletics Australia asking how he became a member of that Commission. The General Manager of Athletics Australia assured me that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the IAAF Council decides, from time to time, in its discretion both to establish Commissions and to determine the membership thereof . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Athletics Australia is not involved whatsoever. Consultation is not sought. Further, Australia is not represented on the IAAF Council. </PARA>
<PARA>This is correspondence which, in substance, is supported by the General Manager of Athletics Australia and the Chairman, who is a member of the Australian Sports Commission. The IAAF wrote back, after I wrote a letter asking the same question-as quite obviously one would-and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Plant was nominated by the IAAF (and with the approval of Athletics Australia) as a Member of the IAAF Grand Prix Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into any more detail on this correspondence, except to say that there appears, prima facie, to be a clear contradiction between that information which was provided by Athletics Australia and that which was provided by the International Amateur Athletics Federation. This seems to be the ongoing saga in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps this is the golden thread that goes through our attitude to the recently introduced legislation setting up a statutory authority for the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The reason we support the establishment of a statutory authority is that it is our philosophical view that we are not convinced that one can trust the officials. The history of this inquiry and the history of drugs in sport in Australia is that there is no evidence of an overwhelming, or at least reasonable or substantial, standard which would persuade any objective person that the officials, particularly in amateur sport, had the commitment and dedication to drive drugs out of sport. The concern fundamentally and essentially seems to be to cover up, to compromise and to pretend that there is not a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One will find, I am sure, that without doubt Senator Baume will be prosecuting the argument for the statutory authority on the basis that it is necessary because the people associated with sport in many respects, at an elite level, cannot be trusted to act in the way they should act-that is, with a voluntary code of conduct of their own. I find that very sad. It was only this morning that I found an article written in the New York Times of 28 October-which is perhaps a bit outdated but terribly germane to my views. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The USOC-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the United States Olympic Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>which should really be looking out for the health of America's athletes as well as promoting level playing fields and ideals of sportsmanship, has been more concerned about its image and fund raising ability. When a cloud of rumours surrounded the testing procedures themselves, Dr Voy, the USOC's chief medical officer, resigned. The new chief, Dr Deborah Waters, felt a responsibility to get a handle on the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Last April, with the help of Dr Yesalis and Edwin Moses-</PARA>
<PARA>as we all know, he is the 440-metre hurdles champion-</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Waters proposed an anonymous survey of all athletes attending the Sports Festival this year in Minneapolis. She realised that meaningful research can only be done with the help of athletes themselves. It was a much needed first step. Why, then, did Harvey Schiller, the USOC executive director, cancel the research after all the preparations were made and researchers were in the dorms with the athletes at the Sports Festival?</PARA>
<PARA> As long as there are more questions than answers, don't think, for one hundredth of a second that drug testing has done much to protect the health of athletes or to level the playing field. </PARA>
<PARA>That really summarises the problem we have in Australia. We cannot help but note these things, if we take even a casual observation of them. For instance, we had a long debate two days ago on the question of whether we ought to be advertising tobacco products. One of the people on the International Olympic Committee Medical Commission-the body which is essentially made up of prominent doctors, biochemists and authorities on testing, sampling, effects, results, causes and implications-Dr Klausnitzer, is in charge of the East German drug testing laboratory at Kreische. He was the head of the laboratory at the time that the East Germans were paid in hard currency to take drugs, when it was regimentation that all these East German athletes had to take anabolic steroids or other performance enhancing drugs. Absurd as it might seem to us, they were even having to induce gas to give them buoyancy in their swimming. As one of them said, the greatest challenge for them was not to win the 440 or the 100 metres; it was to hold themselves in physical contact until such time as they dived into the water. It was like a balloon under water. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Klausnitzer is still on the International Olympic Commission health body. He has not been driven off. My understanding is that Mr Gosper is now a Vice-President of the International Olympic Federation. To my knowledge, neither he nor Mr Coates, nor any other Australian Olympic official has raised a hand or, more particularly, a voice in protest against this former East German, who manufactured and manipulated and ensured that these athletes took the drugs in a regimented form, or said that he should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I hope that next time we make a bid for the Olympics it will be received with more enthusiasm than Melbourne's bid was. I am moved to observe that in the events that flowed from that those States such as Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania that supported Melbourne and not New South Wales-which is now the heart and centre and soul of the Australian Olympic Committee-were punished in a very unpleasant way for their support of Melbourne. Each of those States nominated a person to be on the Australian Olympic Committee. Victoria nominated Bill Hoffman; South Australia nominated John Rodder; and Tasmania nominated John Watson. The other nominations came out of the blue-Keith Murton, David Prince, and John Whitehouse from those States, in that order. Their association with Sydney and with the elite sports was clearly identified. </PARA>
<PARA> What is commonly known in the trade as the bloodbath of that night demonstrated the pay back for those who dared support Melbourne on this occasion. Athletics Australia, for instance, gets half a million dollars a year of taxpayers' hard-earned money to indulge itself in sport for its own glory. I hope that those officials, when they are playing these games with politics, reflect on the effect that is having on Australia generally and the effect it had on the Melbourne bid. Everybody, but everybody, knew, when the Australian bid went up, about the politics involved. I only hope that when Sydney gets its bid up it gets our complete and absolute support and that the same sorts of politics are not used. I will raise more detail about that at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As members of a free democratic society, there are a number of principles which we must and should hold very dear. One of those principles is equality before the law. I think it would be remiss of me, therefore, if I did not take this opportunity to address one of the very grave threats to that principle of equality before the law, that is, recent attempts by the Commonwealth to put itself above the judicial process. Unfortunately, I am only able to be brief on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall approach it from the point of view of international law, for two principal reasons. Firstly, I believe that the obligations a state owes to its individual members are at least the same as the obligations that a state owes to an international citizen. Secondly, increasingly in this corporate world, the relations that governments have with the private sector are frequently relations between governments and corporate entities. It is a recognised principle of international law that large corporations, even if they are incorporated in the same state as the government in question, have an international character. That was recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co. case, which was heard in 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the starting point should be to ask whether the Commonwealth should effectively enjoy immunity from judicial process. This question is sometimes taken for granted. Certainly the obligation of the Crown to obey certain principles of judicial process was recognised as early as Magna Carta. There is a very nice exposition of the matter given by O'Connor in International Law, volume 1, page 841. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the most that can be said of customary international law is that it enjoins immunity from the judicial process only in respect of governmental activities that pertain to administration, and does not compel it in respect of other activities which are more truly commercial than administrative. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Connor is saying that we have to draw a distinction between acts of government that are administrative and acts of government that have a commercial character. To put this in legal terms, governments can indulge in acts which are jure gestionis, that is, commercial, or acts which are jure imperii, that is, acts of administration, acts of government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate at times that the Government does put itself above normal judicial processes when we are talking about acts of government and acts of administration. Unfortunately, sometimes that is necessary. At the moment, we are in a period when governments all around the world-State governments, Federal governments, sometimes even local governments-are indulging in corporate activities and commercial activities. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the Victorian State Government indulging in stock market speculation. I hope that most State governments, if they choose to indulge in such activities, are a little more successful than the Victorian Government. But a government cannot be allowed to rectify its commercial or fiduciary mistakes through the use of legislation. Nor should it take the opportunity to abuse its position as a law maker to its own financial advantage. When individuals abuse their power to their own financial advantage-for example, trustees in the administration of a trust-it is a matter that the law takes very gravely. It is only appropriate, therefore, that, if a government abuses its trust to administer the law fairly and equitably, we should take the same view. Lord Denning, in Rahimtoola v. Nizam of Hyderabad (1958) AC 379 at 418, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is more in keeping with the dignity of a foreign sovereign to submit himself to the rule of law than to claim to be above it, and his independence is better ensured by accepting the decisions of courts of acknowledged impartiality than by arbitrarily rejecting their jurisdiction. In all civilised countries there has been a progressive tendency towards making the sovereign liable to be sued in his own courts; notably in England by the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, recognition-this time by the Privy Council-of the importance of governments and sovereigns not enjoying immunity from judicial process when it comes to their commercial activities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there is a distinction to be made. The question sometimes, however, is what is an administrative act and what is a commercial act? Sometimes acts are supposedly administrative in nature but have such an overwhelming fiduciary aspect-an overwhelming financial vested interest-that they are, to all intents and purposes, acts of commerce or fiduciary interest rather than acts of administration. </PARA>
<PARA> This draws me to the conclusion of this speech and the particular reason for speaking tonight. It was with great dissatisfaction that I noticed in the previous couple of weeks the introduction into the Senate of a Bill which was calculated from the start to deny a corporate individual the right to due judicial process. That Bill was passed today. I do not intend to canvass questions of retrospectivity but it was very clearly the case that the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 was introduced in an attempt to deny Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd a right to fair judicial process before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe it reflects fairly or satisfactorily upon any members of this chamber-be they Government or Australian Democrat-who take the opportunity to put the Commonwealth above the law and above the rights of the corporate individual. People may well say that corporations are big enough and bad enough to look after themselves. Unfortunately, corporations are made up of many individuals-many small individuals-who each suffer the hurt that is inflicted upon the corporate body. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter that was also recognised in the previously cited case of the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, which is a matter of major principle. I believe that this principle needs to be upheld. I believe that if the principles of open and accountable government are more than just words, they should be reflected by our deeds. If we are to live in a democratic society and if we are to have respect for judicial process, I believe it behoves us here in this Senate chamber to stand up for the rights of individuals, to stand up for the rights of corporations and to stand up for the rights of all of our citizens before the law to give them the opportunity of due judicial process and a fair hearing and to ensure that the Government does not abuse its powers in its own vested financial interests. </PARA>

In the third week there were four; in the fourth there were seven; and so on. It dribbled on and on. It dribbled on because the Bills were not coming into the chamber from the other place, not because the other place was out of the Government's control but because the Government had no Bills to bring forward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear that Senator Ray is saying no, he was not saying that it was us delaying it- it was his own delay. I am overjoyed if that is the inference of his interjection just now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal with the exact facts here. How come, if all these Bills we have now been inundated with are so important-and we had a motion today, which was successfully carried as a result of collusion between the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, to label them vital, important and urgent Bills-they have only come here in the last 15 sitting days?</PARA>
<PARA> Fifty-five of the Bills listed on the Notice Paper have been introduced within the last 15 sitting days. It would be very difficult for the Opposition to have delayed those Bills to the extent that the sort of remedy that is required is a guillotine. In fact, in the last four sitting weeks I think we have had something like 25 Bills passed. I do not know whether Senator Ray regards that as obstructionism-apparently he does. It is obstructionism when we pass 25 Bills in four weeks but it is sound Government progress to pass four Bills in three weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> What hypocrisy did we get today? All I want to do is put on the record what the facts are about this disgraceful performance by the Government. Senator Ray asked me by way of friendly comment across the chamber today, `Did you ever vote for the guillotine or the gag when you were in government?'. I have to say yes, I did, in the lower House. That, by the way, is a pattern and a practice. Whether it is good or bad, it is a practice in the lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> I am celebrating, along with Senator Walters, Senator Short and Senator Chapman, the fifteenth anniversary of our election to a parliament. We are watching the procedures of that parliament being subverted, the procedures of a House of review being subverted. The bulk of this legislation, which has been dumped on us in the last 15 sitting days, has in the main been gagged through the lower House with no debate. It is now being guillotined through this House of review with no debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, when I look through this list I see a great number of Bills which are not urgent to the extent that they need to be rammed through this legislature, whether or not they have been subjected to proper scrutiny. Senator Watson has told us that one piece of legislation in particular was agreed not to be sent to a committee in order to try to assist the Government if there was to be a decent opportunity to scrutinise it in the Committee of the Whole. When I look through the list of these Bills I wonder what the urgent need is for some of them to be put through in a state which may very well lead to further amendments, further corrections. </PARA>
<PARA> We were inundated with compendium Bills this year-compendium Bills correcting legislative muck-ups. I have been astounded at the number of Bills that have had to come into this place in this compendium form correcting drafting errors in Bills because they simply have not been looked at and examined properly. The Government certainly has not looked at them properly. Government members have not applied their great intellects to them, or maybe the problem is that they have applied their great intellects to them and that is why they are in a mess. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times we have continually had correcting Bills coming through this place. One of the reasons is that we have this rush at the end of the session because the Government cannot organise itself. Towards I think the last week of the short session we had at the beginning of this year about 37 Bills hit us, as I recall. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a lousy way to run a government. I do not mind Senator Ray saying, `Come on. You are making the same speeches complaining about this as I used to make when I was in opposition'. I take that point; that is fair enough. But the pretence that somehow there is something especially phoney or improper about our objections and that they are really just objections by way of form rather than substance is what I resent. We are making sound and proper objections. Maybe even some of those that Senator Ray made when he was in opposition were sound and proper. But the way you and Senator Collins responded to them today suggested that you had no genuine concern or sympathy for the point of view being presented here. Quite frankly, you should have. They are the same points that you have made in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had four contributions tonight. Of course, Senator Michael Baume is a master of the adjournment appearance. He says that, if a person says one thing and then denies he said it, it means the opposite. This is an old journalist's trick. It is one that he is very proficient at. It is not a particularly good one, though, when it comes to real debate, real reasoning and real results. Nevertheless, it is the sort of muckraking approach that one would expect from an ex-representative of the fourth estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would be interested to hear Senator Baume's views about the recent events in New South Wales, where the titular head of the Liberal Party, Mr Nick Greiner, kept the Parliament sitting for 33 hours on end for the end of year rush. It is not only this Parliament; the great Liberal Party Premier did that from 10 a.m. through to 7 p.m. the next day, for 33 continuous hours. Bar a meal break or two-not many-he kept that Parliament sitting for the last minute rush. I will search the record for Senator Baume's press release on that. Who wants to bet me that there was never a press release on that? Of course there was not; there was no press release at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume went on to distort the debate. He said that I came into the chamber this morning and said that the sole reason for this situation was Opposition obstructionism. That is a direct untruth. I acknowledged this morning that there was fault on behalf of the Government for the end of season rush. Those opposite should go back and read the Hansard. I also pointed to the fact that there were several parliamentary statements, which was unusual, which also delayed the process. Senator Michael Baume coming in here tonight highly offended is knocking over a straw man. </PARA>
<PARA> He then came up with an extraordinary proposition. He wrung his hands. He actually came in here and confessed that he voted for the guillotine in the other place. But, after he was scrubbed out of the House of Representatives and after he had worked for the great John Howard for a few months, he came back here to haunt us-a reformed man. He had been on a road to Damascus conversion. He was no longer a guillotiner but a wimp. He has come into this chamber no longer the tough man he was in the House of Representatives but a marshmallow man. I dare Senator Baume to get up tonight or any other night and swear on a stack of whatever religious beliefs he has that he will never vote for a guillotine in the future. None of those opposite will-not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Baume's conversion is genuine, he has gravely insulted his colleagues here tonight. He has said, `This is a House of review and a guillotine should never be used'. But from 1975 to 1980 his colleagues sitting here tonight voted for a guillotine time and time again. There they sit-Senator Walters, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Durack, Senator Teague and Senator MacGibbon. They all marched into the chamber and happily voted for the guillotine. Not only did they vote for the guillotine; they voted to gag the guillotine motion. They did not even allow a debate on the guillotine. They came into this chamber and squashed everyone. Why? Because they had an absolute majority. That is why they did it. In 1980 the gag was moved at eight past eight and sixteen Bills went through by 10.55-democracy Liberal Party style. </PARA>
<PARA> The only difference between Senator Baume and me is that I am not a hypocrite. It never would have bothered me if it had happened when we were in Opposition. I would have taken it as being part of the natural course of events, but we have absolute hypocrisy here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators have complained about Senator Watson's treatment. Yes, Senator Watson did want a whole day to be spent on the committee stage of one Bill. We have saved honourable senators from that and I think everyone in the Opposition may be grateful. However, as we were approached today on that matter we have agreed to convene the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tomorrow morning so that Senator Watson can have his day in court. We did not have to do that; we could have gone ruthlessly through and ignored his wishes. We also made it very clear that we had moved the guillotine now-with six days debating time before the end of the session-to make sure that legislation was not guillotined on the last day. I have noticed an enormous lift in the standard of debate in this chamber today, as people have put forward concise arguments for the points they have made. We have heard some good speeches today and honourable senators can thank me for my largesse. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a few other contributions to the adjournment debate tonight. There was a contribution from Senator Kemp-an apprentice senator doing an adjournment run. I think that is a good idea-it gets the bugs out of the speaking system. I really think that Senator Kemp has done the Senate a grave disservice tonight. He has put out a challenge to Senator Cook and I have received a message that Senator Cook is now working on a couple of really great answers to questions next week to thoroughly and totally contradict the rather facetious and shallow speech that Senator Kemp has made here tonight. I am looking forward to Question Time next week to hear my great colleague expound these questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only one thing to add. It is said that there are lies, lies and damn statistics. Half-way through Senator Kemp's speech I knew that he would use the figure for 1982-83 as his point of comparison. Why? Because it followed a massive wages blow-out. Opposition senators always use that figure because it came after a massive wages blow-out when profit share was crushed and there would have to be a rebalancing over the next couple of years. Of course it happened because in 1981-82 Fraser gave away a centralised wages policy, which blew the wages out. Therefore, honourable senators use that figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why does the honourable senator not try using figures for the years later or years before? Of course he will not, because like everyone else-especially economists-he picks the year most favourable to himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also heard tonight from our great adjournment recidivist, Senator Crichton-Browne. Whilst I have not necessarily agreed with the way in which he has prosecuted some of these matters, I must assure him that we all support the stamping out of drugs in sport. I do not think this matter is restricted to one side of the chamber. People feel very strongly about it. I am still very disappointed that Raelene Boyle has never won a gold medal. She was not beaten through lack of ability, but through drugs. </PARA>

<PARA> Last and least we had Senator O'Chee's contribution tonight. It was a very unctuous speech, as always. My only advice to Senator O'Chee is that he should loosen up. I am not trying to be patronising, but he has to loosen up his style. It is great to quote Lord Denning, apple pie, motherhood and all the rest of it, but he should loosen his style up a bit and then I am sure he will make a major contribution to this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (6) Orders for the new hat badge were placed in Oct 88 and deliveries were received in June 89.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) 7000 hat badges were supplied at a cost of $8800.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Current stock is estimated by HQ Logistic Command at 2000 badges. Given the current usage rate this quantity will be sufficient until Feb/Mar 91.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) It has been decided that, coincident with the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings and in keeping with the desire to foster tradition, the `rising sun' badge would be adopted as the principal emblem of the Army, replacing the crossed sword and kangaroo emblem. Before this could be done there was some amendment necessary to the 1969 design to ensure that it clearly identified the Australian Army. To achieve this the words `The Australian Army' replaced the word `Australia'. The contemporary community usage of the word `military' to refer to the entire defence force meant that a reversion to the original wording `Australian Military Forces' was not appropriate. The stars were deleted to allow for the revised wording and also because the seven major points of the badge already symbolise the States and the Commonwealth.</PARA>

The Government believes that the response presents a balanced and considered approach to the challenges confronting small business and a solid basis for reform for the sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Most of the issues identified in the Report are of a long standing nature and there are no quick fixes. In consequence the Government's response sets out the basis of what is necessarily a medium to long term reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA> However, action is already underway where possible. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has commenced reviews of the sales tax administrative system and of compliance costs for small business. Mr Beddall invited representatives of the major national small business and industry organisations to attend the Second National Small Business Forum in Melbourne on 29 November to discuss the Government's agenda for small business. He has also convened a meeting on 19 December of all State and Territory Ministers with responsibility for small business to seek their commitment to a co-ordinated approach to small business issues.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's response to the Beddall Report reaffirms the Government's commitment to overcoming the difficulties facing small business in Australia. It shows that small business issues are clearly on the Government's agenda and that the Government has now agreed to the steps necessary to ensure that the work begun by the Parliamentary Committee is carried through.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) &amp;(2) Unemployment and Sickness Benefit (U&amp;B) clients are already required to provide the Department with a tax file number (TFN). At 9 November 1990 536,580 current U&amp;B clients had provided TFNs.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of a project undertaken in July 1990 the Department estimates that about 40% of total pensioners (900,000) have a TFN. Estimates are not available by pension type.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security has made no estimate of the number of persons receiving family payments who have a TFN but expects the proportion with TFNs to be very high.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The number of clients with TFNs at the end of 1990/91 cannot be estimated at present. The number will depend on when the legislation authorising the collection of TFNs from new client groups is passed and how quickly requests for TFNs can be issued. The rate of issue will need to take account of the capacity of the Australian Taxation Office to process enquiries and new registrations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) &amp;(5) The Department's policy on exemptions has yet to be settled.</PARA>
<PARA> The draft legislation provides for the Secretary of the Department under certain conditions to exempt clients from the requirement to provide the TFN of a spouse. It is not known how many clients will seek this exemption.</PARA>
<PARA> It has also been decided that full-rate pensioners over 80 years old and with a low risk of incorrect payment should not be required to provide a TFN. At 14 September 1990 there were 294,716 pensioners over 80 years old.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Attached is a Departmental Administrative Circular of 19 June 1990 outlining the procedures to be observed by Departmental officers for the recovery of sundry debts and the acquittal of travelling allowances and temporary advances. Also attached are pro forma letters used by the Department in the recovery of sundry debits and advances. Copies available in the Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Of the 25 short term mission advances outstanding as at 20 June 1990, 21 advances have been acquitted by 23 November 1990. The remaining 4 outstanding advances total $11,986.55.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As at 23 November 1990 there are only three outstanding advances from 1984-85, totalling $6,965. One advance was acquitted in early October 1990. The following are details of remaining outstanding advances.</PARA>
<PARA> An advance of $500 for meals and incidentals was paid to an Australian Diplomatic Courier for travel to the US and UK on 14 September 1984. The officer resigned from the Australian Public Service on 13 November 1984. Currently the whereabouts of the individual is unknown. Numerous efforts have been made to locate the individual using Telecom white pages, Electoral rolls and other available listings.</PARA>
<PARA> The remaining two advances for $3570 and $2895 were issued to an officer for a short term mission to Noumea, 21 August to 18 December 1984 and 19 December to 21 December 1984. The officer had completed the short term mission but had not acquitted the advances. The case has been referred to the Administrative Law Section of the Department for legal advice and action. The individual resigned from the Australian Public Service on 28 February 1987 and now resides in Brisbane. Advice received from the Australian Government Solicitor on 20 November 1990 is that the former officer has been contacted and that the advance may be acquitted by submission of a Statutory Declaration. This advice will be accepted and the amount cleared from our advances register.</PARA>
