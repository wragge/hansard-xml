<TITLE>Animal Patents</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The undersigned citizens of Australia and custodians of the Earth oppose the patenting of animals and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would reduce biodiversity, compromise animal welfare, concentrate ownership of breeding stock and allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>
<PARA> We pray that all members of the Australian Senate will act on this petition.</PARA>

<TITLE>Health Care for the Elderly</TITLE>
<PARA>Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> If open not-for-profit health funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, those costs need to be shared equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> Some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> Take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws the attention of the Senate to our opposition to any attempt to restrict access to the rebate for abortions under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is a universal health care system and as such the availability of any schedule item should never be determined on the basis of the moral values of a minority of citizens. Equity and access within the present system should be the right of all Australian citizens and guaranteed to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Webster Abortion Funding Abolition Bill would, if successful, severely limit the availability of rebates for items 6494, 274 and 275. The effect would be twofold-further discrimination against all women (particularly those who could not afford the full cost of this procedure) and an invasion of the confidentiality that exists between client and medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In introducing this important Bill into the Senate, I would like to briefly run through the background circumstances which led to the need for its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Nine years ago, the Fraser Government set in train the potential for unacceptable foreign ownership of Australian television when it introduced the so-called `Murdoch Amendments'. The particular changes relevant to this issue effectively moved the selection of television licensees to the market place and altered the foreign ownership rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual foreign owners continued to be limited to 15 per cent, but a new rule allowed foreign investors to buy up to 50 per cent in a parent company controlling a television subsidiary. In the case of foreign investors with complex corporate structures, control over companies holding television licences could easily be retained under this rule. Although television companies without a parent company were limited to a total of 20 per cent foreign ownership, they could easily alter their corporate structure to fit within the new rule allowing 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the amendments were passed, the Labor Party opposed them, so when they came to government, one would have expected them to act immediately and reverse the situation. They have not done so. In fact, three successive Labor Communications Ministers have failed to act and close this outrageous loophole. The antics of the Hawke Government on this issue are nothing short of scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent history of this sorry saga bears recounting in some detail. Last December, the Australian Democrats signalled their intention to move an amendment to plug the loophole, but this was stopped when the Government pulled off its own Broadcasting Amendment Bill at the last minute. Eventually, on January 4th of this year, the then Minister, Mr Willis, issued a press release warning investors that he intended to tighten the foreign ownership rules to a limit of 20 per cent and to apply `remedial legislation' if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> This somewhat surprising-and certainly belated-move seems to have been a response to the Seven Network's receiver showing interest in foreign investors and Nine Network executives who were seeking foreign investment support for the beleaguered Bond Media. The Ten Network was already well above the 20 per cent limit which had been built up quite legally since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's announcement caused a flurry of protest from the financially-strapped networks and the Federal Opposition. This, in turn, seemed to render the Minister immobile and the Government's intentions became increasingly confused. Events were then overtaken by the election, during which the foreign ownership question was emphasised as an important election issue by the Australian Democrats alone. The fact that the Democrats were alone in raising the issue is a sad commentary on the commitment of the major parties to retaining Australian control of our television networks. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the election, the situation has remained confused on both the Government and Opposition sides. The new Communications Minister, Mr Beazley, has variously been reported as being on a collision course with Caucus because of his commitment to maintaining the 50 per cent limit on foreign ownership (AFR 3/5/90) to committing the Government to closing the loophole in the Broadcasting Act (Australia 3/5/90). Among other comments, the Minister is reported as saying that the manipulation of holding companies was `not a situation that can persist'. The Australian Democrats agree absolutely that it cannot persist and the provisions of my Bill rectify the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles involved in this situation are very clear and very simple-despite the unprincipled and politically-motivated changes of position by the Government and the Opposition. The Australian people have no difficulty in understanding the undesirability of foreign control of our television networks and they are not frightened by the demands of network owners. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Hawke Government has allowed 60 per cent of our print media to fall into the hands of foreign interests and now a Labor/Liberal/National alliance has ducked for cover while our television networks are on the brink of passing into foreign hands too. This prospect is quite intolerable as the Democrats have argued consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of an earlier Labor/Opposition error cannot be remedied by a further mistake. The problems of Australia's debt-ridden network owners who went on a spending spree after the Government's deregulation of television ownership rules in 1986 cannot be resolved by inviting foreign interests to rescue them now. Buckling under even further to the pressure of deregulation poses greater and greater threats to this country's integrity and sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA> As I promised before the election, I am now introducing the necessary amendments to the Broadcasting Act to plug this unacceptable loophole. The challenge is before both the Government and the Opposition. I fervently hope they will put Australia's interests first by supporting my Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the purpose of this Bill is to implement Australia's obligations under article 4 of the protocol to the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement on Acceleration of Free Trade in Goods. These obligations involve the removal of anti-dumping measures in respect of goods of New Zealand origin from 1 July 1990 and the application from that date of our Trade Practices Act to certain anti-competitive conduct affecting trans-Tasman trade in goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that in 1983 Australia and New Zealand entered into the closer economic relations trade agreement. That agreement recognised the unique historic, political, economic and geographic relationship between the two countries; it also recognised that the further development of this relationship would be served by the expansion of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the two governments agreed to a package of measures to accelerate, deepen and widen the relationship with a view to the creation of a single trans-Tasman market from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> An important element of this package is the protocol on acceleration of free trade in goods. The protocol provides for free trade in goods of Australian and New Zealand origin to commence on 1 July 1990. We are confident that this target will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 4 of the protocol recognises that as from the date of full free trade, that is 1 July this year, anti-dumping provisions between the two countries will no longer be appropriate. Article 4 requires the replacement of such provisions with expanded provisions of our competition laws, that is, the Trade Practices Act 1974, as from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention at this point that the New Zealand Government has already introduced legislation to implement its obligations under article 4 of the protocol. Although not identical in language, the New Zealand legislation can be described as symmetrical and complementary to the legislation that I am now introducing. We understand that the New Zealand Government is confident that its legislation will be in place by 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard honourable senators' attention is drawn to the speech by the New Zealand Prime Minister on 20 April to the Commonwealth Law Conference in Auckland in which he spoke not only of the significance of the present complementary legislative package, but also of the importance that New Zealand attaches to the development of CER. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that I am now introducing will amend both:</PARA>
<PARA>the customs legislation to remove anti-dumping in respect of goods of New Zealand origin; and</PARA>
<PARA>the Trade Practices Act 1974 to extend the provisions relating to the misuse of market power to a market in New Zealand or to a combined Australia-New Zealand market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also provide effective enforcement procedures for the new trans-Tasman provisions of the Trade Practices Act and for the complementary New Zealand legislation. It will do this by amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Evidence Act 1905. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Customs Legislation</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill amends the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988; the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975; and the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these amendments is that from the day this Bill commences, neither the anti-dumping authority nor the Australian Customs Service will undertake any new dumping investigations in relation to New Zealand goods, and any dumping action which is in progress on that day will be immediately discontinued. </PARA>
<PARA> Any securities taken in relation to New Zealand goods will be returned as soon as practicable, but in any case no later than six months after this Bill commences. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs agents and the importing industry generally will be aware that section 151 of the Customs Act 1901 already contains provisions which exhaustively define the circumstances when goods may be regarded as having been produced or manufactured in a country. It is planned to use this mechanism for the purposes of these anti-dumping amendments. To do this satisfactorily however it is necessary for the Bill to make certain minor amendments to section 151. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make clear that this Bill does not change the existing anti-dumping arrangements in respect of goods originating in any country other than New Zealand no matter how such goods arrive in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974</PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the new provisions of the Trade Practices Act which are to provide a substitute to anti-dumping procedures between Australia and New Zealand. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits a corporation which has a substantial degree of market power in Australia from taking advantage of that power in any Australian market for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor, or of preventing the entry of a person into a market, or of deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in a market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will insert a new section 46A into the Trade Practices Act which is closely modelled on existing section 46. New section 46A will prohibit a corporation which has a substantial degree of market power in Australia, New Zealand, or Australia and New Zealand from taking advantage of that power in an Australian market for the same predatory purposes as are prohibited by section 46. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also make amendments to the Act to enable the Trade Practices Commission to obtain information in New Zealand about possible breaches of the new section 46a. Under the corresponding New Zealand legislation the New Zealand Commerce Commission will be able to obtain information in Australia about possible breaches of the equivalent New Zealand provision to new section 46a. The equivalent New Zealand provision will be section 36a of the New Zealand Commerce Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Evidence Act 1905 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA>Experience has shown that competition law litigation can be complex and hard fought. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be particularly the case in actions for a breach of new section 46a of the Trade Practices Act or new section 36a to be included in the New Zealand Commerce Act. Respondents to proceedings under these sections are likely to be substantial and powerful corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Australian and New Zealand provisions contemplate circumstances where the respondent is exercising market power in one country with harmful effects in the other. In these cases evidence will have to be obtained in both countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing procedures for obtaining evidence in another country are cumbersome in the context of complex trade practices litigation. The need to obtain evidence in another jurisdiction under existing procedures could substantially delay and increase the cost of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to ensuring the new competition provisions to deal with abuse of market power in trans-Tasman markets are effective. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains a range of innovative procedures to ensure that litigation relating to these provisions can be conducted quickly and without undue expense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Federal Court of Australia will be able to issue subpoenas to be served on persons in New Zealand requiring attendance in Australia. The New Zealand legislation will empower the High Court of New Zealand to enforce these subpoenas. There are, of course, proper safeguards to ensure that this power is not abused and does not cause undue inconvenience. </PARA>
<PARA> It further provides for evidence to be obtained and submissions made from New Zealand in Federal Court proceedings by means of video-link or telephone. Where it would be appropriate to do so the Federal Court will be authorised to continue or conduct its proceedings in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill permits the High Court of New Zealand similarly to sit in Australia and to take evidence or submissions from Australia by video-link or telephone.</PARA>
<PARA> These procedures will ensure that the most efficient and effective means of conducting proceedings will be available to both courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Judgments and orders, including injunctions, made by each court in trans-Tasman market proceedings will be readily enforceable by registration in the other court. For example, under this Bill and the corresponding New Zealand legislation an injunction issued by the Federal Court in such proceedings can be directed to a person in New Zealand. On registration in the High Court of New Zealand that injunction will be enforced by the High Court in the same way as an injunction issued by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, amendments are made by the Bill to the Evidence Act 1905 to facilitate proof of New Zealand judicial, official and public documents and Acts. These provisions are for the most part based on existing Commonwealth legislation relating to the Commonwealth, States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this Bill and the corresponding New Zealand legislation is that litigation in respect of trans-Tasman market matters will be able to proceed with as little impediment as possible due to national boundaries between Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA>Operation of the New Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I wish to make a number of general comments about the development of this legislation and its future administration. </PARA>
<PARA> First, honourable senators should be aware that the scheme for the legislation and in particular the amendments to the Trade Practices Act and to the Federal Court of Australia Act and the Evidence Act, has been developed after close consultation not only with New Zealand officials, but also with a working party of representatives from our leading professional and business groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that this working group has been drawn from a wider consultative group of industry representatives which has been established to assist the Attorney-General's Department in the work being done under the Memorandum of Understanding on the Harmonisation of Business Law signed by the former Attorney-General and by the then New Zealand Minister for Justice in August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is appreciative of the assistance that the members of the working party have given to the Attorney-General's Department, often with less time than all parties would have wished, in the development of this legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-dumping actions are an administrative matter with investigative costs largely being borne by the public sector. For the future, protection from trans-Tasman predatory conduct will be afforded by the new provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The enforcement of these new provisions will be a matter for private parties or for the Trade Practices Commission through the court system. Business and industry groups have therefore expressed concerns to the Government about the potential additional cost burden that the new scheme particularly with its need for trans-Tasman investigations will place on their members. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these industry concerns the Attorney-General will be asking the Trade Practices Commission when it considers whether it should investigate a complaint under proposed new section 46a to be sympathetic to, and to take full account of, the expense and difficulties that would be involved for the complainant if the complainant, rather than the Commission, had to take action in regard to the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The final decision whether to proceed in a particular matter rests properly with the Trade Practices Commission. However, it is the Government's view that the enforcement action under section 46a by the Commission is a central element in the creation and maintenance of a competitive trans-Tasman market. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, the Government has taken steps to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission will be adequately resourced to assist industry in this regard. It is difficult to estimate the exact workload that the new scheme will generate for the Commission particularly in view of the fact that the number of trans-Tasman anti-dumping cases has not been great in recent years. However, we will be keeping the situation under close review. As the Attorney-General has already indicated we are committed to ensuring that this new scheme is successful. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has been allocated additional resources, initially involving two extra staff and expenditure of $0.146m per year. This funding will be kept under constant review and increased if necessary. No extra funding is being allocated at this time to the Federal Court as matters arising under the new provisions will be dealt with within existing court resources. Because there has been a low incidence of anti-dumping actions in recent years involving New Zealand goods, no off-setting savings are likely to be achieved through the abolition of such actions. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation is the result of co-operation between the governments of Australia and New Zealand. It is part of the wider CER exercise. The Attorney-General expressed his confidence that the Bill would have the support of all parties in this Parliament. We are grateful for the support that the shadow Attorney-General has already given this Bill. I now commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are quite suddenly today back on debate on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill and the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills. It goes to show that one has to be prepared at all times. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill is about increasing from 30 to 50 per cent the sales tax on so-called luxury cars and four-wheel drive vehicles that are above $28,000-odd wholesale or $42,000 retail. I believe that this tax, or levy, has no economic rationale about it. It was announced during the lead-up to the election as a measure to raise an extra $100m for roads. But I believe that it is nothing more than an extension of this Government's consumption tax which is imposed rather selectively. An expenditure of $100m on roads will not go very far, but I know that any extra funding on roads is a good move because of the way in which the road systems in Australia have been run down particularly over the last six or seven years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government raises ample taxes in the name of roads. In fact, it raises from fuel levies and other measures five times in excess of what it puts back into the roads and yet it is using this tax on luxury cars as an excuse to gain extra road funding. It is nothing but a jealousy tax. It is a tax to enable the Government to show its supporters that it intends to sock the rich. We on this side of the House have said for a number of years that the Government has got a consumption tax in another name, that is, sales tax. To illustrate what I mean I will quote from a speech given in the House of Representatives by Mr Snow, the member for Eden-Monaro, who said that the Government had had a series of taxation measures over the years and went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>They include the measure that we have tonight, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As with a lot of other measures that have been taken by the Government, the Bill takes away the need for a consumption tax. We need to look at whether we should go for a sales tax on luxury cars or the consumption tax . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That shows what this Government is all about when it comes to a consumption tax. It has a consumption tax and yet it denies it. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am most annoyed about with this Bill, and the reason why I have taken part in this debate, is that this increase in sales tax on so-called luxury vehicles includes four-wheel drive vehicles. That is the aspect that I am most worried about. What is the definition of a luxury car? One man's luxury is another man's necessity. These vehicles are more of a necessity in remote areas than in urban areas. In remote regions there is a necessity for safety and an ability to use certain roads in certain regions. The only luxury cars built in Australia are the LTD Ford and the Holden Statesman Caprice, which I do not believe has been totally released. They make up only 7.24 per cent of total luxury cars; the rest are imported. </PARA>
<PARA> The vehicles that are used in suburban and urban areas can be a lot smaller and lighter than those needed in remote areas where rough roads, corrugated roads, flooded roads, dusty roads and sandy roads mean a heavier, more substantial vehicle is needed. In most cases a four-wheel drive is needed. In remote areas those supposed luxury four-wheel drive vehicles double up as a work vehicle as well as a private vehicle. The average yearly mileage in remote areas is far greater than in suburban areas. Motorists in suburban areas would probably average around 16,000 kilometres a year. The minimum average in remote areas would be nearer 50,000 kilometres. The engines in lighter vehicles, mostly four-cylinder, which are used in suburban areas would wear out far more quickly if they were used in the rougher remote areas-that is, if the vehicles did not shake to pieces structurally in the meantime! Heavier vehicles are required on corrugated roads. I have already said that bigger vehicles in remote areas double up as not only work vehicles but as vehicles to take children to school. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the safety angle. Heavier vehicles are needed in remote areas as accidents are more likely to happen because of potholes and sudden flooding at night time, and a person could finish up in the bush against a tree. Over the Easter break I had the great misfortune to see a fatal accident outside my own gate. A small car got into difficulty in gravel and hit a tree. It disintegrated and unfortunately the passenger was killed. A heavier, more substantial vehicle would have stood up to the impact. This is true not only of four-wheel drives but of other standard two-wheel drives as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax puts these classes of cars needed for work and safety in remote areas into the luxury class. The Range Rover is an example of such a vehicle, noted for its independent four-wheel suspension, as is the Toyota Landcruiser station sedan; although it is nowhere near as comfortable, nevertheless it is very sturdy in accidents. I know that Range Rovers are termed by detractors-supporters of the Australian Labor Party and others-as Toorak trucks or St George's Terrace tractors but unfortunately they are lumped into a luxury class. As I have already said, someone's necessities are termed someone else's luxuries. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed sales tax is nothing but a jealousy tax, as far as I am concerned. It is being used as a measure to belt the rich and, unfortunately, the people living in remote areas. What annoyed me at the time was that it was introduced by press release. Now we have retrospectivity as well. Car dealers now have a law by which they cannot charge more than 30 per cent of sales tax on these so-called luxury vehicles and yet when this Bill, if it is passed, receives royal assent, it will be introduced retrospectively. That means that the motor dealer is caught between two lines of fire. He cannot legally charge the customer who buys the car between now and then yet, if this tax is introduced, the Australian Taxation Office will charge that dealer who will have to collect it from his customer. If the customer pays, that is one thing; if he does not pay, it is another-the dealer will be caught with the bill. I am asking: who is going to pay the difference?</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, these are my conclusions. There is a lack of sound economic rationale for introducing this new tax. It is simply a political manoeuvre which will have no ultimate benefits for the Australian economy. The nature of the introduction of the change to the legislation by press release is wrong as a matter of principle. There is concern that the new level of tax may not raise anywhere near the amount of revenue claimed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has calculated, on the basis of present sales, that it will raise $105m in one year. It also assumes that the buyers of these so-called luxury vehicles will buy at any price. That may be so the first time they buy such a vehicle, but the Government will find out that, as with most other commodities that are bought, after a price rise purchasers make sure that those vehicles or other commodities are used for a longer time before trading them in. So I believe that there will be a downturn in the sales of these so-called luxury vehicles and that the Government will collect only a fraction of that $105m. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a concern about the likely negative impact on employment and business viability in this sector of the car industry. The car industry is depressed enough. We have only two manufacturers in Australia, as it is, and I believe that with reduced sales of these cars we will see a further downturn in the industry which will cause more lay-offs of car industry workers. Unfortunately, those factories are in cities where unemployment is already at too high levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical effect of the increase will be to impose a de facto tariff on imported vehicles in direct contravention of the Button car plan. That has been expounded well in the press. It is opposed to our beliefs with respect to the reduction of tariffs an the micro-economic reform that is needed to keep Australia competing with the rest of the world. The new tax may also impinge on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are my reasons for opposing this legislation. It is an ill thought out tax. It was thought out on the run to pick up a few votes. We can lump it with other on-the-run measures that were made leading up to the election, such as the Kodak bail-out, the supposed buy-back of North West Cape in Western Australia, and all of the promises made to the greenies and radical groups. Incidentally, the Government cannot afford to keep those promises. I hope it does not keep them over the next few years because the economy could not stand it. I lump this measure with those other measures and I believe it is certainly a backward step for the car industry of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill, in itself, is severely detrimental to the interests of Australians and the Australian economy, contrary to what we hear from the Government. The legislation, in the way in which it was announced and, indeed, the way in which it is now being handled in this Senate, simply demonstrates the state of confusion of the Government since the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation was supposed to be debated in this chamber on Thursday, yet we found that because the Government was not prepared to consider the Estimates committee reports last night, it was brought on suddenly just before we adjourned. Again, the Estimates committees began today, but the Government found itself totally unprepared to consider those Estimates so this legislation was brought on again at short notice. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the way to treat legislation of this significance to the Australian motor industry. But it demonstrates the state of confusion in which this Government finds itself at the moment. Sharing in that confusion in no small measure is the Minister responsible for the motor industry, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. Of course, it also demonstrates the low priority which the Government gives to the implications and consequences of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke briefly last night, I referred to the fact that this was a tax on so-called luxury cars. I asked really what was the definition of a luxury car and whether price was a determinant. If a luxury car was to be defined on price, the Senate needed to be reminded that the price of the cars to which this tax will apply is largely fixed by the Government, not by the market, because a large segment of the retail price of these vehicles is caused by massive tariffs and also the past effect of quotas applied to the bulk of these vehicles, with the exception of two that are manufactured in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting that the level above which this tax will apply, the retail cost of a car, is $42,910. This is the inflation adjusted figure which was originally introduced by a previous government some years ago to apply to the limit on depreciation of motor vehicles. As I said last night, that was an unjustified initiative and this proposed hefty increase in sales tax on these particular vehicles is likewise unjustified. Of course, the only reason that it will apply to a couple of Australian-made vehicles is that the retail price of those vehicles has escalated faster than inflation over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA> That further indicates the way in which this legislation is an additional protective measure for the domestic industry. The prices of the two Australian-made vehicles to which this tax will apply increased faster than inflation over the last few years. That demonstrates the inefficiencies of the Australian industry, inefficiencies which are not being solved by the Button car plan. So, in effect, this is an additional protective measure. As I said, you cannot define a so-called luxury car on the basis of price because that price is due only to the effects of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> I then asked whether it was the quality of the car that determined what was a luxury car, whether it was the standards of safety, performance, equipment and finish of a car. If that is to be the definition of a luxury car, surely it is the lack of equivalent quality in Australian vehicles which is one of the major problems of our domestic industry-its inability to reach that standard. But surely because a car has a particular quality to which the Australian produced vehicle ought to aspire is no reason for calling a car a luxury car. As I said, clearly the use of the term `luxury' is a pejorative attempt by the Government to rouse the politics of envy to justify this iniquitous charge. It simply cannot be justified. It is an arbitrary imposition at an arbitrary price level, just as is the limit on depreciation. Neither of these can be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said last night, far from increasing the present rate of sales tax on these particular cars from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, the Government ought to reduce it to 20 per cent-the level that applies to other motor vehicles. At the same time it ought to abolish the limit on the depreciation value for motor vehicles, particularly as we now have in place a fringe benefits tax and substantiation requirements to ensure that depreciation claimed is validly claimed only for business purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I concluded last night, there are three questions that the Government has to answer before it can justify the introduction of this tax. Firstly, is an increase in what I have already shown to be a discriminatory tax justified? Secondly, is it consistent with the direction supposedly provided for the Australian car industry by the Button plan? Thirdly, are the revenue assumptions of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) correct? The clear answer to each of those questions is no. Firstly, the tax on quality imported cars is already discriminatory at a rate of 30 per cent and to raise it, in isolation, to this absurd level of 50 per cent puts it totally out of line with taxes levied on any other consumer items. The result of the legislation will be that these vehicles will be taxed at 150 per cent above the rate at which most other cars are taxed. This is a very dangerous, short-sighted policy for such quality cars to be singled out as the sole source of additional revenue with which to fund what are, in essence, social programs. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that some of this revenue could also be used to build new roads really makes a mockery of the aims which the Treasurer has for this money. We are all very much aware that the Australian motorist is greatly short-changed in terms of the revenue paid to benefits derived ratio. That is true for motorists in general, but it is even more true for motorists who buy vehicles at the quality end of the market. Motorists already contribute disproportionately to Government revenue. We have seen the price of fuel rise by 20 per cent in recent times and most of that rise is a result of government excise duty. In the last financial year the excise duty on petroleum products amounted to about $6.3 billion. There are, therefore, ample funds within that revenue to be tapped in order to build additional roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian motorist already contributes some 12 per cent to all Federal Government revenue and 14 per cent to all State government revenue, and that excludes revenue received from such things as speeding fines and other motoring offences. </PARA>
<PARA> An increased tax on quality motor vehicles will have a significant impact on the pricing of these vehicles. It has been estimated that there will be a cost increase of some 13 per cent, and that will have a devastating effect on that market segment which is already in decline as a result of the effect of high interest rates and the economic recession into which this Government had led us. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague is quite right. Of course, another detrimental effect of the legislation will be that it will threaten employment and investment in property, buildings and equipment by vehicle importers and the distributors and retailers of these vehicles. The protection of the domestic industry is often justified in terms of the investment and employment that it encourages. This claim completely ignores the investment and employment that is generated in the distribution and marketing of imported vehicles. This is a further impost which will directly threaten that employment and investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also raises questions about this Government's commitment to free trade. No doubt we will be viewed askance overseas for introducing what is, in effect, an additional protective measure. It may not strictly conflict with the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, because it is a tax, but there is no doubt that, in terms of the effect of its application, it is a protective measure. Certainly, overseas countries looking at our trade record will view it as such and view this Government as hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I raised concerns whether this tax is consistent with the aims of the Button car plan. Of course, after the events of last week we are not quite sure what the Button car plan is all about when we hear from the Treasurer that Senator Button has been dragging the chain in reducing protection for the motor vehicle industry in order to make it more competitive. As I understand it, the fundamental aims of the Button plan used to be to bring the price of cars down, to use imported vehicles as a pressure point on local manufacturers to make them maintain productivity and quality of vehicles and thereby ensure that Australia developed an efficient automotive manufacturing industry which was capable of exporting quality vehicles at a competitive cost to world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax increase is totally inconsistent with those aims. It raises the ceiling price up to which the price of domestic manufacturers' vehicles can move and therefore relieves them of competitive market pressures in any realistic sense. It also makes it harder for Australians to afford quality motor vehicles and enjoy the safety which such vehicles provide. Furthermore, it places the latest automotive technology beyond the reach of the average Australian motorist by making quality imported vehicles even more expensive and, again, by relieving market pressure on local manufacturers to develop similar technological advantages in domestic vehicles. This, in turn, has a negative impact on Australia's capacity to develop an export market for motor vehicles because the technology and quality which manufacturers will offer will not be up to world standards. </PARA>
<PARA> If people question the protective effect of this tax, they need only remember what happened in 1986-87 when, because of the devaluation of the Australian currency, the prices of imported vehicles were forced up dramatically. The result was that the retail price of locally manufactured vehicles also shot up in order to fill the vacuum left by imported vehicles. This dramatically shows how imported vehicles, when they are allowed to be priced competitively and do not have unrealistic tariffs and these sorts of unrealistic taxes applied to them, can keep price pressure on local producers. The events during that period also showed what happens when this price pressure is removed. Again, we see the lack of justification for this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question concerned whether the Treasurer's numbers were correct with regard to the revenue that this tax might raise. Clearly, the answer to that question is no. The market for the cars to which this tax will apply was running at a going rate of around 15,400 units during the 1988-89 financial year. However, during the last quarter, as a result of the recession into which the Government has plunged us due to its high interest rate policy, the going rate declined to under 11,000 units-roughly a 30 per cent decline. If the legislation is passed and the tax is introduced, this increase will indeed be the straw that breaks the camel's back with regard to this segment of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this segment of the market already pays its way with regard to revenue raising in Australia. Under the current tax and tariff duty structure, Government revenue taken on imported cars in this segment of the market is roughly equivalent to the landed cost of bringing those cars into Australia. In other words, Government tariffs and taxes double the price of these cars in Australia. To put it another way, the Government revenue, through taxes, gains half of the retail price of these cars for its own coffers. As I said, this segment is already contributing more than its fair share to Government revenue. There is also additional revenue through the fringe benefits tax, stamp duty and registration fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the assumptions of the Treasurer with regard to the revenue implications of this tax. We can assume that the average cost of an imported car to which this tax will apply will be around $86,000. If one assumes a going rate of 15,400 vehicles, which it was in the  1988-89 financial year, the total revenue collected would be approximately $200m in duty and $247m in sales tax-a total of $447m. </PARA>
<PARA> If the market remained at that level, then the additional revenue the Treasurer predicted would indeed be raised. That ignores the real world situation of sensitivity to price in the marketplace. The Treasurer also seems to have ignored that this segment of the market has already declined to a going rate of about 11,000 units per annum. That gives a significantly lower revenue figure. That number of vehicles would provide tariff duty of $142m and sales tax of $174m, a total of $316m. So the Government has already lost $130m in revenue compared with last year, simply because of the fall off in the market as a result of the current recession. That represents more than the additional revenue the Treasurer is hoping to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> Further than that, we need to consider what will happen to that going rate of 11,000 units once the additional tax applies. It would appear now that that will drop back to at best an annual rate of 9,800 units; the most likely result is a going rate of 8,000 units. Between May and October of this year it is estimated that the going rate will fall, indeed, to 5,100 units, because of the pull forward effect which the application of this sales tax from 1 May has had on the market, but then will rise to about 8,000 units per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> So we see from that that there will be significant loss in revenue-something of the order of $60m or more. In fact, at best the introduction of this additional sales tax will be revenue neutral, but the most likely result will be a loss of revenue for the Government. That further ignores the loss of additional revenue from the fringe benefits tax, stamp duty, and so on through the lower number of vehicles sold. </PARA>
<PARA> So those three main questions are all answered in the negative when an analysis is done of this proposed tax. If the Government deems it necessary to raise additional revenue from the motor industry on top of all the revenue which I earlier mentioned is currently raised-some 12 per cent of total revenue for the Commonwealth Government and 14 per cent for the State governments-if the Government wants to be even more rapacious as far as the motor industry and motorists are concerned, then surely the best decision would be a modest increase in sales tax on all motor vehicles. This would give a much more secure revenue base and would not be as disruptive to the market as this proposed tax. Of course, it would avoid those three specific problems that this tax will cause. This tax really is more in keeping with a Third World country than with a highly industrialised country. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax particularly penalises imported vehicles. This may be seen by some people as helping to restore the balance of payments. I recall last night in the brief debate that ensued on this legislation that Senator Maguire interjected about the balance of payments when I was speaking. The simple fact is that this segment of the market has minimal detrimental effect on our balance of payments. I understand that it is something less than one per cent of our total imports and, therefore, has virtually no effect on our balance of payments whatsoever. So that is simply a fallacious argument. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that it will have detrimental effects on the quality of locally manufactured vehicles. That not only relates to keeping competitive pressures on the domestic market and improving the safety of motoring in Australia, but it also has environmental impacts. So there is a greenhouse issue involved in this matter. We need in Australia, as Senator Button himself has recognised, continual competition from imported vehicles. That simply will diminish as a result of this legislation. None of the assumptions on which the Government has based this legislation can in any way be sustained. The legislation is totally unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, imported cars in this segment of the market are not a problem as far as Australia's balance of payments difficulties are concerned. The tax is certainly unjustified in terms of Australia's general approach to free trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It works directly against the principles laid down in the Button car plan. It is directly discriminatory against a segment of the automotive industry which, as I have indicated, is already overcontributing to government coffers. It is in danger of eliminating from the industry some participants and dealers. The consequence of that will be a loss of investment and a loss of employment in the industry. Of course, that will throw many more families on to the dole queues. It is not only those that sell these vehicles, it is also those that service them and those that repair them that will lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of revenue, the best result will be that it is revenue neutral. The Treasurer will not gain the extra tax he is seeking from this measure, but the most likely result is that it will be revenue negative. Because of the decline in the market for these vehicles there will be a direct loss of revenue. It will also distort the market and the capacity of Australian consumers to buy freely the best, safest and most environmentally sound and fuel efficient vehicles available on the market. It will really make this country a joke in terms of international regard for us. It will make us look more and more like a Third World country that simply relies on heavy protection to sustain an inefficient domestic industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth considering, before I conclude, that it was the Treasurer who last week criticised Senator Button for dragging the chain with regard to the reduction of protection generally and in particular with regard to the motor industry, for his failure to reduce tariffs quickly on that industry. Yet it is the Treasurer who introduced this legislation, this 50 per cent sales tax on a particular segment of the import market, which will have a significant protective effect on the domestic industry. So who can believe the Treasurer when he criticises Senator Button for dragging the chain on protection when it is the Treasurer who, in the same week in another place and this week in the Senate, seeks the passage of legislation which will have perhaps an even greater impact on the price of these vehicles and, therefore, a reduction in competition for domestic industry than tariffs have?</PARA>
<PARA> So on all these grounds I personally strongly oppose this legislation, as do my Opposition colleagues. We will be opposing it when the various questions are put. I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to withdraw this legislation and, while it is doing that, also to withdraw the depreciation limits which apply to the same vehicles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly in support of this amendment for two reasons. One is that with our current balance of payments imbalance, we need to clamp down on unnecessary imports, especially luxury goods-not just motor vehicles, I would say, but other luxury goods as well. I add for good measure that there are a lot of other things we do not need to import, particularly military equipment, which through the last decade has cost this country over $1 billion a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other reason for supporting this tax is that we need to discourage the purchase of expensive and luxurious cars. Nobody really needs a luxury car, any more than anybody needs a $20,000 high fashion outfit or a million dollar house. We have looked askance at communist bureaucrats in their limousines in Moscow and Beijing; we laughed at the Bhagwan's 83 Rolls-Royces; and some of us remember Lady Docker's gold-plated Bentley in England-a cast of gross extravagance. In East Africa, the new middle class is known as the wa-Benzi, or the people who show their newly acquired wealth by getting a Mercedes Benz-a particularly crude display of extravagance which is singularly inappropriate in countries where many live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in a democratic society such as Australia we cannot stop people buying luxury cars, so the best we can do instead is to tax them as heavily as possible. If people can afford $42,000-a conservative estimate for some luxury cars-they can either pay a few thousand dollars extra by way of the tax or buy a more sensible, cheaper vehicle. I cannot agree with Senator Chapman's assessment that jobs will be lost. In fact, the purchase of more Australian made vehicles might be a healthy step in the right direction for the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of the car in Australia needs a drastic reassessment. The emphasis now needs to be on small, fuel-efficient cars and not expensive gas-guzzling vehicles bought for pomp and show. In a society where many people cannot afford a car or choose rather to walk or to use a bicycle or public transport, the import of luxury cars is a gross display of unnecessary extravagance. </PARA>
<PARA> With concern over the depletion of the ozone layer, increasing pollution, the run-down of our oil reserves and growing demand for improved public transport, Australians will soon have to think again about the way we relate to private motor vehicles. We are all concerned about the carnage on the roads and the destruction of our inner cities to make way for freeways and car parks. That has to be reassessed and has to stop, too. We have been a servant to the private motor vehicle for far too long. There will have to be a combined effort, based on public education and legislation, as we change over to greater reliance on walking, cycling, taxis, buses and trains. Linked to that we need a major effort, at both the Federal and State levels, to improve our railway system. In the meantime a tax such as this is a good way to reduce the purchase of luxury cars, and it will help to slightly reduce our balance of payments deficit as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1990 and the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills 1990. Hopefully, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is in a private hospital bed in a metropolitan Sydney hospital and not in a hospital in a remote area of Australia, he may be able to hear this Senate broadcast if he is tuned in at the end of the dial. If he is bothering to or is well enough to listen, I send him a cheerio call and wish him a speedy recovery because I fear for Australia with the Treasurer, Mr Keating, at the helm, for even a very brief time, given the way in which this legislation was introduced by press release and given Mr Keating's total disregard of the process of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pros and cons of the legislation to increase the sales tax on luxury cars from 30 per cent to 50 per cent has been debated in this chamber and in the other place at great length by the Opposition. The concerns about that tax have been more than adequately argued. I would like to add my voice to the concerns about the way in which this legislation was introduced. Mr Keating constantly demonstrates his total disregard for this process, for this place, for the other place, and for the parliamentary process. We should never forget that the Treasurer does not even bother to get his tax return in on time. He has a disregard for one of the committees of this chamber that is held in high regard throughout the Westminster system-the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who are not aware and those who are not in this chamber at the moment, that Committee comprises three Government and three non-Government members who look at each Bill to make sure that the clauses contained in them do not infringe on the rights of individuals and do not take away the rights and powers of elected parliament. The Committee looks at some other things but, basically, those are the issues which the Committee addresses. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently four of us from this Senate went to Great Britain to take part in the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation. At that conference, countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as other Commonwealth countries, were very interested in this process and in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This Committee was set up to protect the rights of citizens. Almost all Ministers respond to that Committee when concerns and queries are raised about Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1987-88 annual report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee-its latest report-reports that only one Minister had not responded to comments made to him that year. The Chairman of that Committee-a Government member-had the unenviable task of bringing this to the attention of the Senate. In that report the Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an unhappy situation when a single minister, responsible for some of the most important legislation that comes before the parliament, decides that he cannot respond to a parliamentary committee about whether legislation could undermine personal rights or parliamentary prerogatives. </PARA>
<PARA>It ought to be of concern to all Australians that someone who is a pretender to the throne of the prime ministership holds in such blatant disregard a committee which is considered, by this chamber and by the other, as one of the most important committees in protecting the rights and privileges of Australian citizens. And it was the Treasurer, who introduced this latest bit of legislation by press release. The last time I spoke on a tax Bill was in November 1988. I am not given to speaking on tax Bills very often. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. I got up to speak on that occasion because it was some taxation on non-cash business benefits. In February 1985 the Treasurer issued a press release telling people that non-cash business benefits would be taxed. Whether we agree with the taxing of non-cash business benefits or whether we agree with increasing sales tax on cars above a certain cost is irrelevant when we see the way in which Mr Keating has introduced these pieces of tax legislation. In February 1985 the Treasurer announced that there would be tax on non-cash business benefits. I would like to remind the Senate that that legislation came into this chamber 3 3/4 years later. So people who had won prizes selling Tupperware and people who had won trips for various achievements in business were left with a degree of uncertainty as to whether they would be taxed retrospectively on those benefits. I think that is intolerable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is intolerable, too, that the Treasurer announced in February the tax level on cars costing more than $42,910 would increase from 30 per cent to 50 per cent on 1 April. Then, for some reason, he changed the date to 1 May-presumably, as he said, to make it easier for the car dealers. The problems caused by that announcement and the change in the date of effect left dealers in what Mr Michael Delaney, the Director of the Motor Traders Association of Australia, has termed as an impossible situation. He said that while Mr Keating has claimed that the change of date was intended to assist motor dealers in administration, it did not do that and it resulted in the dealers being in a situation which was unacceptable. </PARA>

It also placed the Commissioner of Taxation in the unacceptable situation of not being able to implement existing law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that we, as a parliament, should accept this process. Mr Keating, the Treasurer, should be subjected-as citizens, we are subjected to putting in our tax returns on time-to the need to respect the traditions of this place. He should reply to committees such as the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills and not abrogate the role of law, issue press releases and then bring in legislation retrospectively. It is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of the argument about the tax itself-that is another debate-the process by which this legislation was introduced should be enough to convince someone like Senator Vallentine, who has now left the chamber having made her two-minute speech, that the process itself is wrong. That is why she should vote against it; that is why the Australian Democrats should vote against it. It is totally unacceptable to have this process and the sooner Mr Keating learns this, the better. Therefore, I cannot support this legislation for the reasons that have been outlined by Opposition senators, but in particular because of my grave fear and concern about Mr Keating's method of introducing this legislation and his total disregard for this place. </PARA>

As I say, my understanding is that the concerns were not raised by the Government but by the Opposition. I think this is a matter that needs to be clarified, not just for this Bill but for future legislation. Some matters were raised which seem to me to warrant some response. A lot of useful general attitudes about tax matters that were raised were standard and appropriate and do not require a specific response from me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three specific points raised concern the date of operation of the legislation and the implications of that; the revenue estimates; and the implications for our trading position overall, particularly in relation to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). I will address the date of operation question first. It is not correct to say that there are no provisions to deal with a taxpayer's obligation during the period between 1 May and the day on which the Bills are enacted. Sales tax amendments always have a date of operation, typically the date of announcement. They are not usually announced outside the Budget, but that is not unique. The explanatory memorandum sets out the situation that applies in the relevant sales tax procedures legislation. It deals with the implications that arise when a car is sold before the amendments are formally enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> People are entitled to raise their concern about what they call legislation by press release. The point of whether or not the law covers adequately the arrangements which an individual needs to make to protect his or her position as a taxpayer in relation to the Australian Taxation Office is adequately addressed in the explanatory memorandum and is set out in the normal way with regard to the sales tax procedures legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman raised the issue of revenue estimate. I am not sure whether other honourable senators did likewise because I was not able to hear everybody's contributions. I know that he did so and I assume that others did so too. This is a matter which is not capable of proof in advance. We all know that they are estimates and history may prove us all wrong. The figure may be different from that which any of us have calculated-the low figure that Senator Chapman or, as I understand from his indication, Senator Watson calculated, or the $105m that the Government has calculated. Obviously this is not the first time that these concerns have been raised in the Senate chamber. They have been raised in public discussions by politicians, economists and others. That is not unusual, of course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has completely ignored the price elasticity of demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am about to come to that. When tax changes are made we nearly always come to the question of price elasticity of demand, which is a very inexact measure, prospectively or retrospectively. But nobody knows for sure and certain assumptions are made. There seems to be some evidence that the price elasticity of demand of these higher priced products is much lower and that it tends to respond much less significantly to changes in price than would be the case with a similar tax change on lower priced products. I cannot prove that in advance but there is a fair degree of evidence that that is the situation with products such as this. It is reasonable to assume that such will be the case again. All I can say is that when these concerns were expressed publicly, the revenue estimates were rechecked and came essentially to the same conclusion. Therefore, the Government remains satisfied with the revenue estimates and does not wish to vary them in any way. Certainly the different estimates of what might be the appropriate revenue outcome are not a basis for rejecting the legislation. But the Government remains confident that that is the appropriate measure. It is a pity that Senator Watson is not in the chamber at the moment, but I welcome his support and that of everybody else for the reduction in the tax on vehicles used by people with disabilities-the so-called metrocab part of the legislation. I appreciate that and merely acknowledge that agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the GATT principles and this legislation, I have seen some press statements based on an assumption that this legislation will somehow undermine our position in the GATT. It is true that some overseas delegations have raised with Australia a concern that this legislation may have a potential impact on the import of their cars. But those people substantially represent countries which have luxury sales taxes on cars. They have very similar taxes to that which is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax which we are proposing applies to domestic and imported products, not only theoretically but also in fact, and is, therefore, consistent with the GATT principles. Although it is true that most of the cars which are affected will be imported, it is also true that most imported cars will not be affected. Less than 20 per cent of imported cars will be subject to the 50 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's overall tariff policies and the decision to abolish the tariff quotas on cars in April 1988, which did seem to escape some people in the debate, have led to a situation where we are quite confident that there is nothing in this legislation which is in any way inconsistent with the GATT principles or with the position we are arguing in the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA> The key argument is the date of operation of the tax. The evidence remains that this is the usual procedure for dealing with legislation which is necessarily announced with a date of operation in advance of the date on which the legislation passes the Parliament. The interpretation is straightforward and standard, and the law is clear and set out in the explanatory memorandum. As far as we can tell, the revenue estimate is satisfactory, appropriate and accurate and there is no breach of the GATT principles. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I welcome the debate and many of the sensible points that were raised by people in general discussion about the possible implication of this legislation and the concerns which they expressed from their philosophical viewpoint, I do not accept any of the arguments for the withdrawal of the legislation, and I will deal with the detail of the amendment when we get to the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 1, clause 2, lines 8 and 9, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend my colleagues on this side of the chamber for their very valuable contributions to this debate. I draw the Committee's attention particularly to the very moving and sensitive speech about freedoms and the rule of law by my colleague Senator Patterson. This is the thrust of our amendments to clause 2. The amendments will delete the operative date of 1 May. Our understanding is that the Bills will then come into effect 28 days after royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> I will put to the Committee our grounds for moving these amendments. First, there is the rule of law problem. Secondly, there is a lack of sound economic rationale for the introduction of this tax. Having lost the vote on the motion for the second reading, we have moved these amendments. In that second reading debate, we brought to the Senate's attention the nature of the introduction of these changes to the law. Legislation by press release is wrong as a matter of principle. Our amendments seek to overcome these fundamental objections that we, and I understand the Australian Democrats, have. There will also be a negative effect on long-term employment in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has moved amendments relating to the starting dates of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1990 and the Sales Tax (Nos 1-9) Amendment Bills 1990. Starting dates are a particular problem in quite a number of pieces of tax legislation. Over the years we have debated how to best deal with these matters. Normally, the Government makes an announcement, usually on Budget night, as to when laws are deemed to commence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of very good reasons for that. Changes of one kind or another to taxation law can cause problems if they are known beforehand. Hence, the normal exercise of secrecy on the Budget. Obviously, people would be able to make windfall profits and gains if there had been an announcement of the changes to be introduced as from the Budget. In those circumstances, it is obvious that the Parliament would then introduce retrospective legislation in as much as the date of commencement of that piece of legislation would predate its passage in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I took Senator Patterson's comments during the second reading debate to refer to an almost total prohibition on that type of action. I find that strange. I was here during the last Fraser Government and that was the normal course then; it is the normal course now. As a means of operation I think it will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are other changes to taxation legislation that do not fall within that category. For a number of other reasons, it is often advisable that the starting dates of these pieces of legislation precede the dates of their passage in this chamber. For example, if the Government has alighted upon a rort in the income tax system, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has usually made an announcement that the particular loophole will be closed as of that date. That legislation has normally been passed by the Parliament. It is not acceptable to say, `This rort has been discovered. When we get round to passing the legislation it will apply as at that particular time'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Patterson-and indeed it was contained in some of Senator Watson's comments-verged on suggesting that the Opposition would no longer support that type of proposition. I find that strange. It is important to accept that the Government needs to be able to make legislation operative as from the date of its announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Some years ago we were sufficiently concerned about the Government's action on taxation measures that we wrote to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) setting out the criteria that we would accept in the future regarding legislation which had been announced by press release. One of the criteria was that the legislation ought to be introduced within six months of the date of its announcement, and when the announcement was made it was a detailed announcement so that people could operationalise their taxation measures concerning that announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> This has not always been the case. Indeed, in the last few years there have been some celebrated instances where announcements of changes of dates to legislation were made but the legislation did not appear in this chamber for more than a year. In one case I think it was 18 months. This is completely unacceptable. The government cannot say to people, `You will arrange your taxation measures with regard to this press release' and then not give them the necessary details. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the other criteria in that statement that we sent to the Prime Minister because they are really not relevant to this issue. But this matter falls outside our announcements and the statement that we made to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister as to how we would operate. However, it relates to income tax changes or company tax changes. Of course, the strict legal liability of both those taxes does not come into effect until 30 June-the end of the financial year. Pay as you earn taxpayers, and others of course, were paying in instalments over time. </PARA>
<PARA> The area which we are now dealing with does not relate to that. We have a difficulty in telling people to collect taxes-in this case a third party; people who were wholesaling vehicles to retailers-for which there is no legal basis to collect. The Treasurer said, `Go ahead and collect it, and at some stage we will get some legal support for you'. </PARA>
<PARA> In other cases, the people who are collecting the income and company taxes are not a third party as such but, legally, the Executive Government through its departmental structures. That is really quite different from a private individual being required to collect tax as a result of legislation, but with no law under which he can operate. It is a very difficult situation in which to put a private citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> As it so happens with regard to this legislation, the amendment probably does not make a great deal of difference to Government revenue because, as everybody already knows, one cannot buy a car now without the sales tax already having been paid on it. If one looks at the sale of luxury vehicles in the last couple of months, it is fairly obvious that any luxury vehicle anywhere in Australia technically has already been bought by somebody. Normally, most of the cars one sees in showrooms are not the property of the retailer. Every luxury vehicle that one now sees in a showroom in Australia is the property of a retailer. The reasons for that are fairly obvious. Marketplace pressures have forced people into undertaking that commitment, which is unfortunate for many retailers who now carry very large loans, which they had to raise to be able to pay for the vehicles that are sitting on their floors. I suppose that they are hoping that the sales will continue. One could not sell a luxury vehicle with the new sales tax on it either this month, next month or probably for the next few months, because such vehicles are still available at the old sales tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence, whether the amendment moved by the Opposition is passed or not will make no difference to Government revenue. Since there is no revenue difference, my Party, having supported the principle of increasing the tax on luxury vehicles-it has been a policy of my Party for many years that these taxes be levied-believes, however, that it needs to be done correctly. We believe that the correct manner in this case is that the tax is increased in a fashion that does not leave a private individual in the community exposed to engaging in tax collection without legislative support for such collection. Hence, we propose to support the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We would have preferred to put in a date. The reason for that is that I have spent quite some considerable time over the last few years arguing that we ought to have dates in legislation as to when it commences. I find it a bit strange that we are actually supporting the taking out of a date. The trouble is that it is the wrong date. I would much prefer to have inserted a date because I do not believe that this chamber should any longer simply agree to the passing of legislation, as it used to, allowing the bureaucrats to set the date as to when legislation should start. As honourable senators will know almost every piece of legislation that has come in in the last six months starts either on the date of proclamation or six months from the date of passage of the legislation. So, essentially, there is a time frame in which we give the bureaucracy the chance to get together any regulations that need to be in place at the time we proclaim legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped that the Opposition would have moved an amendment to put a date in the legislation. Unfortunately Senator Watson, who moved this amendment, is not listening. If I can speak to him on this matter, perhaps he may consider my suggestion that he has actually perpetrated another difficulty in the way he has structured this amendment by not putting in a date. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was just setting out, the Senate has now insisted dates be put in legislation. The Government, acceding to the wishes of this chamber, has issued instructions to the drafting officers that they do that. We would have preferred that a date had been entered-either the date of proclamation or six months after the date of the passage of the legislation, whichever is sooner-as a way of dealing with the matter rather than just simply leaving it wide open. Nevertheless, with that caveat I indicate that we will be supporting this amendment because it regularises a situation that we think is important. In future, we hope that the Government, in this area, deals with these taxes in a more acceptable manner and structures their operation in such a way that individual citizens are not imposed on in the absence of any supportive legislation for undertaking action for the collection of tax on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the indication by Senator Macklin that he and his fellow Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment and the request for amendment made by the Opposition. I also welcome the fact that at least he recognises the administrative incom- petence of the Government in the way it has introduced this legislation. That administrative incompetence only compounds the policy incompetence we have seen with the introduction of this 50 per cent tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin has just raised with the Opposition the matter of why we did not put in a specific date for the legislation taking effect. The reason is quite simple. This amendment and the request for amendment, which, it appears, will now be passed in the Senate with the support of the Democrats-they have indicated support for our amendment-will have to be considered by the other place. We do not know what that process will be, what time consideration will take, whether the House will be recalled or whether this matter will be left to be considered in the Budget session. Therefore, it would be most unwise to put a specific date in the legislation, and it will take effect as from 28 days after the legislation receives royal assent. Therefore, we are not bound to a specific date which may become irrelevant if the other place has not dealt with the legislation before that date. I hope that Senator Macklin will accept that reasoning on our part. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the main reasons for moving this amendment is that, under section 70d (1) and (2) of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1930, it is a clear offence to require payment of an amount in excess of the amount of the sales tax which may be properly charged. It would be an offence for a wholesaler of vehicles to seek to charge the 50 per cent sales tax before an Act to levy such a rate was passed by this Parliament, received royal assent and took effect 28 days later. As Senator Macklin has said in his remarks, this tax announcement is not the same as other tax announcements which are often made in advance of legislation where the tax is collected by the Government itself. In this situation, the dealers-that is, private business persons-will be required to collect the tax on behalf of the Government and, as I have said, would be acting illegally in doing that. For the Government to apply legislation in a way which makes private citizens act illegally is simply not good enough. That is quite a different situation from the Government acting illegally by collecting tax in advance of legislation. The dealers would clearly be acting illegally and would be subject to heavy penalties for doing so. On the other hand, if they charge customers only the 30 per cent tax which the existing legislation provides, they would later be hit retrospectively by the Australian Taxation Office for the additional 20 per cent and possibly penalties as well and they would not in any way be able to recover legally that additional 20 per cent from their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not good enough for the Government to put dealers, private citizens and private business people in this double jeopardy situation by trying to force them to collect from consumers taxes which are illegal and remain illegal until the appropriate legislation is passed through the Parliament to change the existing law. That is why the Opposition has moved this amendment. I urge the Committee to support the amendment, and I welcome the indication of support from the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to express some pretty grave concern about the step which the Opposition and the Australian Democrats appear about to take on this matter, not because the Senate does not have the right either to make the request or pass the amendment in whichever way it is appropriately couched-quite clearly, it is a matter within the authority of the Senate, so I am not raising a concern in terms of proper rights-but because I think we are acting in ways the consequences of which are not going to be desirable, based on some information that is less than adequate. It is going to cause problems, not for the Government or the Australian Taxation Office, because the money has not been forwarded to the Taxation Office-the consequences of this change are not going to be refunds which the Taxation Office has to make-but for wholesalers and retailers. It is going to have very odd effects out in the marketplace, and it has some consequences in terms of proper political process that I think have not been considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin outlined more adequately than I have heard anybody else do the essential rationale under which sales tax legislation always takes effect from a date before that on which the amendments to the tax are formally enacted. He quite correctly outlined that principle. It is a proper principle and one that has been applied by governments of all political persuasions for many years and will continue to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I can tell this legislation is not unique, but I am not in a position to cite chapter and verse, so for the moment I will assume that it is, although I think that is not the case. What distinguishes this legislation is that we had an incumbent government saying, `If we are re-elected we will change that sales tax legislation'. If the Opposition and the Democrats say that that is a variation to the normal procedure which a government is not entitled to make, they are saying that sales tax rates are not matters which effectively can be issues in the election, because the date of operation will have to be some time at least two months after the date it is announced, possibly more. In fact, if this procedure is undertaken, it will be four months. The commercial, political and electoral consequences of that are absurd. I ask Opposition senators to just think about that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the point, but I did not expect Senator Chapman to understand. The point is that, in terms of proper process, it is entirely appropriate and normal, and the practice of all governments of whatever political flavour, carried by this chamber on many occasions, to have dates of operation that are prior to the final enactment of the legislation. That is necessary and, as far as I know, unchallenged, although some of the things honourable senators said in the debates seemed to challenge it, but I am sure that is not what they meant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rights of taxpayers, as I outlined in the somewhat belated response I made to the second reading, are protected in the proper discharge of their duties under the Act by the Sales Tax Procedure Act 1934. So that problem does not really arise. What we have is a slight variation on the usual practice of Budget or economic statement announcement of sales tax changes and the introduction of legislation. That would be a problem if this were a Bill introducing new definitions into the sales tax legislation, saying, `A new category of goods is going to be defined and, therefore, the tax on that will be different and, therefore, you have to guess what we mean by this new category'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the case on this occasion; an existing, precisely defined category which everybody knows and understands is being shifted to a new rate. There is no question of details which the taxpayer might reasonably be required to know being unavailable. There is no missing detail because there are no changes of definition. There is no doubt about which products are affected. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to think about the consequences should these amendments and requests be carried. We are saying that such distortions that have taken place in the marketplace caused by the lapse of time between the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and 1 May, the consequences of which for certain retailers seem to be a cause of concern, at least to the Democrats, are going to be exacerbated. We are going to have, certainly for a short time, uncertainty about what is going to happen at all because the Government will take some time to say what it is going to do in response to this. Even if the Government is prepared to accept this proposal, we then have a situation where it is some six weeks of further delay in the application of this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Intelligent, informed senators on the other side of the chamber are concerned that the delay that has taken place in trying to get legislation has caused some adverse consequences to people who may have excessive stocks and that now we are saying that they have to do it for a further six weeks; that we are saying, `Here, we will make this problem more difficult for them'. It is very straightforward, and it is a serious problem. Even Opposition senators, senators who hold the balance of power, have an obligation to think about the consequences of their actions, and I ask them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that this is a big administrative problem for the Government. It is almost certain that none of the money that has been collected has been forwarded to the Government. It is likely that the first effective date on which it would need to be forwarded is 21 June. So I am not saying that the Government is going to be caused great difficulty; I am saying that the market and the operators out there are going to be caused great difficulty-it is a very straightforward point-and for no net gain. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not understand the great point of principle that distinguishes this from the normal sales tax procedure. I do appreciate that we may have found ourselves in a new situation-in the experience of those of us here, though I think not unique-with regard to how, when an announcement about sales tax policy is made in an election context, the date of operation is determined. I do not think we want to create the situation where that is not a matter that can properly be debated in an electoral context and such announcements cannot be made. It seems to me to be a perfectly proper democratic process that it ought to be able to be debated, but if it is the desire of the Opposition or the Democrats that there be some discussion, some dialogue, about how such matters ought to be dealt with in an election context, I am very happy to participate in that dialogue-this does not seem to be the best place or context in which to initiate such discussion-so that we can have a clear and, hopefully, agreed enunciation of the principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always understood that the principle that sales tax operates from the date of announcement has been an agreed principle in the past. If we need to say, `Let us look at how that principle applies when sales tax is an issue in an election, when the Parliament is not sitting and there is no capacity for the Government to take such an initiative', let us do so. But let us not try to do it after we have made a change, the consequences of which are adverse. Some people say they are minor. That might be the case, because we do not know, in terms of tax collection, but the market consequences are not irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent I think the Opposition is putting an imposition on the people it is trying to help. I suggest that with all those arguments compounded by the drafting matter which Senator Macklin has raised, it would be much more appropriate if the legislation were to be passed as originally introduced by the Government. If people do detect a new element of principle about dates of operation of sales taxes, let us have a debate about that principle separate from this legislation and try to come to some agreement about how proper practice might be pursued in the future, but not at the expense of this legislation and with the consequences that will follow from this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity of welcoming Senator McMullan to his new post as a Parliamentary Secretary, particularly with his involvement in taxation legislation. I believe that his thoughtful mind will bring a refreshing change from some of the dogma that has pervaded debates on these matters in the past. I believe it is indeed refreshing to hear from Senator McMullan, as the spokesman in this area, his concern about the consequences that will be felt by some of the people who are going to be affected by this legislation. I only hope that this concern is not confined to this particular legislation. I hope that Senator McMullan's interest, enthusiasm and concern will be translated into Bills that are yet to be debated during this session of this Parliament, because similar issues about the effect of Government legislation on particular people will undoubtedly be raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind Senator McMullan in relation to the setting of this date, 1 May, that it is the Government that has control of the parliamentary calendar-when parliament sits and when matters are debated. It is no use Senator McMullan appealing passionately to the Opposition, saying, `We are sorry, but we now appeal to the Opposition to try to get the Government off the hook, not to embarrass it'. After all, it is the Government's responsibility for its present dilemma. It got it wrong. It is the Government's proposed legislative amendment that offends this principle of the sanctity of the rule of law. It is the Government's legislation that offends its own principles, as explained in the Legislation Handbook issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That handbook outlines the sorts of issues that should be subject to press release but not those as manifested in this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in accord with the principle laid down in that Prime Minister and Cabinet handbook, that where there is significant lost revenue, or abuse, the sorts of procedures that the Government has adopted today are not necessary under those guidelines. But there is absolutely no excuse for adopting the procedure and the particular date the Government has chosen in the circumstances under review. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to repeat, but I would like to acknowledge, the explanation that has been given by my colleague Senator Chapman as to why, as an opposition, we did not put down a specific date in replacement of 1 May. Again, we as an opposition, have no charge for or control over the parliamentary calendar and, if we had put down a date, the Government could very conveniently had led the Opposition into the same situation as the Government has found itself in. We are not going to be led into that trap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a couple of comments. I accept a number of the points that were raised by Senator McMullan. I think they are correct. But, as Senator Watson has just pointed out, the Senate did not come up with this legislation. It did not actually timetable it, and it did not organise it. It is now dealing with it in the time frame in which the Government wished it to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not. It would probably have come on in a couple of days time, so the Government is getting this debate early. With regard to the uncertainties that may arise, again, they are not caused by this chamber; they are caused by the Government. It was not required to engage in this type of operation. I am not sure why we have had the long discourse about the election; possibly there is something in the second reading speech which I did not hear. I think that in an election campaign it is perfectly open to a government to say that if it gets back into power it is going to raise taxes on luxury cars and so on. That is the essence of an election. It has nothing to do with how the legislation is finally dealt with, however. The Government may suggest the starting dates it wants, but it is up to Parliament to determine which starting dates it gets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This particular instance is quite different, as I suggested before, in terms of the Budget context. The whole exercise has been dealt with in a very expeditious manner. But it is turning into a very dragged out matter and, as I understand Senator McMullan, it is likely to be dragged out even more as the Government contemplates what to do about it all. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to that, there is one issue that sometimes gets a run in the press-and if Senator Walsh were here undoubtedly he would be out of this chamber in a flash, raising it again-and that is the bit about the House of Representatives. I will state very clearly my party's position with regard to the House of Representatives. We will deal with legislation as it is presented in this chamber. I am terribly sorry, but I cannot say that we will do any more. We will deal with it as it is presented in this chamber. Whether the House of Representatives is sitting is irrelevant to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Opposition will not take that position on other Bills which we may be debating in a few days time, such as the wool tax legislation, but our position is very clear: whether the House of Representatives is sitting is irrelevant to amendments which are presented to Bills which come before this chamber, from our viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wishes to reorganise the sittings of the House of Representatives to take account of what happens in this chamber, that is fine. But it is in the Government's hands. If the House of Representatives comes back again it will not be a massive imposition, considering it has sat for seven days in the first half of this year. Members of the House of Representatives are not likely to be worn out by that particular exercise. It will only take them a minute or two to dispose of this legislation, as they never have a committee stage and do not debate legislation anyhow. Dealing with this in the House of Representatives will not stretch anybody's brain power or endurance. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to make that very clear. Senator McMullan did not raise this, and he may feel I am getting overwrought. He did not raise the House of Representatives as an excuse but I thought he was about to get to it so I thought I would pre-empt it in case he was coming back to it. The legislation can be dealt with by the House of Representatives returning, if that is deemed to be an efficient way of dealing with it. I suggest, in terms of a cost benefit analysis, it would be an appalling way to deal with it. I have here motor vehicle registrations for the month of February compared with March. We find that BMWs have gone up by 112 per cent; Jaguars and Daimlers by 264 per cent; and Rolls Royces by 300 per cent-that is only from four registrations to 16, but considering the cost of those cars, that is extraordinary. </PARA>

<PARA> It is fairly obvious that there is no way in the world that those types of volumes could be sustained in a normal market. In fact, the market has already had a hiccup built into it, and that hiccup will take six to 12 months to be ironed out. In fact, the dealers do not expect that to be sustained. They expect a fall-off in retail sales not only back to the February mark-which, in itself, was historically on a high because of a number of factors such as transport strikes-but much lower. The effect of this tax, of course, is also likely to depress the market, although the length of time over which this will occur is difficult to predict. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I think there is unlikely to be any revenue collected from this exercise for quite some months. Hence, I think it is probably a matter for the Government to deal with in the House of Representatives in the Budget session, without any loss of revenue. I do not think there is an issue involved here. If any tax has been collected and I would find it strange if there has-that is, if any comes through-there will be a small number of items which will be able to be dealt with with administrative ease. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that already Senator McMullan seems to have fallen into the Yes Minister exercise of saying that it will be administratively difficult. We might hear about the constitutional difficulties shortly and a number of other problems. It is not administratively difficult; it is administratively easy. There are, in fact, no hitches or problems with changing the date. The whole thing will be capable of being worked out in a very easy, simple and straightforward fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no problems with the documentation of this whole exercise. People would not pay in the order of $300,000 for a car and then not want the dealer to know where they were. They want the dealers to know precisely where they are, because all the cars will still be under warranty. Therefore, everyone's whereabouts will be easily ascertainable. I think it was a good try in terms of Senator McMullan creating a few problems, but there are none. It will be a simple, straightforward matter. It can be dealt with either when the House of Representatives returns next week, as has been foreshadowed, or, if it does not come back, in August when, in terms of the revenue, the situation will be identical. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the recently discovered community recognition that a properly structured superannuation scheme provides the best opportunity to enjoy the increasing longevity which most of us can look forward to. However, there are a number of salient statistics that I think make it imperative that we address the issues sooner rather than later. There are currently some 1.9 million persons over the age of 65 and about 2 per cent of the population are currently over 80 years. The Bill for age and veterans pensions is around $10 billion per annum and the tab is currently being picked up by six persons in the work force for every one elderly person. Within 30 years the position will be quite different. Those over 65 will have more than doubled to 3.9 million, almost 20 per cent of the population, and there will be only three persons in the work force to support each one of them. The number of persons over 80 will have trebled to approximately 6 per cent of the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This rapidly growing army will be the most intensive users of a vast range of health and community services. Our capacity to provide proper care to contribute to their enjoyment of life will be significantly diminished if the numbers of those dependent upon welfare, as almost 78 per cent are today, remain at current levels. It is therefore imperative that we put in place as quickly as possible an effective retirement incomes policy which will give the vast majority of the population a proper retirement incomes policy for their later years. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some of the remarks of Professor Bettina Cass, who in many ways has been a leader in the debate in this area. In June of last year she set out the basic principles of an equitable and sustainable retirement incomes policy. We do not cavil with the bulk of those. Certainly to the extent that it is necessary to have economic security, psychological security and stability we fully recognise that need. The adequacy question, as she describes it, requires sufficient income to meet not only basic needs but the requirements necessary to participate fully in the social life of the community. Superannuation pensioners, as she points out, currently provide only about 10 per cent of people's income in retirement. In many ways that is the nub of the problem. It is therefore profoundly significant that the ageing of the population is a challenge to all taxpayers. The Superannuation Bill 1990 is one that our descendants will have to face up to in the same way that current taxpayers are finding that their liabilities are ever increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The savings investment gap, that is, the shortfall of domestic saving compared with investment, is currently of the order of 5 per cent of gross domestic product, which is about the current proportion constituted by the current account deficit. It is clear that substantial increases in savings must be the top priority. People must be encouraged to save for their own retirement. In order to do that it is a matter of ensuring that there is a higher lever of productivity in order to contribute to higher levels of funding. It simply solves nothing if we attempt to address the problem by transferring funds from employers to employees or on to superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Our gross foreign debt at present, as we are all acutely aware, is approaching $150 billion. Australia now has a downgraded credit rating and higher risk premiums. As a result, domestic interest rates are much higher than they ought to be because of the shortage of savings. All of those factors make it imperative that we should attempt to boost the savings ratio as much as possible. Again, one of the significant difficulties we will have to face is that simply transferring funds into superannuation funds will not necessarily solve the problem because there is likely to be a significant substitution effect which will simply mean that savings are being transferred from one vehicle to another. It is imperative that we get the total level of savings much higher than it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal package which the Senate is currently addressing involves the introduction of a new Commonwealth superannuation scheme which is said to bring the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements `substantially into line with the private sector'. To some extent this is a euphemistic description which disguises the fact that the Commonwealth has been exceedingly generous in the past and is now exceedingly anxious to reduce its commitments under what has to date been a totally unfunded scheme, currently costing some $896m, just to maintain current levels. It has been estimated that there is something in the order of $50 billion of unfunded liabilities in existing Commonwealth, State and statutory authority schemes. The new scheme, which will be optional for existing employers to join-optional for a period of 12 months; it will be compulsory for new members-will be funded only as regards future liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of positive aspects to the new legislation. Employer contributions will fully vest after four years, although we take the view that that ought to be a much faster timetable. This is in stark contrast to the existing regime, under which employer contributions do not vest at all until retirement, causing many thousands of contributors over the years to miss out altogether. It also allows temporary employees to join the scheme after three months as of right and not, as under the old scheme, after one year and then only subject to approval. It also adopts the new reasonable benefits limits (RBLs) which will be based on highest salary over three consecutive years, a much fairer system than the current final average salary and one which is designed to ensure that those who choose to scale down their employment prior to retirement are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the old scheme the employee contribution was fixed at 5 per cent, compared to an employer contribution of up to 18 per cent. Whilst this imbalance certainly delivered bonanzas for many, it did little to encourage responsible saving by employees. The new scheme introduces a new flexible approach which allows employees to contribute between 2 and 10 per cent depending on the current economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> However, whilst this has a superficial attraction of being geared to capacity to pay, I would strongly suspect that for many workers it will simply provide an opportunity to scale down to the minimum and thereafter never have the discretionary income or the savings will-power to make up the difference later, thereby simply compounding the inadequacy of the scheme as a serious attempt to replace the current arrangements. It will be necessary for employees to average something of the order of 5 or 6 per cent of their contributions over their lifetime in order to maximise their entitlements under the reasonable benefits limit regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Commonwealth hopes that in this area employees will take that on board as a self-imposed discipline. I would have thought it is very likely that human nature suggests that they will do that only with a much greater level of incentive or, indeed, discipline than is currently provided to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme effectively endorses 55 years as the de facto retirement age. That is the outcome of a deal between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Government. The former, the trade union movement, is to be commended for embracing superannuation and accepting the logic of deferred earnings in retirement as an outcome very much in the best long-term interests of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> But the gap between this early retirement norm and the current pension age, especially for males, who are the major recipients of superannuation payments, is very substantial and will inevitably constitute an overwhelming temptation for many to celebrate their departure from the work force by a round of short-term consumption expenditure items. To the extent that this involves paying off the mortgage it can be defended to some extent, although the preferred course may be, at that time in life, to trade down to a smaller home. </PARA>
<PARA> But the most disturbing aspect of the new scheme is undoubtedly the dramatic movement away from compulsory pensions to lump sums, a move which makes us almost unique in the Western world, and I suspect uniquely irresponsible, because that is what this move is. Whilst it is dressed up in pious rhetoric about providing incentive to encourage retirees to prefer pensions-and it certainly does that-the reality is that, as the Government well knows, the vast majority are likely to grab the honey pot every time, dissipate it to varying extents and then get into the double dipping trough, one of the greatest rorts in the welfare system, to which this Government is prepared not only to turn a blind eye but actually to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA> This becomes very obvious when one reads the contribution of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) in the debate in the House of Representatives. He professes to be an expert in the field. He might get high marks for initiative in trying to make a quid out of the exercise by flogging his own publication but his primary responsibility ought to be concern for the national interest, and in this area he has lamentably failed. I invite honourable senators to listen to this for the height of irresponsibility:</PARA>
<PARA>We want the right for people to have a lump sum because when they retire they want to pay off the home. The want to buy the new car. They want to take the holiday. They need the dollars in the pocket. </PARA>
<PARA>This is surely an invitation to profligacy. There is not one word about the true purpose of superannuation. It is not to update the kitchen, take the trip to Fiji or Ayers Rock; it is to provide a rest-of-life alternative to the aged pension. As usual, the Government-and one can treat Mr Wright as its leading advocate in this area, if only by default-is simply pandering to the short-term self-indulgences that tempt us all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government ought to be endeavouring to put in place an effective retirement incomes policy that will increase savings and provide a secure base for rest-of-life independence and self-support instead of effectively perpetuating the outdated notion that somehow it is the birthright of all taxpayers to pick up a pension in their old age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has totally abdicated its responsibility in this area. It has made no attempt to respond to the views of Professor Cass and others that it should not be permissible to take more than 50 per cent by way of lump sum. After all, such a proportion would allow for plenty of squandering. But to condone a situation where it is possible to take one's full entitlement in lump sum form despite the taxation incentives not to do so is a grave disservice to the taxpayers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Mr Braithwaite and Mr Connolly, rightly pointed out, this Government's retirement policy is tax-driven. It was originally the trade-off for lowering the corporate tax rate. Now it is the milch cow on which the Government will increasingly rely to solve its revenue equations. In the last Budget the anticipated receipts for superannuation funds were $885m, and this does not include capital gains and other taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we certainly support the community desire to move increasingly towards superannuation, we hope that that will be in lieu of the aged pension and we are concerned that there are very many shortcomings in the Government's present approach. An ideal retirement incomes policy has been spelled out by Eric Mayer, Group Managing Director of National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, and it certainly seems to us that there are many positive aspects to his agenda. He says, in summary:</PARA>
<PARA>Further changes are needed to produce an ideal retirement incomes policy, that encourages private provision for retirement:</PARA>
<PARA> Common pensionable age for men and women after a suitable transition period . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I pause there; to date the Government has done virtually nothing in this area other than to talk about a timetable that is very much out on the distant horizon. But it is not prepared to bite the bullet, which it thinks might somehow upset those who have had long-term dreams. I think we have to find a compromise in this area, we have to be prepared to say that there is a period of notice that is sufficient, and that beyond that people ought to have to change their retirement plans. </PARA>
<PARA> Further action is needed to reduce poverty traps, particularly in respect of pensioner concessions. I seem to recall that the proportion of those at least partly reliant on the pension is something like 78 per cent of those of pensionable age, and three-quarters of those are wholly dependent upon the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The eventual extension of preservation to age 65-earlier for special needs cases-is again, I think, a very desirable long-term objective and one which ought to have a short-term approach. Whilst we have talked about the year 2000 as being the starting point for such an approach, the Government again simply prefers that this problem will go away. That is because of the deal that it has basically done with the trade union movement to ensure that people are able to take all of the benefits at age 55. Indeed, many schemes allow earlier retirement ages and the taking of entitlements before that time. Whilst we retain that gap between that retirement age and the pension age, the longer the gap is the greater the incentive for people to double dip. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government well knows that. The answer has to be to extend the preservation age. It can be done in stages, it can be done by giving proper length of notice, but unless something is done about that then I think all we will find is the usual mirror and beads trick of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) so that some five or ten years down the track we will be looking at the statistics and saying, `All those great promises you made have not come to fruition'. But it is a bit late in the day to have the recognition at that time. It ought to be obvious to all those who plan in the area-and there are many experts in the field-that unless we take steps to extend the preservation age we will not really be able to cope with what I think is probably the greatest problem in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly capacity to extend tax deductability for all superannuation contributions up to the extent allowed by reasonable benefits limits. The RBL regime was necessary to ensure that people were not able simply to pile up all their income in their last years, when presumably they had much greater access to funds, and then take out huge entitlements at the end. But in striking a compromise between what is reasonable in terms of concessional deductions and what ought to be then taxed at the marginal rate I would have thought it is in the community's interests that everyone, not just a load of middle income earners, ought to be encouraged to rely much more heavily on their own retirement funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There ought to be a much greater pension RBL than the lump sum RBL. the extension of superannuation tax concessions to allow people not in the work force to provide for their own retirement is again something that gets scant recognition from the Government simply because its primary clientele is the trade union movement, and by definition those are people in the work force, although some 60 per cent or more of those in the private sector do not belong to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our view that much more ought to be done to cater for those, often women, who leave the work force, either to have children or for other reasons, and who then are not able to return to the work force, sometimes for a period of years. There seems no good reason why others, be it a spouse or someone else, ought not to be able to contribute on their behalf. Obviously once the contribution is made it ought to then vest in the hands of the beneficiary, the wife in the instance I have quoted, and ought to be fully portable. In that case the position of the person who may be out of the work force for some years is properly protected. That person has been given a head start prior to the return to the work force and has been given a very real prospect of having a nest egg at the end of the day. At the moment that category is simply ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other concerns that ought to be expressed about the Government's approach to superannuation. The continuing distinction between a retirement age for men and women does seem to be one that needs to be urgently addressed given that married women not only tend to be younger than their spouses by three to five years but also have a greater life expectancy, which may alter marginally as more and more married women enter the work force. I think the figure currently is in excess of 50 per cent. Nonetheless, it does seem an outmoded distinction in this day and age. We certainly take the view that steps ought to be taken to regularise that position. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way we believe that there ought not to be a compulsory retirement age. In fact, it ought to be illegal as constituting discrimination against the elderly. We understand that there are those in the trade union movement who are keen to see people move on and allow for others to enter the work force. To the extent that it reduces unemployment, I suppose the Government would have an interest in seeing that situation continue. But the reality is that with an ageing population there are many people who wish to remain in the work force as long as possible. Professor Cass dealt with this when she quoted from an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey carried out in 1986 which showed that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . one quarter of those who had reached the compulsory retirement age in their job would have liked to have continued working full-time. In addition, about 25 per cent of full-time employees over the age of 45 would have preferred tapered or gradual retirement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say that a proper policy requires:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . two fundamental policy changes:</PARA>
<PARA>the end of compulsory retirement ages and the introduction of phased and flexible retirement provisions;</PARA>
<PARA>anti-discrimination legislation on the basis of age in Commonwealth and States' jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly believe that the Government, for its own client base reasons, has chosen to ignore those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also concern that the case for increased remuneration in any form ought to be justifiable on the grounds of productivity. In that context I think it is very disturbing, despite the grand rhetoric of Senator Cook as quoted in today's Australian Financial Review, that in the second round of the 3 per cent award negotiations there is no mention of productivity. I noticed that Mr Crean claims that the actual accord agreement between the parties made mention of productivity, but there is absolutely no doubt that the Treasurer's February economic statement made no such mention. That is not only highly symbolic but it is clearly indicative that the Government has thrown in the towel on the productivity pretence. Even the first round has been quite unsatisfactory in terms of progress to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is fond of saying that 77 per cent of the work force is now covered, but the fact is that the ABS statistics as at August 1989 showed that the proportion of employees receiving a superannuation benefit is now 47 per cent. That increase includes `the impact of the spread of occupational superannuation following recent national wage case decisions'. Whilst there is a certain degree of humbug already in relation to the first round, I think it is absolutely crucial that the second round ought to be more properly addressed than it has been to date. Probably the major concern in that regard is that there are some schemes that are very generous, some people who do very well under the current arrangements and some people who have good retirement benefits but poor resignation benefits and vice versa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot comment on the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence report under the title Operation Alpha which Senator Hill refers to, but I should remind him that, in relation to links between the Mafia and particularly the growing and distribution of marijuana in this country, all Australian jurisdictions on the mainland-that is, the Federal Government and all State governments-have agreed that the National Crime Authority should conduct an investigation under the title Vigilante.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some charges are still pending rather than having been processed through the courts. The fact is that the various Attorneys-that would include successive Attorneys in the New South Wales Government, for example-have seen the National Crime Authority's investigation into Mafia related matters as being an appropriate response to the various sources of intelligence, including the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence's holdings. They have been an important source of information, no doubt, to the investigators involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even Mr Greiner in his letter to the Prime Minister concerning his request for a joint royal commission acknowledged the work of the National Crime Authority and, as I recall, dissociated himself from the attack on the National Crime Authority made by Mr Hatton.

I believe that the National Crime Authority's reference is an appropriate response by all Australian jurisdictions on the mainland to the phenomenon to which Senator Hill and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence have pointed.</PARA>
<PARA> I have made it clear, nevertheless, that if at the end of the inquest being conducted by Mr Cahill there are matters which require further investigation that would be an appropriate time to decide whether indeed the mechanism of a royal commission was required rather than continuing with the type of inquiry which is based on legislation fostered by and passed by this Parliament in setting up the National Crime Authority.</PARA>

I was disappointed to read the views that Dr Moran put yesterday, but honourable senators would be aware that Dr David Smiles from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation put a very different view to the same seminar at which Dr Moran spoke. I think it is worth noting that Dr Moran's expertise lies in the field of economics. In his haste to dispose of waste in what he describes as `the cheapest way', by dumping it in oceans, I think he is disposing of some of his economic knowledge as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never classed myself as an expert, but I, like the rest of the world, know a lot more about it than Senator MacGibbon does. Dr Moran appears to be completely ignorant of what is meant by the term `sustainable development'. That is perhaps the most regrettable part of his statements yesterday, because sustainable development will be one of the key issues facing this country over the next few years. He has failed to come to grips with the fact that economic development over time will continue only if it is ecologically sustainable. That is a sad reflection of Dr Moran's views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sustainable development is about the integration of economic and ecological values so that we can ensure that future generations can do as well, or better than, we are doing. I doubt very much that, in seeking to dump all sorts of pollutants into our oceans, Dr Moran is taking great account of the future of those who may well have to seek sustenance from those oceans. The Prime Minister stated in a publication entitled, Our Country, Our Future something that is worth repeating today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is increasing evidence that human activity is degrading the oceans through exploitation of marine resources and pollution by organochlorines, heavy metals and plastics. The Government recognises that no country acting alone can protect or manage the oceans. The Government will therefore be using every opportunity available at international forums to pursue effective international measures aimed at the protection of our oceans.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs to his answer to a question yesterday from Senator Hill in which the Minister referred to the powers of the Australian Capital Territory Coroner and the Director of Public Prosecutions to prevent self-incriminatory evidence being given in subsequent criminal proceedings. I ask the Minister: In view of the fact that the prosecutions arising out of Operation Seville failed because the principal witness refused to testify, despite the fact that he had been granted immunity from prosecution by both the New South Wales and Commonwealth Attorneys-General, does the Minister still maintain that the coroner's inquiry into the death of Mr Winchester will be able to obtain all the evidence which would be obtained by a royal commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that the coroner's inquest is designed to look into those matters relating to the manner and cause of the death of Colin Winchester. The question of how evidence might be obtained, including by way of giving an assurance of indemnity or a section 57 certificate in relation to self-incriminating answers, is a matter for the coroner in any particular instance. But I remind the Senate in relation to the inquest that, if at any time the coroner considers that a prima facie case is revealed about the commission of an indictable offence, he can charge the person and, after a certain preliminary procedure, commit that person to trial. It does not have to be an indictment in relation to the death under investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is for that reason, amongst others, that I have been cautious about the idea of having a royal commission running at the same time as a coroner's inquest. I believe it is important that the coroner's inquest continue, particularly as the coroner has indicated that he will look at Operation Seville matters in the next round, and that the inquest be allowed to run, given all of those powers, particularly the coroner's ability to commit a person to trial, that could come out of his investigation into the manner and cause of Colin Winchester's death. I acknowledge that the coroner's terms of reference are different from those that would be the case in a royal commission, but the question of whether a royal commission may be required is something that can best be ascertained at the end of the coronial inquest.</PARA>

Were any Australian citizens injured in the bomb attack, which took place at a building housing the Australian firm of TNT International Transportation Co. in Chile? Have any steps been taken to protect other employees of Australian firms operating in Chile? If so, what safeguards have been put in place to protect Australians working in Chile?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that bomb attacks took place in the Chilean capital of Santiago on 14 May at various locations, including the United States consulate, a Jewish community centre, a Mormon church, an army parking lot, and offices of two foreign owned firms, one of them being the Australian company TNT International Transportation, as Senator Jones said. One person, a Chilean security guard at the United States consulate, was slightly injured during the attack. Although there were no Australian citizens involved in the attack, the Australian Government is concerned about the safety of Australian citizens and businesses in Chile. Our embassy in Santiago is working closely with them and the Chilean authorities to ensure their security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage no-one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, although some suggest that the left wing Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, FMR, was responsible. The Front is known to have provoked a series of incidents over recent months, apparently with the objective of destabilising the new Aylwin Government in Chile. Extreme right wing organisations in Chile have also been engaging in terrorist activities. I know that the Aylwin Government is extremely concerned about this continuing violence and is making concerted efforts through policing and through political dialogue to bring it to an end. These efforts include cutting off the sources of weapons and funds for terrorist groups. I also know that many of the international firms operating in Santiago, including TNT, have made private security arrangements to supplement these efforts.</PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, Australia views with concern such use of violence, especially the attempts to destabilise a democratically elected government which is publicly committed, unlike its predecessor, to the preservation of human rights. We do support very strongly the efforts of the Chilean Government in bringing the violence to an end and thus ensuring, amongst other things, the confidence of Australian investors and businessmen in Chile.</PARA>

He made the point that Dr David Smiles of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Soils Division was also a contributor to the seminar. One could ask whether Dr Smiles also was contributing in an official capacity. The important point in Senator Coulter's question which was not answered by Senator Richardson relates to the adequacy of criteria for selecting Industry Commission commissioners. In that sense I point out that Dr Moran does not speak for the Industry Commission, as an institution, on environmental matters. He is head of the Business Regulation Review Unit, which now falls within the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter may not be aware that last Friday the Treasurer announced new appointments of commissioners to the Industry Commission, including that of Dr Tor Hundloe. He is currently Director of the Institute of Applied Environmental Research at Griffith University. He has written extensively on environmental impact assessments, the economic and social impact of development and cost-benefit analysis. He has also undertaken consultancies for State and Commonwealth governments and the United Nations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Social Security to the home equity conversion scheme initiative which was announced by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, in the August 1989 Budget. Will the Minister give details of the implementation of the home equity conversion scheme, which States in the Commonwealth have a scheme operating and how many retired persons are now enjoying the benefits of the scheme?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Colston would be aware, home equity conversion schemes are financial products offered by the private sector and, therefore, are not offered by the Government. Those schemes permit older people to borrow against the value of their homes, to receive that money either as a lump sum or in payments over time and, as it were, to repay that amount upon their death or upon permanent departure from the home. For that reason the scheme has had quite some acceptance. The Commonwealth does not operate a scheme. However, because it recognises the interests of many pensioners in these schemes, it has provided the opportunity to make use of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 1989 Budget, we announced that from 1 November 1989 the first $40,000 received under one of these schemes would be exempted from our income tests on the pension. The income test free limit was established to prevent the loans becoming a way of avoiding the income test and the assets test, but we still have to allow pensioners to borrow enough money to cover their major expenses. We have continually stressed to pensioners that they ought to be careful about these schemes and the operation of them. We have made sure that our own financial information service provides information to pensioners about those schemes. The implementation of the changed income test treatment of these schemes has proceeded very smoothly but we have no figures available for the number of pensioners using the schemes because we are not administering them. So I cannot help Senator Colston with that, although I will attempt to find out more information. As I understand it the Commonwealth Bank does not operate one of these schemes, but commercial schemes are available in three states: New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="756" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of press reports this morning suggesting that a ceasefire proposal sponsored by Thailand is close to agreement between the four Cambodian parties and may be unveiled at the meeting of Cambodian leaders which is proposed to be held in Tokyo on 4 to 6 June. Those reports are based in turn on an article which appeared yesterday in the Bangkok Post. At this stage we do not have a great deal more detail about the Thai proposal than appears in that article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bangkok Post article does, however, spend some time linking and comparing the Thai proposal with a separate one that has been advanced in recent weeks by Australia. I can say a little about that, although in the present highly fluid situation it would not be appropriate to say very much on the public record at this stage. The situation is fluid with major discussions pending among the Permanent Five members of the Security Council of the United Nations in New York later this week and in the run up to the Tokyo meeting in early June, to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian proposal evolved in the course of a recent extensive visit to the region in late April and early May by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Deputy Secretary, Michael Costello, in which he was asked by me to explore the prospects for a confidence building strategy which would hopefully give something of a kick-start to full scale negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian proposal involves in essence an agreed military standstill under the good offices of the United Nations with accompanying verification of the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from the country. It has a specified time limit and is expressly designed to lead to the negotiation of a full-scale comprehensive settlement. As I said, it would not be appropriate for me to go into any further detail or to describe reactions to that proposal except to say that the reaction generally has been encouraging. I think it would be appropriate, however, and helpful for me to add just a few words in conclusion on the underlying rationale for any military standstill, whether it be one crafted by Australia, by Thailand or by anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA> I have always taken the view that a cessation of hostilities could contribute very much to the objective of a comprehensive settlement, an objective which, of course, we share with other governments closely concerned with the Cambodia problem. In a statement to the United Nations General Assembly last October our Permanent Representative, Dr Wilenski, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, my delegation believes that the international community should be quite unequivocal in supporting any measure that would reduce the misery being inflicted on the Cambodian people. Thus not only must we do all we can to prevent an escalation in the fighting, we must also do all we can to promote a ceasefire while the search for a comprehensive solution goes on.</PARA>
<PARA>After more than a decade of hostilities, Mr President, the lack of trust and the suspicion among the Cambodian parties are very deep. An agreement to stop the fighting, even an agreement of limited duration, would be a compelling contribution to the building of confidence among the parties and, if that agreement were carefully formulated, it could unquestionably enhance the prospects of concluding a comprehensive settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> But, one last word: while a military standstill will be enormously important, it is crucial that it not be seen as an end in itself. Recent history in Lebanon I think demonstrates clearly the fragility of ceasefires which are not themselves an integral part of a long-term settlement. To be durable, any ceasefire or military standstill must form part of the overall settlement process and be directly linked to a comprehensive settlement. It is to the achievement of a comprehensive settlement that Australia's efforts will continue to be overwhelmingly directed.</PARA>

These are all responsible positions dealing with substantive policy work of importance to the Government and the country. As Senator Crowley would be well aware, it is also the case that women members of parliament have participated in Australian delegations to the UN General Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> Women officers have been among those who have worked in Australia and at overseas posts on the many high profile international initiatives in which we have been engaged in recent times. These include Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, southern Africa, chemical weapons, Cambodia, and Antarctica. There are several women officials involved with the Uruguay Round and Multilateral Trade Negotiations. There are a number of women legal officers who work on important treaty and other international negotiations, such as the Timor Gap Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health and relates to the Government's treatment of the psychiatrically disabled under the provisions of the Disability Services Act. I remind the Minister of the statement made by Senator Grimes, the responsible Minister at the time of passage of that Act, that-and I quote from Hansard of 20 November 1986-`the world will not change' and `the way I administer the legislation, in fact, it will not cost anything at all'. This statement was made during debate on the successful Australian Democrats amendment which included, as a target group, the psychiatrically disabled. What is the Government's current policy on funding of services targeted for people with psychiatric disability?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell was kind enough to give a little preliminary notice of this question, and I have received an answer from the Minister. There is no question that people with psychiatric disabilities are eligible for services under the Disability Services Act. At the present time, policy is that new services primarily targeted for people with psychiatric disabilities will receive a lower priority for funding under the disability services program. However, they are not excluded from services, and some are already receiving services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is considerable potential for overlap between responsibilities of State and Commonwealth governments in this area, as provision of services for people with psychiatric disability has traditionally been the responsibility of State governments. With the aim of delineating respective responsibilities, the disability services program has commenced bilateral discussions with State and Territory governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Industrial Relations seen the report in today's Australian quoting a spokesman for Mr Barry Coulter, the Deputy Chief Minister in the Northern Territory and the person in the Territory Administration responsible for the trade development zone, which attempts to blame the Department of Industrial Relations for award breaches by the Hengyang company? Is this true?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="760" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the comments attributed to a spokesman for Mr Coulter. I have also seen comments in the Sunday Territorian of 20 May directly attributed-at least, in quotation marks-to Mr Coulter himself on the same subject. In the Sunday Territorian Mr Coulter said that the Hengyang company had agreed to meet its responsibilities to its employees three months ago, and that it had been standing ready to do so for the past month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that comment were true there would be no need for the Department of Industrial Relations to have conducted an exhaustive investigation of the under- payment of wages. It would simply have been the case that the company would have paid the right rate and it would not have been necessary for us to discover that the total amount of underpayments came to $574,000. There is no responsibility on the Department of Industrial Relations to ensure the right rate of pay is paid. There is every responsibility on employers to pay their employees the award rate, and if they do not do that they are open to prosecution and should be so prosecuted. Whatever Mr Coulter wants to say about the Department, the obligation rests firmly with the company.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Australian newspaper article referred to in the question to me today. Mr Coulter's spokesman said, according to that article, that it is the responsibility of the Government to monitor the situation there. I inform the Senate that in November last year a representative of my Department went to the trade development zone management and reported his belief that the award was not being properly observed by this company. That representative was told by the trade development zone management, which is directly responsible to Mr Coulter, that that was not so, that the award was being observed and that all the conditions were proper.</PARA>
<PARA> At that point, innocently and naively as it turns out, we terminated our inquiry. It was not until February of this year when the Clothing and Allied Trades Union made a formal complaint that we went and investigated the company and found massive underpayment. The point is that Mr Coulter's authority-the trade development zone-turned away our initial inquiry. If there is a degree of ministerial responsibility here it rests firmly with Mr Coulter in ensuring that his trade development zone, when it receives inquiries from a body such as the Department of Industrial Relations, properly investigates those inquiries. If it had done so it would have found the massive underpayment we later found in February.</PARA>
<PARA> I reject the allegations of Mr Coulter. I say, once again, that if the Northern Territory wishes to continue the support of the trade development zone-a concept, in itself, that is an admirable one-it should root out of it the offences of this nature that are occurring and allow genuine business to get on with promoting trade in a proper way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. I preface my question by suggesting that the Minister would especially appreciate the importance of local content in rural and regional news broadcasts. Therefore, given the oft quoted commitment by this Government and, more particularly, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to the provision and expansion of services to rural and regional Australia, can the Minister explain why in Tamworth, New South Wales, in other areas such as Tasmania, and in some places in all the other States of Australia, services to rural listeners have been cut? In our particular case in Tamworth, the popular local rural news broadcaster lost his job, and that means there is a loss of local content. The Minister should not grimace and put on a face about this. Given that the ABC's Chairman, David Hill, told the Senate last year that funding was proceeding to provide two ABC signals to country listeners, are not the reductions in regional staff defeating the ABC's stated objectives to upgrade and improve country services?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not making a face; in fact I have to confess I was dropping off to sleep. The ABC has been carrying out a full review of its services around Australia for some time in order to provide the most efficient service possible to all Australians. That has involved, I freely concede, some readjustment of staffing allocations in various centres around Australia-including, I might say, my own home base in Darwin, and Alice Springs-and that has led to criticisms such as that made by Senator Brownhill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the ABC has carried out this readjustment in an extremely responsible manner. By and large there has been a distinct improvement in the quality of the broadcasts that have emanated. I am not personally aware of the difficulty attached to the announcer at Tamworth. That has not been brought to my attention, but I am happy to refer the question to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley. I will endeavour to get an answer to the honourable senator no later than this week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and take this opportunity to thank him for the message he sent to the Chernobyl telethon, which I attended in Moscow recently. Is the Minister aware of the extent of ongoing medical care and research needed following the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster in 1986?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a very gentle question, but I can assure the Senate that it was all Senator Reynolds's own work; it was not a dorothy dixer. On 26 April, the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, I sent a message to a television marathon organised in the Soviet Union to help the victims of Chernobyl, noting that Australia shared fully the international concern for the victims of this very tragic accident. Australia firmly believes that the suffering and the loss caused by the accident should not be in vain and that there are lessons which must be learnt from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this context, we have cooperated with the Soviet Union in efforts to prevent such catastrophes in the future or to minimise their effects. We have joined with it in acceding to two international conventions designed to facilitate assistance and early warning in the case of a nuclear accident. We also continue to support fully the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the field of nuclear safety.</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet authorities now state that the scale of the disaster caused by Chernobyl was much greater than was originally claimed, particularly in terms of the long term damage inflicted on the health of many of the inhabitants and on the environment in areas of the Ukraine and Byelorussia, neighbouring Chernobyl. The Ukrainian and Byelorussian governments, as well as Soviet representatives abroad, have appealed to the international community, including multilateral agencies such as the World Health Organisation and the United Nations Environment Program, UNEP, for assistance in dealing with the consequences of Chernobyl.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government supports the effort of UN agencies to provide a constructive and coordinated approach to this question. The UN Economic and Social Council is considering the issue of international cooperation to deal with the consequences of Chernobyl at its current session, and these discussions should provide a helpful framework for handling this issue in the UN system.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of the question, the Australian Government has not received any request for specific medical expertise from the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is difficult to get a precise indication of what relevant Australian expertise the Soviets might seek to draw on. A practical consideration of how this might be approached would obviously depend on the nature of any requests that might be made by the Soviet or international agencies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia. I draw the Minister's attention to the decision yesterday of the Queensland Government to abolish the Cape York-north Queensland enterprise zone at a time when it was finalising three significant projects. In view of the Minister's public support for regional development, can he give any indication that the Federal Government will offer particular assistance to growth in north Queensland, where the State Government has failed to do so? Will the Minister countenance the creation of a joint Federal and State trade development zone (TDZ) to prevent the further economic deterioration of an area already in recession and additionally suffering from the downturn in the tourist industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="762" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Government supports the development of northern Australia but, unfortunately, from my experience it has been the tendency of State and Territory governments for a very long time to consistently blame the Federal Government for all the alleged shortcomings of northern development and then to attempt to take the credit for anything that does fortuitously happen to go right in northern Australia which in most cases, at least in my own patch, has been entirely financed by Federal Government money. That is hardly surprising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I have provided that background to Senator O'Chee's question is that the question of setting up trade development zones, which is what Senator O'Chee is talking about, is absolutely and unarguably the province in the first instance of a State government. Very little case could be made for the Federal Government taking on the obligation and responsibility for setting up such a proposal. There are considerable shortcomings and dangers inherent in such proposals, exciting and innovative as they are.</PARA>
<PARA> No doubt Senator O'Chee has been paying some attention to a number of questions that have been asked in the Senate in respect of the TDZ that is currently operating-it is the only one operating-in Darwin. I was extremely interested to see the advertisements that were placed by the Queensland Government announcing its original intention to locate TDZs at both Cairns and Townsville. I was aware from its advertisements that the Government was intending to base its proposals very substantially on the same basis as that which was run by the Northern Territory Government at the TDZ in Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that in respect of the existing problems at the TDZ-they are significant problems, I regret to say-and as a resident of northern Australia I profoundly regret the appalling mismanagement of the Northern Territory Government in respect of this TDZ, and I do not say this to make any political points--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators-No!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, I do not. If honourable senators would bear with me for one minute, I will give the reason why. I am sure that Senator O'Chee would agree with this. By the very nature of the communities that we are talking about-isolated communities in northern Australia-it is always a high risk proposition to try to establish what the TDZs are principally aimed at, that is, providing a manufacturing sector for northern Australia, which it currently substantially lacks. Northern Australia has significant resources in terms of mineral wealth and tourist potential but profoundly lacks any major manufacturing infrastructure. One of the reasons for that, as Senator O'Chee knows, is the cost of establishing that infrastructure and particularly energy costs, which predicate against it. The entire point of establishing trade development zones is to give a government supported edge to enable what are essentially high risk enterprises to get off the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a substantial matter of regret to me, not just as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia but as a Territorian, that in what is known to be a high risk area the profound mismanagement that has occurred in TDZs creates a dreadful atmosphere of indecision and lack of confidence in terms of potential investors. That is precisely what has happened in respect of the TDZ in Darwin. I regret to say that there has to be some question mark placed on whether the 15 companies that were about to establish in the zone will proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure Senator O'Chee that I am very alive to the developments that have happened in Queensland because I have been watching them with some interest. Despite the fact that it is clearly a State responsibility, I am extremely keen to take up with Mr Goss-I will be meeting him to discuss this subject this week in Canberra-the reasons why the Queensland Government took the decision that it did. But I must say that it is probably not entirely unrelated to developments, regrettably, in Darwin.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the reason that I seek the suspension of Standing Orders is that in this matter we are dealing with the creation of a new Industry Commission to which, according to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, the commissioners are currently being appointed. The particular matters which the Commission will consider are also now under consideration and, in view of the state of the development of this new Commission, which replaces the Industries Assistance Commission, it is appropriate and urgent that the contents of Dr Moran's comments and Minister Button's response to those comments be debated at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of Dr Moran's comments it is not a matter which can be left to a later date because that would clearly lock the Commission into a situation which I believe it is possible to show will not be in conformity with provisions in the Industry Commission Act, the Act creating the Industry Commission, which were included as amendments by the Australian Democrats and which were approved by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Those amendments go to the heart of some contents of the considerations of the Commission, namely, that the Commission must take into account environmental matters and that the Commission must contain a person who has experience and knowledge in the environmental area. Without debating Dr Moran's particular comments, it would seem to me self- evident from any cursory examination of those comments that he has shown himself to be a person incapable of fulfilling that task. In view of the incipient nature of the Industry Commission, it is therefore appropriate that Standing Orders be suspended now so that this matter can be debated and the membership of that Commission by Dr Moran can be settled at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily quoting the editorial in yesterday's Australian on this matter, I just briefly add to the sense of urgency which the Australian Democrats feel by simply saying that it is a fact that this week the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has referred as a matter of urgency to the Industry Commission some very important inquiries as part of the Government's micro-economic reform. These inquiries will be taking place during the recess of this Parliament. We are very concerned about the position of Dr Moran on the Industry Commission, in that we believe this is in conflict with amendments which were made to the legislation setting up the Industry Commission, and particularly because of these inquiries which are under way. I remind the Senate that these are inquiries into micro-economic reform in the areas of electricity, railways and rural marketing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The area of our concern relates to the ability of the Commission to take into account the very important environmental, social and economic effects on particular areas of the economy in its reform. We are concerned because of the reported comments of Dr Moran who believes there is no such thing as land degradation, that indeed the oceans can soak up as much pollution as we want them to, and probably does not believe in such a thing as global warming. Yet he is on a commission which is currently to undertake with all speed a review of the generation of electricity, and a review of railways and rural marketing in this country. We believe that this is a matter of urgency for the Senate here today because the Commission is so important and because those inquiries were recently and urgently given to the Commission and speeded up on the advice of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> We have obviously taken note of the question, as have others, from the Government member earlier in Question Time. We are concerned about the influences that exist on the Commission. We note that Dr Tor Hundloe has been appointed, among others, and that is a matter that we are pleased about. But we are concerned about Dr Moran and his reported statements. We believe that this issue is worth the time of the Parliament, as these inquiries will be taking place in the first instance while this Parliament is not sitting and therefore it would not be able to be debated. </PARA>

There is no need to be hairy chested here today; they are already counting. That is what probably prompted Senator Powell into the field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point about debating questions after Question Time is that it is very much a reserve weapon, to be used fairly sparingly; otherwise a precedent will be set and every question will be noted and debated afterwards and this chamber will become a farce. There is ample opportunity to raise these issues. As that particular person will not be sitting on an inquiry before 10.30 tonight, there is ample opportunity for the honourable senator to raise the issue on the adjournment or on matters of special interest or public interest on Thursday. If we were to set a precedent, as a government, to always agree to have a little speech after Question Time on a whole range of questions, we could see where the precedent would take us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>This government's failure to provide small business with the necessary economic climate in which to survive, as evidenced by the record number of business failures and bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA>The crescendo of criticism of this Government's economic policies is matched only by the escalation of business bankruptcies right throughout Australia. The powerhouse, the dynamo, the engine room of the Australian economy, is small business, and it is failing while this Government plays semantics with the recession that is on the small business agenda at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I asked Senator Button a question, more in hope than in expectation, that he would be able to offer some solutions to the small business community. I asked him why people were going broke and he could not give an answer. I asked him whether the Government had any policies or hope that it could offer the small business community in its hour of need. The short answer was no. Senator Button thought that everything would be all right if the Government reduced demand in the economy. That was the Australian Labor Party's way out of this impending disaster which is almost upon us. We have seen up to 10,000 businessmen go broke since Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> I moved today's urgency motion because for many small business people the term `recession' has no meaning. They have receded as far as they can. There is no further retreat possible. Their only alternative is to close up shop and walk away from a lifetime's work and savings or be put in the hands of a receiver. That is why the question that this motion asks has to be answered today: what is the Government going to do about the number of people that are heading into bankruptcy?</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the big players, Qintex Australia Ltd and Hooker Corporation Ltd, go down. There has been much public attention focused on the spectacular corporate collapses and we have seen the number of corporate collapses escalate dramatically between 1987-88 and 1988-89-from 4,836 to 6,189. They are massive figures. But small business has suffered even more under this Government's economic mismanagement. According to the Attorney-General's Department, in the January-March quarter this year there were 2,142 small business bankruptcies-450 more than for the same quarter last year, an increase of 27 per cent. Those business people have been put out of work and if they employed four people, that means that approximately another 8,000 people are on the dole queue, dependent on some type of welfare for their survival. </PARA>
<PARA> We are finding now that the 2,142 businesses that went broke are only the tip of the iceberg. The Australian Small Business Association put out a press release saying that even those figures are inadequate in depicting a true picture of what is happening. Whilst statistics on bankruptcy show a steady increase in business failures, that is only a very small part of the larger picture. Many businesses close down before they actually go bankrupt-before they become a statistic. The owners simply close their doors, sell their remaining assets, shoulder their debts, send their wives off to work, try to find a job in order to pay off the debt and, nine times out of 10, lose their home. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that statistics can never truly paint a picture of the hurt and suffering caused by business collapses. They do not explain the years of hard work which have gone into building up the goodwill and assets of a business, often secured against the family home, or the heartbreak of people who know that they are going broke and try to work their way out of it and pull out of the dive by trying to extend their own working time or their wives' working time, only to find that bankruptcy is inevitable because of Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business is the yardstick by which to measure the whole country's economic performance. All people have to do today is walk down to the shopping centres, their local factory or business and ask the business people how they are going. They will all say that it has never been tougher. We had an expression when I was in the trade that we used when things got tough. We used to say, `Even the liars are complaining'. That is the way it is at the moment. Not one person out in the community-not even the most optimistic small business person-is saying that things are good. Things are crook, and, according to Senator Button, this Government does not have the answers to the problems, or if it does have the answers, Senator Button is not prepared to tell the Senate about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there has never been a more arrogant government in its attitude to small business. The Government wants small businesses to be de facto tax collectors and red tape merchants, to bear the brunt of a hopelessly complex tax system, to pay the Government's sales tax before they have received it themselves, and to be well-resourced advocates of industrial relations and the very poorest of relations when it comes to combating the abuse of market power by big companies. The Government wants small business people to offer it capital gains tax after they have worked all their lives, established a nest egg and then want to sell their business. The Government comes in for its share after years and years of hard work by small business. For many small business people the only way that they can retire is by selling their business, thereby having some form of comfortable living after years of hard work. But even that is being denied the small business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business is supposed to be the great innovator and centrepiece of our economy and the largest private employer and taxpayer. Yet one would think that, because this Government requires small business to be all of those things, it would show some sympathy. But the economic climate for small business provided by this Government is like Delilah was to Samson-it has robbed small business of its strength and vitality. How can any business sustain the loss of incentive to make profits in the way that this Government has forced on small business? How can small business compete when faced with the prices and interest rates that the Government has imposed upon it? Cost increases, like those achieved under the accord, will increase the cost of workers' employment conditions by up to 22 per cent. Employer groups have worked out that the costs will increase by up to 15 to 20 per cent on such things as the increasing cost of superannuation, shorter hours, second tier wage increases, and a training levy to be now imposed on businesses with payrolls of over $200,000-which is really only a very small business with seven or eight employees. It is really just another tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone has to tell the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-and I hope it is Senator McMullan-that he cannot flog a dead horse; or he can, but it will not take him very far. This Government has flogged small business for all it is worth and it cannot be flogged any more. The Government cannot bring the economy to its knees by forcing it to pay more for labour while demanding competitiveness. It cannot abolish trade tariffs without making progress on labour tariffs. Australia's dismal manufacturing importance cannot be improved while the Government's high interest rates, labour costs and array of taxes discourage investment in plant and equipment and labour. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that the manufacturing sector of this nation has lost 31,000 jobs in the last 12 months. The Government has replaced our manufacturing sector with the import sector. Senator Lewis put it very succinctly the other day when he said that our main exports now are empty containers which are sent back to the country from which they came. That is what we are reduced to. The Government has increased costs for small business and small manufacturers by adding all of those costs-training levies, shorter hours, second tier wages and increased superannuation-to the cost of employees' wages and it has reduced the Australian manufacturing industry to almost nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and Senator McMullan have missed the vital link which will restore our competitive fortunes-the true labour market reform that delivers on productivity. The Government has to stop theorising about it. It cannot keep increasing costs for small business and expect it to be productive. The Government has to be able to stand up to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and say, `Listen, we cannot inflict any more costs on small business because it just cannot carry them any more'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has talked about deregulation of the transport industry, the communications industry, the shipping industry and the rural industry but it has never talked about deregulation of the labour industry. It has missed the whole point. The Government will never increase Australia's productivity while it imposes those centralised wage costs on small businesses, whether it can pay them or not. We are facing record bankruptcies in this nation because of the Government's twin policies of high interest rates and high costs on small business through this induced centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no significant interest rate relief for small business, and this is the other part of the equation of the small business collapse. Many are still paying 18 to 20 per cent interest and some are paying even higher. No business can survive the infliction of these interest rates. As one who had a successful small business for 18 years before I came into this place, I do not believe that there are very many small businesses that can pay those interest rates and survive. Yet we find that this Government has nothing to offer the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have continually questioned Senator Button through the course of this week, pleading with him to give some ray of hope to small business. He cannot come up with any answers except, `We are going to reduce demand.' We have tried that and it has not worked. The Government has reduced demand all right, but it has almost reduced every small business in this nation to bankruptcy. The Government's tight monetary policy is having a snowballing effect. Even if high interest rates were to come off, we would still see many small business people overstretched and going into voluntary bankruptcy or liquidation. It is not only the Opposition that is demanding that the Government do something; it is not only the Opposition that is saying the Government's policies are not working. Retailers are also saying it and the banks are warning that worse is ahead. </PARA>

<PARA> Even Senator Walsh, who had the decency and the courage to come out and say something because he was so frustrated, believed Labor's policies were not working. He believed that the Labor Government was leading this nation into the greatest financial disaster of all time. Government members would not take any notice of him from the front bench so he went onto the back bench to see whether he could give a lead there. He stood up there and tried to direct operations from the back bench. He is a very honest man. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is an honest man. He stuck to Cabinet solidarity, but at least he got out there and said something. He knew the policies of this Government were going to lead this nation to bankruptcy. I say that he is an honest man, and I find myself in agreement with Senator Walsh on a number of issues now-post-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) is telling the Government that small business is going through a tough cycle, that there is genuine hardship, that people are feeling the pinch, that there is a further possibility of more bankruptcies that things are going to get worse before they get better. Mr Beddall has announced that his small business report is a blueprint for the next few years and that his main aim is to get the Government off the back of small business. His report contains medium and long term solutions. I have read that report and it is a very good report. I must say that it is not just his report, it is a report supported by all the parties in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the new Minister is going to have a hell of a battle to have capital gains tax reduced. I think Mr Keating has said that through his Department it will be almost impossible, although Senator Button has lent some support, saying that on rollovers a reduction is important for small business. We will see who wins on that issue. Last time Senator Button spoke up he got not a slap on the wrist but six of the best from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> There is also criticism from Barry Jones, another ex-Minister. What he suggests is that Government members spend six months in opposition because they need a bit of rest and recreation and they are losing their commitment to getting on with the job. They squabble, they break ranks, they engage in public pay-backs and brawls. Generally they act like small kids who have been allowed to stay up too late and are overtired. We can make fun of this, but it is a very serious problem. It is even more serious when one is out there trying to battle to hold a business together. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch on the comments of Nobby Clark, the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank. He says that this is the worst time for small business in 45 years. I hope that when Senator McMullan gets up to answer my criticisms he will give small businesses some hope, some idea of the Government's plans to get them out of the absolute mess that they are in. Every indicator is pointing to the loss of jobs and the downfall of small business. The primary producers are suffering up to a 250 per cent increase in bankruptcies. The number of houses being built has dropped by 23 per cent. The Master Builders Association believes non-housing construction will drop by up to 15 to 20 per cent. Liquor stores and retail associations say sales are dropping. With Mr Clark's admission that this is the worst time in 45 years, some people are going to have a cataclysmic landing. It will not be a hard landing, he says, it will be a terminal landing. Every possible indicator is telling this Government that the small business sector has had enough. Its problems have got to be addressed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> My urgency motion states that this Government has failed to provide small business with the necessary economic climate in which to survive. The Government has failed 750,000 small business people and two million families that depend upon small business. We believe it is imperative that action be taken which will help soften the impact. I look forward to Senator McMullan's explanation of how he is going to help small business in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly do not blame Senator Boswell for looking forward to these remarks; they are going to be worth every bit of it. In the process, I want to make a couple of comments about those things which he did say-and there were not a lot. Essentially, most of the things that were recounted-it was strained logic-were things that have not changed at all over the last five years. It is hard to understand, as a matter of logic, how that can be the explanation of the changed circumstances that small business faces. There have been some changes, and I want to refer to those, but most of those matters to which the blame was attributed are matters that have been constant over the past several years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also found it a little surprising that we had stories about the collapse of manufacturing production and new capital expenditure. Any graphs produced over the past five years will show a continuing trend of substantial increase in manufacturing production and new capital expenditure. If those are the criteria indicating a good climate for small business, then over the past four years the climate has been tremendous. Manufacturing production increases over the past four years have been 2.5 per cent, 1.5 per cent, 6 per cent, and 5.5 per cent; and over the first two quarters of this financial year, 6.6 per cent and 2.8 per cent. Those are the most recent figures as published in the monthly economic and social indicators. </PARA>
<PARA> New capital expenditure is where this crisis apparently exists. There is a terrible climate in which people are not prepared to invest. Over the past four years, the annual rates of increase of new capital expenditure have been 10 per cent, 8.5 per cent, 10.5 per cent and 13.4 per cent. They really are indicators that if the signposts Senator Boswell is trying to mark out are the appropriate ones, then of recent times there has been an extraordinarily good climate, and I did not hear words of congratulations on those occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the Opposition through this motion is trying to say, `We wish the business cycle would go away'. Economic management and business management would be a lot easier if things did not change. Let us turn our attention away from a wish list to the role of government in relation to small business. I retain the view, which I think Senator Boswell would share, that the best people to run small business are small business proprietors, not the Government. We do not want to start creating a situation in which the Government runs around saying, `We are going to show you how to run your business'. I acknowledge that and, as I said, I think Senator Boswell would share that view. He may run small business slightly better than some other members of the Opposition who were not quite as successful as he was; nevertheless, it is a proper principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's obligation is to create an economic climate in which there is demand for the products of small business, in which demand is growing, in which the cost of supplying those goods or services from small business are as low as possible, and in which small business is assisted-to the extent that it is within the realm of government to assist-to have the capacity to run businesses efficiently and profitably. From time to time those circumstances of growth and restrain of costs do lead to that capacity to run a business profitably but from time to time it is inevitable that there will be some economic downturn. In every country in the world, in every economy in the world, and in every decade, the rate of growth changes. It cannot always be maintained at the peak. We need to provide training and assistance to small businesses to allow them to cope as best they can with the downturn. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some statistics about the economic climate which I alluded to when rebutting some of the points Senator Boswell made. If we look at the first obligation of the Federal Government in dealing with small business, which is to create a climate of economic growth, a climate in which the demand for the products of small business might be increasing, we find a record of sustained growth for many years-a record indicating an extraordinarily strong climate of economic growth and demand. I will use calendar year statistics because it makes comparisons with other countries easier, although Australians are used to using financial years. The statistics would not be significantly different. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia in calendar year 1985 the growth of gross domestic product was 5 per cent and in subsequent years, 2.1 per cent, 4.3 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 4.1 per cent. So up to calendar year 1989 there was an average rate of growth over those years of 3.85 per cent compared to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of about 3.6 per cent and a European Economic Community average of about 3 per cent. In the 12 months to June 1989-this is the cause of a significant part of the problem which we confront-the growth in domestic demand in Australia grew by 8.6 per cent whereas, unfortunately, production grew by only 4.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those supply side constraints were what blew out our balance of payments and have necessitated the slowdown of demand, which is the changed circumstance creating the difficulties for small business. I want to come back to the question of supply side constraints, but it is necessary at the beginning to acknowledge that domestic demand significantly exceeding domestic capacity to meet that demand and the consequent balance of payments problems have forced a tightening of monetary policy. That has eased off the pace of demand growth. The majority of indicators would suggest that demand is slowing without pulling the economy up altogether. The Government recognises that high interest rates are biting in both the business and the household sectors. However, if we do not moderate demand we run the risk of a burgeoning in our debt to a level that neither we nor, more importantly, our children will be able to sustain without dire economic hardship. We have to recognise and deal with the economic circumstances with which we are confronted. </PARA>
<PARA> Supply side constraint is not new. It is not something that has emerged since June 1989. It is not something that has emerged since March 1983. It is a product of 30 or 40 years of industrial policy failure in Australia. We do have to deal with it through this jargon term of micro-economic reform. I am not very enthusiastic about that term. I think that if we talk about efficiency, most people know what we mean. It will take away some of the jargon, the aura or mystique and we will get down to some of the things that people can understand. If time permits I will come back to the issue of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to cope with the consequences of that supply side constraint. The growth has existed over the last five years and it is the responsibility of all governments to try to keep generating that growth. As to the question of cost controls, real unit labour costs have fallen consistently over the last seven years. Inflation has fallen-but not enough; it is still too high. It will fall further, but it remains a major problem in the Australian economy and nobody can ignore that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's predictions about the rate at which it will fall and the point to which it will fall-about 6 per cent by the middle of next year-is about right. That is not excessively optimistic but it is also not a cause for great complacency. It is a very poor effort. But inflation is a very difficult problem to bring under control. Australian governments since the war have not had a successful record in dealing with it. If we get inflation down to 6 per cent, that will be a 5 per cent fall since we came to office. But it is not a cause for opening the champagne and saying that it is a victory; it is just a step along the road. Over the last six years some of the cost circumstances have been very suitable for small business. Real unit labour costs have fallen, real wages have remained tight yet, because of the growth in employment, household disposable income has increased-that is, costs tight and demand growing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn briefly in the time available to the Government's obligation to provide assistance to business so it can be as well geared, as well structured as possible to cope with the inevitable swings of the business cycle. One of those areas relates to training. I reiterate my initial point that I do not think it is government's job to run small business. Small business proprietors are better at doing that. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are currently involved in a joint study of the training needs of small business. It is important; it is overdue. Nobody has done it before. This is the first Government that has addressed training, and it is time that it was addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial initiatives are also being taken in the provision of government advisory services to small business through the establishment of a small business council-which was set up by this Government, not by any of its predecessors, not by the conservative governments of the past. It has provided a series of advisings and has suggested initiatives. For example, the Government has agreed to provide support for a consultancy to develop a national small business foundation and the establishment of a national industry extension scheme, with which I have been somewhat involved in the Australian Capital Territory and which has provided a lot of assistance to many small businesses in terms of creativity and coordination. It has also provided support for the establishment, in conjunction with key private sector organisations, of a joint Commonwealth-State national small business information and awareness program, and for research into small business matters which is carried out by the small business research unit in the Bureau of Industry Economics and the publication of reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Those things are only creating the potential for small business to succeed. It is not the Government's job to run them but it is the Government's job to provide the advice and the infrastructure. It should have been provided by previous governments and was not. To some extent that obligation is being met. Many changes have also been made to the taxation system to assist small business, the most fundamental area of all. People talk about tax in a very complicated way. Basically, people understand tax in a much simpler way. The rates of tax have come down. The top tax rate has come down; the rate of corporate tax has come down. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the tax rate for small business and others has gone down. In fact, tax as a percentage of gross domestic product has not gone up either, but that is not the point of this discussion. For an individual small business trying to succeed, the key statistic-when one peels away all of the Opposition's rhetoric about the taxes it wishes did not exist-is `what percentage of my profit do I have to pay in tax?'. The rate has gone down and division 7 tax on so-called excessive retentions has been abolished. Imputation has been introduced. They are all things that any small business proprietor will tell us have been a substantial benefit to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also have the commencement of the very important tax simplification project. It is a very long haul. There are no miracles in the simplification of tax. It is a big and complex task confronting not just the Tax Office and the Treasury, but business, the professions and the community at large. When the discussion paper comes out, we will be looking for comments from all of those people. Many of the interim stages during the development of the simplification process will be substantial benefit to individual men and women running small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the time to go into the substantial improvements to the tax level; and the provision of information, inquiry services and pilot programs to assist in rural and isolated communities; and the question of the ability to carry forward tax losses indefinitely, rather than in the limited way that was possible before. All those things are important. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, I cannot fail to address the question of capital gains tax. Senator Button addressed this question perfectly adequately in a substantial way at Question Time by saying that when small business was doing very well, the capital gain structure was exactly the same as it is now. So it is hard to claim that the capital gains tax is the cause of the current problem. There seems to be a logical flaw in such a claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) was quoted somewhat out of context and selectively after having spoken on the Walsh Report about some of the issues that he perceives regarding capital gains tax and small business and the roll-over question. But I have not seen quoted his comment that, `I would like to achieve that in the long term. There are some benefits in that'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a difficult argument because Treasury and Taxation make the valid point that once one tinkers with the tax law, one can open up loopholes. It is our responsibility to try to convince them that there is a way of rolling over the capital gain for a trading business without opening up loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a question to which the Opposition has never addressed itself. It regards finding loopholes in the capital gains tax as one of its obligations to its constituency, so that tax can become optional again, like it used to be before the capital gains tax was introduced. We do not and we will not share that view. If there is a way in which tax can be changed to address the requirements of small business without undermining the integrity of the system, let us look at it. But let us ensure that we are not passing obligations on to the honest taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk briefly about the other controversial area-which I heard Senator McLean address by way of interjection-concerning banks, credit and interest rates. These very important issues were raised in comments by Mr Greiner this morning. There is anecdotal evidence abroad of banks cutting back on credit to otherwise very strong and sound businesses that could continue. I have to say that at the moment the statistics on bank credit do not bear out that anecdotal information. It appears that the supply of credit is keeping pace with nominal demand. It may be that there is a delay in the statistics coming through; it may be that a change is being disguised by the pattern that has applied to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> We have all heard the anecdotal evidence and we all know of some individual cases that have occurred. I suppose we have to say in passing that if this is a sign of increasing rigour by the banks in the application of their prudential requirements, it would be welcome. But if it is undermining support for otherwise sound business, that is something which would not be welcome. Excessive caution in that area would not be welcome; it would not be a case of the banks discharging their proper obligations within the corporate structure in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said, there is room for further falls in interest rates to small business following from the easing of monetary policy since January. Nobody pretends that that is suddenly going to mean that interest rates will be low. It will not. They will not be in the short term and there is no point in pretending otherwise. But there is the capacity for further falls and we would expect-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret to say that Senator Boswell is asking the wrong person. The Government has made possible the easing of monetary policy which creates the potential for those falls. We would expect that in the private enterprise climate, which the Opposition supports and which we recognise and support, the banks, in their competitive environment, will pass those on to small business as it becomes possible. The Government has created the climate for this to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody could pretend that this is not a difficult time to be running any sort of business, small or large. There is no magic wand. There is not some easy formula where we can say all of a sudden that the problems of small business are solved. Small businesses do not exist in a world by themselves outside the economic circumstance in which big business, private enterprise and public enterprise-all the industries that go to make up our total economy-exist. Small business does not exist in a world by itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The only solution is to restore the economy to sustainable growth with low inflation. This means sound macro-economic policies-fiscal, wages, monetary, and, if you like, exchange rate policies. It is a question of micro-economic reform and efficiency, but let us keep that in perspective. The macro-economic measures are always going to be more important. It is a question of providing special assistance to small businesses by way of advice and information to make it possible for them to operate. The best people to run small businesses are small business proprietors, not government and we should not pretend otherwise. Therefore, it has been the Government's obligation, and it remains its obligation, to concentrate on getting the economic fundamentals right, which we have done over the last seven years and which we will continue to concentrate on doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as the Australian Democrats spokesperson on small business to support this urgency motion. We are speaking on this urgency motion at a time when small businesses in Australia are in a crisis only surpassed by that experienced during the so-called Great Depression. Recent statistics show that bankruptcies and business failures are rapidly increasing and this has a major impact on all Australians. The significance of small business to Australia is set out in the third paragraph of the preface of the recently produced January 1990 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is known as the Beddall report. The report says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are 600,000 small businesses in Australia-and an additional 150,000 in the farming sector. The precise contribution of the 750,000 small businesses to Australia is difficult to quantify but is substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an understatement; it is a massive contribution from the 750,000 small businesses. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>They account for 96 per cent of all firms, half of the private sector employment and a third of all employment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The existence of the small business sector contributes greatly to the flexibility of the economy and its ability to evolve to meet changing demands.</PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from the first major report on small business since Federation. Almost 40 per cent of Australians are employed by small businesses. When these businesses go to the wall the impact passes like shock waves through all levels of our society. Only small businesses can be the vehicle of our economic recovery and until something is done to alleviate their economic woes, Australia will not come out of its present economic morass. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the simple realities of the significance of small business to this nation. It is a reality that this sector of the economy is in absolute crisis. It is all right for the Opposition, however, to point the finger of blame at the Government but, frankly, its record is no better. This critical sector of the economy has been ignored by successive governments. This is reported recently in the Beddall committee-the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, and I will return to it later. The Beddall report reflects on the plight of small business as it has resulted from the failure of successive governments and not only the current Government. The Australian Democrats believe that a major contributor to the plight of small business was the deregulation of banks. This dramatically changed the climate in which small businesses have had to operate and in which small businesses have failed to cope. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan earlier cited the constructive things that the Government has done in support of small business, particularly in the area of taxation. We must acknowledge that some constructive things have been done by this Government in support of small business. However, the significant thing that this Government has done is to create a deregulated banking climate, a disastrous climate, in which small business has been unable to sustain itself. We now have a situation where we see the likes of Mr Fowler, the Managing Director of Westpac Banking Corporation, and Nobby Clark, who was quoted earlier by Senator Boswell, crying the plight of small business in this country, when we have been arguing in this place for the last 18 months that it is banks, in the context of deregulated banking, that have substantially created this plight. I have said over and over again, and will continue to say whilst ever I am a senator in this place, that deregulated banking has emasculated small business and must be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> Banks have a three-way bind on us. First of all, at the stroke of a pen they create credit. Credit is a positive sounding word-but it is debt. It is credit in the banks' books, but it is a debit or debt in our books and the banks have created massive indebtedness. They are now saying that small business and ordinary individuals in this country cannot service that debt at interest rates running at 17 and 18 per cent and in excess of 30 per cent on overdrafts. I tabled in this place a document called the Argus memo. It revealed that Mr Nobby Clark's bank was asking small business people to service debt short term in excess of 30 per cent. If they cannot service that debt they are being bled white in attempting to service these levels of indebtedness. The banks are now going to foreclose on the assets which they previously cited as justification for enticing these small business people into that level of indebtedness. So we will see a wave of foreclosures; in fact, the leading bank magnates of this country cite the fact that they are going to have to foreclose on the very people that they have led into this chronic level of indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities are that deregulated banking is not competitive banking at all. The banks in this country have behaved like cartels. One rise in interest rates is followed by another and then another. If it were a truly competitive situation, one of them would take advantage of the fact that the others are lifting their rates, but it is not a truly competitive situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not. I have been looking at this issue constantly for the last 18 months and the banks admit that within days they will follow suit in raising their interest rates. Within weeks building societies follow suit, and within months so do credit unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with the proposition raised by Senator McMullan that the banks are primarily responsible for spiralling interest rates. That is in the context of what they describe, in their own words, as super profits. We had Mr Fowler bleeding several days ago and apologising to his shareholders that for the first time in several stated half-yearly profit periods he had had to declare that profit was declining for his bank. Even though his bank recorded a profit of $340m-odd, he is wailing the same plea that symptomises the devastation of the very small business people he is asking to service the indebtedness that he had created at interest rates sometimes in excess of 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been total abandonment of the fiduciary relationship in banking. Banks are pursuing profits irrespective of the consequences to their clients. I will be tabling in this place on Thursday, as I have already done, evidence of the fact that that is clearly the case. I think honourable senators are aware that I have tabled affidavits relating to in excess of 80 cases now. That is just a sample of what is happening out there in banks exploiting their clients-I believe in complete defiance of the fiduciary relationship under law-in pursuit of their own super profits. </PARA>
<PARA> This new wave of foreclosures was inevitable. It simply reflects the very nature of banking. People are offered credit-that is, debt-secured against an asset. I have tabled in this place examples of banks that have foreclosed on those assets and then sold them off at 25 per cent of the valuation that they arrived at when they induced the business person to take the credit, in some cases less than 12 months previously. For the consideration of honourable senators I have tabled clear examples of this abandonment of the fiduciary relationship. I will be doing more of this in the remaining two weeks of this session and into the next parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies of the failures of small business is that small businesses are the clients of large businesses. As small businesses go to the wall, so the shock wave impacts upon large business. We have seen, and it has been much quoted in the media, the fate of so-called WA Inc. in Western Australia. There were a whole series of medium to large and very substantial businesses going to the wall at a cost of $699.5m. For the consideration of honourable senators I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of in the vicinity of 20 major business failures under the general heading of `WA Inc. Losses' which simply cites the impact upon medium to large business of what has been happening across this nation in the context of deregulated banking for the last six or seven years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Finally, in the few minutes remaining to me, I would like to look at the hopeful side, the more positive side, of the situation in which small businesses find themselves in Australia. I do not think we can alter the fact that there is a major crisis on our hands. It is the product of neglect of consecutive governments and of deregulated banking. I believe that there is a ray of hope in the pages of this document, now known as the Beddall report, which is titled Small Business in Australia-Challenges, Problems and Opportunities. It is at least a ray of hope to see that the Beddall report sees some future for small businesses. I know that at the moment many small businesses see no hope whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend this document to the Senate. When the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia in the pre- election context went to the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats and asked, `How do you regard this report?', it sought assurances from government and alternate government at the time that the 66 recommendations of the Beddall report would be implemented irrespective of who came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats were the only ones to respond to that request by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. Not even the Government, which had commissioned this report, was prepared in the pre-election context to commit itself to the 66 recommendations. Neither was the Opposition-the very Opposition which is castigating the Government today over the current fate of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats gave an unequivocal guarantee that we would support all 66 recommendations of the Beddall report. It is a constructive report. For the first time we have something which gives us an historical and a contemporary overview of the problems which confront small business. It makes a series of structural, general and specific recommendations which it believes will redress the plight of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Australian Democrats support this urgency motion. It is clearly a matter of urgency that the Government address the plight of small business. However, in supporting the urgency motion, we cite the fact that the current situation is not solely the result of the present Government's policies. Indeed, the Beddall report looks at the historical context of the plight of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> I give notice that as the Australian Democrats' small business spokesperson I will be returning specifically to the issue of banking. It is fundamental to the survival of small business that we redress the deregulated banking and that we challenge the banking system by setting up a full scale inquiry into banking practices. Irrespective of who is in government, until that wrong is made right, rationality will not prevail in the small business sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I have been in this chamber for only a few weeks, I find it absolutely amazing and an insult to small business that we do not have present on the front bench-I note the presence of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate)-a Minister responsible for small business, Treasury or economic matters. So much consideration does the Government have for small business that it is not prepared to have an appropriate Minister sit through an urgency motion of two hours. This is an insult and a disgrace to the largest employment sector-the small business sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened to the earlier reply of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and the response by Senator McMullan. Senator McMullan said that we are going through a normal business cycle. Some business cycle! He said that that was an excuse for government policy, government inaction and government inertia-government ignoring the plight of small business. If Senator McMullan suggests that this is a normal business cycle with interest rates as high as they are, then I would hate to see his version of unprecedented high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I concur with Senator McMullan to the extent that there will always be failures in the business community. Where people give it a go there will be people who fail. But today we are highlighting to the Parliament the magnitude of the number of failures and the escalation in the failure rate. The fact is that small businesses, like home buyers, simply cannot absorb high interest rates being inflicted upon them by government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan said that the Government has a responsibility not to interfere with small business. It is certainly not doing that; it is totally ignoring small business. But it is the Government's responsibility to get the economic fundamentals right. It is the Government's economic policy direction and its high interest rates that are inflicting so much hurt and damage on small business at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few days we have seen Australia's banks being put in the firing line by Senator Button, Senator McMullan and Senator McLean. We need to pass off this responsibility on some group rather than on government economic policy. So the buck has been passed to the banking community. Never has there been a more graphic case of misplaced and inappropriate apportionment of blame than that given to the banking community. </PARA>
<PARA> On Sunday the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) said that banks not only treated small business badly but also made it pay for blunders of corporate high flyers. This is an outrageous accusation. Yesterday, the Premier of New South Wales, in identifying policies of the Australian Labor Party as the core of the problem, indicated that the banks were overreacting to the downturn in the economy by pulling the pin on some successful small to medium sized businesses. Nobby Clark, the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank, fuelling the debate, said yesterday that conditions for small business in Australia were the worst he had seen in over 45 years. That is identifying the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Job creation and retailing appears to have ground to a halt. Throughout the community, city and country alike, shop vacancies are increasing. Figures recently released by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research suggest that consumer confidence is at its lowest ebb for 17 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional quiet months of June, July and August are in front of us. What prospects do small businesses have for survival with interest rates as high as they are at the moment and with the Government showing no inclination whatsoever to ease monetary policy or interest rates. This affects not only small business people but also first home buyers. In the next three to four months they will be faced with a period of traditionally quiet retailing. </PARA>
<PARA> During the next three to six months will we see a massive escalation in the number of small businesses going bankrupt? Correspondingly, will we see a very savage increase in the number of people turned out on to the unemployment queues simply because small business is no longer able to provide them with jobs?</PARA>
<PARA> Last week Australia's largest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, revealed that its sales in the March quarter were 5.4 per cent above that of the March quarter last year. That is not even keeping pace with inflation. There is a contraction in the level of retail sales. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of high interest rates people in the age group of 25 to 45-the traditional home buyers; people buying, establishing and equipping their first home-have retreated from the retail market simply because they are trying to keep a roof over their head. They are not equipping their homes with the goods and essentials they would ordinarily require. That is rolling over and affecting the small business community. </PARA>
<PARA> They are serious problems. They have been put on the public agenda and they need to be addressed. It is simply not good enough for the Government to come in and say, `It is just the normal business cycle. You have to take the good with the bad. You have to put up with it'. We will not have a small business sector if the Government continues to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the behaviour of Australia's financial institutions is the direct result of the Hawke-Keating lethal cocktail of high interest rates and tight monetary policy. That is the net effect. That is what is filtering out of the community at the moment. Put simply, high interest rates-this Government's deliberate policy; a single instrument policy to dampen demand-are killing Australia's small business sector. The draconian monetary policy is threatening to decimate Australia's entire small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has forced the small business sector on to a credit roller-coaster resulting in business failures, small business bankruptcies and forced mortgagee sales. While bankers, economists and politicians argue over whether the economy will have a soft or a hard landing, the small business community has had a crash landing. And the statistics indicate and clearly prove that. </PARA>
<PARA> The people have been largely ignored by a party and a Prime Minister which rely heavily on big business, big unions and big government. The forgotten part of the equation is the small business sector, Australia's largest employer. Yet, small business is the heart of the free enterprise system. Senator McMullan said that the Government supported the risk takers and the entrepreneurs in the private sector. The Government is not doing much to assist the small business community of this country. It seems that the Government has forgotten that Henry Ford was once a small businessman. Small beginnings encourage people to invest their life savings, to establish a business and to get out there and give it a go. People who are prepared to be risk takers in that respect deserve a fair go and encouragement from the Government. We have not seen that. The Government has not been interested in backing the small business community. </PARA>
<PARA> As John Collins, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce has said, when deals are made within the corporate estate on important issues such as industrial relations and micro-economic adjustment, small business would be lucky to be considered even as an afterthought. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business's role is crucial in what one could describe as the engine room of the Australian economy. It is the key part of the Australian economy, yet in the last March quarter alone bankruptcies rose by a huge 27 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. The bottom line is that the small business sector in Australia is in desperate shape. Hence, the urgency motion in this House today. But the Government obviously does not consider the situation to be urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> Most small businesses are struggling to survive. Interest rates of 20 to 25 per cent are the norm and not the exception. As the economy moves towards a recession, there are excessive tax burdens and falling demands for products. If one is a small business proprietor and one happens to go over one's overdraft limit, one pays a surcharge for that period in overdraft which is, in some instances, between three and five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Our high inflation rate of 8.6 per cent, which is higher than that of our major trading partners, impacts on small business simply in the need to restock the inventory, the stock in trade, which is the means by which businesses can trade and service the needs of their clients. With an 8.6 per cent inflation rate, small businesses are required to allocate more of their retained earnings simply to keep stock at last year's levels without giving any consideration to expanding the range of goods and services that they can provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Retailers rely on suppliers' trade credit for inventory holdings. Because of high interest rates, in recent times we have seen small businesses, instead of paying for their goods on a 30-day basis, being forced to spin their payments out to a 60-day basis, then to a 90-day basis simply because they do not have the retained earnings in their business to pay their creditors. With the current economic circumstances, when creditors have pressure applied to them, it is applied down the line to the small business operators. Hence, we have this cycle of contraction of funds and available cash within small business to maintain existing stock levels, inventories and credit files for those customers it would ordinarily service. Yet, there are no policies in place to tackle inflation in a meaningful way. Again, we have a credit rollercoaster. Sales tax is a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see that we have another division within the Government on the capital gains tax. I noticed that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce today indicated that he did not think that capital gains tax was a problem at all for small business. It so happens that the Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, thinks it is a major problem confronting small business at the moment. The Minister for Small Business has indicated that he will be taking a Cabinet submission which would allow the roll-over of capital gains tax for trading businesses. He has Senator Button on his side, but he does not have the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on his side. We have become accustomed to who wins in a circumstance like that; it is usually the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we have a divergence of views between Ministers handling the area of economics and small business as to what policies ought to be put in place to give some breathing space to small businessmen who have mortgaged their homes and used their life savings to establish a business. Invariably, they rely upon the capital gain of that business over an extended period of time for their superannuation. It is their retirement fund. It is what they accumulate over an extended period of time. </PARA>

The Australian Society of Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants have endorsed the need to look at credit, the incapacity of small business to borrow currently at reasonable rates in the marketplace, the high debt load of small business and the bringing forward of corporate income tax collections. We clearly need to put in place a range of monetary policies which do not rely solely on the single instrument of high interest rates to dampen demand within the community. That is the fundamental flaw in the Government's policy direction. It is relying on a single instrument of policy to dampen demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, we should have enterprise agreements. It is ludicrous that the centralised wage fixation system should set the rates for a motor mechanic working in Sydney and apply exactly the same rate to a motor mechanic working in a country town somewhere in the backblocks of South Australia. The cost of living in Sydney is markedly different from the cost of living in that country town in South Australia. The capacity for customer turnover in Sydney is markedly different from that of a country town in outback South Australia. Yet through the centralised wage fixation system we apply the same criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> Those businesses have not got the capacity to meet the very divergent cost structures that apply in each case. We need flexibility. Therefore, we need to move to enterprise agreements so that we can get a more rational approach in that area. In addition, the Government needs to reduce its expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a motion that has been moved by the Leader of the National Party of Australia in this place, Senator Boswell, alleging the Government's failure in relation to small business in Australia. I outrightly reject this motion. I am not sure whether Senator Boswell is a big businessman or a small businessman, but in 1982-83, when in government, honourable senators opposite drove Australia and small business into a full-blooded recession. They drove thousands of small enterprises in this country to the wall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From 1985 onwards, when we were reforming the taxation system, the people opposite tried to defend the indefensible. They defended sectional interests, privilege and, worst of all, inefficiency in the Australian economy. Let us look at Senator Boswell's track record. The very person who moved this motion in the Senate this afternoon, attacking us in relation to small business, in 1985 attacked this Government for disallowing entertainment expenses. He made the most dire predictions. He predicted doom and gloom for Australia as a whole because of our disallowing entertainment expenses as a tax deduction. Today we have the spectacle of Senator Boswell, now in a new role as Leader of the National Party in this place, again spreading doom and gloom and making the worst possible predictions about a key sector of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the entertainment allowance was hardly used by small business. It was a $330m annual rort heavily used by big business, the big end of town. Small business owners could not take advantage of that rort. They were too busy working to have lunches subsidised by the taxpayer. In 1985 Senator Boswell, in this place, foretold doom and gloom for a key section of the Australian economy, the restaurant sector. Of course, the restaurant sector is a small business sector. It is not populated by large business undertakings; it is a small business sector of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall take a few moments this afternoon to check the forecasts made by Senator Boswell less than five years ago, in 1985, about that small business sector. They are on the record. We have all got Hansard and the computerised database. It is fascinating to see the predictions made by conservative politicians in this place. The most important thing that we on this side of the chamber must do time and time again is check those predictions and claims because conservatives, of course, trade on the basic proposition that people out in the electorate have short memories. What they do time and time again is to make predictions hoping that people will forget them in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell is on record in Hansard of 4 December 1985, page 2932, as making outrageous claims about the impact of the disallowance of entertainment expenses-getting rid of the free lunch, getting rid of the tax subsidised lunch paid for by other taxpayers in Australia. The present Leader of the National Party is making these claims to defend sectional and privileged interest in Australia. He said that the disallowance of entertainment expenses would lead to a loss of jobs in the restaurant industry of around 11,000. That is a statement from Senator Boswell, the mover of this motion about small business. On the very same page-I do not know how he got to the calculation-he upped the prediction to 14,000 jobs lost in the restaurant industry. That is the reality; that is the prediction Senator Boswell made as recently as 1985 when talking about an important small business sector of this economy. That is what he said. On the very next page of Hansard, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA> After the Christmas boom-</PARA>
<PARA>this speech was made in December-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . around February or March-there will be a massive fall in the Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reality of Senator Boswell's claim. That is what he said in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see how Senator Boswell's predictions came out for a key small business sector of the Australian economy. I want to check those claims and forecasts. After all, Senator Boswell has come in here today and made further doom and gloom claims about the small business sector of the Australian economy. I have had a look at the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for employment in the restaurant sector, and they make fascinating reading. The figures are official information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for restaurants, hotels and clubs-in other words, the hospitality service sector of our economy. Bear in mind that Senator Boswell, the present Leader of the National Party, told this place in December 1985 that 11,000 jobs would be lost in the restaurant sector. Then he upped the figure to 14,000. The reality is that in November 1985, a month before Senator Boswell made this speech, there were 230,000 jobs in the service sector, the hospitality sector, of the Australian economy. That is the reality; those are the official figures. In November last year, just recently, 11,000 jobs had not been lost in that sector; in fact, quite the reverse. There were not 230,000 jobs in the hospitality sector of the Australian economy but a massive 307,000 jobs. So in the space of four years, in a climate when the entertainment allowance had been disallowed, when we had stopped businessmen in pinstripe suits in Sydney and Melbourne going out to lunch and ticking it up to the taxpayer to the tune of $330m a year-something that small businessmen could not do-77,000 extra jobs had been created in the hospitality sector of the Australian economy, and overwhelmingly those jobs were in the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> So there we have Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party, exposed. He thought he would get away today with making further doom and gloom claims about a key business sector, but the record shows that as recently as four years ago he had no credibility in making predictions about business; he is simply not believable. The reality is that, while Senator Boswell said that the hospitality industry would go down, it went up-despite his predictions. </PARA>

<PARA> This motion again demonstrates amply that the conservatives take a narrow view of economic management and of key sectors of business. They do not have the full perspective of what happens out there in the marketplace. In fact, conservatives are incapable of seeing the big picture so far as business is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion focuses on Government monetary policy. That is not spelt out but that seems to be the focus. The motion seems to be about interest rates and the cost of finance. It goes on to make claims about bankruptcy levels. I happen to monitor bankruptcy figures very closely, and I have had a look at the figures for my State of South Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Olsen is going off about bankruptcies in South Australia. In the Adelaide Advertiser of 15 May, which I thought I would keep here as insurance, an article appears under the headline `Low Level of Bankruptcies Puzzles Experts'. That is a newspaper in Senator Olsen's own State. The article states that in the first quarter of 1989, the first three months of 1989, the Small Business Corporation of South Australia had identified 92 business bankruptcies in the State and that-surprise!-in the first three months of 1990 there were not 92 but 81. Presumably, Senator Olsen has not read this article, but it certainly pays to do your research in this place and keep abreast of what is really happening out there in the community. Doom and gloom is being spread around the place by conservative politicians-yet there is the fact from the research director of the South Australian Small Business Corporation saying, `Well, 92 last year; 81 this year for the same period'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government believes that small business is a vital sector for the Australian economy. We are well aware of its dominance in the private non-agricultural sector of the economy, where some 44 per cent of total employment is in the hands of small business people. It plays a major role in the economy, and I am certainly aware of major overseas studies that show that the formation of small business is a major source of total job growth in the overall economy. One of the key determinants of how many jobs are created is in fact the number of small businesses actually being started up. So we are certainly well aware of those factors. We do acknowledge that there is concern out there about the level of interest rates and the cost of finance, and that has already been amply canvassed this afternoon by other spokespersons. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more to Government policies and economic management than just talking about monetary policy and the cost of finance; there is wages policy, incomes policy and fiscal policy. For example, the key difference between this Government and the conservatives-who, fortunately, are on the Opposition benches and will stay there for some time-is that we have operated a very successful incomes policy. We have allowed the Australian economy over seven years to expand significantly without double digit inflation occurring; we have had a managed incomes policy. I think Senator McMullan made the point earlier that cost pressures faced by small business under the Fraser-Howard Liberal Government were running at 11.5 per cent per annum. That certainly was the consumer price index in 1982-83, but I think Senator Olsen said a moment ago that the CPI was now running at 8.6 per cent. So there we have a three percentage points reduction in the underlying cost structure facing Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the other side of wages policy? One of the great successes of the Hawke Government for small business is in keeping down the number of industrial disputes, cutting out the sheer number of days lost in industrial disputes around this nation. It is a tremendous achievement. For example, when the Liberal-National Party coalition was last in power-and I have checked this with the Parliamentary Library-the number of days lost in Australia due to industrial disputes was two million. Two million days were wasted in this nation due to industrial disputes-a great disruption to both small business and big business, which really suffered because their products could not get to markets. There were disruptions everywhere in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Hawke Labor Government we do not have two million days lost annually due to industrial disputes. We do not even have 1 3/4 million days lost. The last figures show that 1.2 million days were lost in industrial disputes compared with two million under the Liberals. They are very important things to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should also look at investment. Firms are not going to be investing if they are going to the wall. Surely the proof of the pudding is in the eating. If there is large investment going on in the Australian economy, something must be going right in the productive sectors of the economy. I want now to run quickly through some investment figures. For example, real business investment in Australia is running at a level 68 per cent higher than it was under the last Liberal Government. It is 68 per cent higher in real terms; in other words, it has gone up 68 per cent more than inflation. That is an enormous increase in investment. The average rate of growth of investment under this Government for the last five years has been 10.8 per cent per annum, whereas in the last five years of the Liberal Government it was 1.6 per cent per annum-an enormous difference. The investment has gone into plant and equipment, new factories, warehouses-all of which, in the longer term, create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also helped small business-particularly incorporated businesses-by adding the double tax on dividends. No longer is company tax paid on company profits as well as income tax on dividends in the hands of recipients. We tax one or the other now, and that has certainly been an advantage for incorporated enterprises. We have cut the rate of company tax from 49c to 39c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Those measures have been funded by cracking down on the rorts. We got rid of the free lunch-$330m a year ticked up to other taxpayers. We brought in the fringe benefits tax and that is now pulling in about $900m a year. The revenue from those things is funding the reforms we have put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion moved by Senator Boswell this afternoon should be rejected-it should be thrown out. I have shown that in the past Senator Boswell has been totally without credibility in making predictions in this place. He certainly has no credibility in making these predictions today about small business. The record of the Liberals in government was to send small business to the wall by the thousand. Labor recognises the key role of this sector of the economy and we are implementing a major report on small business. We have got the runs on the board on small business and the Opposition's rhetoric is no match for the Government's achievements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Maguire's contribution were not so serious it would almost be laughable. Senator Maguire has the audacity to stand up in here today, when we are debating a most serious urgency motion, and accuse the Opposition-in particular, Senator Boswell-of not having any credibility concerning small business. The only three people in this debate with small business experience are the three coalition speakers. Senator McMullan is an Australian Labor Party official; Senator Maguire is a researcher-cum-whatever he certainly is not a businessman; and Senator Cooney is a barrister. Senator Maguire has got the audacity to talk about credibility. Who has got the credibility?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McMullan was absolutely and utterly amazing, as was Senator Maguire. He is still going on with ancient history, blaming the Fraser Government for the problems that small business is experiencing today. But then again, we cannot expect him to understand or empathise with small businesses because not only has he never been in one but also, he has never had to deal with them. He has never gone to them nose to nose, eyeball to eyeball, and had a look at the issues day to day. He has never had to worry about struggling to pay the staff wages at the end of the week. He has never had to worry about paying workers' compensation, the rent, the telephone, payroll tax and all the other taxes. He has never had to worry about filling out the copious quantities of paper work that this Government and the State governments demand on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> No. All is well because obviously, from listening to Senator Maguire's contribution, small businesses have never been better off than they are today. I suggest that Senator Maguire get out there and talk to some of the small businessmen who are going broke. </PARA>
<PARA>The urgency motion states:</PARA>
<PARA>This government's failure to provide small business with the necessary economic climate in which to survive, as evidenced by the record number of business failures and bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA>We could not make it more specific if we tried, and the facts are there to substantiate it. The reason many businesses are going broke in the overwhelming majority of cases is not because of their own inadequacies but because of the disastrous economic climate brought about by this Hawke-Keating Government. This Labor Government has failed the 750,000 small businesses in this country. Once a government decides to rely upon interest rates as its major economic tool and drive the economy into recession rather than seek the reforms that would improve our productivity, then the scenario is inevitable. Big business may lick its wounds with smaller profits, but small business simply struggles and goes out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence is well and truly before us, contrary to what Senators McMullan and Maguire have said. Senator McMullan said, and I wrote it down, `Things have not changed at all over the last five years'. Bully for him. Only last month we learned that bankruptcies had risen by 50 per cent since 1984-85, with a 27 per cent rise in the last quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an indication that as many as 10,000 small businesses were in serious trouble. But this Labor Government, through this debate today, is telling us that nothing is wrong; all is well. The bankruptcy statistics for the March quarter show another 2,142 Australians were declared bankrupt. That is a rise of 27 per cent by contrast with the same period in 1989. There is no better indicator of a troubled small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, my home State, 296 bankruptcies represent a 74 per cent increase on 1989. Most of these, I might add, do not simply reflect the misfortunes of an individual; they mean that many employees are simply out of work and other small enterprises are left with bad debts. For each small business that formally goes bankrupt, another five close down voluntarily before they go all the way down that same path. Therefore, in Western Australia we are looking at the disappearance of 1,500 small businesses in the first quarter of this year. The outlook for many of the other 70,000 small enterprises in that State is not promising either. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the West Australian on 18 May reported that in the smart, refurbished Piccadilly Arcade in the heart of Perth-right in the central business district-there were four empty shops. That is just in once arcade. One of the shops bore the notice, `We've had enough after six years. Thanks Bob and you too, Paul'. I believe that really sums it up. There was a small business that was able to survive for six years-therefore, it could not just have been badly managed or inadequately based-but thanks to this Government it has gone out of business. At the same time 100 jobs have been lost through the closure of the Bi-Best discount department stores-the larger end of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> Next Saturday there are two by-elections in Perth, in the electorates of the ex-Premier and the ex-Deputy Premier who have been forced, by their own Party, to nick off. We see the pork-barrelling of the world going on over there by the new Premier, Dr Lawrence. But small businesses over there are being hit for six by that Government, too. They have high land taxes, water and council rates and, I think, the highest electricity charges of any State. This, combined with the problems created by this Federal Government, leads one to ask what have those people in Fremantle and Maylands got to look forward to if they vote for the Labor Party on Saturday?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) merely tells us how well his policy is working. On the Sunday show on 8 April he stated that he thought the banks would bring business rates down to about 18 per cent or even better. What a cynical joke! A survey by the Small Business Letter showed that not one respondent paid less than 20.2 per cent plus surcharges. We can see how closely our aspiring next Prime Minister understands the real world of small business, because the only small business he has been involved in-which might not be so small-is buying antique clocks. </PARA>
<PARA> A Mr White in Sydney calculated that, on top of his 24 3/4 per cent interest rate, he was paying an extra 5 per cent in government and bank charges. With an effective 30 per cent interest rate, he decided to close down his 35-year-old suburban retail outlet. Many other businessmen around Australia are reaching similar conclusions and taking similar action. It is not only those in small business and their employees who are affected. Taxpayers also feel the effect as all these people go out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with my colleague Senator Olsen who said that quite clearly this Government does not consider this issue to be urgent. I would go so far as to say that I do not think it even thinks it is an issue because it has treated it with absolute contempt today. Not to understand the impact upon small business under the Hawke Labor Government of the real cost of business borrowing rising from an effective 4 per cent in 1982-83 to 15 per cent in 1988-89 is nothing short of a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of these high interest rates upon the housing sector is a fairly familiar story, as Senator Olsen has already touched on. It is not only those who cannot afford houses but also the small businesses associated with the building industry that are suffering. In Western Australia their position has not been helped by a 50 per cent drop in housing starts in the December quarter, a halving of the market for $40,000 homes in the March quarter, and new dwellings overall 30 per cent below last year's figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are not the only burden that the Hawke Labor Government has foisted upon small business. Nominal wage growth and lack of productivity growth under the Australian Council of Trade Unions accord means that staff become too expensive to employ. Yet 10 minutes ago Senator Maguire stood up in here and told us how fantastic the accord had been. </PARA>

The accord has not served small business well and it has made sure that many small businesses will simply go bust. If that is the Government's ultimate goal, why does it not come clean and tell small business? It should not let them just drift on getting into a worse and worse state and going bankrupt. There is no point in Senator Maguire shaking his head. The statistics in Western Australia show quite clearly that there has been a 74 per cent increase. I notice that Senator Maguire very judiciously did not touch on the Western Australian figures in his speech. They also show a 27 per cent increase nationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The lack of micro-economic reform is felt by those efficient small businesses engaged in export or importing, since our ports are only 50 per cent as competitive as European ports and 40 per cent as competitive as those of Asia. We now have a Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) who admits that `people are feeling the pinch and that is very worrying'. Those are his words, not mine. He expressed the objective to `get government off the back of small business'. Is this not a fine sentiment after the election? thanks to his Government, small business is just another arm of the Australian Taxation Office. It is forced to undertake half its work and is severely penalised if it falters in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that we have to `get government off the back of small business'. This is the Minister who also started saying that maybe capital gains tax should be able to be rolled over: `When one business is sold, buy another one'. Yet prior to the election campaign this Government categorically and unequivocally denied our claim that nearly half the businesses that were liable for capital gains tax had incomes below $40,000. It categorically denied that. Now, after the election, it says that maybe there is a need to look at the problem with capital gains tax. Of course there is a problem with capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is notable that during the recent election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told the Small Business Letter that the then Minister, Mr Barry Jones:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . made it clear that Governments at all levels need to get off the backs of small business. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a view did not stop him getting the sack soon after, I might add-Barry Jones was easily expendable. All we may get therefore are junior Ministers, such as Mr Beddall, mouthing pro-business sentiment while the Hawke-Keating Labor Government goes its own merry way and more and more people go into bankruptcy. The Minister is starting to believe that some of the issues may need to be looked at. It will be interesting to see whether Prime Minister Hawke, and the soon to be Prime Minister Keating, will actually act upon some of these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey conducted earlier this year by the Australian Small Business Association showed complete unanimity among 2,000 respondents to the proposition that assets held for more than five years should not be taxed. This is the view of the coalition, but it is rejected by the Hawke Labor Government. Small business knows that it pays too much and has devoted too much valuable time to compliance with government regulation in the taxation field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been said by all speakers in this debate, I think, that there are 750,000 small business people in Australia and many of them are feeling the strain. In so far as there is good news it is that most of them will continue to carry on small businesses not just for their own benefit but for that of the country. I wish to congratulate the very many small business people who carry on their businesses efficiently and well, as I say, to the benefit of themselves, Australia, and the world as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most small business people do well. There are those who do not and there are those who are going bankrupt, and to those people we must have nothing but sympathy. All honourable senators have made that point, including Senator Boswell with his usual great style, Senator Olsen, and Senator Knowles in her very forthright manner. Indeed, the Government understands that. We have been accused of ignoring the plight of small business people. That is not so at all. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology-the Beddall report-is an indication of that. The things done under that report are indications that the Government has not forgotten the small business person, the person who, as Senator Knowles quite properly says, has to bear the burden of on costs such as insurance-whether workers compensation insurance or otherwise-payroll tax, the renewal of equipment, and so on. We on this side thoroughly understand that it is hard for people with those oncosts and high interest rates. In so far as that is a point that has been made on the other side, we agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether this matter of urgency will go to the vote or not. Whether or not it does, the reality as to who has the better of this argument was proved on 24 March. The sorts of things that have been pointed out by the Opposition and the arguments that have been put forward so eloquently on our side by Senator McMullan and Senator Maguire, have been ruled upon by the people of Australia. The interesting thing is that the matters urged by Senator Knowles, Senator Olsen and Senator Boswell have been ruled upon not by the Government but by the people of Australia, who have voted to give this Party, this Government, another three years in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation that now exists with regard to small business is little different from the situation that existed on 24 March. The people of Australia have said that this Government is the appropriate one to look after not only small business but the economy as a whole. I assure any small businessman, businesswoman or business company that may be listening to this debate that the Government is very conscious of its responsibility to that particular sector and will be moving to do several things which I will come back to. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said, or at least implied, that there has been a lessening of demand. That is quite correct. There has been a lessening of demand because unfortunately that has been made, by necessity, a central part of the Government's policy. The demand in Australia has been too great. That has sucked in imports from overseas. That has put us in a situation where we owe too much to people overseas and has brought about the necessity for us as a nation to consume less. That is a scenario that was accepted by the Australian people on 24 March. They understand that we have had to do this, but we do not do it, Madam Acting Deputy President, through any joy--</PARA>

<PARA> I have mentioned the things that this Government has already moved to do regarding its promises in the short time it has been in office since 24 March. There was, of course, the Beddall report. I agree with those on the other side who welcomed that report. I wish to quickly go through what this Government has done and what it proposes to do. There will be regular meetings between Mr Beddall, the Minister appointed specifically for small business, and his counterparts in State governments to promote coordination in the manner in which governments deal with small businesses. One of the great objections that small businesses have had to the way government in general has operated is that there are, as a result of Federation, a variety of authorities, not coordinated, which impinge upon business in a bad way, whether small or large. It is therefore a matter of great moment that governments should get together to coordinate their approach to small business. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has also promised an annual report to Parliament on Government policy as it affects small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Boswell so generously said-and I thank him for that-that will be handy. It will certainly be handy that there will be an annual report which will indicate what has happened to small business, which will show what the Government has done for small business and which will allow this House, as well as the House of Representatives, to have an opportunity to debate the issues that surround small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has announced an inquiry into the complexity of the taxation system, again a matter of great moment. An ability therefore exists to make the taxation system more understandable and hopefully more simple. There will be a consultative group consisting of relevant business and professional groups to report on its responses to the tax recommendations in the Beddall report. In other words, the report that David Beddall has produced has been made available to those interested, specifically to small businesses, to discuss and give a response to. Again, that is something that has been done by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government there has been a reduction of the rate of tax that companies have to pay. It has been reduced to 39 per cent, taken down from a high of 60 per cent in the last decade. As a pilot program for 1989-90, mobile information vans telling businesses about this reduction will be taken into rural and isolated communities with small business being a significant target area. Not only is small business in the cities and in the major country towns looked at but small business in rural areas will also be looked at. From 1 July 1990 self-employed persons and unsupported employees will be able to claim tax deductions in full for contributions up to $3,000-this is in terms of occupational superannuation-and for 75 per cent of the excess of contributions over $3,000. This Government has set up a program whereby people in small businesses can make provision for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> These are simply a few of the things I have read out from a list that has been given to me from Mr Beddall's office. It is a summary which covers over four pages. If I went on I could point to many other issues which have been embraced by this Government, specifically by David Beddall's office and by the Minister himself, and which specifically go towards helping small business. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition, as it has today, properly puts forward its case, and does so with great style and great gusto, it is usually raising issues which this Government has specifically put up and has answered. In a certain sense it is not to the point to say that there has been an increase in bankruptcies. Of course, there has been an increase in bankruptcies. Is that bad? Of course it is bad. It must be bad for anyone to go bankrupt. For a person who has built up a business, say a small corner store, a cabinetmaker's business, a plumbing business or, with great respect to Senator Knowles, a solicitor's business or a doctor's business, for a person who has spent time and effort building up a business and then for a variety of reasons finds that that business has to go into bankruptcy, it is a tragedy. It is a tragedy which this Government understands and which this Government is going to do something about. It is a tragedy which clearly is understood by those on the other side. But to understand the tragedy is not to meet the point. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point is: What is the answer to that problem? I have gone through and illustrated what this Government has done. All the Opposition has done-and I think it does it with a great deal of sincerity; those on the other side are always sincere when they prepare these matters of public importance-is say that interest rates are too high. They are very high. I agree. Those opposite say the economy is not as good as it should be. I agree. </PARA>

Demand has to be suppressed because we are sucking in too much from overseas. We must turn the economy around to produce goods here which we can sell overseas. And that is what is happening. Business investment has risen in real terms by an average of 10.8 per cent per annum over the past five years and 92 per cent of the 1.6 million new jobs created have been in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bjelke-Petersen says I should shout him lunch, and I would be prepared to forgo the loss on the fringe benefits tax. I say to Senator Cooney to look at any headlines he cares to look at: `Banks warn worse ahead', `Retailers feel the pinch as economy slows', `New method needed to rescue companies', `10,000 companies have gone to the wall since Christmas'. We can go through headline after headline. We will find that there is a recession; there is no way out of it. The figures indicate that 10,000 small businesses are going broke annually, and that rate is increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But all we have heard from Senator Cooney and the other Government speakers is that everything is all right, there are no problems, and all we have to do is hang on. That is not what I expected to hear. It is certainly not what the small business people want to hear. They want to hear what the Government is going to do about interest rates, on-costs, superannuation payments, training levies, 38-hour weeks and accords. Those avenues were not addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The main issues of this debate were not picked up. Senator Cooney said, `The way we will fix this is by the Prime Minister putting down an annual report in Parliament'. I can assure Senator Cooney that that would be absolutely no good at all. Miles and miles of paper are coming across our desks here now. What we want to see, and what the people who are going broke in record numbers want to see, is some action. </PARA>
<PARA> Not Senator McMullan, Senator Cooney or the other Government speakers have taken any time to point out how the Government is going to help small business. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has said that he is going to reduce demand. Senator Cooney has said that the Government is going to reduce demand. But all it is doing is reducing business. </PARA>
<PARA> When those opposite face up to it, what is going wrong in this country is that we are not producing anything. The on-costs that the Government is putting on business are driving businesses into the ground. The Government is closing factory after factory and reducing our capacity to manufacture. Last year 31,000 jobs were lost in our manufacturing sector. We have a $2 billion trade deficit every month. Every month this country is going broke at the rate of $2 billion because we have no capacity to manufacture, we have no capacity to get productivity up and we are going bankrupt at the rate of $2 billion a month. But Senator Cooney tells us that the Prime Minister will put down an annual report in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not going to work. Senator Cooney has shown today that none of the three Government speakers has a clue how bad the situation is. They do not understand small business, the engine room of the Australian economy, and they do not know what they can do to help. They do not even understand the problem. It has been an exercise in absolute futility to try to explain the Government's position because it has no position. It does not understand the need to protect those 10,000 people who are going broke annually. I am very disappointed in the contribution that the Government made because it had no answers whatsoever for small business. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek to draw the Senate's attention to several aspects of the report of the 108th session of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). On other occasions we have drawn attention to the inadequacy of the NHMRC structure to deal with a number of quite important matters. It is a structure which has grown like Topsy over the years. Many of the committees are composed of part time people who have other quite arduous duties in relation to university teaching, lecturing and research work. The considerations by the NHMRC committees of a number of important matters are then very often dealt with in a delayed fashion and the independent research capacity of the NHMRC is also inadequate to deal with many of these questions. I draw attention to several matters in this report. On page 9 we find that toxicological work is going on in relation to the origin of high organochlorin levels in breast milk. </PARA>
<PARA> The extremely high levels of some of these pesticides in human breast milk was drawn to the attention of the public in Western Australia in the early 1970s. It was pointed out then that human breast milk in Western Australia would not be admitted to the market if it were cow's milk because of its excessive levels of organochlorin pesticides. Yet we find that in 1990, some 18 years-if my memory serves my correctly-after that was first drawn to the public's attention, the NHMRC is beginning an investigation into this subject.</PARA>
<PARA> The uptake of organochlorin pesticides from residential and occupational exposures is, again, a matter which has been in the public domain for quite a long time and one which quite clearly should have been taken up before now. I am not reflecting on the competence or the integrity of the NHMRC, but rather on the inadequacy of the total structure to more quickly and expeditiously pick up these matters and deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 10 of the report deals with the training of pest control operators. In 1986 I was a member of a South Australian Government committee looking at a massive contamination of the Streaky Bay High School with aldrin-dieldrin. For a time it looked as though it might be cheaper to totally demolish the school and rebuild it. This situation was due to the inadequacy of the schedule which set out how pest control operators should behave, and also the inadequacy of the training of that particular pest control operator. The system was so loose that despite the massive cost no action could be taken against the pest control operator in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 11 draws attention to the limited data available in Australia on dioxins in paper. This underscores the inadequacy of the ability of the NHMRC to independently research these matters, and therefore that it is dependent-overly dependent in my view-on information which comes in from overseas. We should have a great deal more independent local research effort which can advise the NHMRC and others in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am reflecting on the integrity of the NHMRC when I draw attention to page 30 of the report which deals with the effectiveness of water fluoridation. It mentions that the NHMRC has a committee inquiring into a number of matters raised by, among others, Drs Diesendorf, Sutton and Colquhoun. In an article in Nature Dr Diesendorf drew attention to the inadequacy of the data on which proof of the effectiveness of water fluoridation was established. Nonetheless, this report goes on and says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to the report of the 108th session of the National Health and Medical Research Council. We learn on the first page of this report that the National Health and Medical Research Council was constituted way back in 1936, and that the functions of the Council include reporting to the Commonwealth, the States, the Territories and to the Australian community on matters relating to the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and ethical issues in relation to health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With reference to those expressed functions, if one turns to page 17 one sees that there is a section headed `Disease prevention and control'. I cannot see under this section, or anywhere else in the report, a segment on iatrogenic diseases. I believe that there is an urgent need for research into this area in Australia. There also appears not to be a lot of overseas research. The Parliamentary Library was unable to come up with many references when a request was made by me last year. The research that I, and others in my office, have done in the epidural use of depo-medrol has suggested a very large problem in that area. In fact, that research has led us down a number of paths and it seems that the use of depo-medrol epidurally is possibly only one in a number of problem areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the Senate's attention an article in today's Perth's Daily News under the heading `Victims to Sue over Pain Drug'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Forty West Australians have launched a legal bid for compensation from WA doctors for injuries allegedly caused by treatment with the controversial drug Depo-Medrol. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the WA Depo-Medrol Epidural Action Group are taking action both individually and as a group to stop others from being injured by the drug. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Depo-Medrol Epidural Action Group claims hundreds of West Australians have been left virtual invalids after undergoing spinal injections of Depo-Medrol for back pain. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The WA Health Department is drafting a set of guidelines for the appropriate use of Depo-Medrol. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to commend the Western Australian Health Department for taking that action. However, I have some reservations as far as that is concerned. It seems to me that it is not a defensible proposition that a form of therapy which the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) has refused to register should be in any way supported, defended or regulated by any State health department. If a health department were to do so it should require medical practitioners to inform patients that depo-medrol is the substance proposed to be used because one of the problems that arose was that patients were simply not told what drug was to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The health department should also require practitioners to make it clear to patients that the drug manufacturer applied to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee to have depo-medrol approved for administration by the epidural route and that the application was rejected because the ADEC considered that efficacy was not substantiated and that the procedure was risky. The health department should also require practitioners to make it clear to patients that the notes supplied with depo-medrol by the manufacturer, Upjohn Pty Ltd, make it very clear that epidural administration is not supported by the manufacturer and that the pharmaceutical products guide specifically advises against epidural administration. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of sections in this report which make it absolutely clear that patients and people who require treatment by a hospital or doctor should take a lot of responsibility for their own actions. Only yesterday there was a report in a newspaper that almost a third of asthma deaths in Australia could be prevented if patients sought help more quickly. It is a tragic situation when if people sought the proper help at the right time--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome this report of the Inter-State Commission entitled Road Use Charges and Vehicle Registration: A National Scheme and, in particular, I am pleased to see that this issue is being addressed seriously. The report indicates on page 228 that the impact of recommended changes that will be brought about by the adoption of the report would be such that for all vehicles, other than the heaviest rigid trucks and trailers, all road use costs would be recovered through fuel charges. Such a suggestion I welcome indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>Inter-State Commission</PARA>
<PARA> The report generally heads in a direction which could redress some of the anomalies which we can see at the moment in our present road funding practices. I am pleased to see that the report tackles the issue of registration fees. The name `registration fees' is a misnomer. As the system exists now that fee is paid at a State level. Such a fee is used for a variety of purposes associated with transport. Probably in most instances only a twentieth of the fee is actually used for registration. At present it is a fixed charge and does not reflect any of the variables which should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The two most important variables which should be taken into account when placing fees or charges on a vehicle would be the vehicle's mass and the amount of use it makes of the community's roads. This report at least enters into that debate and considers some of the variables. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two variables, the mass of the vehicle and its use of the community's roads, are the variables which determine the contribution of that vehicle to the wear and tear on our roads and they should be put to work to determine the level of the contribution that vehicle will make towards construction and maintenance of our roads. We could use weigh bridges, tollgates, roving test crews, locked odometers and all sorts of devices to arrive at a just charge, but as this report suggests, an efficient and equitable charge could be applied through fuel levies. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important to remove fixed charges such as the so-called registration fees for several reasons. Firstly, high registration fees are an incentive to make use of what has been paid for. In my case, the car registration is in fact about 20 per cent of the market value of my vehicle. Having paid that, it is wasteful of me to leave the vehicle sitting in the driveway, so I get out and use it. A low registration fee and a high fuel tax should encourage more people to use public transport. A low registration fee would also encourage owners of older vehicles to keep them on the road for a few more years. We should not overlook the effect of this measure. Even a superficial understanding of the motor trade would allow the conclusion that vehicle repair and maintenance is a labour intensive activity. We should take into account the fact that employment can be generated by encouraging people to keep vehicles on the road for longer. This report could go a little further in looking at some of the fuel charges. I think, for example, that the present tax zones that we use for income tax could be manipulated in some way to determine a differential in the fuel taxes paid by different people in different zones in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The report in general gives us a clue to some of the directions that we could follow in bringing to resolution some of the anomalies that are at present in our road funding arrangements. I was entertained by the report and I hope that a considerable number of its recommendations and findings are adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously Senator Bell has a lot to learn in politics. It is obvious that he can pay a taxi fare from one end of his electorate to another because of the implications that would arise as a result of the report of the Inter-State Commission, Road Use Charges and Vehicle Registration: A National Scheme, in a place like Tasmania. I would challenge Senator Bell, as an Australian Democrat, to take a much wider vision than the small patch that he represents in Tasmania and come to some of the more remote, regional and distant parts of Australia and look at the effects of many of the recommendations of this report on people who live in areas where they cannot catch a taxi from one side of town to another when they have to do something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many ways in which some of the recommendations of this report will impinge very seriously on Australians who live away from the major capital cities or the south-east corner of the nation or in fact in Tasmania. I flag many points in this report that need to be addressed very seriously and carefully. If honourable senators take the time to look at the tabling statement by the Minister for Land Transport, the Hon. Bob Brown, in the House of Representatives, they will see that there are a number of issues on which he has clearly set out the objectives that `we will be observing'-I presume that is the Hawke Labor Government-and the principles that will be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his statement goes into quite a lot of the principles that he has already set down. Let me just highlight one of them:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . our initial approach will be to seek a cooperative basis for reform with the States, but we will make strategic use of Federal powers, which are considerable, where this process does not yield a satisfactory rate or level of change. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the keynote principles of the Labor Government. It is obviously going to wave the big stick under the eyes of the governments that are scattered throughout Australia that must cope with this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I highlight, for example, a problem that could arise. It came out in the Estimates Committee hearing the other night when I questioned an officer from the Department of Transport and Communications about whether that Department had in fact recommended the mass distance charge for heavy trucks and trailers travelling long distances. The Department accepted that it had made that form of recommendation. That in turn would produce remarkable additional costs on freight charges in remote parts of Australia. For semitrailers, registration is likely to rise from approximately $900 per annum to $16,000 per annum. What implications of that will be passed on to the consumers living in remote and regional parts of Australia? It is all right for Senator Bell, who has only to pay a taxi fare to get from one suburb of Launceston to another, to expect that charges will not be picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> This report canvasses a lot of economic and social debate and argument, just as it should do, but it must be read in the context of the way in which the Labor Government is disadvantaging people who live away from the major capital cities and the major parts of Australia. There are many aspects of this report that need careful consideration by all of the large States and by the Northern Territory. If it is just picked up using the principles outlined by Minister Brown, we will see a large number of Australians, who are not in any way represented in this place by the Australian Democrats, vastly disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak to the Inter-State Commission report, Road Use Charges and Vehicles Registration: A National Scheme, but Senator Tambling indicated such conservatism in his remarks and his protection of the status quo that I think further remarks need to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal, of course, is not in any way new. I point out to the Senate that I was the Australian Conservation Foundation's representative to the National Economic Summit which Mr Hawke called in 1983 shortly after he was elected. If honourable senators want to go back to the reports of the National Economic Summit, they will find in volume three four chapters which I wrote. One of those chapters canvasses precisely the recommendation from the Inter-State Commission which is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I took the proposal somewhat further and addressed some of the problems that were raised by Senator Tambling. My suggestion was that the Government essentially abolish, apart from a nominal charge, registration of vehicles. I also suggested that the majority of third party insurance cover be abolished so that the cost of vehicle ownership would be very small, but that the fuel price be doubled. I suggested that approximately half of that increase in revenue go to pay registration charges and third party insurance costs, but that the other half go to subsidise the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles. That would be on a sliding scale depending upon fuel efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling does not seem to realise that many of the costs that he talks about are already being borne, but not by those who are incurring those costs. They are being spread on to the rest of the community. We will shortly have to import billions of dollars worth of fuel because our indigenous reserves are running out. It is clear that we need to increase substantially the efficiency of the whole transport system in Australia. We are the third most serious greenhouse polluter in the world on a per capita basis. That is a problem that needs to be addressed and, indeed, we are currently looking at a way of reducing greenhouse emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. </PARA>
<PARA> A major contributor to greenhouse emissions is the amount of fossil fuel that is burnt in motor vehicles. One way in which we can substantially address the problem raised by Senator Tambling, and which I mentioned in my paper, is that part of the extra revenue that is raised as a fuel tax would go to establishing regional distilleries so that farmers who grow a whole variety of crops could produce alcohol, locally, which could be used in vehicles. If the price of fuel was doubled, the price of power alcohol would be roughly equivalent to the price of fossil fuel. That would make farmers independent of outside sources and not subject to the vicissitudes of the withdrawal of labour in oil refineries by tanker drivers and so on. It would also provide local industrial expansion and employment in regional centres and would exactly address the problem of greenhouse emissions, because by fermenting crops to alcohol and then burning the alcohol, one is simply cycling carbon dioxide through that system and not adding to the total greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA> It also addresses the problem of the increase in the imports of fossil fuels which this country will increasingly face during the next decade. I think there is considerable merit in the proposal which is before us. It needs to be expanded rather than contracted and I think the problems raised by Senator Tambling can be addressed through those mechanisms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to spend a few minutes on the report of the Inter-State Commission. I will discuss the mass and distance aspects relating to vehicles, as mentioned in the report. Although I welcome the idea of dropping the registration fee and adding the amount to the fuel levy to be put back into roads, I am concerned that what has already happened to levies raised in Australia for use on roads would happen again. The idea of imposing a fee on trailers also concerns me because a lot of trailers are already licensed and if a person owns only one prime mover and two or three trailers, that owner can get a reduction for the second and third trailer. Unless one has a road train licence, of course, one can pull only one trailer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But this report seems to get away from that aspect. The proposal for a fee to be imposed on trailers was to appease the subcontractors who own prime movers, and pull the big transporters' trailers around the country. This report came out to hit the main contractors rather than the subcontractors. That idea is all right providing that a person can get full use out of his or her trailer. If a person has a trailer licence, costing $16,000 for the year, and only uses the trailer for part of the year, as farmers do, then the idea is certainly not going to work. I welcome some other aspects of the report, but it certainly has a long way to go concerning this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter mentioned fuel efficient vehicles and the fact that operators should be encouraged to buy and use fuel efficient vehicles. As one who is experienced in contracting in road transport, I can assure Senator Coulter that the present cost of fuel in Australia makes a contractor go for the most fuel efficient vehicles that he can get hold of and also the most fuel efficient drivers who drive according to the road conditions and the load being carried, and who therefore use the minimum amount of fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to Senator Coulter's idea of production of power alcohol. This idea was pretty popular in the surplus wheat years from 1969 to about 1976. Our family business looked at the idea of manufacturing our own fuel and we simply worked out that for the plants available at that time to manufacture power alcohol, we would have to keep them going for two shifts a day, 365 days a year, in order to produce enough fuel to meet our needs. Then at the end of the process, the cost was not very different from that of fuel that could be bought. So we discarded that idea. I believe that this report has merit. There is a lot to learn from it, but I also have a lot of reservations about it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report outlines:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The number of design faults and defects in the New Parliament House not only continues to be a source of inconvenience to the occupants of the building but some are causing operational inefficiencies which add to the servicing costs of the building. Resolving many of these problems appear to be cumbersome and time consuming involving numerous consultations between the Joint House Department, the Parliament House Construction Authority and the original contractors. It is hoped these faults will not become a permanent feature of the building. </PARA>
<PARA>I read out that element of the report because I wanted to stress that it tends to underline some of the points I have been raising for quite some time in this chamber, with varying levels of support. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with some problems about the way these matters were dealt with in the Senate Estimates Committee because there is now, no doubt, a massive list of mistakes or errors or problems that have emerged out of building design faults. It does appear that these estimates are the appropriate ones under which to deal with those matters, even though under Estimates Committee D, I think it is, the Parliament House Construction Authority will come up for discussion. However, the answers from the Parliament House Construction Authority have come back via Estimates Committee A, and that is why I intend to deal with them now. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that whenever one has a major building one has a series of problems. I am concerned that so many design faults seem to have emerged-apart from the architect reinventing the wheel in so many areas, for example the door handles, which have been specially designed to catch coats, tear trouser pockets, and do as much damage to people's hips as possible. Apart from things like that, one has to look only at the carpets upstairs; the number of marble tiles that have had to be chipped out; the water leaks; the nonsense involving the blinds; the chaos in the kitchens; the moth-eaten textile walls in the other chamber; the air-conditioning breakdowns; the pools of water that gather on floors which are, for some quaint reason, set dead level rather than having any run off towards drains in wet areas; the louvres outside and the curtains inside the members and guests dining room; the acoustics in this chamber and in the committee rooms; the need to spend $680,000 to make the members and members and guests dining rooms habitable and useable. The list seems to go on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> We did get some interesting answers in Senate Estimates on some of these matters, but the problem is that most of the defects liability with the Parliament House Construction Authority has either expired or is soon to expire, and the Parliament House Construction Authority itself is set to expire on 30 September. The sort of thing that bothers me is that problems that clearly emerged a long time ago when these product liability situations were alive are only just now coming up for action. For example, there is the farce with the blinds. I remind the Committee that when we first moved into this building back in August 1988, many of the rooms, particularly those on the western side where the sun comes in, did not have blinds at all, and there was a great rush to get the blinds installed. I am grateful for whoever it was who thought it would be a good idea to shut me up by getting me a set of blinds pretty early in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> What interests me is that in Senate Estimates the Joint House Department revealed that it first advised the Parliament House Construction Authority in about August 1988 that it believed the mech- anisms were inadequate and would fail in service. It has been progressively following up that matter with the new Parliament House Construction Authority. That is almost two years ago. Here we are now, close to running out of our defects liability. I suppose it is reasonable for us to wonder why it has taken so long. I can understand the problems Joint House has in establishing whether it was the architect or the supplying company or who it was that was in trouble, but it is clear that the mechanisms were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that inadequacy, a lot of the blinds do not work and the mechanisms are being replaced at a very substantial cost, as I recall. It is a performance contract and it is up to the supplier to provide adequacy for service. The only problem is that labour costs will be about $120,000 for fixing up the blinds problem by providing mechanisms that actually work, rather than the light plastic mechanisms that certainly were not designed to carry wooden slats, which the timber venetians are made of. </PARA>
<PARA> We have received this reply from the Parliament House Construction Authority:</PARA>
<PARA>The timber venetian blinds are not, in the Authority's view, fit for purpose or adequate to fulfil the expectations of either the Agreement with the designers or the Contract with the blind manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA> Remedy is being followed by PHCA through both avenues. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent and parallel actions to establish a more serviceable option that can be taken up to correct these blinds are also being pursued so that these are ready to proceed as soon as the contractual matters have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> There are approximately 1875 blinds to be corrected and work will need to be done progressively to allow recovery of reuseable components, rebuilding and reinstallation with minimum disruption to the building occupants. </PARA>
<PARA> This work will continue beyond the closure date of PHCA. The Authority will therefore organise the repair program, provide adequate funding and appoint agents to complete its responsibilities for this work. </PARA>
<PARA> We really have to ask why the Parliament House Construction did not come to the view two years ago, when it was first pointed out by the Joint House Department that the blinds were inadequate, that they would not and, in fact, have not worked? It seems to me that wishfully hoping that maybe the problem will go away is simply not good enough. I wonder to what extent the Parliament, the Joint House Department and the Australian taxpayer will be disadvantaged because of the delay. I simply hope that full remedy will be available. I seek an assurance that the delays have not meant that full and total recovery of any expenses faced by the Joint House Department will not be made. I want to make certain that the delay has not diminished in any way our prospects of making that recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I am concerned that many of the questions that I asked during the Senate Estimates Committee A hearing were not answered by the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA), through the Joint House Department. I asked whether we could have an estimate of the ultimate charge to the public for the failed mechanisms overall. I have just had an undertaking from Senator Sibraa that he would seek a view about whether the Joint House Department would have to pay. As I recall, I asked whether the total cost of this sort of thing would be different from the amount the Joint House Department would have to pay-is there a total cost involved? I also asked about the cost of designing and equipping the main kitchen which is now to be closed. As I understand it, the Parliament House Construction Authority says that it is a bit too hard to find out that information. It has told us that it has answered all the questions that are necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that we have a total collapse-or an effective replacement-of the main kitchen because it is to be phased out and subsidiary or serving and presentation kitchens around the place will now carry that burden. I wanted to find out the original cost of putting in a major kitchen area-which now is either to be massively unused, or, depending on policy decisions taken, used only for some specific things like baking. When I asked what was the cost of design, construction and equipping of the main kitchen, which is now to be closed, the President said it was something that we had to get from the Construction Authority, too. I believe that some stab at it, without being too detailed, is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I want to raise on this same subject of design failures is the question of ponding on level tiled floors in wet areas. The President mentioned that not only does it happen in the kitchen, it also happens in the gymnasium and dressing rooms. Mr Guilfoyle from the Joint House Department said that this was an issue that the Parliament took up with the Authority and was overruled. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the large volume of design faults that seem to be emerging in terms of user problems. Before doing so, let me say that this is a brilliant public building; it is just not user-friendly. The issues that I am raising relate to user-friendliness. It seems to me that it is not really built for people to work in; it is built for people to look at. On this question of the Parliament being overruled on matters like this, is it possible for the Parliament to be advised about the extent to which its requests were overruled by the Authority:</PARA>
<PARA> Here is a clear example where-I presume that the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House might have made the request or it might have been a Presiding Officer or maybe Joint House; I do not know who made the request-the floors should have had a capacity to drain water away to the nearest waste outlet. It would seem that if this kind of overruling did take place by the Authority, we should find out to what extent the Parliament's desires were not met in building this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I also ask whether $680,000 was needed to restructure the members only dining room to resolve the design fault, if I can call it that. Some design faults cannot be corrected. For example, the requirements for waitresses and waiters in the dining room to negotiate a flight of seven steps with fully laden trays is something that cannot be resolved. It is simply an in-built design fault which will remain there, no doubt, for ever and those people who are unfortunate enough to fall either up or down those stairs will suffer many grazed knees and destroy plates. Does the $680,000 being spent now to restructure the members only dining area include the construction of a glass wall and how much would be saved if such a glass wall were not built, if it is in fact a part of that expenditure?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to Senator Baume, I have been advised that a number of questions that he asked the other evening at the Estimates Committee hearing have been sent to the Parliament House Construction Authority for answers. I think Senator Baume would realise that we have asked for estimates of money and that might take some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer to some of the other points he raised. It is a fact that a consultant's report recommends that there be a reduced usage of the main kitchen. But I would like to point out that there has been no decision taken yet to fully go along with that report. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator mentioned a sum of $680,000 for improvements to the second floor dining and bar areas. Let me go over the history of this. I point out to all honourable senators that no contracts have been let at this stage. But if the work is to go ahead and be finished for when we come back on 20 August, it has to commence the moment that the Senate gets up. The consultants looked at this because of continuing complaints that were voiced by senators and members about the food quality and service, the high subsidy level required, the lack of privacy, the poor ambience and the poor design leading to operational difficulties. We actively investigated ways of overcoming these deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist the Presiding Officers, Spotless Catering Pty Ltd was commissioned during the 1989 Budget session to undertake an operational review of catering services. A progress report was presented to the Joint House Committee on 29 November 1989 on improvements to the second floor dining and bar areas, including relocating and screening off members only dining to the upper level. The Presiding Officers, on the resolution of the Joint House Committee, agreed to proceed with the proposed changes. An information circular-1989/73 of 29 November-went to all senators and members. Spotless then conducted a survey of senators and members on 29 and 30 November 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I believe it was a fairly representative group across the Parliament. Frequent survey comments included: members areas devoid of atmosphere; bistro area poorly conceived; lacking a club atmosphere. There were complaints about food presentation and style, and poor furnishings in the members area. The Presiding Officers then wrote individually to all senators and members in February of this year advising about the proposed new members dining arrangements, inviting them to view a display of plans and artists impressions and to provide comment. The problem then was that we had an election. That display was deferred until April 1990. It was made available to senators and members who attended the first party meetings. It was also made available to those new members and new senators who were coming into the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 13 March 1990 a trial of some of the new service and menu concepts that had been recommended to us by Spotless began. We have had excellent customer feedback from that. There is a strong indication that the financial outcomes that were suggested by Spotless are obtainable. That trial continued until the end of April. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 May, which was during the first sitting week, the members dining room redevelopment booklet was made available in the members club room. Regular meetings of the Joint House Committee have not been possible during the May sittings but I have been approached by members of the National and Liberal parties saying that there is some serious doubt about whether the Presiding Officers should go ahead with the plans that have been shown to members and senators of the improvements that would cost $680,000. In reply to Senator Baume, the glass screening is included in that work. If it were possible to hold a Joint House Committee meeting this week or next week and the previous decision was reversed-that is, a decision was made not to go ahead-there would be, of course, substantial savings. There would still have to be work done in the kitchen. I have got no idea what the cost of that would be, but there is no doubt in my mind that there would be substantial savings on the $680,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke to the Speaker about this matter this afternoon and, hopefully, we will be able to come up with some solution as to whether a meeting is possible before the end of this week. I ask Opposition senators who have approached me on this matter to at least canvass their colleagues on the Committee, particularly from the House of Representatives, because all that the Speaker and I have been doing so far is carry out the resolutions of that committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on some of the matters just raised by the President. I was astonished at the history he gave of things that have been sent out in recent times. I do not think anyone would be surprised that most members and senators were more interested in the election than in the circulars that may or may not have turned up on this matter over the period he referred to. Certainly I was not aware until yesterday of the booklet he referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Discussing this matter in the dining room, one of the staff mentioned the booklet and went and got several for those of us who were discussing it at the time. As you know, Mr President, I spoke to you yesterday and today I conducted a survey amongst Opposition senators. I now have before me a letter I have just signed to give to you of the results of that survey, indicating beyond doubt that the glass panelling is not favoured. I personally find it astonishing that glass panelling was ever thought of to create what I think everybody wanted, that is, more privacy. My answer to that, and the answer of most honourable senators to whom I have spoken, apart from one of our senators, was that that has been achieved very successfully in a most pleasant way with the plants that have been put there. </PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no doubt that the standard of food at present is excellent. Everybody I have spoken to has commented on that fact. It is a marked improvement which is most welcome. There is great favour with the way the food is presented. I do not know what the bistro construction will do to improve what is presently provided. If it interferes with members serving themselves with salads and other food that would be an absolutely retrograde step. That matter has been included in the questions that we asked our own members. There certainly was significant opposition to the suggestion of turning the bar around to bring it into the dining room rather than leaving it separate as it is at present. What was most definite amongst those of our colleagues to whom we have spoken was that the glass would be claustrophobic. I think it would absolutely destroy the area. The concept of the members' and senators' own dining room being separate and at the top, as it is and as was originally intended, is undoubtedly the best idea for the area. Nobody is denying that the survey conducted some time ago indicated that greater privacy would be expected by members and senators, but I cannot see that anyone would deny that it has been achieved by the placing of plants, as is the case at present. Maybe we should leave it precisely as it is for 12 months or so and then see whether any changes need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the kitchen has some aspects that need attention right now, and that should probably proceed, but the rest of it is particularly doubtful. Certainly I think that the glazing that is intended should be left out. I shall deliver this letter to you, Mr President, as soon as the chamber rises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I get one thing clarified which did not come through to me at the Estimates inquiry? I understood that the cost of the equipment alone that is needed to make the upstairs kitchen a workable kitchen was about $120,000. I understood that those kitchen costs `are out of the final quote'. Does that mean that the $680,000 does not include the $120,000 for kitchen equipment? What will be the other costs involved of any structural alterations? What labour costs are involved in putting this new kitchen equipment in? As I understand it, a decision has been made to proceed with the upstairs kitchen. What will be the costs involved?

The reply from the Parliament House Construction Authority states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The design of the kitchens and food services generally was based on-</PARA>

<PARA>a brief approved by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House and refined after extensive consultation and approval by a series of individuals responsible in the Parliament for the food service and kitchen. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why I raise again the question: Who did mess this up? We hear from the Joint House Department that the Construction Authority did not agree with the Parliament's request. The Construction Authority has said that it was based on a brief approved by the Joint Standing Committee and that there were massive subsequent discussions. That is particularly in relation to the level floors and, as I understand it, Joint House having to purchase water vacuum cleaners to get the water off the floor in these tiled areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some more information which I was able to obtain over the dinner break. An extensive program of configuration testing and research on sound pattern generation and dynamics has been carried out over recent months in the chambers and committee rooms. The objective was to produce optimum performance from the current sound systems from the microphones through to the speakers. As a result of changes made following that program, improvements have been reported in all committee rooms except the main committee room and committee rooms seven and 16. Results of the modifications and adjustments are now being assessed by an independent electro-acoustics specialist. When the specialist report is received, the Sound and Vision Systems Office, in conjunction with the Joint House Department, will investigate further ways to enhance sound quality with priority to be given to the main committee room.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume asked a number of questions. To the best of our knowledge the cost plan is unavailable at this stage. I am talking about the wood panelling and the glazed partition in the members' dining room. The broad order of costs identified by the cost planner for the wood panelling and glazed partitions to screen off the upper levels of the members' bar, the members' dining room and the members' guest bar would be about $200,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before we went to dinner, Senator Reid gave me a letter about Opposition attitudes to proposed changes in the members' dining room. I ought to reply to them now. The first question she asked of Opposition members was: Do you support turning the members' dining room around so that it faces into the dining area? We are not turning it around at all; the members' bar is not changing. A servery is being built on the other side of it to serve the members' dining room. The second question was: Do you think a bistro area should be constructed in the members' dining area to replace the present food display area? The food display area is only being reallocated to a permanent position. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the glass panelling was contemplated was that members and senators made constant requests to watch television in the members' club room. They wanted to be able to watch the news and the 7.30 Report. That is why the television was put into the old bistro area. If those requests are to be complied with, that area will have to be soundproofed, otherwise the television will be heard all over the members' and guests' dining room. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last two weeks of sittings we have had a number of complaints from members and senators that members' guests have been walking up the stairs into the members' dining room looking for the toilet facilities. Again, it is felt that the area ought to be permanently partitioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to one other matter in the consultant's report about what should be done in the dining areas of this building. The trial to allow parliamentary pass holders to use the members' and guests' dining room during non-sitting weeks was very successful. Part of that consultant's report says that in non-sitting weeks the upper level area that is now the members' dining room should be partitioned, with members at one end and members and guests at the other end. Parliamentary pass holders should be able to use the lower level. If our experience is as it was during that last non-sitting period, that area will be packed and very noisy indeed. It was felt that some sort of soundproofing would be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> During the meal break I spoke to the Speaker. We are quite happy to consult with the Joint House Committee. I point out to Opposition members that the Joint House Committee has already endorsed the concept. If we can get a meeting next week we will hold it but, if these changes are to be implemented before we come back in August, these decisions will have to be made urgently. </PARA>

As I understand it, there have been complaints for just short of two years-ever since we moved here-about this problem which is now to be rectified. I make the same point now that I have made in respect of other matters such as the blinds. The complaint about the equipment not working began when it was still under warranty; when whoever provided it had to make certain that it worked. It has never worked properly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is page 106, paragraph 11.2.7-Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Very briefly, the Auditor-General discovered some discrepancies between the general and subsidiary ledgers. I must say that this is the sort of point I would have raised in Estimates had I had the Auditor-General's report with me. There may be a very simple answer. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The imbalance has persisted despite the issue of detailed instructions, amended reconciliation procedures and an increase in the threshold level for non-current assets from $1000 to $3000, resulting in a halving of the number of assets required to be recorded separately. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, there is still a $3m discrepancy. The Auditor-General reports that the organisation has recognised these deficiencies and was considering proposals to conduct extensive stocktakes and reduce the stocktake cycle from five to three years. It intended to conduct training seminars for staff designed to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of the fixed assets reconciliation process, and so on. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Further, introduction of a dispersed ADP accounting system in 1991 would provide for automatic updating of fixed assets records when the relevant expenditure was incurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this matter of the Green Commissioner, the Industry Commission in general in relation to the appointment of that commissioner and the role of the Commission with respect to its Act, because these matters have come very much to the fore in the last 24 hours. When the Industry Commission Bill was before this chamber during the last session there were two amendments moved by the Australian Democrats, accepted by the Government and passed into law. They were first, a new subclause 8 (4) of the Bill, which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Where a matter is referred to the Commission for inquiry and report, the Commission must also inquire into, and, in the same report, report on, the social and environmental consequences of any recommendations it makes. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is an overriding, ever-present term of reference, as it were, which must intrude into every report which the Commission makes on any subject. </PARA>
<PARA>Further to that we also moved, and the Government accepted, an amendment to proposed subsection 28 (2) which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>At least one of the Commissioners must be a person who has knowledge of, and at least 3 years experience, in an employed or voluntary capacity, in environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the issue which is before us now-the giving of effect, through the appointment of that commissioner, to that intention which is clearly written into legislation and which was accepted at the time, as I recall, without demure by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will know, yesterday a speech was made to the so-called Sydney Institute by one Dr Alan Moran. Dr Moran said, among other things, that concerns about Australia's soil degradation problem were completely unfounded. He is reported as having gone on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Self-contained land degradation, exhaustion and erosion, where it is confined to the individual's own property, is one of the great fabrications of alarmists and rhetoriticians. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting word. He went on to say that concern about a serious soil problem in Australia was also `completely unfounded', as a study of American croplands showed. Finally with respect to this particular matter Dr Moran said that Australian agricultural output showed signs of achieving sustainable development, which he defined as using resources today without reducing real incomes in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out, first of all, that Dr Moran was reported as speaking as the First Assistant Commissioner with the Industry Commission and also as a senior Federal Government official. Honourable senators will recall that at Question Time today I asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), in relation to Dr Moran speaking in this way, whether he was speaking as a private individual or whether he was speaking as a spokesperson for the Government. Senator Button indicated that it really did not matter very much whether he was speaking in one capacity or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that a rather remarkable statement, particularly in view of the fact that in reply to an earlier question from Senator Childs, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) said of Dr Alan Moran that he had a `cavalier, cowboy attitude'. Clearly, in his reply to Senator Childs, Senator Richardson was distancing the Government from Dr Moran's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know the capacity in which Dr Moran made that statement. I was not at the meeting; I am only going on the newspaper reports. But in a prima facie sense he was speaking in his official capacity. I would defend very strongly the right of employees, including government employees, to make public statements on any matter whatsoever, including government policy, provided they make it clear that they speak in a private capacity. When they speak as government employees it seems to me that it is absolutely essential that they speak only in relation to what government policy is. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly disturbed by these statements made by Dr Moran, as I indicated, at least in a prima facie sense as an employee of the Government, particularly bearing in mind the amendments which have gone into this Bill to attempt, as it were, to green this very important activity of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also in passing that Dr Moran was speaking to the Sydney Institute, which describes itself as a think tank. I have had a little bit to do with the Sydney Institute by way of reading some of its material. I must say I wonder how Gerard Henderson and his colleagues can think with brains that, in my view, seem to have been frozen somewhere in the nineteenth century. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look particularly at this statement by Dr Moran that Australian agricultural output shows signs of achieving sustainable development, which he defined as using resources today without reducing real incomes in the future, we find a statement which is absolutely typical of economists who have no knowledge whatsoever of the real world of living things. Indeed, because of their abstraction from the real world they have a total disregard for the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising because economists compare unlike things by rendering them into dollar terms. So many dollars buy so much land, wheat or petrol. At one level it is certainly true that economists can compare unlike things-they can compare them through dollar terms. But they then make the completely unjustified assumption-and it is clear from Dr Moran's statement that he is guilty of this offence-that, therefore, they are completely interchangeable or exchangeable. That is simply not the case. One cannot eat dollars, nor can one drive a vehicle with land, although through the market system they can be interchanged with dollars. In the real world they cannot be interchanged-they are simply not substitutable. Economists and Dr Moran ignore this difference between the real world and the abstraction which goes on, and has gone on, with economists. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point is: Does the Government share this particular view? Senator Button said today that he was not worried by Dr Moran speaking in his capacity as a Government employee. If the Government shares this view put by Dr Moran, it does not augur well for the Industry Commission. Indeed, the Industry Commission is going to find itself in a great deal of hot water if it is influenced by and makes the sort of statements that Dr Moran is reported as having made. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is Government policy, why has the Government stated that it considers land degradation a serious problem and is spending not a sufficient but a considerable sum of money in the repair of this damage? Surely if Dr Moran is right in his economic analysis, we should be flogging off land to the Japanese for holiday homes. That would maintain income, which by Dr Moran's own criteria and definition would amount to sustainable agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare the statement of the scientist, Dr David Smiles, the head of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Division of Soils, speaking in response to Dr Moran. He pointed out that on a yearly basis Australia loses $350m to $400m worth of nitrogen from its soils; $160m to $200m worth of phosphorous; $60m to $80m worth of potassium; and that there is a real declining quality of wheat because of the declining nitrogen content of the soil. He pointed out that there is great difficulty in maintaining the protein level. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator. Dr Smiles went on to point out that nitrogen loss is tied to acidification and the problems of residue management and that those problems are still without solution. That is the real world-a long way from Dr Moran's totally artificial world in which he compares land, wheat, petrol and other things simply in dollar terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This all adds up to the fact that Australian agriculture is simply not sustainable; that the land on which we are growing our crops is deteriorating. Dr Smiles pointed out that there is no clear way so far in which the nutrient levels in the soil can be maintained. The Government itself admits to $600m worth of lost export potential because of this nutrient loss. According to today's newspapers, Dr Smiles believes that the figure may be closer to twice that level-$1.2 billion. In addition, there is extensive soil loss and salinisation, particularly in Western Australia. Dr Moran went on to say that the world's oceans were too vast to be spoiled by pollution. He said that the cleansing powers of the world's great oceans remained intact and they were still the surest low-cost means available to break down waste and make it harmless: the oceans were `too vast to be spoiled' by damage caused by pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> Was Dr Moran saying-I stress, again, that ostensibly he was speaking as a Government employee-that the heavy pollution of the oceans contiguous to most of the world's major cities, including many Australian cities, as residents of Sydney would know but no more so than those of Adelaide where we have a tertiary sewage treatment system, is not to be taken seriously but, indeed, made worse because ocean dumping is the cheapest means of disposal? Is that Government policy?</PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the fact that Dr Moran was making the statement as a Government employee, apparently. Dr Moran went on to point out that in his opinion the best way to protect endangered animals was to pass them into private ownership. I am surprised by that but, in the light of his other remarks, apparently he seems quite incapable of considering the loss of a species as at all important. The history of private exploitation of animal species is littered with examples of forcing species to extinction, or near extinction. Economic common sense, as expounded by Dr Moran, would mean that a company or a person owning a species would force it to extinction, if that was profitable, and invest that money in the next species. That would be Dr Moran's economic rationality. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental question which emerges from this matter is: Is Dr Moran's view the view of the Government? If not, why was he appointed to a commission which, according to its charter passed in this Parliament only in the last session, should take a very different view from the view which he was espousing only yesterday? Will the Government see that Dr Moran, and people of his view, are shifted to less important and less sensitive positions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last question asked by Senator Coulter is no. I thought I went through this issue after lunch in Question Time. Senator Richardson also answered a question about it. I have never heard a more laboured point than the one Senator Coulter sought to make tonight. Dr Moran is not a commissioner of the Industry Commission. The Business Regulation Review Unit was put in with the Industry Commission. Dr Moran headed that Business Regulation Review Unit. As I understand it, his position is equivalent to a First Assistant Secretary. He is not a full commissioner of the Industry Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Coulter referred at length to the fact that the Industry Commission was a government body with a charter. That is true: it is a statutory authority with a charter. The most important point of its charter, in some ways, is that it is an advisory body to government. It has no greater status than that. The Government can take notice of the Industry Commission's views, ignore the Industry Commission's views, or reject the Industry Commission's views. Dr Moran is a public servant working in the Industry Commission who has expressed views which are not formal views of the Commission. Even if they were formal views of the Commission, the Government could ignore them or reject them. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Dr Moran is in a similar position to that of the scientist, Dr David Smiles, who at a seminar in Sydney put a different view from that of Dr Moran. Dr Smiles is an employee of a statutory authority, the vast majority of whose funds are government appropriations. Presumably, according to Senator Coulter, he is quite entitled to put his view because it is a view that Senator Coulter happens to like. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say the same about both men. I prefer the view, and Government policy is more in accordance with the view, put by the CSIRO scientist. Why are we spending all this money on soil degradation if that is not the Government's view? Why is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) devoting so much attention to this issue if it is not the Government's view? Senator Coulter knows perfectly well that it is the Government's view. However, he comes in here and tries to make a mountain out of a molehill because Dr Moran has a view which he does not like. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not share Dr Moran's view, but I do assert his right to put it if he wants to, just as I assert the view of the CSIRO scientist to put his view, with which I happen to agree. I suppose this little point that Senator Coulter is making is a good launching pad, but it is nothing more than that. I have nothing to add to what I said this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disturbed by the Minister's reply. I made it quite clear that I have no objection whatsoever to Dr Moran putting any views at all provided he explains that they are his private views, particularly as he is an economist and he is making statements right outside his area of expertise. I do not think for a moment that Senator Button can compare those views of an economist when he is speaking on ocean pollution, on soil degradation and on the threat to endangered species with the views of the head of the Division of Soils of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), putting expert evidence before the public. That is a totally different situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, if Senator Button is saying that these matters are merely matters of opinion, then I am doubly disturbed because these matters are not matters of opinion. There is objective evidence in relation to soil degradation; there is substantial objective evidence in relation to ocean pollution; and there is substantial evidence in relation to endangered species. It is not simply a matter of opinion, as Senator Button seems to be saying. There is objective material there and I think that, with respect to soil degradation, Dr Smiles of CSIRO has a perfect right to put the best evidence before him. That is not a matter of opinion, whereas the expressions of opinion-I use those words quite deliberately-by Dr Moran were just that. In expressing an opinion he evidently did not distinguish his position as a public servant from his other position. He was described as being a First Assistant Commissioner with the Industry Commission. In that respect he is slightly removed from Government, but he was also described as a senior Federal Government official. He was apparently holding himself out as speaking in that capacity. That is not a reasonable thing for a person to do when he is simply expressing an opinion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One matter has still not been resolved. We have heard that Dr Moran is not a commissioner. When is the Green commissioner going to be appointed? There was a great deal of discussion in Senate Estimates of what criteria was to be used in appointing him. I am wondering whether we can assume that today's venture from the Australian Democrats is to make certain that Dr Moran does not become the commissioner, if he had an application in. I assume that today's arrangements are to remind the Minister of the deal that the Democrats did with the Government in order to get this legislation through in the first place, which was to require the appointment of a greenie commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of us on this side support conservation and have no difficulty with the concept that someone who is concerned about conservation should be a commissioner of the new Industry Commission. Perhaps our definition of a greenie may be different from the Democrats' definition, and hopefully the Government's is as well. The Democrats' view, from listening to them tonight, is that a greenie is someone who has an acceptable greenie position as far as they are concerned. Other people who have genuine conservation views, who are genuinely concerned about the degradation of our soil, for example, are not necessarily acceptable to the Democrats. There was a great deal of effort put in in the Senate Estimates to establish what criteria there is to be and what sort of `pay-off' to the Democrats is involved for getting this legislation through in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the constitutional problems that have arisen as a result of the passing of this legislation, and despite all the problems that emerge about commissioners who do not retire until 1991, in one instance, and until 1994, in two other instances, they have obligations in that area and are committed in their jobs and in their station to a salary until that time. They cannot be removed. The only thing that the Government can do is offer them other jobs or ask them to accept a compensation package or something like that. We have here a situation where under the Act at least one of the commissioners must be a person who does not have a job and who has at least three years experience in an employed or voluntary capacity in environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Having heard the Democrats today put in their bid for an acceptable greenie, I urge the Minister to appoint to that role someone who has a genuine interest in conservation matters and who has the capacity to balance the conflicting pressures of growth and conservation in a rational way to the benefit and advantage of all Australians, rather than to give way to the Democrats' demands that the deal they did with the Minister should be satisfied only by a greenie of their choice. </PARA>

I think the statements by Dr Moran clearly indicate that there is a real necessity for at least one out of eight commissioners to have a sympathetic view in relation to the environment. If the prevailing view which is coming through from Treasury is that indicated by Dr Moran-and that was the gist of everything I was saying earlier, because he was representing himself as a Government person-it is absolutely necessary that at least one in eight of those commissioners have an alternative view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish to comment that Dr Hundloe has been in the environment area for quite a long time. In the past he has been a councillor of the Australian Conservation Foundation. For Senator Baume's edification, he is a person who also comes from the econometric side of the environment debate. I think he would not object if I did not call him a rabid greenie.

As shown in the Estimates Committee A Hansard at page A108, Senator McMullan undertook at the Estimates Committee hearing to provide answers and written replies to a number of points that I made that evening and which are listed in quite some detail. These related to the current review that was under way with regard to taxation zone rebates. I asked questions about what use was being made of consultants in the review and whether any particular consultation had been undertaken with the various State, Northern Territory or local governments on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was also seeking to know what recommendations arose from the report some two years ago, in 1988, of the Prime Minister's country task force, which for the last two years a number of Australian Labor Party politicians have been touting around in the electorate with rather gay abandon, saying that they had expected that there would have been changes in the 1988 and the 1989 Budgets which have not been forthcoming. Of course, I would now hope that in the 1990 Budget we will see the results of this particular review emerging. I am concerned that those questions have not been addressed at this point. I would have thought that in the last day or so they would have been. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to address a further question more particularly to Senator McMullan, who also stated at the Estimates Committee hearing the other evening that in any redefinition of the boundaries that could be applied to or be part of any review of the zones the boundary review was certainly part of what is being reviewed. Senator McMullan said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's statement announcing the review said that it would be on a no detriment basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to ascertain more details with regard to that specific supposed statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, let me first address your general comment concerning the large number of outstanding questions from Treasury, which is a reasonable cause for concern. I am told that, because they were so many questions put on notice, a lot of resources have been put into trying to collate and ensure that these questions are dealt with quickly. Many of them are under way. As an example, I can deal specifically with those which Senator Tambling has raised, which I will do in a moment. I myself checked on that this evening. I am concerned that the answers are not here but I am advised they are proceeding expeditiously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the general matters of taxation zone rebates, the questions raised by Senator Tambling have the same status as the other 20 questions. I have personally inquired to ensure that expeditious handling of the matter to give him comprehensive answers to all these questions is being undertaken, and I can assure him that that is the case. I would have hoped that it would be here by today but certainly it is being dealt with promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> I checked the no-detriment basis myself. I am fairly confident that the words were used by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) but where they are used in a written statement-and I would have thought that document would already have reached Senator Tambling but certainly it is in transit to him-is in the advertisement calling for submissions to the inquiry. It said quite clearly, `on a no-detriment basis'. That document, if it has not reached Senator Tambling, is in transit to him, and that is where it is stated explicitly and in writing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not at this stage received any of that documentation. I will study it carefully when I receive it. I am particularly concerned at the delays in answering these questions because on Monday of last week I directed a particular question to Senator Collins as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia. I directed a very direct question to him on that occasion. Senator Bjelke-Petersen followed that with a similar question, I believe a day later, to which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, (Senator Button), was unable to give a direct response, and in fact gave almost a contrary view to Senator Collins. However, Senator Button came into the chamber a day later with a prepared answer to Senator Bjelke-Petersen's question. Very obviously there was considerable preparation in the material that was provided to Senator Button last week which was in advance of the Senate Estimates hearing. Therefore I am most concerned to now find that there is obviously confusion and inadequate responses coming from the Department of the Treasury and that it is unable to meet the genuine requests of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the issue that arises in relation to no detriment, I do not believe we can just accept that an advertisement for calling of submissions is in any way indicative of what Government action will be in this response. Thousands of taxpayers in remote and rural parts of Australia have not had any change in the taxation rebate scheme since 1984. Therefore the matter is urgent. The issue relating to zone boundaries or what towns will be included in either zone A or zone B are of particular concern, as I said, to thousands of Australian taxpayers. I do not believe that we should be left on a hook, waiting for these types of inadequate responses that are to come. It will certainly be one issue in which the Government is going to be judged very carefully in the 1990 Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just briefly respond to that? Senator Tambling's high dudgeon is a little hard to cope with. He came in when the relevant section of the Estimates Committee had passed-the appropriate section in which he could have asked these questions having been dealt with some two hours previously-tried to ask questions at the wrong time, and, because I said, `Don't worry about the fact that it is not appropriate now; I am happy for you to ask them now and I will try to get you an answer' he now comes and tries to put on some sort of star turn as if he has been done a disservice when in fact we could properly have said, `I'm sorry, you are too late; we have long passed that section'. Essentially we are providing information to him in response to questions that he did not ask at the right time and to which he was not strictly entitled in accordance with the Standing Orders. It is a bit much for him to come in here and put on that sort of performance. I also think it is just this side of preposterous for him to say that the Government making a written statement in the newspaper of the basis upon which it is conducting a review is not adequate guidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments cover not only the Department of the Treasury but also the Department of Finance; they are relevant to both. The Committee needs to take a very hard look at the effectiveness of this so-called program budgeting in areas where performance indicators are not available or where they are inadequate. While endorsing the philosophy of making managers responsible for the decisions under their control, one line appropriations in areas such as Treasury and Finance for their subprograms are not sufficient, nor are the explanations adequate, particularly for the Supplementary Estimates which we have just dealt with. They are not adequate for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny in their present form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As parliamentarians we do not have the ability to make an assessment of just how effectively these managers have administered and discharged their responsibilities. We do not have an assessment of how effectively they have met their goals or their programs. I think this is reflected in a question that we asked, believing that the 3 per cent national wage cost had not, or could not, be allocated to programs. We were advised that we would have to be given a paper on that position so that we could clarify what program management budgeting involves. There was a further implication that there was one set of books for the Parliament's evaluation and another set for internal consumption. Clearly, these explanations are quite insufficient and inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> When we attempted to ask questions of a general administrative nature, they were repeatedly deflected-incorrectly, in the view of the coalition. The Government representatives' interpretation of our ability to question in this area was inappropriate. Further, this rejection was not on the basis of our questions asking for an opinion or asking a policy question. Our questions were framed in the light of the administration of the programs under the responsibility of the departments concerned. Guidelines must therefore be established at an early opportunity to overcome this inability of parliamentarians to question adequately in this area of program budgeting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly an unsatisfactory position that we have at the present time. We were told that through the implementation of program budgeting the Parliament would be given a lot more information than we were in the past when we had item by item descriptions. We have absolutely no ability, where there is a lack of performance indicators, to see how effectively these programs have been administered. There are good reasons for suspecting that there could be some hiding under the cloak of program budgeting. The concept of program budgeting is to open up these areas for further illumination of what has happened and how effectively the responsibility has been charged. In other words, as a parliament, we need to know just how widely we can question in areas which can rightly be regarded as the proper sphere of administration of a department, whether that department has administered outside the traditional guidelines as well as the extent of the ambit of the administrators' true Public Service responsibilities to the Parliament and the Executive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an issue encountered by my colleague Senator Bishop during consideration of the Supplementary Estimates in Estimates Committee A. The Liberal-National Party coalition continues to be concerned that during the Estimates the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, refused to allow questions to be asked concerning the minute paper prepared by the Department of Finance which purportedly costed the coalition's Economic Action Plan. The Government senator's reason for refusing to allow officers to answer questions was that the matter did not relate to a specific program for which additional estimates were being requested. The matter that the members of the Committee wished to raise was of a general administrative nature and not related to any specific program, least of all the one for which the Department was seeking additional estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition is of the view that Ministers, or their representatives, should not block questioning on additional estimates which are related to the general administration of a department. This is particularly the case where the matter is one which could be regarded as politically sensitive. The coalition will further pursue this matter in the Senate but in the interim this reservation has been appended to the report of Estimates Committee A to draw the Senate's attention to the concerns of the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not been in the Senate as long as most other people in this chamber-perhaps everybody else in this chamber. But I have been on Estimates Committee A, I regret to say, almost from the day I arrived because it started sitting almost on my first sitting day, dealing with Supplementary Estimates. The Chairman of Estimates Committee A, Senator Childs, has been fairly liberal in his interpretation and I think that is appropriate. But I have always had the view, particularly with regard to Supplementary Estimates, that there needs to be at least some connection between a supplementary estimate and the question being asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the good things about the Parliament is that there are plenty of forums in which to pursue information. Sometimes an Estimates committee is the most appropriate place to do that. It is done with vigour and so it ought to be. Sometimes this chamber is the most appropriate place. Sometimes it may be a standing committee of the Senate or a special committee or whatever. There is no shortage of avenues. But Estimates committees, no less than any other part of the Parliament, need to operate within the Standing Orders of those bodies. I do not think we ought to take too narrow a view of it. I do not think anybody who observed the Estimates Committee A proceedings, at least in so far as they related to Treasury and Finance-which are the areas for which I was responsible; I think it is also true for others, but I cannot speak for them-could say that we were particularly difficult in preventing people from raising issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I just commented on Senator Tambling who came in to the Committee entirely out of order, but with questions that if he had asked at the right time and in the right way would have been perfectly appropriate. They were Estimates committees matters. So we said, `Do not worry about the procedural problems; just put the questions on notice and we will get the answers'. The relevant officers had left because we were not dealing with the right section, and that is why we took them on notice. That was an example of endeavouring to cooperate with honourable senators to provide information, and there were others. </PARA>
<PARA>But there just comes a time in which the connection between the matter being pursued and the estimates before us becomes so remote as to be, in effect, non-existent. We had questions such as this in an attempt to make the matter relevant. Senator Bishop said that because the National Audit Office comes under the Department of Finance and the Audit Office would be concerned about the manner in which departmental money is expended, perhaps she could use the Audit Office estimates to ask a question about this matter. I am quoting Senator Bishop, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>Page 14 talks about the National Audit Office. Presumably, the Audit Office will be concerned about the manner in which departmental money is expended. </PARA>
<PARA>If we started to use the Audit Office's role of auditing other bodies to mean that questions about those other bodies could be asked under the estimates of the Audit Office, we could ask questions about the Department of Primary Industries and Energy under those estimates, because the Audit Office reviews that Department's expenditure. That just does not make sense as a point. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quite relaxed about whether or not the question was asked and answered if it could be brought within the Standing Orders. It was not. I simply pursued a point in my first experience on the front bench which I pursued for two years as a back bench member of the Committee. I did not do so because I sought some sort of argument or confrontation, because I am a great advocate of Estimates committees. As the officers at the table and others will know, I have spoken at a number of seminars about the role of Estimates committees and put forward my views. They may not be the views that everybody shares, but I wanted to put on the record the fact that there was in no way any obstruction.</PARA>
<PARA> I certainly am quite relaxed about a proposal that the capacity for people so to pursue matters that are not covered by any estimate ought to be regularised. I am not necessarily having any confrontation with the point that there ought to be some situation by which the situation is clarified. I have found in 2 3/4 years that it is continually uncertain. I am quite relaxed about that. The only reason I chose to speak was to make sure that, the matter having been raised, there is nothing left on the record to say that I set out in some way to prevent people exercising their proper rights under the Standing Orders, which I will not do. </PARA>

<PARA> I must say that I would be much more comfortable if we could be assured of the fact that a failure to allocate them to individual programs does not prevent our pursuing individual programs even though they do not appear with line by line alterations, so that people like Senator McMullan can say, `It didn't appear; it wasn't in the Supplementary Estimates, therefore you cannot talk about it.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the first matter to be raised with regard to the Defence estimates. I want to make a few general remarks about the problems that senators face due to the new procedures. We have here a very bland report by an Estimates committee, despite the fact that it has been considering some very important estimates over a period of two days. The Government has compressed, in an excessive and, I think, an unprecedented way, the amount of attention that is able to be given to Estimates-albeit that they are Supplementary Estimates rather than the general Estimates, but the same general issues are always raised which require the proper attention of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the new rules the theory seems to be that the Senate can, and should, rely solely on the report of Estimates committees in order to debate the details of the Government's expenditure. Although that may not be such a major question in regard to these Supplementary Estimates, it will certainly be a very real question when we consider the Budget estimates in the next session of parliament. If the new rules are going to make any sense at all-and I have very grave doubts as to whether they will; I must say that I have already expressed those in the debate we had when they were brought into the Senate-the Estimates committees will have to do a decent job of reporting to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody could possibly say that the report we have in front of us at the moment is anything more than a bland, anodyne attempt to prevent this chamber from being able to conduct that debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear that that is so. But what concerns me is the amount of time that was allowed for consideration of this report. I do not know what happened to other reports, but certainly the time allowed for the compiling of this report was totally inadequate for the presentation of a detailed consideration of the estimates. This Committee finished its consideration of the Estimates last Thursday evening and a meeting was held on the following Monday at 1.50= p.m. in some public area of the Parliament in order to settle the report. As I recollect, the Senate got up on Thursday--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter who the Chairman of the Committee is. The fact is that the Government has brought on the consideration of these Estimates this week before the committees have had any real opportunity properly to consider the matters before them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not blaming the Committee. I am blaming the Government's handling of this whole process. The report of this Estimates Committee is a classic example of the way in which the Government has compressed the time for the consideration of Estimates. That is my point. I am not trying to blame any particular members of the Committee. I think they were given an impossible job. I am not a member of this Committee but I did attend the Estimates hearings for some periods and I know that detailed consideration was being given to them. But the hearings did not finish until Thursday evening and senators were not available for meetings on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> Having shown some interest in the matter, I was asked if I would put forward any reservations, if I had any. In fact, I was asked to do so before the Committee had finished its work. But, as I said, the Committee then met for a few minutes on Monday to settle the report, due to the Government's demands that these matters be brought before the Senate this week. The Committee did not have any reasonable amount of time for consideration, unless committee members had spent the weekend here-which is a rather unreasonable request considering that the Senate had sat for two weeks. But the Committee was expected to have completed its report before the Senate sat on Monday because the Government demanded that the reports be presented so that they could be debated today or, I suppose, if the Government had its way, even earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> This is certainly an impossible atmosphere under which the new system must work. If we are going to proceed with these new Standing Orders-and I must say that when governments behave like this it is a pretty good indication that such Standing Orders cannot work-and assuming that we are having them foisted on us before the Government has the numbers--</PARA>
<PARA> Government senators-No. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's numbers pushed these things through, with the support of the Australian Democrats. If they are going to work, then proper time has to be given for the Estimates committees to consider properly the matters before them, to properly consider the reservations that honourable senators have put in. There is a list of reservations here. I put in only one reservation on this one, but I will jolly well make sure that there are pages of reservations in future-and I am not even a member of the Committee. I will ensure that there will be pages of reservations or that there will be all-embracing reservations. I can tell the Government that a horse and cart can be driven between these Standing Orders if it thinks it can get away with this sort of blue murder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I put in a reservation on a matter I was particularly concerned about. Of course, no attention whatever was paid to that. I see that one of my colleagues has put in a number of reservations. There is absolutely no comment on any of those put forward by Senator Newman. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to require this process that any senators, whether they are members of the Committee or not, have to put in reservations to get any attention whatsoever given to these important estimates when we come to debate them in detail, as we are trying to do now, then the Standing Orders will be subverted. The intention clearly is that the Estimates committees will take a wide and embracing consideration of the matters, and will try, as Senate committees usually do, to reach some consensus about such matters. It will only be in cases where that cannot be reached that reservations will be put in. But that is a process that needs time. Clearly, this Committee was simply unable in the time to do the job that was given to it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first matter of concern that I wish to express, and I think the Senate, whether now or at some later stage, is going to have to consider the way in which this new procedure is going to work. </PARA>

Women will continue to be posted initially to ships where satisfactory accommodation and privacy provisions exist or can be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Forty women are already at sea under these arrangements. In subsequent years Navy may seek modest funds to make some change to accommodation arrangements in existing ships. Changes would normally be made during a planned refit. Refit costs are not expected to increase significantly as a consequence. Provision will be made to accommodate women in new ships during the construction phase, for example, the Anzac ships. Navy plans to have about 500 women at sea by 1996. </PARA>

There should not be a significant difference in the maintenance costs of the two systems. Ammunition has to be provided to test rifles more extensively than planned. Obviously if there is a minor defect, one must use more ammunition to remedy the defect. About 100 rifles were exhaustively tested to find a solution to the problems being encountered.

I suppose these questions arise in their most acute form as a result of the losses of pilots in the last year or so. I understand that the Royal Australian Air Force is short of approximately 150 pilots-perhaps the Minister could confirm that-and also that there is a recruitment drive for middle level pilots, who I understand range from the ranks of flight lieutenant right through to wing commander.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before tonight I did not know, and I guess Senator Durack did not know, that these people are referred to as lateral recruits. That is something that probably we have both learned tonight. I will give you some information from the questions coming out of the Estimates Committee B hearing and I hope that will cover enough of the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Normal security clearance procedures for Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel are followed for prospective lateral recruits. That is, security vetting is done by the Directorate of Air Force Intelligence and Security. Immigration processing of lateral recruits is subject to the normal rules of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. To expedite processing, a tripartite negotiated arrangement between DILGEA, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the RAAF was signed on 23 December 1989. The tripartite negotiated agreement removes the sponsorship skills test requirements and permits the annual migration of a total of 30 officers of general duties, pilot, navigator, engineer, supply and air traffic controller categories. Lateral recruits from other categories are sponsored by the RAAF under the employer nomination scheme. Australian citizenship is a requirement for permanent RAAF service. A lateral recruit may be accepted by the RAAF if he or she gives an undertaking to apply for citizenship when eligible; that is, after three months full-time RAAF service. </PARA>
<PARA> Retention measures specific to lateral recruits do not exist; however, lateral recruits are eligible for any retention incentives offered to other members of the RAAF. If a lateral recruit accepts RAAF assistance for removal, including furniture and personal goods, a three-year return of service obligation is applied. Non-poaching arrangements were resolved before lateral recruitment started when the Chief of the Air Staff wrote to the Royal Air Force Chief of the Air Services on 17 May 1989 to apprise him of the intention regarding lateral recruitment; that is, recruitment aimed at ex-RAF or serving RAF officers who had already decided to separate. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 June 1989 the RAF Chief of the Air Services responded, agreeing to lateral recruitment by the RAAF. No specific employment contracts apply to lateral recruits. The number recruited during 1989 total 10, with a further 3 possibles. That is made up of four coming from the RAF, one air traffic, one pilot, one engineer and one police; two from the Canadian armed forces, one pilot and one police; three from Air Force Zimbabwe, one air traffic and two pilots; and finally, from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, one ground defence, making a total of 10. </PARA>
<PARA> RAAF lateral recruits are not mercenaries in accordance with article 47 of the protocols of the Geneva Convention 1949, which defines a mercenary as any person, firstly, specifically recruited locally abroad in order to fight in armed conflict, who does in fact take a direct part in hostilities, is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and in fact is promised by or on behalf of a party to the conflict material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that party, is a national of neither party to the conflict, and who has not been sent by a state which is not a party to the conflict on official duties as a member of its armed forces. That is a very convoluted definition of a mercenary. That will also be provided tomorrow in answer to a question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose this raises the general and obvious question of how we can recruit even as many as 10 pilots from overseas-and obviously we may be able to attract them from the countries that the Minister mentioned. How is it that we are able to attract numbers from the United Kingdom rather than being able to retain our own pilots? Has any assessment been made of this?

I do not know what the motive is. I guess it would not take too long to quickly interview the people and ask them what their motives are for coming here. I think it is the general migration motive-that they made the move for family reasons, a better environment for their kids or they are sick of the cold winter.</PARA></TALK.START>

Because of the alternatives that can be offered, once fully trained, retention is difficult.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters may have noticed that I was not here for the very start of the Defence section because I thought discussion on Foreign Affairs and Trade may have run for half an hour to 40 minutes. I was in the process of clearing all the answers. I have got to the stage where I have them with me. There are only five questions unanswered. I would agree that on this occasion there was insufficient time to get some of the questions on notice answered. My Department endeavoured with a great deal of energy to get them answered. One of the difficulties the Department faces is that the answers must be cleared through the Minister. I admit that I have been in Cabinet for virtually all the day and could not clear them in time. Maybe I anticipated that we would not be debating this tonight. I congratulate the chamber on getting this far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all departments will be very conscious at the next Estimates committee meetings of endeavouring to get questions answered before this Committee of the Whole meets. Time constraints on this occasion were a well-known disadvantage. I made no secret of the difficulty of the Estimates committee timetable this time. I said it was very difficult.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly accept the great bulk of what the Minister said. But I raise a point that should be made. The lack of time to examine the Forward Estimates themselves before the Estimates committees met has rarely been equalled and this cannot be justified by the existence of an election or anything else. The figures were presented to us two months after an election.

I cannot see why all the figures have to come out on one day. We got everything in one heap. Surely, the material could have been presented to honourable senators as it became available. That simply did not happen. I, frankly, cannot believe that every department's estimates were not ready until the Thursday before we met which, as I recall, was when we got them.

I was personally frustrated about the very short interval between the Senate Estimates committee hearings and the Committee of the Whole when there was not time for the reports to be properly considered and presented to the Committee of the Whole. As all honourable senators will remember, we had trouble on that issue this morning. Therefore, I can understand the frustration of some honourable senators about that. Nevertheless, I think I should draw attention to what this debate now is supposed to be about and what its limitations are. The order states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That, where proposed expenditure contained in an appropriation bill has been considered and reported on by Estimates Committees, debate on that bill in the committee of the whole shall be confined to matters in respect of which reports of Estimates Committees, or reservations attached to reports, have made recommendations that the matters be further examined by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just get this clarified, as it is vitally important for future consideration? I know that there seems to be some tremendous pressure to get through all these reports tonight, if possible. It is a remarkable attitude, but it seems to be pervading the chamber. I protest against that attitude, if that is the case. Perhaps the Minister for Defence is more relaxed than most, but there is an atmosphere around here of urging everybody to get on and get these things through tonight or as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of the new procedure we have a provision whereby these Estimates committee reports may recommend the adoption of the estimates, as I understand it. I do not quite understand why that is so important, frankly, but anyway it is there. It is put forward as a major new development under these procedures. It does seem to me that, if we are going to have a motion for the adoption by the chamber of the estimates, that must be a subject which can be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to get this clear. Mr Chairman, are you ruling that the motion to adopt the report cannot in itself be debated and that the only debate that can take place is in relation to matters that are actually referred to in the committee report or raised by reservation?</PARA>

<PARA> When it was suggested that, in order to comply with the order of the Senate, a reservation should be entered saying `Senator Puplick recommends that the Senate further consider the matter on which the Committee has expressed a view', we were advised that it was not necessary to put a separate reservation because the issue concerned was one which was specifically taken out and identified as an issue of concern and an expression of the view of the Committee, but a recommendation did not flow from that. </PARA>

It is not worth wasting time on the reason for the discrepancy. I will offer the Department of Social Security to anyone later on in case anyone was caught by surprise by its early passage. The first matter is the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Committee drew attention to two matters. The first was the failure to present performance information relating to objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage it would help me if the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) could summarise for me the answer to the relevant question that the officers can provide for him. The question I asked concerned a representation I had had from an orthapaedic surgeon who had advised me of an elderly patient requiring a knee replacement in a veterans' hospital. His surgeon told him that there were considerable waiting lists at the Repatriation General Hospital in Concord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question was: how long were the waiting lists? How long was this veteran likely to have to wait? The letter from the surgeon made it clear that the reason that the person had seen the doctor was continuing pain in the joint. The operation was required because of not only the underlying orthapaedic problem but also the symptom of pain. In those circumstances, any considerable waiting time is unsatisfactory and probably unsupportable. In that context we were promised some information about waiting lists. It has come through today but it would help me in advancing this argument if that information could be summarised for me. From memory, there are about 29 entitled patients on the waiting lists at Concord for those kinds of joint replacements. If that is so, could the Minister confirm it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the document. Some of the points that emerged from it are that the number of people waiting and who are entitled are about 30 for most of the surgeons. I think that figure is roughly correct. The duration of waiting for some of them, but not for all, has been since late 1987. I think that is also correct. I think that is shown on the same document. The important matter that is not provided and which we may not have asked for-so the Department may not be at fault-is to know how many of those patients can be cleared each month from the waiting list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From what the orthapaedic surgeon wrote in his letter it would seem that the patient could look forward, unhappily, to a long time on that waiting list. Since the symptom which led the surgeon to recommend surgery was continuing pain, this is an inappropriate outcome. The Parliament should be aware if patients who are entitled veterans have to wait a considerable period in pain because the repatriation hospital cannot provide the facilities for them to have the necessary surgery. I need the answer interpreted to give me some indication of the length of time these veterans wait. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to deal with a matter that received passing attention yesterday, that is, the annual report to Parliament of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). As you know, Mr President, I have run a campaign for a very long time about the quality and timeliness of annual reports. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has failed this Parliament in reporting belatedly, and unnecessarily so, on an issue of major significance to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not like having to criticise an organisation for which I have a very high regard and for which Australia has a great need, but I want to say this: Unless ASIO can justify its belated reporting, I believe it should be criticised by this Parliament. Under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act of 1979, ASIO is required to provide the Minister with a report on activities of the organisation as soon as practicable after 30 June. Usually, one finds that those organisations that report late have the justification that they were having a dispute with the Auditor-General, that they could not get their sums right or that these negotiations resulted in the late presentation of their reports. ASIO is not in that situation. The Audit report was signed on 31 August last year, the Attorney-General's declaration was signed on 4 October last year and there was nothing to prevent this report coming to the Parliament last session except that the Director-General's letter covering the report was not in fact sent until 12 February this year. </PARA>
<PARA> What was happening between October 1989, when the Attorney-General's declaration was signed, and 12 February to delay this report? I believe that the Senate is entitled to an explanation from a body which, quite rightly in many instances, finds good reason for not explaining itself but which this time has an obligation to explain itself. I am getting sick and tired of governmental bodies which treat this Parliament with contempt in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise another matter of some substance, a matter that has been raised in the report and that I believe the Senate has to look at with a great deal of seriousness. A significant remark made at the end of the report was not mentioned in the press reports this morning of this annual report. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the scale and diversity of likely future demands indicate a need for significant additional funding in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that for ASIO to give us this warning is a matter of some substance. We are entitled to know why and in what areas. There is some explanation earlier on. In Chapter 2, for example, ASIO identifies far higher levels of activity by some intelligence services over the past year than was previously known in Australia. That is why I think it is important, when we are considering why ASIO should receive additional sums, to look at what ASIO's justifications are for this need to expand. ASIO says:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia continues to play host to a number of representatives of foreign intelligence services from various countries, whose activities are regarded as hostile to Australia's interests. Over the past year ASIO has discovered a higher level of representation and activity in Australia by some hostile intelligence services than had been previously known or suspected. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the threat from these services has been shown to be significant. The lowering of world tensions over the past year arising from political reforms in some countries has not reduced the level of activity of hostile intelligence services. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of great significance because we are in an environment in which the general view is that the detente between the East and West should lead to a relaxation of our guard, if you like. I think that ASIO is telling us that, despite what is happening around the world, Australia simply cannot afford to lower its guard against the threat of hostile intelligence services operating in this country. For example, ASIO points out that, while Australia faces a low level of threat involving politically motivated violence, nonetheless there has been some activity in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> A most significant development was the attempted entry to Australia of a member of one of the most dangerous currently active terrorist groups. Although already married, the member sought to gain entry through his engagement to an Australian woman he met when she was overseas. The woman is believed not to have known of the affiliation of her `fiance' and to have been an unwitting party in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . domestic groups on the extreme right have shown a clear potential to cause distress to sections of the Australian community, and perhaps threaten life. </PARA>
<PARA>In New South Wales we have had the experience of an ethnic Chinese Australian member of the New South Wales Parliament being threatened at a meeting by a group of racists in a most offensive way. ASIO notes:</PARA>
<PARA>The increased collection effort of intelligence during 1988-89 allowed ASIO to detect a greater number of identified and suspected foreign intelligence officers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I am certain that most Australians do not realise that there has been this clear increase. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The increased figure represents both the arrival of more foreign intelligence officers in Australia and ASIO's improved awareness of the roles of those already here. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to conclude with one other matter relating to ASIO and that is its important role when we have a high level of migration. Many people fail to recognise that a high level of migration, such as the one that the Government has presently set of 140,000 migrants a year, imposes a specific obligation on Australian security services to provide adequate screening to ensure that we are protected against the sorts of risks that clearly flow from such inflows. I have already mentioned the checking done to make certain that a foreign agent or a terrorist does not come into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> ASIO makes the point that it made 31 adverse assessments last year relating to non-access checking security requests. It then notes, however, that all but one of those adverse assessments against the granting or renewal of visas to enter or remain in Australia were accepted by client departments. I raise this because, as I understand it and as I understand statements made last year which, I must say, the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, did not respond effectively to, ASIO did make an adverse recommendation about Sheik Al Hilaly. If this report is so and if the suggestion in the documents that were available last year is correct, it makes it even more extraordinary that on only one occasion was an ASIO recommendation overruled and it appears to have been for what could be a political reason. That does add concern to the basis on which ASIO's recommendation was overruled. Obviously, ASIO's recommendations have been sufficiently sound to be accepted in 30 out of 31 cases, but in one case it is found not to be sufficiently sound to be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, mainly I wanted to dramatise to the Australian people that ASIO's major job is to investigate indications of activity against it by foreign intelligence services or other groups or individuals, that this risk appears to be increasing, and that we should not be lulled into any false sense of security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to touch on a matter which is sufficiently attractive for it to be on the front page of today's West Australian. The headline reads, `Racist threat in WA: ASIO'. When one reads the rather more modest print, one sees that this story is a beat up by Mr Keith Wright, a member of the House of Representatives for a seat in Queensland, who is the Chairman of the Joint Committee monitoring the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The thrust of the comments by Mr Wright is that there are well known families of South African descent or families who directly migrated from South Africa to Perth who are promoting racial hatred. He goes on to make a number of other outrageous claims which I will touch on in a few moments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This epitomises the outrageous hypocrisy and bigotry which underlines the double standards in the immigration debate. I should say at the outset that my understanding is that Mr Wright, as Chairman of this Committee, was not speaking with the authority or knowledge of the Committee. It seems to me to be typical of the Australian Labor Party's attitude. It inflames racial hatred, as this article is designed to do, and prejudices decent, honest migrants who come from one part of the world. At the same time, as we have seen in the past, every time the Liberal Party dares to raise the question of immigration it is claimed to be racist. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright claims that he has been given this information by a senior Perth church leader during, to use his expression, a recent secret meeting on the goings-on of families who have migrated from South Africa. I have to say that it very much reminds me of the poor man who spends too much time reading spy comics. I would have thought that if Mr Wright had something of substance to say he would have named the senior prominent Perth church leader and the families and would have gone to explain the nefarious activities in which they are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Having spent some considerable time in South Africa and having spent some time talking to left wing clergymen such as Archbishop Tutu, Bayers Nadir, the Reverend Allan Boesak and one or two others, because of my personal communication with them and their public statements which have inflamed the racial hatred and the violence in those townships, I have come to the conclusion, sadly as a Christian, that to be a minister of the cloth gives one no mortgage on morality, decency, peace and goodwill amongst men. That view was reinforced by my visit through Nicaragua, where I encountered the involvement of a number of members of the Catholic Church in violence in the name of communism. Also, events in the Philippines have done nothing but reinforce that view. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the comments of Mr Wright-I do not know whether he purports or pretends to be a Christian-about Christians in Western Australia, because he says that the greatest sin of these people is that they promote right wing policies of racial intolerance under the guise of Christian principles, are rather a commentary on him and not on Christians. It is interesting that Mr Wright makes much of what he sees to be the responsibility of ASIO to monitor the activities of right wing extreme groups. At the same time, I find him deafening in his silence in respect of the activities of the extreme left wing groups in this country. I wait to hear him raise his voice in objection to the violence and intimidation which have been perpetrated by a notoriously well-known left wing group against the members of the South African Embassy in Canberra. Of course, I have no doubt, as is true probably of any group from any nation or country that might migrate to Australia, that there are anti-social bigots amongst those immigrants and that South Africa has no less and no more than its share. But I find it absolutely repulsive that Mr Wright should, by his claims, tarnish and threaten the good and decent reputations of those South Africans who leave that country to come to our country for a better and more wholesome lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wright says a very curious thing in this article. I have to assume, with respect, Mr President, that he is an anti-Christian, because he says that they are promoting a role for committed Christians to speak out against the evils of communism. I would have thought that the Labor Party was a bit more sophisticated than to raise the spectre of Christians arguing against communism. Mr Wright goes on to say that Hitler picked up the support of many Christians. Unless I am quite wrong, there are-perhaps not by accident but by design-a number of Christians in the Labor Party, and I would have thought that there was nothing improper about Christians having views on a whole range of things. To suggest that there is something reprehensible about a Christian being opposed to communism barks back to the archaic days of the 1950s. It shows all the prejudices, the bigotry, the racism, all those repulsive, revolting characteristics, which I thought were flushed out of the mainstream of Australia a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot imagine that Mr Wright would get the endorsement or support of his own Party to raise the spectre of something being wrong with being a Christian, something wrong with being a South African, and something wrong with coming to this country as a person seeking to have a new hope and a new life. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, I await hearing him make some criticism of those left wing radical groups that have intimidated and terrorised and been charged because of their conduct in respect of their activities against the South African Embassy-and not only that, but in other elements of Australian society. I give no more condemnation to one group than the other, but I am not selective in my morality or my judgment. </PARA>
