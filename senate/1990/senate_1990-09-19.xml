<TITLE>Medications</TITLE>
<PARA> To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> This Petition of concerned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The basic pension is already below the poverty line and imposing any reduction to the pension or levies for medications will cause widespread suffering and sickness.</PARA>
<PARA> A charge on medications will represent a callous repudiation of the promise to establish and maintain the pension at 25% of Average Weekly Wage.</PARA>
<PARA> The rumoured abolition of the invalid pension has caused untold worry and heartbreak among the afflicted on that benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should introduce legislation to:</PARA>
<PARA> Quickly raise the pension to 30% AWE; restore medications removed from the free list and there be no charge on medicine; the invalid pension be retained; and the harassment of pensioners through `kite flying' rumours cease immediately.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.06)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the request of the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Powell) and pursuant to contingent notice I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Powell moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 71 standing in the name of Senator Spindler, relating to the distribution of wealth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is essential that we suspend Standing Orders. At the moment there is a growing disparity of wealth in Australia. We all know the social consequences of such a trend. In fact, we have a social justice policy and strategy put forward by the Government but we are not using the tools. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is a very efficient organisation but its resources are not used. We need-and it is indeed urgent-to suspend Standing Orders to consider having an inquiry into the distribution of wealth and to develop strategies that will lead to the alleviation of the detrimental social conditions which result from the current disparity of wealth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer in particular to the various taxation matters which are both a result and a cause of such disparity of wealth. We are looking at the fact that capital gains are taxed on a real basis whereas the tax on income is based on the nominal income received, that a principal residence is exempt from capital gains tax, that most life insurance policies extending for more than 10 years are exempt from income tax, and that some holding costs of assets qualify for concessional tax treatment. I refer to negative gearing. All of those matters relate to how wealth is acquired in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I express some disappointment at both the Opposition parties and the Government not wishing to know. Ignorance in this matter is not bliss. We should suspend Standing Orders so that we can discuss, investigate and initiate an inquiry into wealth distribution in Australia so that we can develop a strategy for social justice. The Government professes support and the Opposition often uses words of support but no deeds are seen because they are not interested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Spindler is not speaking to the motion that General Business notice of motion No. 71 be given priority. In fact he is canvassing other subjects. I ask that he be brought to order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: we are now under new procedures in which an honourable senator is given only five minutes to argue for the suspension of Standing Orders. This was brought in almost exclusively to allow someone five minutes to traverse a bit of ground. I think it does impinge on Standing Orders a bit. But it was done so that we would not put the President or the Deputy President in the position of having constantly to answer 20 points of order in a row about relevance. For the guidance of the Senate, I suggest that people be given a bit of scope now that they are limited to speaking for five minutes as opposed to a half hour wander that previously existed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had been listening to Senator Spindler carefully. With the knowledge that he had only five minutes to speak, I was not prepared to mention relevance, although Senator Spindler is aware of it. Senator Spindler, I call you for the rest of your time.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the indulgence of the Senate. I was developing the argument as to why we should suspend Standing Orders and why it was urgent that we do so. I believe it is incumbent upon the members of this Senate to ensure that social justice is done in this country. We should be using as a matter of urgency the measures that are available to us. We should have an inquiry that should extend over two years, that should have four or five commissioners, that should use the resources of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and that should also incorporate the work of the social policy research centre of the University of New South Wales and the work done by Dr Peter Saunders and Professor John Neville at that university. The work that is being done by the ABS and by the University of New South Wales will not be effective unless we have a goal directed inquiry. I therefore put it to the Senate that it is urgent that we suspend Standing Orders to enable that strategy to be instituted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only urgency about this matter is to dispose of it so that Senator Spindler can get a press release out saying the Senate failed to process it. That underlines the cynicism behind the `urgency' of this particular matter, which Senator Spindler himself says will take five commissioners and several years to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might inform Senator Spindler that we have this quaint procedure in the Senate of devoting a certain time of the week in most weeks to private business. The Australian Democrats always get one session at that time. I admit it is not a lot of time. But let us see how important this issue is. Let Senator Spindler list this matter as his top priority when his turn comes up in private business, and I will make sure that everything is done to facilitate its resolution in that time allocated for private business. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler had to say why it was urgent that we suspend Standing Orders today. It was purely out of political opportunism so that he could get some votes. I do not see why the Senate, in which all of us are also chasing votes, should be facilitating this matter today. </PARA>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2538" SPEAKER="Coulter Sen J.R." NAMEID="TF4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.13)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of considerable urgency. It is very convenient for the members of the Senate in their very comfortable positions and with their nice salaries to regard the matter of the growing disparity between the rich and the poor in this country as not a matter of urgency. It is indeed a matter of great urgency for those people who are suffering in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that this motion in substantially the same form was moved by colleagues of the senators sitting on the Labor benches; that was Mr Barry Jones and Mr Duncan Kerr. In their joint press release I draw Senator Robert Ray's attention to the fact that they specifically point out that the last significant survey of wealth in Australia was in the late 1960s-more than 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Spindler has pointed out, the members of this chamber evidently do not want to know. We have seen this repeatedly in other cases of simply collecting data which would indicate where this country is going and honourable senators on both the Labor side and on the Opposition benches have voted against collecting information. I draw the Senate's attention to our repeated calls for the investigation of the degree of foreign ownership, which bears very much on this question of wealth distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I point out that the Labor colleagues of the honourable senators who sit on my left-it is rather unusual that they are sitting on my left at the moment-in their press release pointed out that the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population hold 55.2 per cent of the wealth of the country, and the degree of disparity is growing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is indeed a matter of considerable urgency, a matter to which the Senate should be bending its mind now. We should not be endlessly putting off consideration of this very important matter. It lies at the very heart of a fair, just and equitable society-a society which to some extent Australia possessed in years past. That is a society and a model from which we are progressively moving under a so-called Labor government-I stress, a so-called Labor government-which is moving away from the policies on which it was elected, the policies for which the Australian people voted at the last election. We are seeing this in relation to privatisation, the opening up of more uranium mines and a whole lot of other issues on which the Government is not observing the very policies for which it was elected. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that one of the most fundamental planks upon which the Australian Labor Party was elected was the plank of equity. This motion goes to the heart of that matter. We are becoming a less equitable society and it is indeed a matter of urgency that we debate this matter now and collect the data on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will oppose the move by Senator Spindler this morning to suspend Standing Orders to bring on his notice of motion ahead of every other item of business that this Senate has to deal with today in accordance with its ordinary procedures. It is a complete rort, as Senator Robert Ray has quite clearly stated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill has told Senator Spindler that the Opposition will give prompt consideration to his notice of motion with a view to processing it in the ordinary way. What Senator Spindler is calling on to have done will take an enormous amount of time and probably resources. Clearly, all those matters will have to be considered by the Government in particular, but they are also matters of concern to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter can be dealt with in an orderly way as we deal with the great run of matters before us. To suggest that this matter, having been raised for the first time yesterday, has to be dealt with today is quite absurd, and the Opposition will not give any support to that proposal by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill that was presented to us, which we agreed to, is designed to deregulate the airline industry and give an opportunity for more airlines to participate in the commercial airline structure in Australia. I am wondering whether the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) could tell us which airports of the major cities-the six capitals, the national capital and Darwin-have space available in the existing terminals for lease to any new airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Reid's important question, the matter of access to gate facilities is essential if deregulation is to succeed. The question of access to gates is not a problem. I have said many times in this debate that comparisons of Australian deregulation with deregulation that has occurred in countries overseas are fraught with danger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to ensure that when we are talking about deregulation and the effects of it, we relate it strictly to the realities of the Australian aviation market. For that reason I predicted, prior to the announcement on priorities on gate access, that there was not going to be an avalanche of new contenders rushing to the barricades to start new airlines, as there was in the United States, the reason being, as I have said before, that in terms of the realities of our aviation market, we are a tiny player internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a country the size of the United States, with a transport task the size of that of the United States and with a population the size of the city of Los Angeles. One American airline has 10 times the number of jet aircraft that our total combined jet aircraft operations have. So the costs of getting into the aviation industry and the overheads are enormous. They place real restrictions on the availability of slots in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> I was attacked by some of the players in that game when I was simply telling the truth. The reality in fact is precisely that. Only one airline-that is, Compass-has indicated that it is in a position in the short term, and I am talking about the next 12 months, to effectively begin airline operations in a deregulated market. It is in fact in a very firm position to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to take this opportunity to advise the Senate that I had a meeting with Mr Grey last week, simply to be brought up to date on where his airline is at. He is well advanced, with staff fully employed, with aircraft in hand. He is in the last stages, in fact, of negotiating the gate access, to which Senator Reid has just referred, with Australian Airlines Ltd and is in a position to begin his operations on schedule later this year. But he is the only operator to be in a position to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the gate access Federal Airports Corporation is providing already at Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide and Launceston-and I have given this information to the Senate previously-it has given an absolute guarantee that if that is not sufficient, and I can tell the Senate at this point in time that it is more than sufficient, it will immediately move to provide whatever additional gate access is required to ensure that whatever viable operators are in a position to start, the one barrier that will not prevent them from doing so is access to terminal facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taking Sydney, for example, the Minister says a new operator can negotiate with Australian Airlines Ltd.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two gates have been freed up at the airport and can be negotiated. As I said, I have given a detailed explanation of this to the Senate before. I am happy to provide Senator Reid-I will organise it right now-with a printed copy of the priorities that I advised the Senate of, the number of gates at each airport and the airlines from 1 to 7 that were given priorities to those gates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just say again, gate access is not a problem. There is only one operator currently negotiating for gates. Interestingly enough, the only complaint that I have received as Minister is not from an entrant wanting to get into the gates but a bit of a grizzle from one of the airlines that the only entrant about to start operating in a deregulated market is talking to one operator rather than the other. So there is simply no problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Reid has information that a prospective entrant is in a position to begin airline operations-and that, of course, is the condition the Government has placed on this-it has to demonstrate that it can provide a service. If more gates are to be freed up, I would be very anxious to hear from Senator Reid, but the reality is that Compass Airlines at the moment is it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) thinks I am pursuing something that I am not. I just want to know the facts. We have two entrances at Canberra Airport. As I understand it, they are both currently leased to airlines which are operating. Why are there not arrangements in place? Why cannot another airline have access arrangements through a lease similar to those which exist? Why do other airlines have to go crawling to an existing airline to get access to an airport? They are extremely disadvantaged in doing so by the Government's action in trying to thwart deregulation by getting rid of the airports as fast as it could before this legislation was brought into existence. It seems to me that prospective entrants considering coming in would know that they have a battle on their hands to get access to the terminals. I am not suggesting that there are any other players around; in fact, it is not surprising that there are not when one looks at how difficult it is to get access in Sydney, which is the main gateway to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Canberra Airport is very small and perhaps of little concern to the Government. There are just two entrances and, as I understand it, both are currently leased to existing airlines which have no interest whatever in being generous to any competitor coming in. What arrangements is the Government making to ensure that it is in a position to lease space to a competitor and not merely tell a competitor that he can go off and see how well he can do with either Ansett Airlines of Australia or Australian Airlines, both of whom may have an interest in making life as difficult as possible for any competitor? The same thing applies to landing rights at Sydney. Will they be carved up easily so that people can have a fair share?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will proceed across the non-stop interjections of the aviation expert on the front bench opposite. She demonstrated her total lack of expertise on a committee I served on in the not too distant past. The fact is that there is no barrier to a new entrant being provided at the moment with gate access. The airlines are required to negotiate on a bona fide basis with new entrants. They cannot negotiate extortionate demands, they are only able to negotiate on a bona fide basis. At the end of the day if they cannot achieve that arrangement, then the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is in a position to intrude at that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the nonsense that Senator Reid is asserting in the chamber today about this being a barrier, I am able to negotiate and to speak with the actual entrants who are in a position to be negotiating with these airlines. They are not having extortionate demands placed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to Canberra Airport, I say to Senator Reid quite precisely that I have the details with me. I am happy to table this information in the Senate again. It has been tabled once before and Senator Reid can refer to it simply by going to the Table Office. If she wants this debate held up again with that sort of detail, having gone over it already in the chamber, I am happy to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> To get to the very point of Senator Reid's question, I repeat: nobody is being faced with extortionate demands from the existing airlines. These valuable assets have to be negotiated in a bona fide commercial manner. As I have said before, the cost of getting--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which you gave them undisputed right to with your lease.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a load of nonsense. That indicates again the extent of ignorance on the Opposition benches. Is Senator Newman seriously saying to me that gate access at the busiest international and national terminal in Australia should be traded off at a bargain basement price by anybody, or that it would be by the FAC? The FAC is in a position to make those airports pay. That is its charter. If it had the total right-not Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines-it would be negotiating with new entrants on the same commercial basis as Ansett and Australian are currently doing. No extortionate demands are being made. I might say that that view is from the company which is currently in a position of carrying out the only negotiations in process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather than talking about the hypothetical nonsense that Senator Reid has been talking about, let me state the facts. The gate access that is being negotiated at the moment is being successfully concluded. If it cannot be, at the end of the day the FAC will intrude and ensure that it is. That provision already exists. If any operator wants to operate out of Canberra-I can tell Senator Reid that so far none have been forthcoming-the FAC has given an absolute commitment that gate access will be provided either from the existing lessees or from the construction of brand new facilities by the FAC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister precisely how a new entrant will have the opportunity to have adequate space at Launceston Airport, for example. I am not talking about a dunny or a caravan in the car park; I am talking about facilities in the terminal. Not only has it just been leased by the Government on the eve of the Federal Airports Corporation coming into being, in a very shonky and shady manner in my view, but also only in the last few weeks the terminal has been so subdivided by security facilities that I cannot see how a new entrant can come into the existing terminal. That being the case, how long would a new entrant have to wait before adequate facilities were provided? In the meantime, is it expected to camp in the car park as did a previous one which went broke?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply say again in this tired old debate, based on hypothesism and not fact, that if either of the honourable senators contributing to this debate-and I am anxious to communicate with them-know of any operator who is currently in a position of difficulty in getting either actual facilities or prospective facilities, they should let me hear of it, because no-one has been to see me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the Tasmanian port of Launceston, Transcontinental, as well as three existing commuter operators, applied for the facilities. Under the terms of the leases, Promair was the only commuter carrier allocated a highest priority category by the Secretary as it was the only commuter to propose the introduction of new interstate air services after October 1990 which was the condition placed on this by the Government. The remaining commuter carriers were Airlines of Tasmania Pty Ltd and Aus-Air. I allocated the highest priority to Transcontinental having regard to that company's proposal for significantly greater additional air services for Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to avoid further wasting the time of the Committee with this-my irritation has nothing to do with the questions; it has to do with the fact that all of this information has been given to the chamber before and is accessible to the people so dreadfully concerned by the simple act of having to do a bit of work and telephone the Table Office-I retable the information I have already provided to the chamber which gives the allocation of gates the priority accorded at each airport. </PARA>

<PARA> I am concerned about Airlines of Tasmania, and I understand that there has been some ministerial involvement as to what facilities it may have access to. I asked the Minister a specific question about the new security facilities at Launceston Airport, which, as far as I can see, will make it extremely difficult physically for a new operator such as Airlines of Tasmania to use the existing facility. What is to happen to them in the meantime? That very specific question was not answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout the airline pilots dispute, Airlines of Tasmania, a little commuter airline, was one of the few operators that managed to keep Tasmanians being able to get across Bass Strait, apart from the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. That little airline has met with great difficulty both in the bureaucratic requirements-and obviously, also the ministerial criteria-and through commercial pressure that has been put on it by other airlines. Now we have this additional problem put there by the Federal Airports Corporation's glass security box, which has used almost the entire space inside the airport. The hire-car operators who had subleases there, or whatever, have all had to be moved, and there is now no longer floor space to put a new operator in. In addition, Airlines of Tasmania is flying into Essendon, in Melbourne. It does not have access into Tullamarine. It is in many respects a disadvantaged little airline which will go the way of previous commuter airlines from Tasmania if it is not given a fairer deal. It is being squeezed before it has had a chance to really take advantage of deregulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is helping the established airlines by not opening up the facilities and by preventing these new developments, making it more and more difficult for this airline to operate. No matter what the Minister has said here-he seems to be trying to give a guarantee that he will see they are not disadvantaged; I do not know whether he called it a guarantee-it has been disadvantaged over the last few months, and the new facilities that are being built right now will disadvantage it even more unless special action is taken urgently. </PARA>

To the best of my knowledge, Senator Newman, the senator who is making such a fuss about it this morning, did not bother attending the Committee meetings to put any of these points. I see no reason why these issues should be canvassed again in here, because once again, and I regret this, it is simply an indication of the fact that despite the bona fides of the Government in agreeing to participate willingly in this process-and I was a member of the Committee that drafted these new procedures-so far as a time-saving exercise is concerned, it appears to have been a complete failure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the attitude of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) to this whole thing quite intriguing. The Minister knows full well that this Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990 has not been to a committee. That has been explained in the Senate previously. The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure was due to sit and deliberate on this Bill--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that. The Committee was due to deliberate on this Bill by order of the Senate on 12 September. Certain members of the Committee decided to deal with it at 11 o'clock on 4 September, which was at a time when none of the Opposition members were able to attend. I have already put down in the Senate what happened about that and why they were not able to be there. Senator Kernot, for example, was at a funeral. I had commitments in my electorate. Senator Macdonald was in far north Queensland with commitments that he could not just abandon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the first report of this Committee came into the Senate, this difficulty was raised and the matter was then referred back to the Committee. However, for the Government's convenience, we agreed that the report come in and that the Senate deem it to have been dealt with by the Committee. I am happy to abide by the fact that it was deemed to have been dealt with by the Committee but has not been dealt with by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate, at this committee stage, to ask questions that arise from this Bill which I did not expect would take more than three or four minutes. I thought that the Minister would give an answer to the question I raised. I am not talking about any other airline which has been so foolish as not to come to see the Minister already or anything of that kind. I merely wanted to know for the future-perhaps the far distant future-what the arrangement would be. The Minister could have given that quite simple answer right off, instead of going on in the way he has, accusing me of thinking I know something that the Minister does not and making a whole range of other accusations. This is the appropriate time to ask these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that we do not oppose the Bill. Of course we do not oppose it-we support the deregulation which the Government has incorporated-but we are entitled, at the Committee stage, to ask some of the questions that arise. I was on the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure at the time the Bill should have been dealt with by the Committee in that process. But I was deprived of the opportunity of being at the meeting and of being able to ask these quite simple questions as to what will happen well down the track when we have three or four airlines and others want to come in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is the one who is behaving in such a way as to cause this debate to drag on this morning. The Minister can laugh and carry on as much as he likes, but I assert that I am entitled to ask questions and to ask what will happen in future. I know what the Minister has tabled in the past. I want to know for the future what arrangements will be made and why the Government disposed of the airlines in the way it did. It is incorrect to suggest that I am not entitled to ask these questions. It is not correct to suggest that I have had a previous opportunity to ask about this matter. If the Minister gets up and quotes the report again, I shall get up and again explain why I did not have the opportunity to speak. We have allowed that report to come in, deemed to be a report of the Committee, because we are facilitating the Government in getting on with its business. If we had insisted that the Bill go to the Committee in the proper form, it would not have been able to come back in time for the Minister's arrangements to come into place on 1 November. The Minister knows that perfectly well. He is just being rude and uncouth. </PARA>

What is occurring this morning in the debate in committee on the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill and what I am told will occur on the next Bill, which is the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill, is a clear indication that the Opposition does not want the new system to work. There is no way that the new system will work if Ministers such as Senator Collins go along to a committee, make themselves available and have the Bill approved.

Either way it does not matter to me. But I am not going to go through procedures twice -and I do not think too many Government Ministers will want to do so-when we have a new procedure that is designed to ensure it is only done once. Opposition members cannot have it both ways. Either they take these points in committee or in the Committee of the Whole. There is no way that I shall go through every procedure twice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Procedure Committee which put these new proposals to the Senate. I totally support what they are designed to do; that is, to cut down the time of the Senate on these matters and to get on with the business. I support that, as does the Opposition. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) did not attend this Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. In spite of Senator Faulkner's interjections, which of course were most disorderly, that we had the opportunity, that is not the case, and the Minister was not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intended that this matter this morning would take no more than five minutes to clear up something that should have been done in the Committee and was not. I resent the Minister's suggestions and he is not entitled to draw the conclusions he has drawn on this Bill. The Minister should have had the sense to realise that I only wanted a question answered. I told the Deputy Whip that it was a short matter and that I would not be long. It is not my fault that this matter has dragged out. It is because of the way in which the Minister has behaved on a matter when he was not on the Committee. We do support the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I was not at the Committee-I say this for the third time-is that the meeting did not take place at the scheduled time. It was brought on by the Chairman at 11 o'clock on 4 September. I wrote to the Chairman when I heard that it was on-I was not even told that it was on 4 September at 11 a.m.-and that letter has been incorporated in Hansard. I am astonished that the Minister has not read it. I made it clear that other Opposition members and I were not able to attend. I said that if the meeting were to go ahead at that time I would not regard it as a meeting properly held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the matter came up the first time, the Senate agreed with me that the meeting was not properly held and it was referred back to the Committee. The Committee has not looked at the matter again. For the convenience of the Government-again I say this for the third time-we agreed that the report be tabled and be deemed to have been dealt with. Therefore, I took the opportunity this morning to ask what I thought was a short question to which I expected a civilised answer, which I thought proper. Senator Richardson is not entitled to draw any conclusions about our regard for the status of the committees as a consequence of that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. As Senator Reid knows full well, that was in the face of considerable opposition from members on my side of the House as well as from Opposition members. I put this point with absolute sincerity. Senator Reid knows that we are all busy people, and Ministers are particularly busy. A lot of paper flows across our desks. I am as assiduous as anyone else in doing my homework on Bills that come into the House but I say, with the greatest respect, that the only thing I have to go by in terms of the Committee's deliberations is the printed report of the Committee, which indeed I read before this debate started. None of the information put in by Senator Reid this morning about important detail as to the status of this Bill in the Committee's meetings is contained in this report, and perhaps it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make two final statements and re-answer Senator Reid's original question, which I have answered to death. I was involved in the deliberations of this Committee in that my office was contacted. That issue is canvassed at paragraph 3.2 of the Committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Committee received the Bill it contacted the office of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support-</PARA>
<PARA>that is correct-</PARA>
<PARA>to ascertain if any amendments were proposed by the Government and if the Minister or any of the authorities in his portfolio or other interested parties had additional information or were aware of any new developments related to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>This is exactly how the new committee system is supposed to work-to save time. That also is correct. The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Transport and Communications, the office of the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Aviation, the counterpart office in the Senate and the office of the Australian Democrats' Spokesperson for Transport and Communications were also consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is done to save the time not only of the Senate but also of the Committee. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Advice received indicated that there were no new developments and no amendments to the Bill were foreshadowed. No amendments to the Bill had been lodged with the Procedure Office by Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, at paragraph 3.3, the Committee decided to consider the Bill at a private meeting on 4 September 1990. If I had had any indication that any of these matters or that any new developments were going to be raised in connection with this legislation, of course I would have attended. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the honourable senator and the Chairman that on future occasions I will assiduously attend every single meeting of these committees at which any legislation of mine is considered, even if I am formally advised, as I was, that nobody-I asked the question-in the Opposition, no-one in the Australian Democrats, no-one anywhere, wanted to propose amendments or make any changes. But in future, I will be there for every single one of them for as long as this new procedure continues to last. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, can I say, for the eleventh or twelfth time, in answer to Senator Reid's original question, that there are no barriers whatever currently being provided in terms of new entrants into the Australian deregulated aviation market needing access to gates. I and the Federal Airports Corporation have given public assurances that if there are, whether in Tasmania or anywhere else, we will facilitate that entry. I make the offer again here today to honourable senators from Tasmania or anywhere: if any new entrant--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that this debate has developed as it has. Both sides of the chamber acknowledge that we are dealing with a new procedure, which all of us have tried to approach with goodwill. This piece of legislation was the first cab off the rank for a variety of reasons. It was not given the sort of attention in the new committee stage which most of us would have expected it to receive. That is unfortunate. We all regret that. I understand that the procedures for the legislation which will be dealt with at subsequent committees are now much more satisfactory. Nevertheless, we are left with the mess or the wash up of the problems of this first piece of legislation to go to the new committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of that, it is perhaps unreasonable-we certainly see it as unreasonable-for the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), although he was told that there were no amendments and that the Opposition supported the legislation, to expect that, because there was no discussion, for a variety of reasons explained in this debate, there would be no opportunity in the committee stage for, not amendments to be proposed, but questions to be asked of the Government. In that circumstance, we believe it is perfectly reasonable and proper, and not something for the Minister to be so agitated about, for us now to ask questions relating to the piece of legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid and I have been asking questions relating to airports affecting our constituents. We believe we have been acting perfectly properly. If the Minister had not been so truculent in his response, if his blood pressure had not risen so fast, he would have seen that we wanted specific answers and details about the ways that these people will be protected in the future. We would then have finished. </PARA>
<PARA> We are supporting this piece of legislation, and that is the end of it. We regret the hard words of the Minister which cloud what is an important new procedure in this Parliament. We believe that it should be made to work. Unfortunately, as I said, this was the first piece of legislation to go through this system. It cannot be examined in the absence of the other parties in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be very glad if the Minister were to attend, even if he found that there were no questions. He should at least attend those committee meetings. That is the purpose: for the Government to be questioned and for any possible amendments that may arise therefrom to be proposed. I hope that we do not see a recurrence of this on future legislation. I hope that this has been an opportunity to resolve the difficulties that have been faced in the teething stages of the new procedure. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 17, page 8, lines 26 to 29, leave out subclause 4. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 30, page 13, lines 36 to 39, leave out subclause 2. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of these amendments is to withdraw the two clauses in the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill which apply age discrimination. Subclause 17 (4) provides that a person who has attained the age of 65 years shall not be appointed as a member of the council of the Australian Maritime Museum nor will a person be appointed for a term which takes him beyond the age of 65 years as a member of that council. Subclause 30 (2) provides that, in similar circumstances, a person may not be appointed a director of the Australian National Maritime Museum. In other words, a person who has attained the age of 65 years cannot be appointed director nor can a person be appointed as director for a term which will extend beyond his reaching the age of 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Both of these clauses are a blatant example of age discrimination. The Opposition is most strongly opposed to this form of discrimination. Our amendments simply remove both of those subclauses and therefore remove the age discrimination aspects contained in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate agrees to our amendments, this Bill will be brought into line with the Public Service Act. The Public Service Act, as amended, now allows public servants to stay on in their jobs beyond the age of 65 years. In particular, division 8a of the Public Service Act provides for secretaries to departments to remain beyond the age of 65 years at the discretion of the relevant authority. Of course, the Secretary to a department can be equated to the position of director to this museum. There is now a specific provision in the Public Service Act which allows secretaries to departments to remain in their positions beyond the age of 65 years. Quite clearly, the same provision should apply to the director of this museum. </PARA>
<PARA> Division 8b of the Public Service Act allows a similar discretion for senior executive officers of the Public Service to remain in the office beyond the age of 65 years. Division 8c provides the same opportunity for other officers of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 33 of the Public Service Act, which relates to the application of the merit principle, provides that there should be no discrimination in the Public Service on the grounds of age. Furthermore, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regulations provide that it is an offence to discriminate on the grounds of age and that such offences may be heard by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that this legislation provides in clause 40 that the provisions of the Public Service Act will apply to the staff of the Museum. On the one hand we see in this legislation a provision that the staff of the Museum may remain in their jobs working beyond the age of 65 years; yet under the same legislation, unless our amendments are accepted, the Director and members of the Council, whose purpose it is to advise the Director and to advise the Government generally on the operation of this Museum, will not be able to remain in those positions beyond the age of 65 years-a complete absurdity with regard to the way in which this legislation has been drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Council, the very people whom we may want to appoint, because of the experience and expertise they have, may well be over the age of 65, as was mentioned in the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts discussion on this legislation. For instance, retired sea captains or people of that ilk, who have specific experience that would be relevant to the operation of the Australian National Maritime Museum, would be people of great quality on a council of this type and yet they will be precluded unless this legislation is amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, Senator Richardson, indicated in the Standing Committee hearing that the Government would not accept our amendments because it wanted to review the issue of age discrimination in toto. In fact, the Government wanted to review all of the Acts of this Parliament that apply age discrimination and subsequently introduce a blanket amendment that may remove that age discrimination. We really could not get any definite commitment from the Minister that this was to happen. He seemed to have some view that public opinion needed to be obtained before the Government would be prepared to move forward and remove age discrimination from Government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the public is only too well aware of the negative aspects of age discrimination and is only too convinced of the need to remove age discrimination as it is of the need to remove all other forms of discrimination in our society. The public does not need this Government to go out and try to market a policy to remove age discrimination before it can proceed. That opposition to age discrimination in this day and age is well established in the community and there is absolutely no need for the Government to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also no need for the Government to leave this absurdity in this legislation on the basis that it wants to amend all legislation to remove age discrimination at some future indeterminate date. When we have legislation before us that is faulty, we should fix it up when it is here and not allow it to be passed in this chamber in a form which even the Government admits is faulty. We should fix up the legislation here and now when we have the opportunity. If the Government wishes to take other measures in the future on a global basis, let it do that. But let us fix up this legislation while we have the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Standing Committee's consideration of the Bill, the Minister made a number of contradictory remarks. He indicated at the outset that the Government would be speedily moving to amend all legislation that had age discrimination inherent in it, but later he could not give any guarantee that the Government was to move forward at all on this issue and certainly could not give us any guarantee that it would happen speedily. He indicated that the issue had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department and was the subject of an inquiry and he expected to have a report on that shortly. However, later in his remarks the Minister indicated, in answer to a question from Senator Bourne, that because one of the concerns of the Government was that Comcare legislation as currently drafted did not provide cover for people beyond the age of 65, legislation to change the Comcare arrangements would be one of the first issues addressed-one of the first pieces of amending legislation brought into this chamber to remove age discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee hearings of the Department of Industrial Relations last week, I questioned Comcare about this issue. In response its representatives indicated they were aware that some inquiry was going on with regard to age discrimination in the Attorney-General's Department but they had not been asked to give any consideration to changing Comcare legislation. They had not given any detailed consideration to the issue of providing Comcare cover beyond the age of 65. They had not been asked to draft any legislation with regard to age discrimination. Nothing is happening within Comcare to get rid of age discrimination and to solve the alleged problems with regard to Comcare and age discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's indication that we will be able to solve this problem relatively quickly and that Comcare legislation will be the first dealt with in this area is simply contradicted by the evidence given at that Estimates Committee. We will be waiting for an indeterminate and lengthy time before anything is done about age discrimination. The Australian Democrats should recognise that. We are still not guaranteed that anything will happen, but if it does it will be some distant time down the track before we get a satisfactory resolution to this problem. From the Opposition's point of view that is completely unsatisfactory and unacceptable. This legislation before us now, which incorporates age discrimination, should be fixed up now while we have the chance to do so and we should not wait for some indeterminate action of the Government down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of Comcare is not really an issue because already the Public Service Act provides that people can remain in the employ of the Public Service beyond the age of 65 and, therefore, they are already not covered by Comcare. Public servants would represent a significantly large group. In this legislation we are only dealing with a few people: the Council and the Director of the Museum. To add them to the people for whom other arrangements would have to be made for compensation is a minimal requirement on this Government and is not an excuse for rejecting our amendments and further delaying the reform of age discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks I conclude. I hope that the Democrats will see fit to support us on this occasion, contrary to the view they adopted in the Standing Committee. For that reason we have brought back this issue for debate in the Committee of the Whole. It was clear from looking at the Minister's remarks that they were contradictory. His comments with regard to Comcare were not accurate and, therefore, the Opposition's amendment ought to be supported in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find Senator Chapman's debate to be a pathetic justification for doing exactly what I said in the Senate about a quarter of an hour ago: wanting to run a debate through the Committee and then wanting to run the same debate through the Committee of the Whole. That may be the Opposition's decision about how it wanted to play the new arrangement; it certainly is not a way that we will play the arrangement. I have no intention whatsoever of first going to the Committee and running through this debate and then coming in here and running the exact same debate again. That is not what was intended by the new arrangement. Everyone in the chamber knows that. But the Opposition has made a deliberate decision to frustrate the new system. Well, it will not be frustrating it with us, because I will only debate these matters once.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of what happened at the Committee, I explained at the Committee that the Government wanted to have a proper approach, that is, a comprehensive one. The Attorney-General is conducting a review of how age discrimination works in the Public Service. Looking at the boards in this one portfolio of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Australian Institute of Sport has a 65 year age limit; the Tourist Commission has a 65 year age limit; the Heritage Commission has no age provision for retirement; the Film, Television and Radio School has a 70 year age limit; the Film Commission has a 65 year age limit; the Australia Council has a 65 year age limit; but the Australian National Library, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum have no age provisions at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Those facts point to the need to have one comprehensive look at this matter. We might wait five years for a chance to change the legislation relating to one of those organisations. That is ridiculous. We ought to be looking at them all at once-comprehensively, at once. Comcare is a problem. No matter where people rely on ex gratia payments, we have a problem. As a matter of public policy, reliance on ex gratia payments under Comcare is a joke. We cannot do that. We must have a proper way of dealing with it. That can only come if we review how age discrimination works across the whole of the Public Service and if we review the massive implications the changes will have for superannuation and insurance. That is not even being pretended to be done here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not want just to jump at each one of these things. It is a pathetic way of proceeding. It certainly does not help people in that age bracket. We want to do it properly. The main point I want to make today is that, if the Opposition seeks to frustrate the system, the system will not work. The Opposition has started that; we will finish it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has made reference to what he purports to be the Opposition's attitude to the operation of the new committee system. The fact is that we want that system to work. One of the purposes of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts is to look at issues such as the one that is being considered today and which was considered by that Committee- amendments which are basically of a technical nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not an issue that ought to cause a division on a political basis. The amendments are in effect technical ones-two amendments that we put forward in good faith because we believed that they would improve the legislation in a technical fashion. We therefore expected the Government to accept our amendments. We were most surprised when the Minister decided to reject them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has again raised the issue of Comcare. I simply want to know on the basis of his comments what is being done to provide Comcare cover for all of those public servants who are already eligible to stay in positions beyond the age of 65. If, as the Minister suggests, removing age discrimination from this legislation is such a great problem for Comcare, it is an even bigger problem for all of those public servants who already have the opportunity to remain in their positions beyond the age of 65. That simply is not an argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument that the Minister has put forward, that the Government wishes to deal with this issue in totality, simply does not stand up. That is no excuse for passing the defective legislation which is before us now. Certainly, it is appropriate to look at all of the other areas in which age discrimination operates, draw them all together and solve that problem at one time. It may be, as the Minister said, five years before a particular item of legislation which incorporates age discrimination with regard to one department or one instrumentality comes before us, and that is a reason for dealing with all of those instrumentalities at once, but it is not a reason for not dealing with an instrumentality the legislation for which is before us now. We ought to fix up defective legislation when we have it before us. Other defective legislation can be dealt with on a total basis. I simply reinforce the Opposition's support for our amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with a few issues. Senator Richardson is quite right; these matters were dealt with by the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. But it is important for people to understand that the Committee does not reflect the balance of the votes in the Senate. If the Government is opposed to an amendment, on this particular Committee with its four votes against the Opposition's three votes and the Australian Democrats' one vote, plus its casting vote, it can dispose of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that the Government does not get away with the idea that the Opposition is trying to frustrate the new procedures. The ability of any senator to bring back an amendment and discuss it in the Committee of the Whole is quite important; otherwise the Government can just roll these things through the committee system with its sheer force of numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important issues relating to this matter, and Senator Richardson in the Committee agreed with the principle of opposing age discrimination. So we had an agreement in principle that what the Opposition was doing was right. His only argument was that the Government wanted to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into age discrimination and that he would rather deal with age discrimination in government bodies as a whole. He was not sure whether this could be done by proceeding Bill by Bill, Act by Act or body by body, or whether there could be just one Act to deal with age discrimination across the board. None of us know that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the name of consistency-and that was the Minister's only argument-he wanted to make sure that age discrimination applied to the Australian National Maritime Museum. His logical position was that we have a bad principle but that, in the name of consistency, we should apply that principle to yet another quasi-autonomous national government body. To my way of thinking it is a bit like the principle that applied to the gold tax-`The gold tax is a bad idea and it will be bad for the industry, but because everything else is taxed we might as well tax gold as well'. </PARA>
<PARA> Another parallel that we could draw is the building of motor cars. One could find out halfway through the run of building a Ford Capri that one had been putting the wheels on back to front. Using Senator Richardson's logic, we would not say, `Hang on. Stop the run. Let us start putting the wheels on the right way round; let's fix up the defect. There is a bad principle here. The cars will not go too well if the wheels are back to front'; we would say, `Let's let the run go. Let's let all the defective cars go out on the streets. We will recall them all in one hit and fix them up then'. That is the principle that the Minister is trying to have us believe we should abide by. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not abide by that principle. We believe that the Senate has a role in ensuring that good quality legislation comes out of this place, and that in the case of this legislation the outcome is correct for the museum and the people of Australia. We should not just keep applying this bad principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that, if the issue was discrimination on the basis of gender or race-if it was sex discrimination or race discrimination that was in this Bill-we would have it fixed here straight away. Some of his back bench Senate colleagues-Senator Crowley in particular-would be doing exactly what I am doing here today. Senator Crowley would say, `You are not going to discriminate in this Bill', and if the Minister said, `Don't you worry about that; we'll fix it up later', he would not get very far-and he would not get very far in his Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for all honourable senators here today, and particularly the Australian Democrats, to understand that if we allow this defect to go through we will hurt the quality of the Maritime Museum and we will hurt the people of Australia. Senator Chapman is quite right: by discriminating against people over the age of 65 we are seriously hurting the quality of the board that might be appointed to run the Australian National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman referred to retired mariners. There are other people that the Government could consider for the board, such as distinguished former America's Cup and other yachtsmen. Rolly Tasker springs to mind. He has already established his own private museum in Western Australia. There is a wide range of suitable people who are over the age of 65, but because of the Government's insistence on continuing age discrimination these people will not be allowed to sit on the board. </PARA>
<PARA> Who will be the losers? It will not be the politicians but the people over the age of 65 who could make a great contribution to this museum and therefore to their country; the museum itself, and therefore the people of Australia; and Australian tourism and the people who would visit that museum, because it is obviously not going to be the optimum museum. The Minister has said, `She'll be right. We will fix it later'. He said, `We might fix it next year'. He has now said that it may have to be fixed in five years' time. </PARA>

<PARA> One of the final points I want to make is that if we wait until next year or even until next month to fix the matter, because the Government will be making these appointments shortly and the appointments are to be for periods of up to three years, it will take at least another three years to get the optimum board. So the impact of this legislation will be quite significant for at least the next three years-the formative years of the establishment of this museum. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for the Senate not to be taken in by the Minister's promise, `She'll be right; we will fix it up in a year or two'. We have to approach this matter on the basis that we are here to ensure that the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill makes the museum the best museum possible for the money that the taxpayers will be spending on it. By discriminating against people over the age of 65 we are clearly not achieving that. To that end, I support Senator Chapman's amendments. </PARA>

In doing so, I ask myself three things. First, I ask myself this question: If we adopt Senator Chapman's amendments, will the Bill be a better Bill? The answer to that has to be yes. The second question I ask myself is this: Will the Maritime Museum be better off if we adopt Senator Chapman's amendments? The answer to that has to be yes. The third question I ask myself is this: If we do not adopt Senator Chapman's amendments, will the Bill incorporate a discrimination that we can fix now? The answer to that question has to be yes. I made the point that we were not dealing with the broader issue of age discrimination but with a Bill that was before us. In dealing with this Bill we have the opportunity, through Senator Chapman's amendments, to make it a better Bill and to remove a discrimination.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is unusual to debate the matter at this stage, but I want briefly to deal with the manner in which the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill 1989 [1990] has been handled. I commend the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for his alteration of the arrangements today, and I thank him for the courtesy to the Opposition that that involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the division, there was some conversation across the chamber indicating that what had happened in this instance sounded the death knell of the new committee system. The Opposition does not believe that, and is of the view that, with goodwill on both sides, this new committee system can work. I think Senator Newman was making that point earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to recognise, very simply, is that the committee system cannot possibly be a total substitute for the activities of this chamber. It may well be a substitute for a large amount of the committee work of the chamber. In fact, the way in which these three amendments were satisfactorily dealt with indicates that there is some merit in the new system, with a simple reporting system here. As you saw, Mr Deputy President, when the report of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts and the Minister's three amendments came in here, there was no debate beyond Senator Chapman saying that the Opposition supported them, because we, in fact, initiated them. So there clearly is a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is whether or not the Government will take the view that the procedures we have just gone through represent a destruction of the new committee system. What the Government must recognise is that the committees do not reflect the political reality of this chamber. In particular, I note that on this Committee there is one Australian Democrat. As we have seen in this chamber repeatedly there are many occasions--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Spindler" NAMEID="0X4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator Spindler</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eight.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Spindler for his interjection. There are eight Democrats here which, in many instances, means there are eight different views. That is manifested on many occasions by divisions indicating that some Democrats favour a matter and others oppose it. In fact, some Opposition amendments, fortunately, have been carried as a result of splits within the Democrats, ranks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To pretend that the committee system accurately and totally reflects the views of this chamber and that, therefore, matters `resolved' in a committee by the vote of one Democrat necessarily reflect the view of this chamber, is arrant, self-evident nonsense. This chamber must reserve the right to take a supervisory view-a final view, if you like-over the results of committee discussions, and the Minister knows that. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, what is important in this particular matter is that the Democrats, as a party, voted against getting rid of age discrimination in this Bill. They voted against the rights of people aged 65 and over to sit on this museum council. The Democrats can, and no doubt will, say ad nauseam that basically they really do believe that people over 65 have a right to sit on the council, but they will wait until the Government gets around to finding a comfortable, convenient way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard in the Committee the Minister basically saying, `Trust us, we have your best interests at heart'. That is like saying, `Trust me, I am from the Government'. For heavens sake! Considering the undertakings that this Government has continually reneged on-there will be no capital gains tax, you name it-anyone who accepted that kind of undertaking from Senator Richardson, a well-known representative of the New South Wales Right, which is renowned for its capacity to maintain its undertakings--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chapman for his recognition of that irony. Anyone who took those undertakings at their face value needs his or her head examined. The fact is that this whole dispute in the Committee, and in this chamber, revolves around one simple thing: how do you resolve a problem? The problem is whether or not people over 65 should be excluded from membership of this particular board.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his continual interjections. Yes, three bites at this cherry. We want to stress to the people of Australia that, in fact, this Government and the Democrats have voted against people aged 65 having the right to sit on a museum board where there is a specific relevance for retired people-particularly retired sea captains-having a magnificent opportunity for input in a way which would benefit the Australian people. I tell the Minister, yes, I am stressing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Minister interjected I was making the simple point that the disagreement is over the method of doing it. There is no logic or honour in the Government's position. There are many boards-and we have heard about the Australian National Gallery-on which people over 65 can survive happily; admittedly, as is the case with the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, in constant disagreement with the Government. People over 65 can survive quite happily without the disastrous risk proposed by Comcare which the Government purports, in this discussion, to be the reason it cannot possibly allow people over 65 to be on this board, because it has not worked out how to do it satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> As we heard from Senator Chapman, the Audit Act allows people over 65 to be compensated, either in lump sums or seriatim payments, for any problems that may emerge. There is no practical prohibition or inhibition on the Government resolving this problem by simply saying, `Okay, we will not have another committee with this absurd prohibition; we will not add another one to this list of those that prevent people over 65 sitting on them until we have resolved the matter overall'. The Government takes a different view. It says, `No, we will add yet another to this absurd situation' while, at the same time, ignoring those that do not have age limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say, in conclusion, that the fact that the Democrats have joined the Government to vote to keep 65-year-olds off this board is a blatant example of the Democrats going along with the Government for, I presume, some offset reason, because it is not in keeping with their own alleged principles. I want to stress that this case is a simple one. It is: `Do you trust the Government to fix it up, or don't you?' As usual, the Democrats are placing their faith in the Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In seeking to explain to the Committee that the Opposition really wanted to give meaning to the new system, Senator Baume just made a total mockery of the new system. Any senator who has been here more than five minutes knows that at this point in the debate one virtually never runs the arguments again. But here we are and we have heard the lot again. I watched Senator Michael Baume through hours and hours of an Estimates committee hearing make a mockery of its procedures. The Government cannot do much about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When an Opposition senator wants to make a mockery of an Estimates committee by basically having been too lazy to get proper briefings as a shadow Minister, using the Estimates to get those briefings, the Government cannot really do anything about it. One sits there and listens for hour upon dreary hour. One watches all those thousands and thousands of dollars of public money being wasted, as officials sit for hour after hour, waiting for the questions that may never come. But having said all of that, I cannot do a thing about it. I have to wear it. </PARA>
<PARA> But when Senator Baume is seeking to frustrate this new system, he has to understand that it requires government cooperation. We will not cooperate with a system that he makes a mockery of in the way that he just has. If he wants to make the system a farce, fine; but he should understand this, that he will do it on his own. He is not going to intimidate the Australian Democrats by getting up and performing like that. They are big enough and ugly enough to take care of themselves. All he is doing is wasting more time of the Senate. He has become the world champion of wasting the time of the Senate. But the Government is not going to play the game. From here on in he wastes it on his own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is today dealing with the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill 1990 which has previously passed through the House of Representatives. Since it passed through the other House some members of the Senate have received a letter from the Law Council of Australia, expressing some concerns that the Council now seems to have regarding technical aspects. So this seems quite an appropriate piece of legislation to be dealt with by the new procedures we have been discussing so fervently this morning. I am glad that it is proposed that the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill will be going off to a legislative and standing committee for further scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Opposition is conscious that a person's human rights and the need to balance these against the protection of the community have both been taken into account in considering this Bill. It is very, very important to all of us that the growing importation of illegal goods-drugs, narcotics and even weapons-be stemmed. All these things pose a threat to our society and that was of the utmost concern in the Opposition's consideration of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know only too well that drugs especially are an increasing problem in our society. The number of people using drugs is increasing each year and the ages of those using them are getting lower. No special group seems to be isolated from drug usage, even amongst those with whom I have a particular interest-that is, the defence personnel. They too have an increasing number of members using drugs. Once again, the difficulty of identifying them is very important, particularly if the safety of other members of a military team is going to be prejudiced by those under the influence of drugs. It is clear that it is vitally important to the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a 1985 survey, 25 per cent of the general population have used illegal drugs at some time in their life. But this had risen to 28 per cent in a similar survey conducted only three years later, in 1988. That 1988 survey showed that males in the 20 to 39 year age bracket were the strongest users of drugs; 15 per cent of that population had for a consistent period used drugs; 8 per cent of males used amphetamines, 5 per cent used heroin and cocaine, while the remaining 2 per cent were users of other drugs, including LSD. </PARA>
<PARA> In that study in 1988 it was also found that cannabis is regularly used by 10 per cent of all school students, 3 per cent of all students illicitly used sedatives, while 2 per cent used amphetamines. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly alarming are the numbers of drug-related deaths. In 1987 some 25,300 deaths in Australia were directly caused by drugs; whether it was overdoses, AIDS-related caused by using infected needles, or accidents resulting from drug usage. The National Drug Abuse Information Centre suggests that one in every three deaths in the 15 to 34 year age group is drug-related.</PARA>
<PARA> If ever there was an indictment of a society, those figures surely tell the tale. Therefore, anything that we as the legislative body in this country can do to stem the tide of drugs coming into our country should surely be done. </PARA>
<PARA> These facts and figures have been foremost in the minds of members of the Opposition when we approached this piece of legislation. Those figures have had to be in our minds in weighing up what have to be acknowledged as infringements of human rights once this Bill is passed. One has to weigh up the relative merits of two undesirable matters-on the one hand, the effect of drugs on our society and, on the other, the restriction of human rights in order to stem the flow. </PARA>
<PARA> But methods for the importation and concealment of drugs have become increasingly sophisticated. Thus it is appropriate that the Australian Customs Service improve its methods both of detection and of recovery. Drug trafficking is not selective. Drugs have been found on a 63-year-old priest, on a grandmother, and some parents have even had their babies or children carry drugs into this country. A person from Thailand was arrested carrying 93 condoms containing 700 grams of heroin internally. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Bill will give the Australian Customs Service more comprehensive powers to detain and search passengers and incoming visitors suspected of carrying illegal goods or drugs. I just draw attention to the matters that were identified in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). The Minister said that in 1988-89 the total number of persons searched was 2,505 which represented 0.06 per cent of the total arriving passenger population of 4.2 million. Of this number of searches, 102 persons were detained for internal search and in most cases those persons consented to X-ray by a medical practitioner. The Minister stated that the figures clearly show that the present power is exercised in a judicious and controlled way and it is not expected by the Government that as a result of this Bill the number of persons searched should show any marked increase. We hope that, as a result of this legislation, the human rights elements might be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for three levels of search: a frisk search, an external search and an internal search. The Opposition was very keen to ensure that each of these levels becomes more thorough and that controls placed on the Customs officers were also strengthened. Customs officers currently only have the power to conduct an internal or an external search. These searches must be ordered by a justice of the peace or the Comptroller-General of Customs. The order must be based on the reasonable suspicion of the Customs officer leading him or her to believe that the person is carrying illegal drugs. All searches conducted must be done by an officer of the same sex and, in the case of an internal search, by a medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The current system is inadequate in terms of the protection it offers both to the civil liberties and to the privacy of the traveller. The current system does not provide, for example, for a search to be carried out in private. Nor does it allow any protection for those who do not speak English. We know that the numbers of non-English travellers entering Australia are very high. Surprisingly, the current legislation does not provide the detainee with the right to a lawyer. Bearing all this in mind, it is of some concern that the Customs Office has had this legislation on the backburner for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> The new legislation enables the frisk search to be implemented. Basically this is similar to that which all senators have had experience of every time they go through security checks at airports around the world, with a quick running of the hands over the person's outer garments and anything voluntarily removed by that person. This search is restricted to officers of Customs and where that officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person is carrying illegal goods. The Opposition is pleased to note that the invasion of the detainee's privacy has been minimised by the right of the detainee to have the frisk search conducted in private if he desires. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving to the second level of search, the external search, this is slightly more intrusive than the frisk. An external search is a search of the body and anything worn by a person to determine whether the person is carrying prohibited goods. The external search can only be undertaken if ordered by a justice of the peace, the Customs Comptroller-General or an officer of supervisory rank. Suspicions of the Customs officer must be strong enough to warrant a search being required. As with the frisk search, this may be undertaken in private and must be by an officer of the same sex. </PARA>
<PARA> The third level of search, and the most intrusive, is the internal search. This level of search is the one which is most thought to invade personal privacy. The Opposition was very concerned to ensure that any invasion of personal privacy was minimised and that regulations on Australian Customs Service officers were controlled. An internal search can only be undertaken where a person is suspected of carrying illegal narcotics in a commercial or trafficable quantity. This is opposed to carrying illegal goods, which is the test applied to the previous two levels of search. </PARA>
<PARA> If the detainee does not consent to the search, it can only proceed following two periods of 48-hour detention to allow any substances being carried to be emitted naturally. Both the period of detention and the search have to be individually ordered by a magistrate or a judge. The judge must give due weight to all evidence, including new or emerging facts. </PARA>
<PARA> A detainee held for an internal search has a right to a lawyer to be present or to represent him at the hearings seeking the detention and search orders. An internal search is to be conducted by a medical practitioner at a hospital.</PARA>
<PARA> Medical practitioners are provided for in the legislation in terms of any suit which may arise as a result of the search, with the exception of negligence. If the detainee is a minor or is mentally or physically incapacitated, he has a right to protection at all three levels of search. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the shadow Minister for Customs in the other place, that the Customs Office has reached agreement with the States regarding the provision and compensation of the judiciary. I also understand that it has reached a similar agreement regarding the provision of medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which looked into the human rights aspects of the legislation, regarded the rights of the individual as adequately protected. The Committee also considered that appropriate efforts had been made to protect persons against abuses of power by Customs and police officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the legislation as we understand it to affect the rights of individuals. But as I stated when I began my speech, we have some concerns which relate to the matters that have been recently raised by the Law Council of Australia. On the whole, we believe that the invasion of privacy has been adequately balanced against giving the community sufficient protection from traffickers of illegal drugs and narcotic substances. We should be looking at this legislation in the light of a response by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to the report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which was tabled on 6 June, entitled Drugs, Crime and Society. The Attorney-General has responded to that report. In his response he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes this opportunity to reaffirm its ongoing commitment to the policy underlying the National Campaign against Drug Abuse, which is that Australia requires a balanced mix of strategies which will both reduce the demand for drugs-primarily by preventing drug use before it starts-as well as reduce their supply. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that the Bill before the Senate today will help to reduce the demand for drugs, as well as do it in a way which is fair to the individuals who may well be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the concerns of the Law Council of Australia, the Opposition has taken the trouble to put these concerns before the Customs Service and has then discussed the responses of the Customs Service with the Law Council. We understand that the matters concerned in its letter were based on the 1989 Bill to a great extent and not especially to the Bill before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not really fully aware of whether there are still outstanding matters of serious concern for the Law Council, but we are not disposed at this stage either to oppose or to amend the legislation. We believe that the new procedure of referring the Bill to the legislation Standing Committee for more detailed scrutiny will enable any remaining concerns of the Law Council to be given deeper study. On receipt of the Committee report, the Opposition will then be in a position to express a view on any proposed amendments coming from that Committee. As I said, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation; in fact, we support the aims of the Government on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it quite clear at the outset that, while the Australian Democrats will not be opposing the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill 1990, we do have some reservations about its ultimate effectiveness. As always, in this area of legislative action there is a need to balance civil liberties concerns against the protection of the community, that is, the public good. In recent years this Government has brought forward a range of measures in the crime fighting and drug control category. Broadly speaking, the Democrats have supported these measures while continuing to place proper emphasis on their efficiency and, indeed, the need to protect individual rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, this Bill repeals the current power to detain and search people suspected of unlawfully carrying prohibited goods, and inserts in its place a new division containing a more comprehensive range of Customs detention and search powers. These new provisions bring together the full range of Customs body search powers: from the least intrusive frisk, through external search, to the most intrusive internal search. Quite properly, as the powers given to Customs officers in relation to searches are strengthened, the legal requirements on those officers are made more rigorous.</PARA>
<PARA> At present, Customs officers only have the power to conduct either an external search or an internal search and these searches must be ordered by a justice of the peace or the Comptroller-General of Customs. The order must then be based on reasonable suspicion. Searches must be carried out by a person of the same sex or, in the case of an internal search, by a medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> This current regime is open to criticism on civil liberties grounds in that it does not provide for searches to be carried out in private, there is inadequate protection for minors, there is no provision for interpreter assistance for non-English speaking suspects, and the right of detainees to a lawyer needs to be strengthened. In these respects, this legislation tightens up and improves on the current situation. It is clearly preferable to have powers and obligations arising from those powers spelt out in the legislation so that both Customs officials and suspects are better protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Customs Service has had this legislation on its drawing board for some years and, to its credit and to the credit of the Government, there has been consultation with civil liberties, human rights and privacy groups, and most concerns raised have been addressed in the legislation. By and large, the relevant organisations are happy with the protection afforded to passengers subject to a search. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is true that searches necessarily involve some invasion of privacy, apart from not conducting searches at all, as much as possible has been done in this legislation, we believe, to protect a person's rights. I note in particular that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, whose brief is to examine legislation from the point of view of personal rights and liberties, considers that the rights of individuals are adequately protected under this Bill. In particular, the Committee noted that the Bill actually improves on the present situation, as I have said before. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to run briefly through the provisions of the proposed legislation. The Bill provides for three levels of search: a frisk search, an external search and an internal search. The first of these-the frisk search-is restricted to officers of the Customs Service, where an officer suspects on reasonable grounds that a person is carrying illegal goods. The invasion of the suspect's privacy is minimised in this case by the right of the person suspected to have the frisk search conducted in private, if he or she so wishes, and for the search to be conducted by an officer of the same sex. </PARA>
<PARA> The second level of search is the slightly more intrusive external search and appropriately the controls put into place for this search are much more stringent. The external search can be undertaken only if ordered by a justice of the peace, the Customs Comptroller-General or an officer of supervisory rank. In this case then, the Customs officer's suspicions must be strong enough to convince one of those persons before the search can proceed. The search must be undertaken in private and by an officer of the same sex. </PARA>
<PARA> The most intrusive search is, of course, the third level and controls imposed in relation to it must be commensurately strong. An internal search can be undertaken only where a person is suspected of carrying illegal narcotics in a commercial or trafficable quantity-as opposed to carrying illegal drugs, which is the test applied to the other two levels of search. In the absence of a suspect's consent, an internal search can only proceed following two periods of 48 hours in detention to allow the substance to be emitted naturally. The two periods of detention and the search have to be individually ordered by a magistrate or judge. </PARA>
<PARA> A person being held for an internal search has the right for a lawyer to be present or to be represented at the hearings to seek the detention and search order. The internal search must be conducted by a medical practitioner in a hospital and the medical practitioner is provided with immunity from suits which may arise as a result of the search, with the natural exception of negligence. </PARA>
<PARA> Most significantly, at all three levels of search the person detained has the right to protection if he or she is a minor or is intellectually or physically incapacitated. Similarly, a suspected person who is not fluent in English has the express right to be given an interpreter. Both compared with the current legislative regime and measured against the yardstick of appropriate protection for individual rights, the Bill is therefore acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Having looked at that aspect of the proposal, I now want to comment briefly on the contribution this legislation might make to the protection of the community in the area of drug use and drug peddling. It is recognised that drugs represent an ever-growing problem within our society. Honourable senators will be aware of the figures which confirm that assertion and I will not go into them here. It is also true that methods of importation and concealment are becoming increasingly sophisticated and hence the available powers and methods of detection and recovery must also become more sophisticated. </PARA>
<PARA> While we acknowledge the magnitude of the problem, the Australian Democrats are not convinced that these new search procedures will make a major contribution to combating the drug problem in this country. Indeed, a different approach altogether is almost certainly required. My colleague Senator Coulter will be discussing this aspect in more detail in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer in passing to the report by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which, in its report on drugs and crime, detailed a number of possible options of how to deal with the drug problem in future. It suggested that the States, as well as the Federal Government, should address these possible alternative options with some urgency. The Customs Service itself acknowledges that it is not in a position to estimate the effectiveness of its efforts in terms of drug availability or abuse. Other reports indicate that the trafficking of illicit drugs to Australia has continued to increase and that there is no evidence that illicit drug seizures have had a major impact on the availability of illicit drugs in Australia, although no doubt these measures will assist in containing it to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Australian Democrats' reservations about the effectiveness of this proposed legislation does not mean we oppose it. However, given its impact on people's privacy, we will be monitoring its implementation very carefully and will move to amend it in future if that becomes necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Spindler has already indicated, I will address only one aspect of the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill 1990, and that is the effectiveness of the procedures which, in a philosophical sense, are an extension of the present attitude which the Government has to the control of the use of illicit and other drugs. I note that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) stated in his second reading speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In that respect, this part of the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>I refer particularly to the internal body search section-</PARA>
<PARA>is similar to the Customs Amendment Act of 1979 which proposed an internal body-search regime, but which was never proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is useful to emphasise that we are dealing with an attitude which apparently has remained substantially unchanged over the last 11 years. For technical reasons, the Bill was not proclaimed and, in a legislative sense, what we have before us now may be more effective. However, in terms of the attitude to the importation of illicit drugs and the use of those drugs in the community and the problem that that poses for Australian society, the modification of attitudes that has gone on at least in some quarters in Australia is not reflected in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 17 of the Bill sets out the procedures which will apply to the conduct of an internal search, which is to be conducted by a medical practitioner. The Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a medical practitioner may, in carrying out an internal search of a detainee under section 219Z, use any medical procedure or apparatus that the medical practitioner considers to be reasonably safe in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The medical practitioner is constrained from using any procedure involving a surgical incision unless he or she considers it necessary to do so because the detainee's life is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Very extensive powers are given to the medical practitioner under this Bill, and the normal rights of patients with respect to assaults on their person-in other circumstances these would be regarded as assaults on the person because they are done without the permission of the detainee-are abrogated by this legislation. As Senator Spindler has pointed out, we are not objecting to that given the context in which this legislation has come forward. What we are questioning is the effectiveness of that context. The general principle which lies behind this Bill is that by imposing more stringent methods of detention, of search and of the imposition of penalties, in some way we will get on top of this growing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I point then to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, to which my colleague Senator Spindler has already referred. I quote one paragraph from the report last year of that Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the past two decades in Australia we have devoted increased resources to drug law enforcement, we have increased the penalties for drug trafficking and we have accepted increasing inroads on our civil liberties as part of the battle to curb the drug trade. All the evidence shows, however, not only that our law enforcement agencies have not succeeded in preventing the supply of illegal drugs to Australian markets but that it is unrealistic to expect them to do so. If the present policy of prohibition is not working then it is time to give serious consideration to the alternatives, however radical they may seem.</PARA>
<PARA>On other occasions, as recently as this week, we have drawn attention to the strong desirability of the Government's looking elsewhere for a solution to this problem of increasing crime and the increasing costs associated with the use of illicit drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also that in the Minister's second reading speech, on page 8-Senator Newman has already quoted this section-the Minister is there saying:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988-89 the total number of persons searched was 2,505, which represents 0.06 per cent of the total arriving passenger population of 4.2m. Of this number of searches, 102 persons were detained for internal search-</PARA>
<PARA>I have calculated that as 0.002 per cent of the total number of people arriving-</PARA>
<PARA>and, in most cases, those persons consented to x-ray by medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that it is not expected that that number will increase. It seems to me that that number is sufficiently small to suggest that it is fairly arbitrary, and that, again, these further measures which are included in this legislation are not likely to be effective in stemming the flow of drugs into this country. Most of the 0.002 per cent of people detained agreed to be x-rayed-suggesting that most of them were probably not carrying drugs. An extension of the ability to detain and search that small number of people will probably not be very effective in dealing with this very considerable problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting also to remember that historically a drug such as heroin was freely available in Australia up until about 1940. Indeed, Australia imported more heroin per capita up until about 1940 than any other developed country, and that importation was legal. Here we are today. We are a society that still exists. We still conduct our affairs in a normally civilised manner. We have not descended into a drug-ridden community that is incapable of conducting its affairs rationally, normally and in a civilised manner despite that history of having gone through a period in which heroin was imported in large amounts and under conditions in which it was completely legal. </PARA>
<PARA> The narcotic use in Australia-indeed on quite a large scale-is not a new phenomenon in this country, and it has not in the past produced the sorts of problems that many people who are concerned about alternative ways of dealing with this problem suggest might happen. Of course, when narcotics were outlawed, the opportunity was then made for the crime syndicates to move into the trade and operate in ways which were illegal. The syndicates were made illegal by the very act of these drugs themselves being made illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> The main criterion for imposing criminal sanctions on particular behaviour is that the behaviour is harmful to others. But I ask the rhetorical question: does this principle justify criminal sanctions against certain drugs given that the crime associated presently with drugs is a direct result of their becoming illegal. In other words, we have made crimes of things which are really medical and social problems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The drugs themselves are neutral, of course. Criminalisation has fostered a close and profitable relationship between narcotics and organised crime. Those who have the most to lose from legislation are those with a capital investment in the mechanisms of the black market. It would be interesting to note, if we were to move towards decriminalisation, who would object most to such a proposal. I suggest that it would be more likely to be those involved in the present illegal importation and sale of drugs in this country. The tougher the legal measures against drugs become, the higher the price that can be asked for the drug and the bigger the profits that can be made. Large illegal empires need large and protected distribution networks. Of course, this then has led to these profits which can be made, leading to the corruption of the justice structures in this country and in other countries. It has also led to a considerable amount of crime and violence on the streets. One has only to see what has happened on the streets of cities such as New York recently, and particularly the enormous violence which has broken out in countries such as Colombia, where many people, particularly in politics and in the media, find it impossible to conduct any criticism of the drug crime links without the possibility of being murdered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The money invested in illegal drug operations can also be seen as a drain on the world pool of legitimate capital. The world trade in narcotics has been estimated by the United States Senate as around $500 billion a year. If the trade became legal and controlled, with prices which of course would very significantly undercut this black market, the big dealers would be those with most to lose. The drug consumers in Australia-it is estimated that there may be as many as 30,000 to 50,000 people who are dependent on heroin, and perhaps as many as 60,000 recreational but non-dependent users-are at present totally at the mercy of an unregulated market. They are moved on to more lucrative and dangerous substances through artificial supply restrictions. Criminality amongst users trying to pay the inflated prices is widespread and one of the enormous drains, of course, on our present police forces is the degree of breaking and entering of homes and other premises, the petty and not so petty pilfering that goes on, the prostitution and the various other activities that are carried out in an attempt to pay for illegal drugs. The damage done by most narcotics arises principally from the fact that the trade is illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> Death and illness among drug users is not predominantly caused by the consumption of the drugs; it is caused by the unregulated doses of drugs, by impurities mixed with the drugs and by the unhygienic conditions associated particularly with the intravenous use of drugs. On a previous occasion I dealt at some length with the risk posed to the Australian community from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome because of the use of injectable drugs and the sharing of needles. </PARA>
<PARA> So we simply wish to stress, as my colleague Senator Spindler indicated, that, while we are not opposing this legislation, we do see it as an extension of a system of control of drug importation and use which has demonstrably failed and which needs to be modified. The modification would be associated with an improvement in the health of the community, a decrease in crime, a decrease in the cost of law enforcement and, hopefully, a much safer and more humane society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill 1990 is to transfer the functions of the Maritime Operations Division of the Department of Transport and Communications to a new statutory authority. As outlined in the second reading speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), the functions of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) are to be the coordination of maritime research and rescue services; administration of the national plan to combat pollution from ships; implementation of maritime safety and pollution prevention conventions on Australian and visiting foreign ships; the provision of navigational aids and of safety radio services to shipping through the Overseas Telecommunications Commission; the setting of standards for the education, training and certification of seafarers; the operation of the seamen's engagement system; the operation of the Australian register of ships; promotion of sea safety for small craft; and representation at the International Maritime Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Bill, responsibility for investigations of marine casualties will remain with the Department of Transport and Communications. As pointed out by the Minister, the functions being transferred to the Authority have all been effectively performed by the Department, and Australia has an excellent record in maritime safety. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives it had three features: firstly, to establish a statutory authority, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority; secondly, to locate the new statutory authority at Newcastle; and, thirdly, to establish the Authority at a cost of $10m which has been estimated to have blown out to $17m or in excess of $17m. </PARA>
<PARA> The question must be asked: What is the purpose of establishing yet another statutory authority? The Government argues that it represents corporatisation or commercialisation. If that were the main compelling reason as a step towards privatisation, it would have some merit. What the Government is doing, however, by various mechanisms-and this is one of them-is, firstly, to get revenue and expenditure off Budget, and, secondly, to reduce accountability to the Parliament and thus the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has in recent times established a series of trust accounts within departments which lend themselves to this course. They are what are called quasi-commercial operations. The original intention had some merit in that it was, I understand, meant to place them in a competitive position with equivalent-type operations within the private sector. However, it has not gone in the direction that the Department of Finance would have liked it to have gone because these quasi-commercial groups have a large number of captive clients within the public sector itself. This not only enables them to cover fixed costs at monopoly rates, but also to compete with the private sector, using, if they wish, marginal costing; there are numerous examples of this already occurring. It is exactly the same principle as in the domestic prices for primary products in Europe being used to subsidise rural producers, to which everybody on both sides of this Parliament objects. So what we are seeing are subsidies being given through tied clients to make government business enterprises appear to be competitive and efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> What has attracted the Government, however, to trust accounts, in the case of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, a statutory corporation, is that revenue and expenditure go off budget. With trust accounts, to a large extent what goes off one department's budget will, of course, go onto another department's budget. A great problem to the Parliament is the ability of individual members and senators to be able to trace that process. </PARA>
<PARA> With statutory corporations, as is the case with AMSA, where a fee is charged for service the revenue and expenditure are all off budget. While not objecting to a user pays concept for service, what it does enable the Government to do is to impose whatever charge it likes on to a group of captive clients who have no option but to pay. It is thus another government charge and a further indirect tax on that particular sector of the community which has no option but to pay. However, more importantly, it is a way of hiding government revenue and expenditure. The cumulative effect enables the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Government, quite incorrectly, to hoodwink the community and the media by claiming that they have reduced government revenue and government expenditure. At a time when there is a greater and greater demand in the community for transparency, the setting up of yet another quango is not the way to go. For the reasons outlined earlier, the Opposition will be opposing this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> What a litany of deceit we have had on the location of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. When the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) raised in the House the real reason behind the location of AMSA and the expenditure of around $17m in the vicinity of the electorate of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), this was greeted with outrage by the Minister and his colleagues. It is worth quoting a few of the responses. In the House of Representatives on 22 August, reported at page 1282 of Hansard, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no parish pumping; there was no need for there to be. But to choose Canberra would be unbelievable parish pumping . . . would look absolutely stupid, and it would be stupid. Yet we have the audacity of this nonsense about parish pumping. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day the honourable member for Newcastle said:</PARA>
<PARA>I pay tribute to the Minister for Land Transport, who initiated this legislation. I take umbrage at the insult that was offered by the shadow Minister regarding the location. </PARA>
<PARA>Then in the House of Representatives the new honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), reported at page 1334 of Hansard, gave us one of the major reasons for locating at Newcastle-this is great stuff from the Government's decision making process-when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Newcastle is adjacent to the best winemaking area in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that Australia has economic problems if this represents the decision-making process of the Australian Labor Party! Then the Minister for Land Transport, reported on page 1338, said:</PARA>
<PARA>While some of the comments may have been a little facetious, honourable members generally would appreciate and understand why AMSA will continue to be located in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further:</PARA>
<PARA>It is just coincidental that my electorate adjoins Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA>And he said further:</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that the decision to locate AMSA in Newcastle was based on objective reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>So we had the high dudgeon of these people associated with the Newcastle area claiming that what the member for Gilmore had said on pump priming was abusive to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Following all those indignant protests during the debate, a sensible note was introduced by Senator Walsh, who sprung the Government when he said, among other things, `Circuses are taking over from the real issues and such a move has no functional purpose'. It is quite apparent that, with the ringmaster on the back bench, the clowns are now running the circus. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These events occurred before I was Defence Minister but, as I understand it, arising out of various discussions a response from the United States Administration as to who would be in command and control-not withdrawal-of North West Cape occurred some time in late February or early March this year. I think that there has been some misunderstanding as to whether the United States would totally withdraw from North West Cape. I have had no indication that that is the case. I know that there was a typographical error in the appendices to the statement released about the United States bases around the world. I have had every indication that the US intends to stay involved in North West Cape for many years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The detail of the transfer of command and control from a joint facility to an Australian-run facility is still a matter for negotiation and discussion with the United States Administration. We hope to pursue these factors at the upcoming Ausmin talks in more detail in October. I doubt whether they will be resolved fully then because it will take some time to resolve all these matters. So far as I am concerned, I have no knowledge that the United States will withdraw from North West Cape. It is a question of who controls North West Cape in a command sense and basically who pays for North West Cape. There will still be substantial United States involvement for several decades to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of an article in the West Australian newspaper last Monday, 17 September, written by Brian Toohey entitled `A cosy relationship denies the workers'? Does the Minister agree with Mr Toohey's opinion that the leadership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions shares a cosy relationship with the Treasurer and that this works against the interests of union members?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article by Brian Toohey, which I understand is nationally syndicated. I saw the version published in Monday's West Australian. If we expect of journalists as we do of witnesses in court proceedings to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth, we have to recognise that the art of rendering the truth in journalistic copy is indeed a difficult art. But even with that qualification borne in mind, this article does not meet the whole truth element of what we would expect to be a reasonable report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Toohey has written an article which is selective in the extreme. He has selected to suit his particular brand of prejudice. There can be no argument that he has eschewed objectivity in the putting of his point of view. Therefore, the proximity to truth in reporting that his article bears is indeed a distant one.</PARA>
<PARA> I propose to comment only briefly on the point raised by Senator McKiernan. It is true-there is nothing surprising about it; it would be odd if it were otherwise-that the union movement has a proximity to a Labor government that it might not have to a Liberal government. There is a closeness. In fact, we have an accord to help regulate industrial relations. The managing of that is a difficult enough job in order to keep all the elements of that accord travelling in the right direction for the positive outcome of the economy. To characterise the interconnection between a representative of the union movement and the Government as some sort of conspiracy, as the article seems to imply, is to characterise it entirely in the obverse direction to where it really is-it is an essential element to proper management.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Toohey has repeated an old canard in his article that the Opposition used in the election campaign-I see that Mr Howard still uses it-by simply and mindlessly saying that under Labor real wages have fallen. That is true because there has been a change in factor shares from wages to profits-as the accord was designed to do-in order to generate profits for investment and encourage investment in Australia. But what that canard does not recognise, which is the whole truth and which is left unstated in this article, is the fact that disposable household income per capita, which is the real test of the well-being of ordinary Australians, has risen by over 11 per cent during the period of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Just simply mindlessly repeating that real wages have fallen ignores the fact that there is an 11 per cent improvement in household disposable income per capita. The well-being of households is dependent on wages, on taxes, on other services provided and on the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA> The social wage is the other flaw in what Mr Toohey has said. In his article he has ignored any commentary-he purports to speak as if he were a Labor man but condemns the Labor Government-that the biggest tax cuts in Australia's history, combined with measures to reduce tax avoidance, have been introduced by this Government; that we have extended occupational superannuation to the greater bulk of wage and salary earners, including women, who have been traditionally excluded; that we have introduced the family allowance supplement and Medicare; that we have introduced housing assistance, which was not provided before; that we have made significant improvements in the provisions of child-care; and that there has been a dramatic movement in the retention rate in secondary schools, with year 12 rates having increased by 36 per cent in 1982 and by 60 per cent in 1989. When looking at the well-being of families, it is not simply a matter of the real value of wages; it is the real purchasing power, the real household disposable income, that is the test. Chaney, Howard and Toohey make a trinity in not recognising those objective truths.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to a report in today's Australian that a confidential Government report from the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) was obtained by the media and that that report recommends more deregulation in the banking system. I ask the Minister: Does he agree with the report's statement that the relative lack of competition in the Australian market has allowed the banks to maintain artificially high lending margins? Does this indicate the failure of the Treasurer's method of deregulating the financial system? Does the Minister agree that there would have been even more competition in the Australian banking industry if foreign banks, granted entry several years ago, had been allowed to operate in Australia as branches rather than being required to operate through subsidiaries?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very easy for some people to leap to conclusions. On the basis of the advice or the minute I have received from the Bureau of Industry Economics I am not able to leap to any conclusions of that kind. The BIE offers independent advice on a variety of economic issues. The costs and availability of capital to industry are as major a concern to it, as they are to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The burden of the BIE paper was to make the point that Australian banks appear to be enjoying lending margins double those obtaining in the United Kingdom at the present time. The United Kingdom comparison was chosen because monetary policy there followed a very similar course to monetary policy in Australia. The distorting influences of changes in monetary policy on lending margins is taken into account in such a comparison.</PARA>
<PARA> The implication of that is that the costs of capital to business borrowing domestically is higher than those justified by the current circumstance of monetary policy. That is not a novel conclusion. I have made some comments about that before and I believe other Ministers have too. The Treasurer made that point a few weeks ago in some statement relating to the banks. The BIE also concluded that the banks may now be seeking to recoup some of the losses experienced recently as a result of bankruptcies and the collapse of some highly leveraged entrepreneurs.</PARA>
<PARA> As to whether this indicates a lack of competition in the Australian market and that more competition would occur if additional banking licences were made available to operate only in certain market segments, as I indicated in the earlier part of my answer I am not in a position to say for sure. That may well be the case. It may be an issue worthy of examination. However, I am sure that the behaviour of the capital market has not been subject to as much scrutiny as other sectors of the economy in the so-called public micro- economic reform debate.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the need to make capital available to small to medium sized firms to enable them to grow and develop new products and services, our capital markets have proved to be narrow and inflexible in their lending practices. In particular, the thinness of the venture capital market in Australia appears to be just as much a product of cultural attitudes amongst the institutions as it is of market structure.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to Senator Short's question, in summary all I can say is that any conclusions one can draw from that are speculative ones and I would not draw them at this time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government is extremely concerned by the situation in Sri Lanka, as I know many other Australians are, including Senator Hill, who has been quite vocal-appropriately so-on the subject. We are concerned about the bloodshed, especially the deaths of non-combatants; about the breaches of human rights; and about the implications of the conflict for Sri Lanka's future as a nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have expressed this concern publicly on a number of occasions, particularly with regard to the actions of the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers. I realise that the LTTE has denied its involvement in massacres, as has generally been its practice throughout the conflict. I can only say that the weight of evidence is overwhelmingly against it.</PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that human rights breaches have not been committed by others. There have been instances of human rights violations on both sides, and I am disturbed that the number of these continues to escalate. Certainly, there is no question of me or the Australian Government condoning abuses perpetrated by the Government security forces. I believe that the Sri Lankan Government has been making genuine efforts to ensure effective discipline among its forces. In my discussions in Colombo recently I emphasised the need to sustain these efforts. Subsequent to my visit, the High Commission in Colombo has been instructed to remind the Sri Lankan Government of the need for restraint, particularly in view of some alarming reports of heavy casualties among Tamil civilians in the east of the country.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of our growing concerns about the situation and our firm belief in the need for a negotiated political settlement, I discussed with President Premadasa ways of making progress toward a settlement, including the possibility of involvement by the Commonwealth or some other appropriate multilateral mechanism. Following further consideration of the matter after my return to Australia, the Prime Minister has now written to President Premadasa to set out some options in the Commonwealth context which the Sri Lankans might like to pursue. These options concentrate on a possible Commonwealth good offices role to facilitate resumption of negotiations between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. The Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs and trade, Senator Hill, has been fully briefed on this subject.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications to a recent significant paper on Telecom Australia's community service obligations by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which noted that competition will force Telecom to adopt a pricing structure which includes charges for directory assistance, higher rental charges, timed local calls and higher STD charges for remote rural consumers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very important role that Telecom currently plays is that of providing telecommunications services to remote communities, which it does through its community service obligations. But the Government has taken the position-and it is the correct position-that a greater degree of competition needs to be provided to make sure that Telecom across the whole range of its services performs more efficiently than the largely efficient way in which it is performing at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the constant targets for attack in Australia is Telecom, and I agree with the Australian Democrats and a number of others that Telecom is often unfairly and unjustly criticised in that, at least from where I sit, it provides a relatively efficient service. But it can be better, and there is no question that competition will bring that about.</PARA>
<PARA> To address the detail of the honourable senator's question, I have said in this House twice already, but I am happy to say it again, that the Government has set the broad parameters that are required to be achieved in changes to the telecommunications networks in Australia. The Government has given an absolute guarantee that rural services will not be adversely affected by this move, but the very complex detail-and it is very complex-still remains to be determined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, it is true. Last week was not a good week for aviation in Australia involving big jets. But what it indicated was something which I have always held to be true and something to which the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority has recently been giving a great deal of attention, because of which some very unfair criticism has been levelled at him: that is, to attain an excellent safety record, which many countries around the world have, one needs a combination of factors involving the strict regulation, supervision and workmanship that go into the original construction of the aircraft; the quality of the maintenance that is then delivered to that aircraft during its entire working life; and the expertise of all of the multiple systems involved in regulating the passage of that aircraft through the air in relation to other aircraft, that is, the skill of the crew on board the aircraft, air traffic control and the quality of the equipment that is involved in all of those stages.</PARA></TALK.START>

While the aircraft was on its final approach to the airport, the two outboard engines flamed out due to fuel exhaustion. A third engine flamed out as the plane touched down on the runway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aircraft stayed on the runway and air traffic control requested it to move off the runway so that an F18 fighter could land. The pilot responded that he was unable to move the aircraft from the runway to the taxiway as he was out of fuel. Regrettably, the airport then had to be closed for three hours while the aircraft was refuelled on the runway in order to move it off the runway.</PARA>
<PARA> The incident was very regrettable. Both the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and the Civil Aviation Authority are currently investigating it. The Bureau has already given me a preliminary report which says that the preliminary investigation has already revealed that there seemed to have been a substantial problem with fuel management on behalf of the crew. I have no doubt that the report, when it is completed, will contain further details which I can provide to Senator Faulkner at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say at this point in time whether there was any real danger to the community near Williamtown airport except to say-in acknowledging the facts, as I have to Senator Faulkner-that the aircraft landed at Williamtown literally with the fuel in the fuel lines running to the engines and none in the tanks. It was luck, again, and the prompt action of the controller who diverted it to Williamtown, that saved what could have been the third disaster in one week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be said that some people in rural Australia, and some of them associated with the National Party of Australia, do seem to have an interest in trying to orchestrate an emotional and irrational debate on a number of quarantine issues. It seems that they are doing that at the behest of some commodity groups within rural Australia, where those commodity groups are having to face up to some international competition. The fears and anxieties, where people are being exposed to competition, are being exploited and preyed upon by some political figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That has led to suggestions from some of those commodity sectors that quarantine should be used as a non-trade barrier to prevent the entry of competitive goods. This Government rejects the idea that quarantine should be used for that. Quarantine and inspection should be properly used to make sure that no disease is introduced into Australia through the import process, but not to prevent healthy or disease-free commodities coming in here to compete with those that are available from domestic supply.</PARA>
<PARA> I just sound this note of warning: were it to be that the force of this lobby were to gather, Australia would be adversely affected if reciprocal action was taken against it on its major commodity exports of wheat and wool, at a time at which, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions, we are lobbying strenuously for a reduction in non-trade barriers.</PARA>

It should be noted that those proposals are based on low risk fireblight source areas for fruit, disease freedom in the season prior to export, orchard inspections, testing of sample fruit as well as dip treatment, and that only two districts of New Zealand would be involved-not the whole of the country. It is also worth noting that apparently healthy apples when exported have never been responsible for the establishment of fireblight.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. The FAC is about to release a very important document at 3 o'clock this afternoon-immediately after Question Time-which relates directly to all the issues that Senator Parer has canvassed. I note, and it certainly did not come from my office, that a substantial part of the broad detail of that document is already on the front pages of today's media. But as the Minister responsible for the FAC, I do not want to be discourteous to it by canvassing at length the issues that are contained in that environmental impact statement (EIS) before it is released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to Senator Parer's question, however, I would say that the EIS has been unfairly criticised for not containing any recommendations. This is absolutely pertinent and relevant to Senator Parer's question. In my view, it does not need to contain any recommendations; nor should it. It lays out in some considerable detail the options that are available to manage the increasing difficulty of traffic congestion at Sydney Airport.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not as simple as building a third runway. The EIS canvasses the possibilities that are available. It points out ways of dealing with the problem. The problem can be effectively dealt with through pure traffic management without building a third runway or an airport at Badgery's Creek. There is no question that that is technically possible. For that reason the EIS properly canvassed the matter. If honourable senators think that the screams from the New South Wales regional airlines when I introduced the very modest management technique of peak period pricing were bad, wait until they hear the screams if we try to impose that solution. Nevertheless, the EIS canvasses it. It also canvasses the possibility of constructing a third runway at Sydney Airport and of going ahead with staged development at Badgery's Creek in accordance with the normal commercial demands that would be applied for a second airport to be established on commercial grounds there. The EIS also lays out the scenario for directed development at Badgery's Creek, as opposed to normal commercial demands. Those are the three major options that the EIS canvasses. All of them would successively solve the traffic management problems at Sydney Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, the issue is very important nationally for this country, particularly in terms of the micro-economic reform agenda of this Government, in that the airport has an unarguable impact on the people who live in the area next to it. Unlike the Opposition, we are not prepared-I, as Minister, have never been prepared-simply to brush the interests of those people aside as being of no account, which the Opposition would like us to do. Their interests have to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> Environmental and traffic management concerns have to be addressed-this is a very important point-as do the economic concerns, in terms of the return on the investment, for the viability of those airports, wherever they are, once they have been built.</PARA>
<PARA> The EIS, quite correctly in my view, lays out very precisely that none of those issues-environment, traffic management, economic viability, or the concerns of the people at Sydney Airport-would preclude the construction of the third runway or the staged development of Badgery's Creek. The EIS quite correctly points out the options that are available. All of them will solve, with up sides and down sides, the traffic management problem at Sydney Airport. It is a political decision for the Government at the end of this process to determine the proper balance that has to be struck between all the competing interests. As I have said, unlike the Opposition we are simply not prepared to brush them aside as being of no account, but at the end of the day it is a political decision as to whether that runway should proceed or not. We have therefore deliberately allowed an extended period of three months for the scrutiny of this document and for all the issues to be canvassed, but on the basis of what the EIS has produced it will be a decision for the Government at the end of the day as to whether that runway proceeds or not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must commend Senator Foreman for raising this question. We talk in this community about the level of industrial disputes as a major factor for lost time in production, but we do not talk anywhere near seriously enough about the lost time caused by industrial accidents, injury and disease in industry, which is by a factor 12 times more than the dispute level. However, we do not talk at all about the lost time to production because of absenteeism and labour turnover, which is also stated, at least by some commentators to be about the same level as lost time due to accidents. It is in approaching the subject of how to increase productivity and improve the time out of industry by the productive inputs that this question becomes important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A group of consultants put a report to the Automotive Industry Council, which covered 2,300 employees at 11 automotive industry plants throughout Australia, representing approximately 10 per cent of the employees at those plants. The major findings of the report were that in 1989 labour turnover rates for companies participating in the study varied from 11 per cent to 61 per cent per annum with a median of 28 per cent. The turnover costs were about $6,600 for each non-trade employee and up to $71,000 for each manager. Turnover and absenteeism add almost $850, it was found, to the cost of a car. The key underlying factor influencing turnover, absenteeism and motivation was the worker's commitment to the organisation, and the most important determinant of the worker's attitude overall was the managerial style used. The report stressed the need for an open management style with an emphasis on consultation and open and fair decision making.</PARA>
<PARA> The findings of the report are consistent with the findings of similar reports in the past in that there is a recognition of a need to introduce new organisation and managerial style to ensure job satisfaction. It is recognised that it does make a difference, as some workers have said. In organisations where a new open managerial style has been introduced, it has been found that when people clock on they are not required to leave their brains at the gate; they can take them in and apply them to the production tasks that they do there. All the abilities of an employee are used, not just the mechanistic aspect of his or her skill contribution. Award restructuring has been a positive help and the workplace reform program that this Government runs has also helped improve the quality of working life and the quality of productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that in the automotive industry the Government has undertaken a number of programs. In 1988 the Department of Industrial Relations part funded a tripartite overseas mission to Japan, the United States of America, West Germany and Sweden to investigate best practice in the industry. As a consequence of that visit a study of work groups at Toyota is being carried out by Dr Bamber of the University of Queensland on a grant. The Toyota Dandenong plant is pioneering the work teams concept in the automotive industry in Australia and will report in March 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly give that undertaking. When it comes to this high speed computer matching, it will be done in the old Deakin telephone exchange. I hesitate to raise that, but I thought it best to get it off my chest early. I know that an old sparring partner of Senator Boswell's has had something to say about the Deakin telephone exchange. It is not the world centre of a Jewish, socialist, Fabian, Catholic plot for a one-world government. I hope that this will be accepted by all senators. If Senator Maguire goes out there, he will see for a start that the premises are as secure as premises can be in this country and are guarded 24 hours a day. The data matching process is done in complete privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Slow down Senator Patterson; I am trying to explain this issue. It is a matter of genuine importance and I am really trying to get even Senator Patterson to understand it. The records from other agencies come to the Department of Social Security (DSS) on magnetic tapes. Apart from technical control messages, nothing at all appears on screens while those tapes are being processed in our equipment. The only outputs from the matching process are the details of possible incorrect payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, not all of the bits of information thrown up will turn out to be actual incorrect payments. But the matching process will give the Department an indication of where to look. Where, upon further checking that relatively small number of people who have been suggested might be doing the wrong thing, it is shown that they are not, then every scrap of information is destroyed within three months.</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative is that the Department do all of this by hand. Once it is done by hand, all the privacy aspects I have just gone through go out the window; we cannot have them. People in my Department will then get access to much more information than they can at the moment. Remember that under the system now being proposed no-one-literally no-one-sees any of the information of Australian citizens unless and until they are thrown up as being the subject of possible incorrect payments, and only a very small number will be in that category.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point is that the only details that will be provided to the Department of Social Security by the Australian Taxation Office for this bulk matching that we are now doing will be those that actually relate to clients at DSS-not, as I have seen in some articles lately, that every Australian's information will be passed through. That is simply not the case.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of what I have just said, using the tax file number actually is an option that guarantees more security and more privacy than any other method, certainly more than the method currently being used by the Department, which is to do it all manually. Although tax file numbers cannot be used in data matching processes at the moment-I, therefore, cannot show honourable senators a current program using tax file numbers-I think it would be desirable that all honourable senators actually see how this process will work, where it is happening and how many people will have access to it. Rather than answering all the statements that some honourable senators have made, the Secretary of my Department will be writing to all honourable senators and offering them, during the course of the next couple of weeks when Parliament is not sitting, the opportunity to inspect the operation.</PARA>

I remember that Dr Hewson explained that he supported the measures the Government had taken in this respect. He did so in the context of the Opposition saying that it would have wiped $3 billion off government expenditure. The only way to do that is to weigh massively into social security payments. Those opposite have to make the choice either of taking $400m off cheats and bludgers or of taking it off genuine needy people. This Government will not have a bar of the latter; we will certainly do the former.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know why I have to suffer these arrows of outrageous fortune at the hands of Senator Bishop day and night. We went through all these questions last night in the Estimates Committee and they are being recycled today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me be quite precise. The Industry Commission has published a draft report in respect of its inquiry into the passenger motor vehicle industry. As I understand it, the embargo on the publication of that report was lifted today, as it had been leaked and appeared in some newspapers this morning. As I said half a dozen times last night, it is a draft report. The Industry Commission will deal with submissions from various concerned parties-I believe about 64 submissions have been made to the Commission. The Industry Commission will deal with those submissions and will then publish a final report, which is a recommendation to government. At that time the Government will deal with the question.</PARA>
<PARA> Although we dealt with the last part of Senator Bishop's question last night, I suppose it is a bit of a stir, so let me deal with that too. If Senator Bishop examines my record as industry Minister, she will see that there has been no report of the Industry Commission of any significance which this Government has not implemented. There are two exceptions: one relates to the chemicals and plastics industry, in which the Government adopted a much harder approach than was recommend by the Commission; the second one relates to the textile, clothing and footwear industry, where the Government, with Opposition approval, adopted a softer approach than was recommended by the Industry Commission. That may well have turned out to be a mistake. But let me say that it was done at the time on a bipartisan basis.</PARA>
<PARA> It is no good bowling up those sorts of questions to me here. As I said last night, one of my colleagues made a reference to my seeking to do private deals with the motor vehicle companies. I have explained that in the Senate, in the Estimates Committees and so on. I just repeat, and will continue to repeat, that in an industry which is entirely foreign-owned-it amazes me that Senator Bishop, having taken up three hours of the time of the Estimates Committee last night with this sort of stuff, needs to hear it again-any government that is laying down policy for that industry would be very foolish not to talk to those who make the investments in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop asked me about 30 questions on this matter last night. I do not know what I was doing wasting my time last night when this stuff is recycled here today. It seems to me that the Estimates Committee process is totally wasted if I get a question like this one again today after the answer was provided on several occasions last night. It is a disgrace to the processes of the Senate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson asked me a question on 17 September and I have an answer for her. The honourable senator has confused on the one hand the general rate increase for pensioners, sickness beneficiaries and long term older beneficiaries that will take place in March 1991 and on the other the general question of indexation dates. The pharmaceutical supplement is being replaced by a general rate increase in March 1991 for all those who currently receive free pharmaceuticals as well as other pensioners. As a matter of administrative simplicity we have referred to this as occurring on the indexation pay day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no anomaly with respect to sickness beneficiaries under the age of 21 generally. They will be eligible for the general rate increase of $2.50 taking place in March 1991, and will therefore be covered for any expenditure up to the safety limit of $150 for the November 1990 to December 1991 period. Despite this, it is true that sickness beneficiaries under the age of 21 will not have their $2.50 indexed until January 1992. The reason for this is that sickness benefit for under 21-year-olds forms part of the Government's common youth allowance structure, which ensures that all payments to those under 21 are indexed annually in January to keep them in line with Austudy. It should be noted, however, that the pharmaceuticals charge will be indexed in October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus a person under the age of 21 who becomes a sickness beneficiary in the period from 1 October 1991 to 31 December 1991 may have to pay the indexed charge while receiving only $2.50 in compensation. The difference would amount to less than 20c per item. In an extreme case, for example, someone who used 12 scripts in a three-month period would be out of pocket by approximately $2.40. These people will have entered the system well after Budget night. The Treasurer referred in his Budget Speech to existing beneficiaries and pensioners. The fact remains that all those in the system now will be fully compensated and many will be better off.</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board has credit insurance cover through Austrade and the Export Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC). Under this cover claims are payable on outstanding amounts four months after the due date. In the normal course of events there would have been a regular flow of payments from Iraq to the Australian Wheat Board through the United States banking system.</PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has had an exemplary record of meeting payments as they fall due. I am advised that Iraq has authorised three payments totalling $US2.8m to be made to the Australian Wheat Board but these have been affected by the United States freeze on Iraqi transactions. The Australian Wheat Board is endeavouring through the appropriate channels in the United States to secure the release of these payments. As yet no response has been received.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to compensation, it is still too early for the Government to take any decision on this. However, in this case the block payments would be included within the causes of loss covered by the Australian Wheat Board's insurance with Austrade-EFIC.</PARA>

<PARA> On the matter that Senator Walters raised as to whether there will be a Minister available on the Tuesday, at this stage there is no meeting of Estimates Committee C scheduled for Tuesday. Estimates Committee C will be meeting tomorrow, the third day. It will be meeting on Friday, the fourth day. If a fifth day is required, the Government will have to examine when it can make a Minister available. Committee members will also have to assess when they would be available to have a meeting. We would do that with as much cooperation as possible, but I suggest that, because of the changes that have occurred to the Government's representation on the Committee, it would be better to leave the problem to be worked out amongst the members of the Committee as to when it would meet again, if needed, and the decision can then be communicated to all other senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the fundamental importance for the national interest of major micro-economic reform, and noting that improved efficiency and greater competition are key elements of such reform, the need for the Senate to endorse the selling of shares in the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it clear what the debate on this urgency motion today is about and what it is not about. It is not a debate about the merits or demerits of privatisation. It is not about debating whether publicly owned business undertakings would make more efficient use of our community's scarce resources if they were run by the private sector. It is not about whether privatisation, with necessary supporting measures, would increase competition or give consumers a wide range of better quality goods and services to choose from and at lower prices. It is not about whether employees in public enterprises would be better off if those enterprises were owned by private shareholders, with the employees having the option to be shareholders in their own enterprises on preferential terms. The debate is not about whether privatisation of government-owned business enterprises would lead to higher national productivity and increased national competitiveness in an ever-increasingly competitive international environment; or about whether this increased productivity, efficiency and competitiveness would produce faster economic growth, more jobs and higher incomes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate is not about these matters for one simple reason, namely that that debate has already been held and won throughout most of the Australian community, just as it has been held and won throughout virtually all the Western world and most of the Third World. Privatisation is no longer an issue for debate in much of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 90 governments of all political persuasions around the world-democracies, single party governments and dictatorships alike-have full-scale privatisation of publicly owned enterprises as a major plank of their economic reform programs and policies. The number of countries going down the privatisation route is, of course, accelerating rapidly. One has only to observe the momentous changes occurring throughout eastern Europe. Is it not incredible that in nations which less than 12 months ago were run by hard core, reactionary communist governments, privatisation is proceeding at a pace that makes Australia under the Hawke Government look even more out of touch with modern day reality than is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the few groups on earth yet to embrace the necessity for privatisation, if we want to improve the living standards of our people, is the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Regrettably, the Labor Party appears to be joined in this time warp of unreality by the Australian Democrats, although I earnestly hope and pray that the Democrats today will support this urgency motion so as to prove my assessment of them wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> But setting the Democrats aside, this debate today is all about providing the Australian Labor Party at its special national conference next Monday with overwhelming evidence that the elected representatives of the Australian people, in the form of members of this Senate, representing as we do all shades of political opinion and all States and territories of this nation, recognise the urgent need for the party of the present Federal Government, albeit only for a brief time yet, the Australian Labor Party, to face reality and to pursue policies which will lead to a better way of life for all Australians-policies which are not dictated by faction and division within the Party, policies of the least common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many things that need to be done to make Australia once again a vibrant, dynamic, prosperous, compassionate nation with rising living standards. But in the end, these many things boil down to this: we must become more productive, we must become more competitive, we must use the physical and human resources with which we are so amply blessed more efficiently in the interests of us all as citizens of Australia and as bequeathers of this great nation of ours to our children and our children's children. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that, despite all our endowments, our resources, our skills, our talents and our capacities, our per capita economic output is one of the lowest in the Western world and far lower than the leading so-called Third World countries? Why is it that our costs of living increase each year at twice the rate of most other Western nations-in some instances, four or five times their rate? Why is it that our interest rates are the highest in the Western world and cripple families and businesses alike? Why is it that we cannot pay our way in the world? Why do we buy $20,000m more worth of goods and services each year from other countries than we are able to sell to them? Why, as a result, has our debt to the rest of the world-the mortgage we will bequeath to our children and grandchildren-increased no less than fivefold in the past seven brief years?</PARA>
<PARA> The basic reason is that we do not use our resources efficiently. One basic reason for this is that we have most of our infrastructure-our essential industries that provide the power, the communications and the transport and all the other services that are essential for the efficient working of a modern economy-owned by governments, both Federal and State. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally beyond dispute that publicly owned enterprises are less efficient in the use of resources than privately owned enterprises. There is a library of studies to support this view. If we want to get out of the dreadful mess that the Hawke Labor Government has got us into, one of the essential, urgent actions required is to permit the privatisation of our major publicly owned enterprises. That is what next week's special ALP conference is all about. Will the Labor Party at last grasp the nettle and take the decision to sell the shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines, or will it not?</PARA>
<PARA> There are two aspects of this question that I want to pursue. The first is the quite disgraceful hypocrisy, confusion, illogicality and inconsistency shown by leading members of the Government on this subject over recent years. My colleagues, Senator Macdonald and Senator Olsen will elaborate on this later in the debate. The second point I want to raise is the fact that these fundamental decisions are in the hands of a bunch of unknown faceless people whom the Australian electorate has had no part at all in selecting for this task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is in a time warp. His Party has been in a time warp for the last 80 years. Let me address Labor's cant and hypocrisy first. But before doing that, let me point out that within Labor's ranks the battle has already been lost to the troglodytes in respect of privatisation in the telecommunications industry. Cabinet has adopted the Beazley megacom or monstercom proposal. That proposal keeps Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd totally government owned. The proposed permitted sale of Aussat Pty Ltd is but a minnow in this sea of whales, although even that tiny decision is up for grabs at next week's conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Keating proposal on communications was a less bad proposal than the Beazley proposal, but it too was grossly deficient in its failure to recognise the need to privatise the telecommunications industry and to introduce genuine competition, both of which are full-blooded publicly known and promoted policies of the Opposition. The main privatisation battle lines for next week's special conference are drawn around the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator should read his special resolution. Confusion on these matters reigns supreme within Labor's ranks. No wonder there is confusion, fear and concern throughout the ranks of the Labor Party. Let us have a look at some of the statements of leading players in recent years. Let us have a look at what Mr Keating had to say on this subject in the House of Representatives in 1985. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>No matter where one looks, whether it be at TAA or the other authorities, there is no case for the Opposition's argument in economics except simply to indulge ideologically in a Thatcherite, vandalistic splurge to try to destroy these authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> the Opposition sits back and says that it will sell off Telecom, Australia Post, the Commonwealth Bank, or any of the others. The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth . . . We are not about wrecking them and selling them. The great public services they provide will continue to be provided while ever this Government has the breath to defend them. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in the same debate in the House of Representatives in 1985 Mr Keating stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The sale of the Commonwealth Bank or the Australian Industry Development Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>to the Government's credit it has been partially privatised-</PARA>
<PARA>or Trans-Australia Airlines is simply vandalism of Australia's great public authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that privatisation:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is a one-off fire sale, the sale of the century, of your assets-the assets of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> They would transfer them into the hands of a privileged few, to the cost of every one of us. </PARA>
<PARA>Even Senator Button, who normally speaks reasonably rational-certainly less irrational-economic commonsense than his counterparts, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), was enjoined to join this Greek chorus. At about the same time in the Senate, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Privatisation is not about small government as some people allege; it is not about cutting taxes in some sort of fire sale mentality . . . it is most unfortunate . . . the leader . . . should devote so much time to pursuing this ridiculous red herring . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In recent times the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seem to have had an apparent conversion on the Damascus road. I use the words `apparent conversion' advisedly and deliberately because nowhere that I look in the ranks of the Labor Party, in the so-called think tanks of the Labor Party, and in the policy documents emanating from the Labor Party, can I find one whit of evidence that there has been a detailed and carefully thought-out reconsideration of this whole question. </PARA>
<PARA> However, now the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seem to think that privatisation is not all that bad after all. Indeed, going back to 1988 the Prime Minister started to look as if he was being converted. In an Age newspaper interview in February 1988 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I do believe it is reasonable to ask does it make sense to tie up public resources in, for instance, running an airline. I have a prima facie view that it doesn't. </PARA>
<PARA>Treasurer Keating said the same thing two or three months later. In an AM interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . basically, I don't think the Government ought to be running airlines. And that's why I think their equity ought to be sold down. We can't afford to continue providing subventions for their capital base. Now with scarce Cabinet Room budgetary dollars, we can't be putting billions into Qantas and Australian Airlines and the like. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, why these apparent conversions by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer? It is because they know that the public purse does not have the dollars to provide these public enterprises with the capital funds necessary for their efficient operation. They also know that these enterprises will not be as efficient as they should whilst they remain in public ownership. The tragedy is that they still cannot bring themselves to throw off the socialist mantle of the traditional Labor Party and its platform. They are prevented from throwing off that mantle by the faceless people of the Labor Party and the organisation of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the letter that was sent to all members of the Australian Labor Party. It was signed jointly by Messrs Hawke and Keating and dated 7 September, following the decision by the Hawke Government and the victorious Kirner Government to sell the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank and to allow the Commonwealth Bank to partially privatise in order to fund that merger. In that letter the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said that there were two points that had to be made at the outset in relation to this decision. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the merger decisions were taken to avert the serious possibility of a collapse not only of the State Bank of Victoria, but also, as a result, of the financial system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply untrue. There was another bid for the State Bank of Victoria at that time. Why then did they make that point? They did so because they wanted to avert the argument that the merger is important because it challenges the whole foundation of the Labor Party. There is no point in principle about it; it is just a salvage operation. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Second, the merger and injection of new, non-government capital will see the integrity and commercial capacity of a government-owned bank-the Commonwealth-both preserved and strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA>Messrs Keating and Hawke could not even bring themselves in that letter to use the words `private capital'; they had to say `non-government capital'. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe this is thoroughly consistent with the principles and intentions of Labor's policies towards the Commonwealth Bank despite the reduction from full to majority government ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>On what belief is that based? As I have said, this decision overturns those cherished traditional principles and myths of Labor Party history. But Mr Hawke and Mr Keating are not prepared to bite the bullet, face reality and say, `Privatisation is the way to go. The socialist mantle we have had as our traditional base for our Party over the last 80 years is no longer sufficient in this modern-day world. We are prepared to face up to the reality that that implies'. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor cannot have it both ways. It cannot continue to straddle the fence. If Labor is really serious about its move towards privatisation, it must be prepared to dump socialism from its party platform. The Opposition's plea today has been the consistent plea for a long time now, and it is a twofold plea. The first part is, `For heaven's sake, be sincere about your privatisation policy'; and secondly, `Stop trying to have two bob each way. Face up to reality. We on this side of the Parliament will support you'. If the Labor Party does not face up to reality and does not bite the bullet, the losers will be the Australian people, and they are the constituents of all members of this House on all sides. The other loser will be the Australian nation. I hope that rationality will prevail and that the shibboleths, the hypocrisy, the cant, the fears and the concerns generated within the ranks of the Labor Party will to be swept away. But I wonder whether that will happen. One only has to look at the philosophical-type speeches by the Prime Minister in the past to realise that it is very doubtful that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We come back to the fact that next Monday's fundamental decisions are in the hands of a group of faceless people who have no claim to democratically represent the Australian electorate or even the Labor Party. There are 101 delegates to the conference next week. Of those, less than one in five are members of the Federal Parliament. Yet that conference will be taking decisions that it is the right of this Parliament to take, and the right of a democratically elected government to take. It is not the right of a bunch of people who have never been elected to represent the people of Australia. In the end we shall have a situation next Monday in which 20 people from the Centre Left of the factions of the Labor Party will decide the fate of the future of the Labor Party and therefore, so long as it remains in government, the fate of the policy making of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt about it: this special conference of faceless men is a conference that should not be happening. The Government of this country should have the guts, the ability and the wit to tell the Australian people the situation as it is. That situation is clearly that privatisation is the only route to go towards a more efficient Australia. That is what this motion today is about. If the Senate by passing this motion can assist that cause, we will have performed a very valuable service. I urge all honourable senators to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it clear from the outset that the Government will not be supporting this cheap stunt and will be voting against the motion. The reason is fairly simple. If it is an attempt to divide the party and have a great big debate here, what a sad failure it has been. In the Senate party meeting this morning it took about 30 seconds and nobody even contemplated that such a bizarre and absurd motion would be worthy of support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But secondly, the speech was so bad that it lowered the standards significantly. If it was an attempt to divide the party or create some sort of internal concern, it has failed. If Opposition senators want to withdraw it, we can then get on with doing some serious business in the Senate; they are welcome to do so now-otherwise let us talk about it. It is pathetic. To pretend that there is an urgent need for Senate endorsement of this view is stretching the limits of the English language beyond belief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether or not there is to be any sale of shares in any of those bodies, some of which will be under discussion on Monday and some of which will not be, will be seen from the legislation which will come forward after it has been properly considered, not by the national conference of any political party, but by the Cabinet. After it has made its decision and the matters have gone through the parliamentary party process, not dissimilar to those pursued by the Opposition party, then it will come before the Parliament. If that happens, the Senate can make its decision in its proper and constitutional way. What is happening in this chamber today is a terrible waste of time and a bit of a diversion, but at least it is the first time the Opposition has come up with any matter of public importance or urgency motion. I suppose we should be grateful for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion is fundamentally flawed internally, apart from the politics of it. The arguments within it do not lead logically to the conclusion. I agree with the need for micro-economic reform and that the purpose of it is to increase efficiency in the economy, to increase output, and to deal with the problems we have with the current account deficit and giving us the capacity to do that while easing downward pressure on demand because we can increase supply. Increase of supply is slower than reduction of demand, as we all know, but that is a reality with which we have to deal. Micro-economic reform is one part of it. However, there is nothing in the motion that does anything about the question of competition, which has been thrown in there just because Opposition members realise that if they left it out, it would look like the truth-that they are privatising for the sake of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Competition is sometimes the appropriate process to do with micro-economic reform-not on every occasion, but on some occasions. Micro-economic reform in probably the most important area, railways, probably will not be affected by competition. It is still micro-economic reform and it is still about efficiency, but it is not about competition. Sometimes it is part of the process. The Opposition vaguely alludes to the fact that there are some other elements, but does not say what they are. The motion and the argument in support of it certainly lack intellectual rigour. There is no argument; it is a question of assertion and fond hope-talking about libraries of argument without mentioning any of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Selling shares in enterprises may in some circumstances lead to increased efficiency; not necessarily, and not always, but sometimes. I will quote, from that library, some of the studies that have been done. The selling of shares in those three enterprises or any other has nothing to do with competition. I think that was thrown in as an afterthought. It is inherent nonsense. By definition, selling shares has nothing to do with competition and the Opposition knows it. The Commonwealth Bank operates in a competitive environment. It is valid to argue that it is not a sufficiently competitive environment and that there are some problems with the competition. But it has nothing to do with the share ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. Qantas Airways Ltd operates in a very competitive environment-far more competitive than when Opposition members were in government. There is much more competition with Qantas now that there are many more airlines flying into Australia-and a good thing, too. Australian Airlines Ltd will be competing in a more competitive environment, but that has nothing to do with the share ownership of Australian; it is to do with the proper policy of this Government to do with deregulation, which those opposite always fail to address. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a body of academic evidence that says that, with deregulation, the tendency to oligopoly in airline industries will create a problem with competition and that there is a tendency to monopoly. We might have to look at how we deal with that issue. That is what a substantial body of the academic evidence would say. Nevertheless, it is likely, at least in the short term and I hope in the longer term, that there will be enhanced competition as a result, but it has nothing to do with selling shares in any of those enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to deal with the question of whether it is inherently more efficient, and the evidence is mixed. We find in some of this library of evidence, which Senator Short failed to quote because it does not suit his argument, that the review of our public sector enterprise by Millward and Parker concludes that after an extensive and thorough review of many case studies:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no systematic evidence that public enterprises are less cost effective than private firms. The poorer performance, in this respect, exhibited in the studies of refuse collection and water supply . . . has to be balanced against the absence of any significant difference in Canadian railways and Australian airways and the superior performance in US electric power. </PARA>
<PARA>Another reviewer, Goodsell, whose work was published in New York, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, available comparative data on the efficiency, costs, and quality of services in refuse collection, hospitals, transportation, utilities, and insurance show that whereas at some times business seems superior, at other times government appears to perform better. In still other instances the two sectors do about equally. Hence the results of our survey are mixed but by no means convincingly supportive of the common contention that the private sector always functions better, even according to economic criteria. Moreover, evidence is available to show, perhaps surprisingly to some, that governmental bureaucracy may be less top heavy than private, is capable of impressive productivity gains, and can be just as innovative as private bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA>More recently an article in the Economic Journal, by Kay and Thompson, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it does not seem that there is anything intrinsically superior about performance under private ownership . . . There are efficient and inefficient public enterprises and efficient and inefficient private enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>That should not surprise any of us. The recent Australian evidence confirms all that. That is not surprising. In recent years the problem of prudential processes in the banking system has led to the Commonwealth Bank being a far superior performer to some of the private banks. But this is not to say that inherently and therefore public sector instrumentalities will always be more efficient. On the other hand, the State Bank of Victoria comes a long last in the banking sector. A whole lot of Australian private sector enterprise has a performance that is markedly inefficient. I do not have time to go through the list in detail, but Mr Hartnell's 16 is a good place to start the list of the companies which have failed to perform. It is not just a problem for the shareholders; it is a fundamental problem for the Australian economy and for all Australian citizens who share some of the burdens left over from the inadequacy of those performances. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a substantial body of evidence about the recent efficiency under the administration of this Government of both Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. Qantas was making virtually nothing in the five years prior to this Government assuming office. Since then it has been regularly providing dividends to the Government-in fact, a record dividend in 1988-89 and substantial dividends totalling $132.7m over the period as a whole. There has been a substantial effective performance by Qantas and also by Australian. Prior to the year when they took a substantial knock because of the pilots dispute, Australian had recorded an operating profit of $108m. This compares with the best year during the Opposition's term of office-$14m-and an average performance of $4m to $5m during its years in government. It is no wonder Opposition members want to sell those enterprises, because they could not run them. They do not need to worry, as they will not get the chance to do so in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition pretends that this matter is urgent. The only thing Senator Short's speech made eloquently clear was that the Opposition has no strategy. Let us look at the way in which the Opposition's last great advocate of this issue dealt with this matter. I refer to the former shadow Minister for privatisation, Mr Moore. Did he not make a wonderful declaration? I must say in Mr Moore's defence that it was a very honest statement. I think he said exactly what it was the Opposition intended to do, and that is why he was sacked. When talking about the Opposition's forthcoming privatisation program, if it won the election, Mr Moore said:</PARA>
<PARA> Professionals in Australia are really looking at the greatest Christmas party they have ever had. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that that would have been true. He went on to say how the Opposition intended to do this. He used Qantas as an example:</PARA>
<PARA> You'd get one of the 767s and a couple of executives, and some sort of video presentation and a couple of good-looking hostesses-</PARA>
<PARA>he is as sexist as Senator Short was in his speech-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and you would take this plane to Mt Isa and Darwin and God knows what . . . and take the local identities for a bit of a spin, and give them a spiel, a couple of shots and say, `There's 250,000 shares, and we want you Mr Solicitor, Mr Accountant, Mr Investor to distribute these, and we'll pay you a handling fee'. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on in his very open and honest way-but unfortunately for his political career a way that was not very popular with his colleagues because they do not like to talk about these things, for which he was sacked-to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . banks, brokers, lawyers and accountants at the big end of town will get another shot at the action: providing professional advice and services to the privatisation unit and privatising entities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>In every policy one needs to look at who will lose and who will benefit. In this policy it is very clear who will benefit-those at the top end of town, the professionals, and a few people who think that they can get some very big fat fees out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a long standing commitment-it used to be bipartisan-to the mixed economy. Senator Short did not refer to it. He talked about the inherent superior efficiency of the private sector. Although he did not produce any evidence of it whatsoever, he asserted that that argument had been had and won and that therefore he did not have to bother about it, and he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> No issue has been raised-not by Mr Moore, not by Mr Warwick Smith, the now shadow Minister, not by Senator Short and not by Dr Hewson-about the criteria that determine where we draw the line between the public and the private sector and why it is that enterprise A should be private and enterprise B should be public. Not a scintilla of intellectual rigour can be found. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know-although we do not all own up to it because it is not convenient if we want to say that everything ought to be is privatised-that there are very significant problems with market failure. There are known, longstanding and established grounds in every economic text book beyond Economics I, which talks about the wonderful neo-classical model as if it might actually exist. That does not always mean that the appropriate response to market failure is public ownership; I am not saying that it does. I am simply saying that we know that there is a very profound question of market failure in Australia as elsewhere and that governments need to be aware of that. People should not believe that first year text books in economics draw a model which, if it were true, would be wonderful. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems about monopoly, the imperfect market and externalities. There is the problem of the short time frame that often necessarily drives private investment decisions. That is not a criticism. It is often the very necessary raison d'etre of that private investment, but it is not always most appropriate for investment in areas such as infrastructure. There are problems of information. Perfect competitive models depend upon the presumption that perfect information will be available. Of course, that is very rarely the case. Sometimes it is dramatically not the case in ways that are significant and profound for the interests of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to contrast this Government's position with that of the Opposition's. The Government has often had to face up to the question of the appropriate balance, about where the line between the private and public sector should be drawn. This Government has appropriately made a large number of decisions-decisions which have never been faced up to before. It has not built a fence around the public sector and said, `What is must always remain'. Neither has it said, `There is no case for the public sector'. Rather, it has said that it is a matter for proper rigorous analysis, appropriate balance and sometimes action, where appropriate, when something is in the national interest; not where it is driven by a fire sale mentality of people desperate to try to paper over certain appalling Budget gaps. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a view that the Commonwealth Bank should remain in perpetuity in majority government ownership. Actually, that will not be debated next Monday; it is not on the agenda. </PARA>

<PARA> In conclusion, there is an important issue here, although Senator Short did not get to it. I am not sure that it is a matter of urgency; I am not sure that we really need to sit around here for two hours debating it. But if we were to do so, it would be substantially better than the debate on this rather stupid urgency motion before us. The important issues here are: what is the appropriate balance in a mixed economy; how do we set priorities and make choices in tough economic times? Nothing from the Opposition has ever addressed that question. The luxury of opposition means that one does not have to. That is all right. May those opposite continue to enjoy that luxury; I understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, there are tough decisions to be made. Happily, I am prepared to say, with absolute confidence, that nobody on Monday will be the slightest bit influenced by anything that is said by anybody in the Opposition, nor should they be either on the basis of objective merit, the weight of the argument or the source of the argument. Nothing will be aided by the vapid and the sort of pseudo-urgent arguments and the cheap stunts that we heard and witnessed today. </PARA>
<PARA> There are important questions about economic policy. There is the question of the future of the public sector. The way that investment is made in those things which remain in the public sector and in infrastructure is important. The way that we determine which of the existing public sector enterprises may not need to stay in public ownership is important. But it is about rigorous intellectual analysis of the criteria and what determines this. I have yet to hear one word from the Opposition about the criteria that determine what should or should not be in the public sector. All I have heard, without a scintilla of evidence, is that there is a library of argument that asserts this to be so and that Mr Gorbachev says that it is so. That, in itself, is not the world's most persuasive argument. The balance of academic argument does not inherently point in that direction. Sometimes it does, and those matters should be solved; sometimes it does not, and those matters should not.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very confident that the Senate will reject this urgency motion and, in so doing, it will treat it with the contempt it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA> Today's urgency motion was put forward by Senator Short. It is rather an ideological position but not one that is supported by a lot of rational thinking and rational argument. We are being asked to assume that private enterprise is necessarily efficient. We are being asked to assume that public enterprise is necessarily inefficient. It follows that all employees in private enterprise are wonderful and efficient, whereas employees in public enterprise are badly organised, lazy and so on. That is not only an extremely offensive proposition but also incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps Senator Short is not aware of the results put forward by OTC Ltd which were documented in a recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study that quite clearly stated that the cheapest international telephone service in the world is being provided not by a private enterprise company but by OTC, which is a well run publicly owned enterprise. It should be clear that efficiency is a function of management, not an ownership problem. Yet we find that the Opposition's policy document on deregulation and privatisation states:</PARA>
<PARA>Privatisation, because it increases competition, will lead to services for consumers which are cheaper, more efficient cost and which provide a wider choice. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short points to volumes in the library which attest to that particular proposition. I wonder if the gold lettering on the spines of those volumes reads: Bond, Skase, Connell, Herscu, Lowy-all exponents of efficient and successful private management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would suggest, mainly your backers, donors and proteges. Secondly, we are being asked to assume that competition necessarily always produces efficiency. Very clearly, competition is useful in some cases but certainly it is not essential. I cite again OTC and I again cite the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, which, as I have said before, has improved its efficiency, has shed 3,000 workers in the recent six months and is now able to provide electricity to Victorian citizens at a cost which is increasing at a rate well below the increases in the consumer price index. Privatisation is certainly not essential in all enterprises and in some it would be more costly. Certainly, duplication of capital investment, such as involved in Telecom Australia, would be disadvantageous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, I would like to advert to the corporate culture which in many cases, even if we have competition, produces the opposite result. Let us look at what happened to the influx of foreign banks. What sort of benefits did customers of banks-the borrowers-actually get in our banking sector from the influx of foreign banks? We have had an unprecedented level of interest rates. We have had services reduced to consumers and we have had other services for which consumers are being charged. Competition in the banking sector has not led to greater efficiency. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that. Senator Short says that there is a big library. I would like to hear in Senator Short's next speech some of the evidence he referred to but has not cited so far. As we are talking about the banking sector, perhaps we should advert to the Commonwealth Bank, founded by King O'Malley, as the people's bank. He would turn in his grave if he heard of Senator McMullan's decision to sell 30 per cent of it to the usurers. In its 1988-89 annual report, the Commonwealth Bank showed that it produced a 14 per cent return on average equity capital employed, which is well in excess of results turned in by the private banking sector. In addition, it paid a dividend of $110m-not small bickies and something that was achieved with good management. Yet, we want to throw that organisation into private competition with a sector which is performing more poorly than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at an example. If I own a block of flats and I find that the manager is not producing results or if that investment needs additional capital, I look at improvement to the management, I sack the manager and get somebody else, I borrow money or, if the returns are there, I do not sell the block of flats. Yet that is what we are being asked to do. We also need to look at why we should sell an enterprise that is producing adequate financial returns. We are being asked to sell a stream of dividends which is likely to give a return for years to come to the community as a whole. We are being asked to sell it at today's prices, at garage sale prices, to retire a debt in nominal terms at an interest rate which will not return, on the basis of the performance of the Commonwealth Bank, anything like the benefits that the community can expect to derive from its property. </PARA>
<PARA> I now advert to another reason which I noted Senator Short has not addressed at all: the community service obligations of enterprises which we are supposed to endorse to be sold off for the not proven efficiency and competition reasons. I mention just one that was not adverted to today: the National Acoustic Laboratories Hearing Centres, which are ready for the auction block. It has been shown quite clearly that some of the services-the assessment of children with hearing impairment-will not be carried out by anyone who is running the acoustic laboratory on a profit basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return once again to the Commonwealth Bank situation. I had occasion earlier this week to ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who represents the Treasurer (Mr Keating): Who will take care of the community service obligation of the Commonwealth Bank and will he ensure that they will be met? The Minister's answer was to categorise them as commercial decisions, rather than as community service obligations. I repeat that question: who will actually supply bank statements in braille? Clearly that is not a commercial decision. Very clearly that service will not turn a profit. Therefore, will we retain them or will we throw them away?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's position is to sell not only the airlines and the Commonwealth Bank but also OTC, Telecom, Medibank Private, Australian National Line, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation plus many other government enterprises. In addition, it also agrees with the Government's proposals to sell the Sydney-Moomba gas pipeline, the Housing Loans Insurance Commission and Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA> But why stop there? Why not privatise the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian National Museum or even Antarctica? Could I suggest that, if the Government is serious about the propositions it is putting forward, it might consider putting Mr Skase and Mr Lowy in charge of a totally privatised communications industry? What about Mr Bond in charge of a privatised navy in pursuit of the Iraqi cup? What about Mr Elliott in charge of a privatised Victorian health promotion foundation with particular responsibility to raise funds from the consumption of alcohol? What about Mr Connell being placed in charge of a privatised social security investment advice unit for pensioners? And so on. I have yet to see a cogently argued position by either the Opposition parties or the Government as the Government is doing its current back flip. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me advert to one other aspect which was brought up by Barry Jones and Duncan Kerr. They have proposed that we have a wealth inquiry to show clearly why the current trend towards the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer is happening. One of the factors they have identified is that privatisation will merely increase the skewed distribution of wealth in Australia: the 8 per cent of the community who are shareholders get the privilege of gilt edged investments and the other 92 per cent of the population get nothing except fewer services and higher bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to ask honourable senators: Do we really want to live in a society where every decision is made on the basis of dollars and cents, where every decision that adverts to social or cultural values is reduced to a balance sheet mentality without any concern for human values? I mention the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, which is another item that is on the auction block. At this stage we are only taking one step towards it. It is being corporatised and turned into a company limited by shares. What is to stop a future treasurer, or even this Treasurer, ringing the management and the directors of that company and saying, `Let us place 30 per cent, 40 per cent, or 60 per cent of your shares on the stock exchange.'?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me then ask honourable senators who may have a relative or close family member suffering from a disease that requires a particular serum what they would think if such a laboratory decided that since there were only about 100 cases in Australia the serum was not profitable and questioned why it should engage in research for medication that affects so few people. No doubt such a laboratory would instead engage in the production of the next edition of aspirin. That would have hundreds of thousands of users but, if there is a serum that addresses a particular complaint suffered by only a few people, one would think that a civilised and humane society would ensure that these people were given help. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle that because something is not profitable help cannot be provided is the very position that we are being asked to endorse. It is not too late for the Labor Government to reverse its direction; it is not too late for Senator Short to provide evidence for his position. Why should the richest in our society set the agenda? The only reason these measures will succeed is the rigidity of the Australian party political system. I suggest to the Australian Labor Party that it consider a conscience vote on the privatisation proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me respond to some comments made by Senator McMullan. I am pleased that at least we have a Minister sitting in the chamber at the moment, although no Minister will be participating in this debate-a very important debate about the future economic direction of this country. Senator McMullan said that he saw no reason why the Senate should have the opportunity to endorse Senator Short's motion. As elected members of the House of the people of Australia, we are more entitled to be debating a motion such as this, seeking endorsement, than the Australian Labor Party conference will be next Monday. We are at least elected representatives of the people of Australia. The conference next week will not be representative of the elected people of Australia. The position is that we are far more entitled to be making that judgment than the conference will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have the spectacle of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), duly elected for a three-year term, having to get on the telephone to ring around to 101 people in this country asking them whether as the elected Prime Minister he can pursue a policy direction that he and his Cabinet know is right for the people and the economy of Australia. What a debacle. What a situation when the duly elected Prime Minister has to make phone calls all around the country before he can pursue a policy line that is right for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to comment on the reference to examples. It has been asked, `Where are the examples of the efficiency of the private sector over that of the government sector?'. There are numerous such examples, but two come to mind readily. In South Australia, for example, at a time when we were closing hospital wards because of a lack of funds, the State Government was injecting $6 billion of taxpayers' money into buying tumble driers for the clothing factory, the laundry. Where are the priorities of government in that instance? In Queensland the private sector looks after our prisons, our correctional institutions, at a far cheaper rate than any government instrumentality can do in any State in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the priorities that are being put in place to save taxpayers' dollars so they can be put into the area of the provision of essential services for people-education, health, and the like. We need to get back to the priorities of government expenditure. Government enterprises in many States in Australia lost a total of $2 billion in the course of the last financial year. That money ought to be directed to the areas of priority for which governments are elected-the provision of essential services for people. It should not be out in the marketplace competing unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably. Taxpayers dollars are not collected to do that; they are there to provide essential services for people. It is about time we got those priorities right. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you will understand, as do my colleagues, that it gives me a lot of pleasure to participate in the debate on this urgency motion today. Five years down the track, I might happen to have the last laugh. Having put privatisation on the Australian political agenda in 1985 in the lead-up to and during the South Australian election campaign, nothing gives me greater pleasure in 1990 than to see that stance, that core of political philosophy, starting to be vindicated right across the political spectrum. It seems right that I am in Canberra, in the Senate, to witness what through those years has been a policy embraced and about to be acted on by my opposition, a Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ones that opposed it-and, what is more, led by none other than Mr Hawke and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the very men who in 1985 called privatisation a `vandalistic splurge' and a `disastrous experiment'. The scare campaign which Keating and Hawke ran with such fervour against privatisation in 1985 undoubtedly cost my Party seats in that State election campaign. So there has been naturally for me an added pleasure in watching the Labor Party squirm, duck and weave over the crucial issue of selling shares in government instrumentalities such as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd, and its contortions over Telecom Australia. There is, of course, also additional anger about the many years over which the Australian public and the Australian economy have been deprived of the benefits of such sales as policy because of the intransigent view and stance of the Labor Party until now. While I am sure that there are many in the community shocked at the stark turnaround in political philosophy that we have seen from the Prime Minister and his Deputy, I for one am gratified that they have at last so publicly admitted the correctness of the policy direction and the error of their ways of the past. At the same time, it does not do to dwell on how many other Liberal policies they have ridiculed over the years which ought to be in place and which we could have benefited from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the meantime, I certainly welcome the Labor Party's change of stance on an issue so essential to the future of the Australian economy. Make no mistake about it; it is essential. We are a nation in trouble, and it is to be hoped that what the Labor Party decides on as its brand of privatisation next Monday will not be far too little, too late. We should take this opportunity to welcome the Labor Party to the real world of twentieth century politics, where it is patently wrong to cling to old values and outmoded philosophies, of which public ownership is most obviously one. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990, being anti-privatisation is so outmoded that even Mikhail Gorbachev has spurned it for Russia, saying succinctly last month, 'We'll be phasing out state property'. In Russia private farming plots that are being converted from communal plots are becoming 40 times more efficient as soon as the private people have responsibility for production on that land. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the area of housing. Fidel Castro is privatising public housing in Cuba, as is Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom. If public housing is being privatised in such political extremes as Cuba and the United Kingdom, why are we not doing it here in Australia? Why are we not giving citizens who over their whole lifetimes have been paying rent for public housing the opportunity to buy that housing for themselves? That is where the policy direction has been wrong in the past and that is why it needs changing. That is why privatisation is the right policy direction for the future of this country and for individuals, the people whom the Australian Democrats supposedly stand up for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen that time and time again. We had from the Democrats the analogy of a block of flats-that one would not sell a block of flats just because it was not going well. They seem to misunderstand that the private sector has a discipline. It is called 30 June. If one has not made a profit by 30 June one does not stay in business. So there is a discipline-a discipline to manage properly and efficiently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But in the government sector if an organisation does not happen to make it by 30 June it is not sold up; it gets another injection of taxpayers' funds to keep it rolling on for another year. There is no discipline in the government sector such as we have in the private sector. That is the very real and fundamental difference between the two philosophical stances and policy directions. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, with $2m of taxpayers' funds down the drain already over the course of the last year or so, we need to rethink that policy direction. Particularly with taxes so high, as they are in this country, if we are going to relieve the burden on all ordinary Australians, we need to get the policy direction right. That policy direction means looking after and providing essential services for people, and getting out of the way, off the back of and not competing unfairly with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> If Russia can recognise that clinging to history is no way to tackle a competitive and difficult economic future, what has taken Australia's Labor Party so long to accept the inevitable? It is unfortunate that, in all the emotion of the Government's sell-off decision making and its most public factional pain at the reversal of policy, what privatisation brings to our economy has, unfortunately, largely been forgotten. Put simply, it revitalises it. It cannot be denied that Australia is one of the last major industrialised economies in the world to recognise and act on that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Most other governments have accepted, long before Australia, that it is government's role not to provide all services but, instead, to ensure that they are provided. To honour social justice obligations, governments obviously must provide those essential services, and with excellence. But, most importantly, they should then get out of the service arena, get off the agenda of service providing in that area. That is central to achieving a lean and efficient public sector, and it is essential to remove the tax burden from all and ordinary Australians. Government must be freed from the burdens of running businesses which belong in private hands. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not enough that governments ensure that the private sector provides all but the essential services. After all, not even Labor's left wing has a valid argument against the fact that private companies operating in competition operate more efficiently, more productively, and provide far better service to consumers than do public enterprises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen to the Democrats going on. They have had their opportunity to participate in this debate and they have not put up one logical argument against the move that this motion asks the Senate to support in terms of privatisation of these major instrumentalities. On the other hand, public monopolies have a well-recognised tendency to entrench inefficiencies and to foster the wasteful misallocation of increasingly scarce public resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Take Telecom as a glaring example of why privatisation is necessary for the good of the public purse. Its inability to satisfy customer demands or to deal with customer complaints is legendary. Telecom is ranked by Australian business people as the worst public utility in terms of repairs, performance and responsiveness to customers. As well, its lack of productivity is set out in figures which indicate that it has 60 per cent more employees per unit of service than 12 other leading telephone enterprises around the world. It has been estimated that competitive reforms would save users at least 15 per cent of their present costs, some $1,050m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the airlines, it only takes a look at the global picture to see that just six of the world's largest airlines out of a total of 35 remain government owned. Even if the Government wants to own airlines, the taxpayers of Australia simply cannot afford it. We cannot, for example, sit back and watch Qantas, without doubt one of the world's best airlines, deteriorate to a second-rate operation with outmoded equipment and planes-which it will do without a massive injection of capital, capital which we do not have without the involvement of private enterprise. Where do the taxpayers of Australia find ways to deal with company debt of $3 billion and the need to inject more than $1 billion a year? The Government is in no economic position to continue supporting Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, we already have a foreign debt level so crippling that it takes the equivalent of $250 from each household in Australia each month just to pay the interest on it. We cannot pay our way as it is, and yet the Democrats are suggesting that we ought to compound the problem with their policy direction. There is simply no public money for capital injection into Qantas. Similarly, Australian Airlines needs $4 billion if it is to upgrade and compete successfully after deregulation. In other words, it needs a capital base unavailable to it as a government owned operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the airline problems, there is a quote which stays in my mind from 1985, when from the sayings of Paul Keating came the following:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth. We are about refurbishing them and keeping them strong. We are not about wrecking them and selling them. The great public services they provide will continue to be provided while ever this Government has the breath to defend them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is ironic, is it not, especially when considering the airlines, that what has happened is exactly the opposite of those words of but five years ago. Australia cannot afford to refurbish them. To keep them public would be to wreck them. To sell them is to make them strong. Life and politics have moved on. It is therefore to be hoped that next Monday's Labor privatisation conference will ratify the Prime Minister's most sensible desire to sell off all of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas. I hope he is successful in achieving that aim. Selling anything less than all of Australian Airlines would be to further cripple the public purse. </PARA>

The Liberal and National parties are showing all the classic signs of having been too long in opposition-a situation they are likely to occupy for much longer-and are showing the frustrations and the obvious disappointments. This is now reflected in an essentially negative approach to politics. It is very much like the Australian Labor Party in the 1950s and 1960s. The coalition simply reacts to the agenda that the Labor Government establishes. It reacts to determinations of the Government. Ministers now even take questions in this chamber about the determinations of the Caucus of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. Honourable senators opposite have no alternative view-none whatsoever. All we hear are absolute platitudes and slogans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we ask what the coalition would do, there are a few reasonable guides. We could look at recent history, at the coalition's own words. We could look at the Fraser years from 1975 to 1983. We could look at Mr Moore, as Senator McMullan did a little earlier. We could look at the experience of the only conservative government at a State level, the GreinerMurray Government, or we can look at the slogans on privatisation. I turn to the Fraser years, and for this I am indebted to my colleague Senator Walsh for his analysis in the Australian Financial Review. He said that the Fraser years may best be judged on two essential criteria, the macro-economic performance as reflected in Budgets and its approach on micro-economic issues. I think they are fair criteria on which to judge the Fraser years. On expenditure, for example, six of seven Fraser Budgets increased expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP); that is the record of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> To 1982-83-the last Fraser-Howard Budget-expenditure had reached 28.9 per cent as a proportion of GDP; compared with the previous Labor Budget of 1975 when it was 24.1 per cent of GDP; or compared with the current Budget of the Hawke Government when it is 23.7 per cent of GDP. That is a fair contrast. In 1987 under the Labor Government, the Budget moved into surplus for the first time since 1953-something the coalition was never able to do; it was not even able to approach that in the most remote manner. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no coalition performance at all in terms of an macro-economic basis and no performance at all in terms of electoral responsibility. Virtually everything the Fraser Government did was electorally driven. It was all targeted upon the very next election-all predicated on votes-as seen in 1981 when Treasury Secretary, John Stone, was actually applauding the blow-out in imports. The 1980 election was the hurdle he had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition had absolutely no performance in micro-economic reform. It is a pity it did not show some sense of urgency when it was in government. Let us look at the record of micro-economic reform when the coalition was in government. Consistently, determinations were made that inhibited or prohibited the process: the reaffirmation of the two-airline agreement and increasing tariffs, including those on passenger motor vehicles. There was no labour market reform whatsoever-not even attempted. There was no reform in the ports or in shipping. None in the maritime industries at all. Look how the Opposition has gone silent when its record is examined. Look how it is absolutely silent. There was no tax reform and there was no financial deregulation. That was the coalition's record. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare that with the record of the Hawke Government which is outstanding, because it happens to be built upon a strategy. For example, there is a three-year program for waterfront reform, to close the competitive gap between the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and our maritime industries, leading to a reduction in the work force of 20 per cent by 1992. By 1992 the average crew level in Australian ships will be that of the OECD. Already there has been a reduction of 25 per cent in the work force. There are 13 ships on the Australian coast already operating under the rationalised strategy adopted by the Maritime Industries Development Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Shipping Industry Reform Authority is developing further efficiencies cooperatively with the ACTU, the relevant unions and the relevant business enterprises. That is an important distinction between the coalition and the Government-a process of cooperation against a process of confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Commission is active in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle, Botany Bay and Melbourne. There is waterfront reform in three areas. There is restructuring in stevedoring, Federal-State consultations on interfacing between road transport and the waterfront, and the Prices Surveillance Authority has also been active. </PARA>
<PARA> When in government the coalition had absolutely no performance to speak of on micro-economic reform, including the two years when it had absolute majorities in both Houses of this Parliament; when Malcolm Fraser, to use Billy Hughes's classic expression, could have put pen to paper and written the law of the Commonwealth of Australia, and nothing happened. Let me refer to something that is perhaps a little more contemporary than the Fraser years. I refer to an article in the Business Review Weekly dated 23 February 1990 in which John Moore outlined the coalition's policy on micro-economic reform. Two quotes will suffice to show what the coalition was about. The first states:</PARA>

That begs the question of who would benefit under the conservative's policy. Not ordinary Australians for a moment. Certainly not working people. They do not even figure in the coalition's thinking-not for a moment. They never have and they never will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the national interest, the policies of the Labor Government are the policies to follow. In terms of the special interest, it is the policies of the coalition. Those close to the conservatives can always expect to benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the Government's initiative on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is that that decision has been taken. It was taken by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Caucus on a recommendation from the Treasurer. Senator Short is simply wrong to say it is on the agenda for next Monday. I presided over the meeting of the National Executive of the Australian Labor Party at which the resolution to which Senator Short has been referring was adopted, and the Commonwealth Bank is not contained therein. It has been decided. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the `faceless men' remark-how on earth can a conference that is probably going to be broadcast live, if not telecast live by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, be said to be faceless with several hundred media present not only from Australia but also internationally?</PARA>
<PARA> The problem that the coalition has-particularly the Liberal Party-is that our conferences actually mean something. They make determinations that mean something. They have a democratic function. They are part of the political process. It is going to be a great honour to preside over the conference next Monday. The problem Senator Short has is that of contrasting our conferences, which are part of a democratic process-that actually have a function and a series of democratic objectives-with the Liberal Party conferences, where all of note is John Elliott swaggering around like some Antipodean Emperor Jones. The coalition's conferences mean nought. That is the great contrast. Our conference is a serious policy forum and its decisions matter. There is no greater indictment of the Opposition than the observations that Laurie Oakes made in today's Bulletin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Short for inviting me to quote it. I shall. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has prepared a paper on ways to improve proceedings in the House of Representatives, and discussed it with Liberal leader John Hewson. The proposals include the introduction of electronic voting and rostering ministers for Question Time. Having watched the way Parliament has operated in recent weeks, I have a suggestion for more fundamental reform. It seems to me it would be a good idea to have a group of MPs, designated 'The Opposition,' whose role would be to ask probing questions, expose the government's shortcomings and attack it when it makes mistakes. Hawke, however, might find it difficult to get Hewson's agreement for such a change. </PARA>
<PARA>One could say the same about this proposition before the chamber today. Just look at the record of the coalition in government and in Opposition, through Mr Moore; or the Greiner-Murray Government, where a surplus of $34m announced by a Premier and Treasurer that actually turns out to be a deficit of some $600m. That is really creative accounting. That is worthy of Qintex Australia. Micro-economic reform for the Greiner-Murray Government has been nothing other than redundancies for working people. The burden has fallen in total on working people. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of micro-economic reform, and industrial relations in this country, we have taken a great many restrictions out of the workplace already. We have a wages policy, which the coalition lacks. The coalition is utterly bankrupt of a wages policy. We have a program for union rationalisation and restructuring of the trade union movement to cut some 300 Federal unions to 20 by the end of the decade. The Opposition does not even attempt to approach the issues. Again, there is absolute and utter silence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a program for award restructuring which means something on the shop floor to working people, to management, to the business sector and, overall, to the national interest. The action on the Commonwealth Bank was necessitated by the problems being experienced by the State Bank of Victoria. The action has been taken. There is no doubt about the capital needs of both Australian Airlines and Qantas. Both bodies require a capital injection and that is what we are about doing. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), speaking recently in the House of Representatives on the Opposition's lack of an alternative, said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's position on this issue of privatisation? It is to sell Telecom, OTC, Aussat, Qantas, Australian Airlines and the Australian National Line. Its policy is to sell all the government business enterprises simultaneously. That means something like $30-35 billion worth of assets will be dumped on the Australian market, and this is supposed to constitute a policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposition ought to be rejected by the Senate. It is ill-conceived and it should be stillborn. It is so badly drafted that it constitutes a non sequitur of an argument. The Senate ought to debate these matters in a rational and deliberate way. The national interest demands it. This proposition does not afford us a useful basis on which that debate might proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this debate is simply to allow the elected representatives of Australia to signify, in the very clearest of terms, that it is in the interests of the nation that shares in Australian Airlines Ltd, Qantas Airways Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia be sold. We were hoping, and we still do hope, that the Senate, as a body of elected people, will take this opportunity to signify very clearly that it does, as a majority, support this particular view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not particularly expect the Australian Democrats to do it because we know that they are adopting the cheap political tactic of trying to pick up the votes of the 10 or 12 per cent of people in Australia who still believe in these old socialist views. The Democrats are trying to capture that end of the market so that their current fairly poor vote might get a little bit better and they might get a few extra per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> But we are hoping that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) will use this debate to signify clearly its support for privatisation of Australian Airlines, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. It is very clear that the majority of Australians believe in this and genuinely want the efficiency and competition that privatisation will bring. </PARA>
<PARA> Privatisation was a key plank in the coalition's Economic Action Plan at the last election, a plan which was endorsed by over 50 per cent of Australians quite deliberately, as was shown in the election result. This policy was enunciated very particularly in terms which would have seen privatised, among other things, the two airlines and the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy took into account the fact that rates of return on the capital invested in public trading enterprises are significantly lower than those in the corporate trading sector. Resources are thus inefficiently tied up in public enterprises, predominantly in the areas of transport and communication. When such essential services are not provided in the most efficient manner, Australian businesses and households suffer through higher prices and inadequate standards of service. </PARA>
<PARA> A privatisation program should be motivated by principles that there should be a clear benefit to the consumer taxpayer, that the employees should be offered the option of buying shares in the enterprise on a preferential basis, that the quality and availability of the service is maintained to remote areas, that the program be carried out gradually with a thorough investigation of the options, and that monopoly rights of the enterprise should not be maintained in order to enhance the sale price. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last election our privatisation proposals were opposed by the ALP. It appears that the policies of the ALP were then the plaything of non-elected representatives who had no idea of what was best for Australia. Prior to the election the ALP had this to say about privatisation. On 17 March Senator Childs said:</PARA>
<PARA> We affirm our opposition to privatisation in all of its forms. We know that this opposition is shared throughout the whole of the Labor movement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA> What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national enterprises, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas?</PARA>
<PARA>But since the election there has been overwhelming support from the Government side for privatisation, as the Government struggles from economic crisis to economic crisis, to such an extent that the Government has now found that Australia's future depends on micro-economic reform, which includes the efficiency and competition that privatisation will bring. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and most of their Cabinet colleagues, including the front bench in this chamber, roundly supporting privatisation. What a turnaround by the Prime Minister, when he said in July of this year:</PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the ALP-</PARA>
<PARA>have got to ask themselves whether it is the best use of scarce resources to fund airlines, which means if you do that, there's less funds available to fund obligations towards private citizens . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Now we even have the Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss, who is not renowned for making any decisions at all, coming out today in support of the Beazley Clayton's privatisation proposal for Telecom, saying that the competition would do a lot of good. The massive injection of funds that are needed to enable Qantas and Australian Airlines, for example, to compete on equal terms in a very competitive market requires funds, as Mr Hawke said, that Australia simply does not have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The only way that these scarce funds can be got is by pinching money from the pensioners and that is what the Government has done in the Budget. It is pinching money from people who paid taxes all of their lives and who should in their aged times get more and more, rather than less and less. Or are we going to fund these inefficient government enterprises by cutting defence spending, which also happened in the Budget, when we should be spending more on defence, using the defence forces for the peacekeeping roles that we are being called upon to support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of spending money on propping up these inefficient government enterprises, the Government will probably want to save the few extra bob that it can to pay unemployment benefit to the enormous number of people that are going to be unemployed in the next 12 months as a result of its actions. </PARA>
<PARA> A privatised airline in Qantas and Australian would bring better business decisions in an area which I am familiar with, and that is far north Queensland, in helping both the overseas tourist market and the internal market. It would help these businesses by giving them sufficient resources and independent business initiatives to take the routes and timetables that hitherto were not available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention that a government-owned airline in my area had to cut back on services to the north and northwest because it did not have the resources to properly fund those services. And who took its place? The Democrats were here asking for some examples. They are not here now; they never are. They asked for some examples and here is one. The government-owned airline could not afford to fund services in northern and north-western Queensland. What happened? It got out of it. But someone came in to replace it. It was a privately funded, privately managed airline that had the wherewithal and the expertise to do it, and it is doing it very well. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for privatisation, with the improved efficiency and greater competition it brings, is clearly understood amongst the economists, business leaders and elected representatives of this nation; it is understood by most of the front bench senators of this chamber. It is important that we take this opportunity today to express, in the clearest terms, our support as elected representatives for the sale of shares in these government businesses. It must be done as a matter of urgency because this is on the eve of a conference being called by people not elected by Australians, at which they will try to force their minority view on the elected Parliament of this nation. The people who are leading the charge against privatisation are, of course, the union bosses who are not elected by the Australian public or, if the Cooke inquiry is to be believed, by too many other people either. They are against competition. </PARA>
<PARA> On Monday we had the spectacle of the Government, at the behest of the union bosses, effectively removing choice and competition from the union movement by laying the groundwork for the abolition of many unions which were serving the interests of their members. The union bosses do not want privatisation, because they understand that privatisation would involve better relationships between the managers and the workers and it would involve profit sharing, which means workers getting part of the dividends and profits that would result from the efficiency and productivity of privatisation. If the workers are part owners of these businesses-this is proposed in our policy and I understand that it is part of the policy being proposed by the right wing of the Labor Party-then what is left for the unions? It is quite simple that in these instances the union bosses would be without a job. So it is really a matter of saving their empires. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McLean, the Queensland President of the ALP and one of the leading unionists in the telecommunications industry, has led the charge against privatisation and deregulation because he knows that the power now held by people like him would diminish enormously if Telecom were privatised. He has examples of that with Metway Bank Ltd and Power Brewing because he realises that the unions become irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McLean talks of the Party being railroaded on privatisation by Cabinet. He says that `government initiatives are increasingly coming from bureaucrats and textbook economists instead of the rank and file'. If this is true, then this is one occasion that Australia can say, `Thank heavens for the bureaucrats and textbook economists'. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government should be governing from this Parliament, not from some conference room where matters are being dealt with by non-elected people. These backroom operators, these unelected power brokers, these faceless men are not elected by anyone at all but they are going to try to tell the Government's elected representatives what they should do. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) knows what he should do. He has made a decision with his colleagues in the Cabinet leadership that he should privatise these enterprises. But these unelected people are coming along and they will try to stand over the Government and tell it that it cannot privatise them. Is that not what the conference is all about? These people want to tell the Government that it cannot do what it knows to be the best for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This urgency motion was brought on today to give Government members the opportunity of having the support so that they can go to their conference shored up with some backbone. This will enable members of the Government to go along and say, `All the elected people of Australia support privatisation. We do not want minority unelected groups trying to tell us, the elected representatives, how we should govern this country'. That is what this urgency motion is all about. It is urgent and has to be dealt with today to give the Government a bit of backbone, which it does not seem to have, to make the decision. The Government cannot make the decision in Parliament; it has to run down the road and beg other people for permission to do what it knows is right. That is what this debate is all about. The Opposition is trying to help the Government. For once the Government has done the right thing. The Australian Democrats will not do it, because they are trying to get the cheap votes that the Government used to get. The Opposition is trying to give the Government the support that will allow it to go ahead and privatise. The Government knows it is right; we know it is right; and all of Australia knows it is right. This elected chamber should give the Government that backing so that it can go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Senate as a whole to indicate its support for this motion for the selling of the shares in these enterprises because we all know that that is what is needed for the good of this nation. </PARA>

Public enterprises, as they now exist, at least have the merit that the Parliament and the people, through the Parliament, can have some influence on them. Those opposite want to put the control of these enterprises in the hands of people over whom nobody has any control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting to see how this motion has been framed. Members of the Opposition are not asking that control of these enterprises be given to the people or to the shareholders. This motion does no more than require that shares in these enterprises be sold. What does that do? That does not privatise or give control of these enterprises across. Why is this motion so subtly framed? If those opposite are so courageous in what they want to do, why do they not say, `All right, we want to privatise. We want to give control of these bodies across to somebody other than the government business enterprises'. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators who have spoken on the other side why they have confined this to only the passing over of shares. Why do they not come out and say, `We want to pass control of these enterprises across'? Why are they so shy? Those opposite know better than anyone that shareholding does not give control. Shareholding and control and management of companies are absolutely divorced. Yet those opposite come in here and are not even able to grasp and to grapple with the very proposition that they then argue for. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Standing Orders do not allow us to amend a motion to debate a matter of urgency, which is a bit of a pity because if we could do, so we would perhaps put the terms of the motion more into accord with what the Opposition has argued today. What Opposition senators have really tried to do today is to somehow embarrass the Government and say that the Government has a party machinery which it should not have. Is the fact of the matter that they take absolutely no notice of the people who elect them to parliament? Is it a matter of fact that they take no notice of the party machinery that they set up? Is it a matter of record that their President in Victoria has no ability to determine who will be members of parliament and who will not? Is my mate Roger Shipton able to say that it was only members of parliament that had anything to do with his being unseated? Is Ian Macphee able to say that it was only members of parliament that unseated him in the seat of Goldstein?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be struggling, but it simply indicates that a party machinery is set up to determine a policy and to run a party and everybody adheres to it, irrespective of whether it is the National Party in Queensland, the Liberals in Victoria under their present President, Mr Kroger, or the Labor Party here. It is a matter of record that a party machinery has been set up to determine who shall represent that party in parliament. That is done, may I say, with some force in Victoria and without any regard to the niceties of the situation. It was done with a very heavy hand in Queensland for years. Yet honourable senators opposite come in here and say, `Because you want to discuss this matter with your Party and various sections of the community, your policy is determined by that'. It is simply nonsense to say that party machineries, party structures, have nothing to do with the people elected to this place and the policies they adopt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite ought to understand that the forums of the Australian Labor Party are the most open of any political party of Australia. Its policies are advertised, and its councils are open to the press. The people of Australia know how the system works and they have voted the Labor Party in again and again during the 1980s. With all the objections that those opposite make, the fact of the matter is that we are sitting on the treasury bench and the people of Australia understand that that is what is best for Australia. They understand that the processes of the Party have produced the best policies, the best structures, to govern Australia and that is how they will continue for some time to come. It is nonsense and not to the point to talk about the faceless men, a rhetoric from the Cold War which, it may come as some surprise to those opposite, has now finished. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter of urgency is based on certain propositions, either implied or explicit. The first is that micro-economic reform is of fundamental importance to the national interest. Nobody would deny that. The second proposition is that improved efficiency is a key element in that reform. Nobody would deny that. The next proposition is that greater competition is a key element in that reform. That is a thing that Opposition members might want to discuss. If they did not confine their discussions to the party room, they might find that that does not follow as a matter of proposition. This very day Ross Gittins ran an article in the Sydney Morning Herald headed `The Big Four are laughing all the way'. He talks about the effect that competition has had on the banking industry in this country. As I understand it, those opposite say that what has been happening in the banking industry has been for the good of Australia, and the fact that people are now unable to get loans and there are so many disasters in the financial industry is a good thing. They say that it must be a good thing because it comes from competition. That is the result of their proposition and it is palpably wrong. To make the ideologically base statement that greater competition is a key element in that reform is just not right. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth proposition on which this matter of urgency is based is that the selling of shares in the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Australian Airlines is part of major micro-economic reform and will lead to greater competition. How the selling of shares can achieve that, I do not know. </PARA>

What comes from the way the Opposition has conducted the debate is this: private control will bring about a reform. That is what the Opposition is trying to say. One of the great complaints from the other side in respect of micro-economic reform is the waterfront. People say that if there is any area that ought to be reformed it is the waterfront. The waterfront, from go to whoa, is in private hands. No government has control of the waterfront. The stevedoring companies are all privately owned. Yet the Opposition says that the waterfront is in need of reform. What is the Opposition's position? Is its position that it is in need of reform or that, on the basis of its ideology, it must be one of the most productive industries in Australia because it is in private hands? The Opposition has not clarified that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the television industry which is another industry that has come into private hands. Is everybody happy that the television industry is privately owned-with shares held privately and under private control? Yet those opposite put forward that sort of industry as a model. Does the Opposition want to convert Telecom Australia into the waterfront? Does it want to convert Telecom into the television industry? Is that what the Opposition is on about? Or should the Opposition be doing what this Government is doing, and that is, in cooperation with the union movement, those who support it and the people of Australia generally, looking at each industry to see not whether it ought to be privatised but whether or not it ought to be made more efficient and can be improved so as to deliver both goods and services to Australia in a better form than is the case presently. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this Government has been about since it has been in office. It has achieved magnificent reforms in the taxation system and in education. On the question of training and education, the Opposition says that all the reforms will be brought about by selling the shares of the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Australian Airlines. The Opposition says that that will bring about fundamental or major economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators opposite might address themselves to such questions as education, the training of the work force, the skilling of management, the building of a culture of cooperation between employee and management, a building up of a keener appreciation of the need to find markets both at home and abroad, and the need to make sure that people who go through this period of economic reform do so without being too badly damaged in terms of their employment and income. They are the sorts of issues that senators opposite might have turned their minds to, rather than saying that all this happiness and joy will be brought about by selling some shares-through the Stock Exchange; I cannot think of how else one might do it. The more one discusses this matter, the more one comes to the question that faces us. At a time when we have a conference coming on next Monday which is of some importance, and when we are talking about micro-economic reform and privatisation, the one issue which senators opposite think is important is the question of whether we are going to sell some shares. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In the five minutes remaining for this debate, I would like to draw together some of the threads that have been put forward today. First, I would point out the extraordinary situation that on a matter that really goes to the core of Labor Party policy-making, decision-making, the whole structure of the Party and the whole traditions of the Party, not one Minister participated in this debate. It is pretty easy, though, to understand why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason that no Minister participated in this debate is that most of the Government front bench in the Senate are delegates to next Monday's conference, where they will be put to the test as to whether they support the policies thrashed out within their own Cabinet ranks. They did not have the guts today to come in and muster any arguments at all. It is worth noting that delegates to next Monday's conference include: Senator Button and Senator Gareth Evans-Leader and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate-and Senator Richardson, the numbers man who is trying to get the numbers and who claims he has the numbers for a policy decision vote at conference on Monday, which is the opposite of what the Labor Party is going to vote in the Senate this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Today is an historic occasion for the Senate. Never before have the members of any government party been unable to muster sufficient numbers within their own ranks to support a vote which supports the policy of their own government. That is unique. Government senators are about to vote on a motion which is supportive of what I understand to be the policy of the Labor Government and a policy that the Labor Party is trying to get introduced through changing its platform on Monday. That is what the conference is all about, and that is what the Labor Party has been wheeling and dealing about for days. </PARA>
<PARA> It is equally extraordinary that there has been no back bench support throughout this debate today. I do not recall any backbencher having been here for more than five minutes on the Government side. That is indicative of the problems that this Party has. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish briefly to address this document relating to the schedule of special purpose flights in the Department of Defence. It details for 1988 and 1989 the flights of the so-called VIP fleet of defence aircraft. We have had to wait much longer than we ought to have waited for the tabling of this document, which covers two complete years of VIP flights. We should get these reports much more frequently. Twice a year would be a reasonable basis on which the schedule of such flights should be tabled in this place so that we can at least keep up to date with the use of VIP aircraft and at least know to what extent the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is using them as a taxi between his Canberra residence and his electorate. Certainly the first point to be made about this document is the excessive amount of time that has elapsed between the tabling of the last schedule and the present one. </PARA>
<PARA> There is perhaps a more significant point than that. I have perused this document to some extent this afternoon and it seems to me to contain a number of errors. I notice, for instance, that a VIP flight on which a number of members and senators were transported from Canberra to Melbourne and thence to Adelaide on the Friday of the Budget week sitting of 1989 when the first elements of the airline pilots dispute began does not appear, so far as I can ascertain, in this document. I refer to a flight of the Boeing 707 which carried a large number of passengers and I can find no reference to that flight in this document. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, a number of flights appear to have been undertaken during the period of the airline pilots dispute, which did not commence until August. They are included in this document as having taken place on 14 April 1989-some four months or so before the dispute even began. Therefore, it appears that there are further significant inaccuracies not only by way of omission but also by way of commission in terms of incorrect dates being applied to certain VIP flights. A much improved effort is required with regard to the tabling of this schedule in future. This should happen first in respect of the timeliness of tabling and its frequency but, more importantly, as to the accuracy of information contained therein. The flights that seem to have the wrong dates applying to them appear between pages 217 and 221 of the document. I direct the Minister's attention to those pages in particular and seek an explanation as to why those errors appear. I should also like to have an explanation for the omission of at least one flight of which I am aware that is not included in the document, and there may well be other flights of which I am not aware. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to spend a few moments on this report. In part, I agree with what Senator Chapman said, but in part I disagree. He made the comment that these reports should appear in the Parliament more frequently. I have no argument with that, but I would embellish it by saying that the special purpose flights should be held more frequently. I have been one of the beneficiaries of such flights, and we were most appreciative of the special purpose flights last year when the pilots of this country went somewhat off the track and engaged in their act of kamikaze. The special purpose flights were a boon to those of us who have to travel great distances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal Australian Air Force did a tremendous job in moving not only members of parliament around the country but also many other citizens, residents and travellers throughout this great nation of ours. As a person who as recently as last Sunday had the benefit of one of those special purpose flights, I can say that I really appreciate the liberalisation that has taken place under this Government. We, in Western Australia, rather than having to leave home at about 10.30 or 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning in order to get to Canberra by Monday for parliamentary sittings, are now in a position of being able to leave at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. This gives us an opportunity to spend some little time with our families, to play our parental role and to be spouses. That is one very great benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> When I say that I benefited last Sunday, I should point out that we did not get a special purpose flight all the way from Perth to Canberra. We picked up a commercial flight out of Perth at 5.30 in the afternoon, Western Australian time, and were met at Melbourne Airport by a special purpose flight. This got us into Canberra just after midnight Canberra time. The trials and tribulations of arriving somewhat late in the evening are certainly offset by the fact that one is able to spend a little bit of extra time in one's home State or electorate with one's family and, indeed, even catch up, as I did, with some constituent work and meetings. I am particularly grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I would be drawing too long a bow if I, on behalf of all Western Australian members of parliament, commended the Government for the manner in which it has, over a number of years now, liberalised the conditions for which special purpose aircraft are being used. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention one of those liberalisations, on which a former Leader of the Opposition in this place once spoke. I believe that on one occasion former Senator Chaney said that under a previous Government-I certainly hope that I am not doing him an injustice here-only Ministers could travel on such flights and that backbenchers were prohibited from doing so. As a backbencher, I am more than happy to be able to partake in that service which is available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> These special purpose flights also provide valuable training to the pilots in the Royal Australian Air Force. They can get their hours up while doing a very real service rather than the bumps and jumps they have to do at the RAAF airports around the country. Getting their hours up helps them get their qualifications. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) on the presentation of its report. While some people in this place attack industry leaders, I believe the AMLC does a very fine job in very difficult circumstances of trying to represent the interests of the meat and livestock industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go through a number of comments relating to meat exports that are of concern. The changing circumstances in both the Middle East and Europe will have significant consequences in respect of the demand and market for Australian meat, particularly beef and mutton. </PARA>
<PARA> I start with beef. I am concerned that there is the danger that the European Community might break its agreement not to release subsidised beef into Pacific Rim markets. This would have a terrible consequence for Australian primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that we still seem to have substantial levels of subsidy in the European Community when it comes to beef. From figures available to me it appears that there is still a 25 per cent difference between the administered price and the producer price for beef in 12 European Community countries. This raises a matter of grave concern, which is: What are we, as a nation, doing when it comes to trade negotiations? I have had a number of discussions with various people, including at least one ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA> Those discussions have highlighted one fact and one fact very clearly-that the other primary producing nations of the world look upon Australia as a leader in trade negotiations. Those primary producing countries looked with a sense of dismay at the Government's approach to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, in which the Government went in, having made unilateral reductions in the level of tariffs, with the consequence that we did not have any bargaining chips. </PARA>
<PARA> I know for a fact that at least one ambassador went to the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) and begged him not to go into the Uruguay Round, having made those unilateral reductions. If, as a consequence of that, we suffer particular problems with tariffs and continuing European Community subsidies, the Government will have to bear the condemnation of primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I also address the matter of mutton and live sheep exports. That is also of importance. Last year we saw a reduction in the value to this country of live sheep exports of some $40m as a result of the difficulties in Saudi Arabia. This represents a reduction of 1.6 million head in live sheep exports. I know that some of my Democrat friends would like to see the abolition of the live sheep export trade, but I do not believe that this is in the best interests of primary producers. It is a matter of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Iran recently signed a contract which committed it to purchase another 24,000 tonnes of mutton, we must look upon the Middle East market as essentially unstable. There is still work that can be done to improve the standard of coverage by Australian entities in the Middle East and to improve the prospects of our exports being accepted over there. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have problems in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. At the moment its grain surplus is expected to be used as feed for beef. Therefore, this means a reduction in the Russian demand for beef, which is currently 200,000 tonnes a year. Although Russia is not a substantial importer from Australia, this will have consequences for the market. It will therefore have consequences for Australian primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Very clearly one of the problems that Australian primary producers face is the high dollar, which is impeding access to markets and the cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of Australian primary producers. That area is within the realms of this Government's work. It is the consequence of this Government's handiwork. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not seem as though the country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is doing much for primary producers. It has failed to convey to this Government the concern of primary producers from one end of this country to the other, and the consequence that the very high level of the Australian dollar is having not only on their personal incomes but also on the income of the Australian economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out to the chamber the significance of the comments on page 28 about transport. We need to have substantial reform of the waterfront. The comments that shipping and aviation transport costs amount to 20 per cent of the landed costs of some Australian primary produce are very important. I am very concerned. We need to see substantial and real improvements on waterfront reform. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Science and Technology Council Report Your word is my command: towards an Australian capability in humancomputer interface design deals with the human-computer interface design. Initially, I refer the Senate to a comment on page 6 of the report which, in quoting an American study, states:</PARA>
<PARA>One recent study,-</PARA>
<PARA>this is of the computer industry-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . found that despite investment of A$236.8 billion in information technologies in the United States service industry over the last 10 years, there has been little if any productivity growth. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that an absolutely remarkable figure. It indicates several things, one of which bears very much on the debate which we concluded in this chamber only a few moments ago in relation to the benefits of private industry and the market system. I point out that the United States computer industry is very much privately owned and market driven and yet it has spent $236.8 billion on something which, according to the study, has produced little, if any, increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make in drawing on that figure is that $236.8 billion would have gone into the gross domestic product of the United States as currently measured. In other words, by that measure-a measure which the Australian Democrats have, on many occasions, criticised-the American economy would have grown by that enormous amount. Yet the study found there was no increase in productivity. It is yet another indication of the inadequacy of the gross domestic product index and the fact that it has little real benefit to the community to which that measure applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also says-this relates to a number of computer applications-that there is little point in having ever more powerful tools if users are not able to exploit them. A supercomputer on every desk top makes no sense until the power this technology offers can be harnessed by the user. There is a message in that comment for the excellent tools that have been provided in this institution, the Parliament. We have very good computers, very good databases and facilities for accessing information, but in moving around the Parliament I find that the ability of people in this place to adequately exploit that technology is very limited. </PARA>
<PARA> One can move on from there and point out that one of the penalties for increasing inequity in our community-that is also mentioned in this report-and increasing disparity between the educational standards, between a sufficient wealth to take advantage of a technology which is made available, is that the new technologies simply do not serve the functions that they might otherwise serve. They increase the disparity between people; they increase the feeling of alienation; they increase the real alienation of an increasing body of people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> While the answer to this problem is certainly not the answer which the Luddites attempted to impose many years ago-smashing machines-it does lie in greater equity in the community, greater access to and understanding of the technology, an understanding of the way in which the technology is developing, an understanding broadly through the community of the power of the new technology and the services to which that new technology can be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The increasing inequity in Australia has a great deal to do with the failure of more people in the community to take advantage of the enormous power over information technology which the modern computing facilities make available. Briefly I would like to mention the work of Barbara Stack, which is not mentioned in this document. I found that rather surprising. Barbara Stack is a Tasmanian who has done a great deal of work on the ergonomics of modern computer keyboard operated machines. I recommend her work not only to those in the chamber but also to the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations was, as the title of its first report states, seeking to find ways to balance control and compassion when dealing with the problem of illegal entrants. It is an emotional minefield and for some it has become a political battlefield. But neither of those points gives any politician the right to walk away from the decisions which will be considered by some sections to be unyielding and unpopular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has been charged with finding ways to tackle the problem. It is a problem that politicians cannot procrastinate over, cannot ignore, shuffle around or mumble about. The bottom line is that we have more than 100,000 people living in Australia who are doing so illegally. We do know that the majority deliberately broke the rules. They well know they are living here outside the law. </PARA>
<PARA> We owe it to every single person who has applied to join us through the proper channels, and who is enduring the long wait for acceptance, to deal once and for all with illegals in a firm but fair manner. Our stand must be a very visible warning to anyone overseas who is contemplating staying behind here on a tourist or student visa-the two most popular methods-that Australia is no longer the lucky country for illegals. And there is absolutely no point in looking tough and then acting softly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that is what has happened previously and will continue to happen if some of the Committee's recommendations in this first report are accepted. That is why I was party to a dissenting report. Yes, it was certainly difficult, especially during public submissions to the Committee, not to let the heart rule the head on illegals. There were some very compelling arguments put to us. It would have been easy to be swayed by protestations that many illegals have become good and worthy hardworking people making a valuable contribution to our society. I do not doubt they have. But to have been swayed to ignore that these people must remain responsible for the results of their own deliberate and considered actions-no matter what they now contribute-would have been to entrench the perception that Australia does not take our illegals situation seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason also it is inappropriate that the five year absorption principle should be contemplated. That principle is akin to handing over the key to the door. It was on that key point-the absorption principle and the five-year benchmark on 31 October 1985-that I have supported a dissenting report. In other words, illegals get in, stay low, then put up their heads with a job, a family and some character references five years on and we will have a belated welcome home party for them. The absorption principle also indicates to illegals and to others contemplating similar action that they can get away with it if they hang on long enough. It makes a mockery of any rules and regulations and, worse, it makes a mockery of all those who arrive here the right way, often after years of physical hardship or fear from political regimes in their home lands. We owe them the right to become valued citizens far more than we will ever owe it to those who treated our rules and our values with some contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Our migration program must be successful. We need to ensure that Australians accept our migration program as a carefully considered one for the long-term good of our country. We cannot afford to let racist elements damage efforts to make it work by creating a perception that we do not have the fortitude to enforce its rules, or worse that the program has no rules that cannot be broken. In this regard we cannot be seen as weak. But weak we most definitely are if we allow any five-year absorption plan to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply unbelievable that we will make this five-year absorption amnesty the one and only. That is exactly what has been said, in effect, time and time again. To condone it happening now is to shout to illegals, and to those who protect them, that eventually some more politicians will come along with yet another one and only five-year absorption amnesty; that all they need to do is to stay low for another few years. No-one believes politicians any longer on this issue-and I am talking about a track record of 10 or 20 years-certainly not some groups, albeit a minority, that are not beyond using emotional blackmail and pressure in what is an exceptionally emotional issue. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already stated, my firm view is that our Committee was not set up to make decisions based on emotion or on fear of being unpopular. We must never forget that the long term success of a true multicultural society with the assimilation of many diverse groups rests on a sane, sensible and, most importantly, controlled migration program. That means that it is time to begin treating deliberate illegals as they deserve, in my view, to be treated. </PARA>
<PARA> The British model for dealing with illegals makes sense, and I am all in favour of a similar proposal here. I am disappointed that the British model in total-not in part-was not part of the final report. The United Kingdom model operates from the base that deportation will normally be the proper course when someone is found to be illegal. That is the base from which to proceed. It then works back from that line with a list of clearly defined circumstances where exceptions to the deportation rule may be made. It leaves little room for confusion or continual amnesties. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what we should be striving for-firmness and fairness, and firmness and fairness which are set out in a way that is easily understood by both those who have to enforce the rules and those who break them. However, the problem is now so entrenched in Australia that we need to tackle it from a wider base. It is time for consideration to be given to strengthening and enforcing legislation which makes it a criminal offence to harbour illegals. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Migration Act was revamped late last year we increased the penalties to be imposed under section 80, allowing for fines of $5,000 or two years' imprisonment or both for people who deliberately harboured illegals. That is an increase on the 1985 penalties of a $1,000 fine or six months' gaol, but they still do not appear to be worrying those who are helping illegals. Therefore, they ought to be increased. If a person who is not an Australian citizen is harbouring an illegal, if that person is going to deliberately flout the law in harbouring illegal migrants, his or her right to continue to live in Australia should be put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> They are areas that we need to tackle. Certainly, the legislation needs to be enforced. To date, responsibility for the enforcement of the legislation has generally been piecemeal and penalties have rarely been enforced. That ought to change immediately. It would surely be a first step towards stopping the influx of illegal immigrants and it would signify that we are serious-a message that has not yet been communicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 80 is such a little-used part of the legislation that it is clear that many illegals and those who support and shelter them feel so confident that they will not be caught and punished that they consider their actions fair game. It is no game, but even we, the politicians, could appear to be treating it as such if we hide from the hard and, yes, unpopular decision relating first to illegals and secondly to those who harbour them within our community. It is time for our actions to spell that out in strict rules and regulations which cannot be misinterpreted or misunderstood. That is the control that our Committee was set up to find ways to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> However, compassion should be directed to the group of innocent illegals in Australia. They ought to be considered, protected and cared for. A determination to deal with deliberate illegals must in no way infringe on our compassionate dealings with those who find themselves illegal through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a case at present which shows all the traumas of such a predicament. It is that of two teenage sisters who have been in Australia since they were months old. Only now, when one is studying hard at university and the other a State public servant, have they realised that they are not Australians; they have no right of residency. We should not be heaping the sins of the parents on the children because the parents are illegal immigrants. These girls are to all intents and purposes Australian, and we ought to treat them as such. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another case, that of a teenage boy brought here on a visitor's visa by his grandmother when he was a baby and passed on to an aunt when his grandmother died. He too has only now discovered that his grandmother and his aunt were both illegal immigrants, as he is. I believe from all the evidence that I have heard as a member of the Committee that control and compassion go together, but there is a warning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, I have pleasure in contributing to the debate on the Committee's report Balancing Control and Compassion. It is clear that the neglect of previous governments has left Australia with a legacy of illegal entrants which is estimated at between 90,000 and 150,000. These figures are very large and one wonders how they have reached this size. The answer is simple: they have occurred over a number of years due to a lack of enforcement of compliance procedures. Many illegals currently in Australia have been here for quite some time, although the majority have been here for less than five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Joint Standing Committee has addressed the problem of illegal entrants as a priority and put forward a number of measures to deal with those illegals currently in Australia, and it offers recommendations for dealing with illegal immigrants in the future. The Australian Democrats support tough measures to apprehend and deport illegal entrants. This is certainly necessary to protect the integrity of our immigration program, because to the extent that we allow queue jumpers to get away with breaking the law we reduce our capacity to receive refugees and family reunion migrants who are taking their turn in the approval process. The refugee problem, as outlined in the report of the National Population Council, is expected to grow markedly and Australia will become more and more a country of first asylum. We certainly have an obligation to the global community to recognise this and take appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with my colleague Senator John Coulter when he says that we should deal with refugees at source and should assist other countries to avoid the sort of conditions-economic, social and political-which cause people to leave their countries as refugees. However, we have an existing problem. There are currently about one million refugees in camps dotted around the South-East Asian region in particular, and we believe that the current provision of 11,000 places for refugees is a niggardly response to the rapidly increasingly numbers. We advocate an increase to 20,000, in line with our continuing policy to give priority to the refugee and family reunion categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attempt last year to codify Australia's immigration laws has produced a rigid and oppressive body of legislation which makes it virtually impossible to take account of individual circumstances where the strict application of the law would produce unjustifiable hardship. The number of categories that individuals can use to apply for entry has been markedly reduced. We therefore have situations occurring where innocent illegals, often children, have no recourse under the legislation as it now stands. One example of this is a Fijian boy, deserted by his mother, who came to Australia with his grandmother on a visitor's permit at the age of five. His grandmother died during the visit and the boy was left staying with his great aunt. Now aged 11, with no immediate family in Fiji and basically having been brought up here, there is no compassionate scope for him to stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This codification of policies into law has been coupled with a tightening of ministerial discretion. The Minister, as a primary decision maker, has now little or no discretion to set aside or act outside the legislative framework. Ministerial discretion is applicable only to those with a domestic right of review. Therefore, the Minister can set aside only a decision of a review authority and, except for certain illegals who apply within the concessionary period, illegals have no right of review. Therefore, they cannot benefit from the limited ministerial discretion available. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential to provide a mechanism to allow our system to take account of exceptional circumstances. Unless this is done, our legal system will be brought into disrepute and people who deserve compassionate consideration will be driven underground. We are already facing the unfortunate situation of people applying to the courts for decisions where the department has made too strict an interpretation. This will continue until the Government puts in place regulations to clarify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another complexity in the regulations is the positive candour requirement. This means that the applicant must disclose any material change of circumstances. However, despite the fact that the categories of application have been strictly defined, what constitutes a material change of circumstances is not so defined. If applicants neglect to disclose such information, whatever that is, they may be illegal immigrants. Therefore, it is important that the material particulars be defined to avoid problems with innocent illegals in the future and to have some certainty in the legislation covering them. </PARA>
<PARA> After 31 October, exceptions to the laws governing illegals should and will be at an absolute minimum. However, action must be taken before 31 October and we must find means to reduce the current undesirable level of illegals. If the Committee's recommendations are accepted, this will be achieved by the carrot and stick approach. Illegal entrants leaving Australia voluntarily before 31 October will be able to reapply from abroad without any time restrictions, that is, as soon as they reach their destination. However, illegal entrants apprehended after 31 October will suffer time restrictions on their ability to apply for re-entry to Australia. They will also have to meet costs associated with being deported and, on recent information, several thousand have chosen to leave to avoid these disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this strategy, it is also necessary to enable people in exceptional circumstances to at least have their cases heard. To this end, the Committee recommends, and the Australian Democrats support, empowering the Immigration Review Tribunal to consider applications firstly, from people who believe they are innocent illegals and, secondly, from people who have been here more than five years. However, these are threshold requirements. Applicants will also have to satisfy public interest criteria and will be required to demonstrate that they have made a positive and substantial contribution to Australia. To misrepresent these threshold requirements as a five-year absorption amnesty is wrong. It should be noted that this five-year requirement is not a qualification, but merely a precondition to have an application considered. This approach acknowledges the need for tight controls but tempers the approach with compassion for people who deserve consideration on public policy and humanitarian grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I need to pay tribute to the secretariat staff, who have done tremendous work in a very tight time scale. Robina Mills, Heidi Quinlan and Francis Kleiss deserve the highest commendation, as does the legal consultant, Dr Kathryn Cronin. The Government should recognise that if it is to impose tight time lines, as it has on this occasion, the Committee must have adequate resources to avoid putting undue pressure on its staff, and indeed on the people that appear before it and the members of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 August this report was presented to the Senate and I spoke on it. I got to nearly the end of my comments on the fourth recommendation of the Committee when the time of 10.30 p.m. was reached and the Senate adjourned. I wish very briefly to finish the remarks that I wanted to make on that occasion. I was saying in relation to the fourth recommendation that the Department of Administrative Services should be put under the same rules as everybody else with the land it administers within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It is my view that nobody wants to see a situation where, within one city, one group of land users is able to operate under a different set of rules from those applying to everybody else. The rest of my remarks on that part of the report are included in the Hansard of 23 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a fifth recommendation, that is, that approval of the national capital plan by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) be dependent on a commitment to inter-government discussions on the financial and economic implications of the plan, and that the Commonwealth accept full financial responsibility for the additional costs imposed on the Territory as a consequence of the plan. I draw the Senate's attention to the wording of the recommendation, which calls for a commitment to intergovernment decisions. Unfortunately, we have to ask the question: What is a commitment worth from this Government?</PARA>
<PARA> The people of the ACT thought they had a commitment during the time of the debate on self-government from the then Minister that transitional funding arrangements would be in place for the first three years of self-government, but that was backdated and downgraded to two years. The moneys which would have been paid to the ACT Government at two successive premiers conferences have been withheld. There is now some $35m held in trust to which the Government cannot gain access because that commitment also has not been honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I support the Joint Committee's recommendation, I can really only express some scepticism about commitments given by this Government. I hope that it will recognise the significance of the impact of the national capital plan on development opportunities within the ACT and that there is a need to make a proper assessment of the financial and economic impact of the plan and, more than that, to ensure that the ACT is compensated for any negative financial impact of the plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also repeat what I have said previously in this chamber-that I regard the Commonwealth Government's behaviour over the Gowrie Hostel as disgraceful. I am not challenging the court decisions which said that the Commonwealth may retain those properties, but I do challenge the Commonwealth's integrity in claiming that property. I believe it highlights absolutely the attitude of the Labor Government to the people of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make in relation to the plan, referred to in the report, is the fact that there is a lack of any appeal mechanism against the decisions of the National Capital Planning Authority. The report is correct in stating that this is a matter which need not be taken up within the plan but, in fact, does require action. It is not acceptable that the ACT Government has no appeal mechanism to challenge decisions on the plan. In the end, of course, presumably it would be the Federal Minister who would make a decision, and of course the National Capital Planning Authority is his creature in any event; it is not a satisfactory way to leave the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has amended the views of the previous Committee that the Act be amended to allow for such appeals, and I hope to see the necessary amendments presented to the Parliament at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about this report on debt recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I would like to begin by congratulating the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on a comprehensive survey of what is a vexed and complex area. While I welcome the general thrust of these recommendations, I would like to highlight just a couple of concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before doing that, however, I would like to point out that this reference to a standing committee may not have been necessary-in fact, would not have been necessary-if the new debt recovery provisions had not been included in the legislation. Honourable senators may recall that, at the time, the Australian Democrats opposed these provisions because the community groups were telling us the provisions involved elements of unfairness and victimisation, and made a number of false assumptions, particularly about sole parents. I think this report vindicates both the concerns of these community groups and the actions that the Democrats took at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that this report is clearly placed in the right context. When discussing the recovery of overpayments to pensioners and beneficiaries we are not talking about massive amounts of fraud as some people persist in doing. As the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) noted at the time of the Budget, the cost to the Department of Social Security of overpayments last year-and that includes all the deliberate fraud-amounted to less than 0.1 of one per cent of total payments made to pensioners and beneficiaries. Indeed, in any one year, as most overpayments are due to error, there are fewer than 2,500 prosecutions across Australia for fraud. We need to be clear, as we interpret this report, that there is no widespread rorting of the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> This report identifies numerous problems with the way the Department of Social Security recovers debts from its clients, and I believe we need to take up these matters if we are to make sure that the Department provides humane and supportive services, thereby ensuring that the vast majority of honest pensioners and beneficiaries are not subjected to undue and unfair practices. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly pleasing that this report-and this is recommendation 21-recommends that payments made under the Social Security Act in respect of children are not to be used to recover any overpayments. As the Committee notes, it is simply not on to have children suffer as a consequence of their parents' obligation to repay money. I trust the Department will take heed of this recommendation. I note, with great concern, that the Department's draft debt recovery manual contains provisions that are in direct conflict with this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also pleasing to see recommendations in relation to the Department's obligations to supply accurate, understandable information to all its clients. Many pensioners and beneficiaries complain about the maze of information they have to negotiate their way through and the lack of specific information that they require from the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has been criticised for its information practices for some time, most notably by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs in its report last year on the quality of services provided by the Department. This report re-emphasises the pressing need for some action to be taken on this. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the report recommends that there is a need to address the issue of forms and standard letters, recommendation 11; written notification of alleged overpayments, recommendation 12; clear and precise calculations of alleged overpayments, recommendation 10; and basic information about the availability of appeal rights, also recommendation 10. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to commend the Committee for its recommendation that welfare rights units and community legal centres be funded to provide competent and independent advice for social security clients, recommendation 29. These types of services are most important as pensioners and beneficiaries do not have access to expensive lawyers and they are up against a complex and frequently inflexible system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another positive recommendation, and one that recognises the small amount of deliberate fraud within the system, is No. 15 which addresses the issue of clients being paid one particular type of pension or benefit when, in fact, they were entitled to another benefit. The Committee has rightly recommended that the Department should offset overpayments against the payment to which the client was, in fact, entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make the comment that this report is a very positive move in the right direction. The general thrust is enlightened. Hopefully, the Government will not leave this report on a shelf gathering dust, but we will see it implemented and, hopefully, that will not be in the too distant future. </PARA>

<PARA>The report fails to provide two pieces of information which are required by the guidelines and which, in the case of a body expected to act independently, are important.

<PARA>In response to that, the Senior Assistant Director from the office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions wrote the following letter to the Acting Secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Argument,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter dated 1 June 1990 enclosing a copy of your Committee's report entitled `Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee'. </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 3.20 of that report it is stated, inter alia, that our Annual Report fails to provide information as to the precise extent of the Minister's powers of direction under section 8 of the DPP Act and whether, and if so how, those powers have been exercised. In fact, this information was included in our Annual Report, as it has been in previous years. I refer you to page 11 of our Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McCarthy is correct and I take this opportunity to apologise to the Director of Public Prosecutions for wrongly taking him to task.

<PARA> That the report of the Committee be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sixth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under privilege resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 18 July 1990, the then Deputy President, Senator D.J. Hamer, DSC, referred a letter from Dr P. Ingram Cromack, relating to remarks made by former Senator Jenkins during the adjournment debate on 28 May 1990, to the Committee of Privileges as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The Committee considered the submission and has recommended that a response agreed to by Dr Cromack and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>APPENDIX 2</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE BY DR P. INGRAM CROMACK</PARA>
<PARA>AGREED TO BY DR CROMACK</PARA>
<PARA>AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</PARA>
<PARA>PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(b) OF THE SENATE OF</PARA>
<PARA>25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a rebuttal statement in relation to the unfair and damaging remarks made by former Senator Jenkins in the Senate in which she personally named me (Hansard 28th May, 1990). My reputation has been adversely affected, I have suffered professional injury, financial loss and stress (and my family as well) as a result of these allegations. These allegations have been described by Mr. Gavan Troy, Productivity &amp;Labour Relations Minister, W.A. Parliament, in the West Australian of Saturday, June 2nd, 1990 as being unsubstantiated. These were again repeated by former Senator Jenkins in The Australian Doctor Weekly of 15.6.90. </PARA>
<PARA>Like a few of my Senior Orthopaedic colleagues in this State, I do see (for the purposes of a medico-legal opinion) difficult compensation claims. I am asked to give an opinion based on the history, clinical examination and investigations in claims which have dragged on sometimes for two or three years at least, and where the patient has seen six, seven or eight different doctors, all with differing shades of opinion. These are very difficult and time-consuming cases and require the expertise of long years of experience in the speciality. Hence, the demand usually falls upon the shoulders of the few more senior members for these types of complex cases. It is not that any organisation is choosing``pet Doctors''. </PARA>
<PARA>One has several duties to perform-the chief being to give a privileged medico-legal report without fear or favour whether it be in the patient's interest or in an insurance organisation's interest. These opinions have always been regarded as sacrosanct and not to be distributed to third parties. Unfortunately, this has occurred and medico-legal privilege has been broken and abused. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important also that public monies be protected from false claims in these difficult economic times when there have been cut-backs in Public Hospital funding thereby reducing their working capacity and producing long waiting lists of patients for hip arthroplasties, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>Doctors do not ``cease patients' compensation payments''. It is a decision of the Court based on evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of these claims are referred by Solicitors and Insurance Companies and only a few are purely private patients. This is because of the Medicare and Hospital Benefit restrictions where the patient can obtain no refund whatsoever for an Insurance examination. In this State, there are only a handful of Doctors willing to see these difficult claims because of their complex nature, the problems associated with being called to Court and if the referrals are not under the auspices of the Legal profession or an Insurance organisation, then there is a considerable risk that the fees will never be paid at all or if they are paid, the waiting time is often three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Complaints have been made and two such serve as good examples:-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) I was accused of being responsible for a patient's workers' compensation payments ceasing. However, in actual fact, the evidence is quite to the contrary because the patient's solicitor omitted to lodge the required claim within the time specified by the Court. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Another complaint was that I did not accept the patient's alleged degree of severe disability and this is correct, as I did not feel that this patient (who had a minor, simple, tennis elbow) did have very much disability. I agreed with the patient's own treating Orthopaedic Surgeon who stated that the patient had only l0% disability in the affected arm i.e. the tennis elbow. </PARA>
<PARA>These are two documented complaints where the proof shows me to be entirely innocent of these unsubstantiated allegations. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of former Senator Jenkins' statements (repeated on the A.B.C.) the front and name plate of my consulting rooms were filmed by Channel 2 and were clearly identified and shown on the 6.00 p.m. News on 3.6.90. My consent was not obtained and I consider this an invasion of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>On the subject of R.S.I., cervico-brachial neuritis or whatever other name one likes to give this alleged condition, over a period of 17 months in 1,100 patients, I have only seen eleven cases of alleged R.S.I.-this is only 1% of the total. </PARA>
<PARA>I see compensation cases for Australia Post however, since it is well known (like the majority of my colleagues) that I do not believe R.S.I. to be a discrete clinical entity, to obviate any dispute it has been thought wise for me not to see any R.S.I. cases for Australia Post. This evidence is also documented. </PARA>
<PARA>Regarding the alleged condition of R.S.I., it is not a clinical condition accepted by Australian Orthopaedic Surgeons or the Society of Hand Surgeons as being a condition in its own right. Pain in the arm is a common complaint, and we believe in this day and age, that with sophisticated investigation, coupled with careful clinical observation, a diagnosis can always be made of a definitive type such as ``disc disease'' in the neck or a pinched nerve at the elbow, for instance. I am supported in this contention by other Specialists in other fields. </PARA>
<PARA>The umbrella term ``R.S.I.'' is used to explain symptoms without signs and is thought to co-exist with diagnosed organic disorders (Browne 1984) and to be the explanation for symptoms in excess of those to be expected with diagnosed physical disorders and for symptoms continuing for longer than expected, with diagnosed physical disorders. Used in these ways, the concept of R.S.I. is in all ways, consistent with what is known as functional overlay in legal circles and conversion symptoms amongst psychiatrists. </PARA>
<PARA>(See Lucinda Lucire's Submission to the R.S.I. Task Force Committee 1984/85.)</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore, like my Orthopaedic colleagues and many other colleagues, am not alone in my beliefs of the pathology of this alleged condition. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust the above is an adequate explanation and does explain the damage done to my professional reputation and integrity and the suffering it has caused, both stress and financial. As has been said, former Senator Jenkins has been using unsubstantiated information. </PARA>
<PARA>I would ask the Privileges Committee in its wisdom, to table this rebuttal in the Senate so that it may be incorporated in Hansard as a permanent record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Once again, I believe that the Privileges Committee has acted properly and responsibly in allowing a citizen the opportunity of protecting his good name when he has been subject to remarks in this chamber that are damaging to his reputation. In the case of Mr Cromack, this attack by a former senator involves more than the use of unsubstantiated information resulting in an invasion of privacy. What I regard as reprehensible was the allegation by former Senator Jenkins that there was `a variation of doctor shopping that involves the use of a pet doctor'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> She referred also to collusion between such doctors and insurers and to the fact that older doctors sustain their incomes in this way. This was the context in which Dr Cromack was named. The snide allegation is not only grossly unfair to Dr Cromack, who is a senior orthopaedic surgeon, but misrepresents the position of such medical practitioners who are prepared to offer their careful opinions in medico-legal matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The community whom we represent should be very grateful that these doctors make their services available for difficult and time consuming cases, for which in fact fees may not be received for a number of years or not received at all. It is easy to stand up and bucket doctors, without thought for the facts that it is the courts that make final decisions as to the compensation payments. Surgeons who try to give honest opinions in these difficult cases are also engaged in the protection of public money from false and specious claims. Not only Dr Cromack but all of us have the right to be angry when these actions are held up as being motivated by unprofessional conduct and personal gain. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only to be hoped that some senators and former senators will cease this kind of grandstanding at the expense of professional reputations of those medical practitioners trying to do a difficult and necessary job for the community. Once again, I compliment the Committee on its findings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I refer to two documents-the annual report of the Auditor-General, No. 6 and No.7, and, in particular, the survey of internal audit in the Commonwealth public sector. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its historic report 2.96, recommended that the Auditor-General undertake an efficiency audit of internal audit in the Commonwealth sector which would include a comprehensive survey of internal audit. I wish to acknowledge the Auditor-General's response to that report in the form of the survey of internal audit and congratulate the Auditor-General on the comprehensive nature of that particular report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two aspects of the recommendations that I would like to comment on: firstly, the Auditor-General's mandate regarding his reinstatement as the auditor of statutory marketing authorities and government business enterprises and the establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority. The importance of the Australian National Audit Office's independence, integrity and responsibility to this Parliament cannot be overestimated. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Joint Committee of Public Accounts acknowledged the importance of its status, moving to that of a statutory corporation, associated with that and integral with it from the parliamentary accountability point of view was the necessity to set up an audit committee of the Parliament which would act as a link between the Audit Office and this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that is giving us some concern, I believe, is the need for the Sheridan report in relation to these recommendations to be made a public document. I ask the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who is at the table, to try to hasten that response because its implications in terms of accountability, its responsibility in terms of internal audit and this concept of accountability, really need to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge the tremendous changes and improvements that have occurred in terms of accountability in recent years. Much of the credit for that has to go to the coordinating authorities, which include the Australian Audit Office, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Parliamentarians also have concerns in relation to this whole concept of accountability and about tightening internal audit and raising its status in terms of its responsibilities as a part of this reporting process. I commend both documents to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As mentioned prior to the adjournment of the debate, the purpose of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill 1990 is to create a statutory authority. As I indicated, we oppose the creation of the Authority for various reasons. I also mentioned that when this Bill was introduced in the other House the aim was to transfer the statutory authority when created to Newcastle. The Opposition spokesman in the other place, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), made a point of saying that this was blatant pork-barrelling by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and his colleagues in the Newcastle area. The responses from the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) were shock, horror-this Government would never engage in pork-barrelling! I quoted a few statements from them. For example, Mr Bob Brown stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is just coincidental that my electorate adjoins Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that the decision to locate AMSA in Newcastle was based on objective reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>I also pointed out that a degree of sensibility was introduced into this debate by none other than Senator Walsh who sprung the Government when, among other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Circuses are taking over from the real issues and such a move has no functional purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the people responsible for the safety program who would be represented by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) are already located in Canberra. To propose a move of these people at a cost to the taxpayer estimated in the second reading speech at around $10m, but subsequently amended to around $17m, is a gross waste. No wonder Senator Walsh made the remark that `circuses are taking over from the real issues'. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Authority were already in Newcastle, it would be equally as ludicrous to suggest that it be moved back to Canberra; but it is already here. In this modern day and age with transport and communications the way they are, there would be no justifiable reason for that move. Since the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives the Government has now changed its mind. We now find that, recognising the proposed and very stupid waste of taxpayers' money involved in this very cynical exercise, the Minister, Senator Bob Collins, has decided that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will stay where it is. Mr Deputy President, if you will excuse the observation, it looks like a Bob going each way-Senator Bob Collins going in one direction and Mr Bob Brown, the other Minister, going in the other. </PARA>
<PARA> After all these protests and indignation about the very suggestion that the location was politically inspired pump- priming, what has been the response of Minister Brown now that Minister Collins has decided to keep the Authority in Canberra? In the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 September, Minister Brown is quoted as describing the back flip as `outrageous'. The report then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently as a sop to Newcastle and the three Labor MP's who represent the Newcastle region the Government is now looking for other ways it can invest in Newcastle much of the $10.9 million allocated for the project. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the protestations in the other place by Mr Brown, Mr Morris and others who were so shocked at the suggestion that this was pork-barrelling at the expense of Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Senator Collins on agreeing to keep the service in Canberra. I do not know whether he was swayed by the sensibility of Senator Walsh. Maybe the sensibility of Senator Walsh is catching in some Ministers on the Government side. However, the correct decision was made not to go ahead with the transfer because of the cost. Again, to quote the remarks of Senator Walsh, `it was nothing more or less than a circus'. What a blatant abuse of taxpayers' money to buy votes! There is a report that the $10.9m which was to be allocated to transfer a group of people from Canberra who did not want to be there, who did not need to be there, is now to be used, to quote the Sydney Morning Herald, as a `sop' to those Labor members of parliament in exchange for not doing what should never have been done in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the people of Newcastle, as with the rest of Australia, would prefer less Government expenditure and some genuine micro-economic reform. Curiously, in the other place among the comments made by the new member, the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), was one that he thought the Authority should be in Newcastle because of its proximity to the wine making areas. He also said that this was a major plank in the Government's platform of micro-economic reform. What the public and the people of Newcastle need is genuine micro-economic reform. They want lower interest rates, as does the rest of Australia; they want lower inflation, as does the rest of Australia; and they want less tax-all of which will make a positive contribution to their future well-being and their long term job prospects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks in relation to the Maritime Safety Authority Bill 1990. It is a matter that has been of considerable interest in my electorate since the idea first came up. I certainly join my colleagues in opposing the legislation, which proposes to create a new statutory authority-the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My interest in this proposal for the creation of the Authority dates back to the end of last year when the creation of the body was announced by the Government. It was not announced against a background of calls from the maritime industries for any form of restructuring of sea safety services or any call for relocation of sea safety services that we might have expected would have preceded an announcement of this kind. Yet it was announced and from the outset it was clear that in addition to the creation of the new body, the Authority I have referred to, it was the intention of the Government to establish it at a location outside Canberra from where the sea safety organisation had operated for many years, and it was to be placed in Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole process begs the question as to why the Government was so determined to make these changes and why they should take place in Newcastle. It is my understanding that the industry this organisation is supposed to serve not only was not seeking these changes, but also was not even consulted about them. Since the proposal came to light late last year, concern has been expressed within the maritime industries about the likely increases in costs and charges that will arise out of the costly exercise of creating this new Authority and relocating staff from Canberra to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Government has recognised the considerable financial arguments against relocation outside Canberra and has announced that the Authority, if its establishment goes ahead, will remain in Canberra. That is a decision which I welcome. In my view there should never have been any question of moving the personnel involved with the sea safety organisation, whether under the present arrangements or as part of a new authority, outside the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> My remarks should not in any way be construed as an attack on Newcastle. My view about the location of sea safety personnel would have been the same if the proposed location had been Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, or any other site. There is no reason why it should be shifted from Canberra. The arguments against a move from the ACT to any other city would be equally valid. </PARA>
<PARA> The moving of personnel would have been an unjustified waste of taxpayers' money and would have served no useful purpose in sea safety. There would have been the cost of physically moving the equipment and personnel to a new location; the cost of accommodation at a new site; the cost of moving those staff who remained in the service to the new place; and the cost of redundancy packages for the families of staff unwilling to disrupt their families and who wanted to stay in Canberra. Of those there were many. And of course there would have been the loss of expertise of those who would be leaving the Sea Safety Centre if it moved, causing considerable dislocation to families who otherwise would have stayed in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times it was discovered that the property in Newcastle which was to be the home under the proposal-NESCA House-was considerably contaminated with asbestos. I do not believe it has ever been ascertained what additional cost that has incurred or what additional cost might have been incurred by shifting from the proposed venue to a new venue. Those are only the monetary costs. The cost to the employees in terms of the disruption of their family life would have been considerable. Also, as I mentioned, the skills and expertise that would have been lost indicates to me that the move should not be made. </PARA>
<PARA> What seemed surprising to me was the fact that the Government showed little interest in the more than 200 employees and their families who would have been affected by the move. I had letters from many who were upset about it. They indicated that they would not move because the impact on their children would be too great. Certainly the union to which they belong was opposed to the sea safety unit being moved from Canberra. Perhaps the Government was misled by the Department's very optimistic submission to Cabinet which estimated that 80 per cent of employees would be happy to move from Canberra with the AMSA. From the information that I have obtained, I do not believe that that was an accurate assessment of the number that wanted to move. I think the figure was arrived at without looking at the new structure. Very few people were happy to move and I believe that it would have resulted, at least for a period, in a downgrading in the service which could have been provided while new people were recruited and trained in the necessary work of the area. Ship survey services and other operations would also have been affected had the unit moved from Canberra to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Centre has responsibility for search in an area covering 11 per cent of the earth's surface. It operates for 24 hours a day and is well equipped with very sophisticated computer and satellite equipment, as well as highly skilled staff. My real concern of course was with the impact on the staff. An enforced move would have damaged the search and rescue unit's ability to carry out its functions as efficiently as it has in recent times. Recently it moved within Canberra from Weston to Belconnen. It cost a considerable amount to relocate the unit and that did not include the cost of people moving houses, as would have been the case had the unit gone to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The grievances and the views of the employees-as I mentioned, there were 200 or so-seemed to carry little weight with the Minister who previously held the portfolio, that is, before Senator Collins became the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. He was determined, it seemed, to see that the project proceed both with the formation of the Authority and the transfer to Newcastle. The only conclusion which could be drawn from the former Minister's determination was that he felt there was some other benefit for the move to Newcastle. I think that his comments in the last few days raise the question: Why did he want it in Newcastle? Many people have been surprised at the way he has reacted to the decision, which is obviously a Cabinet decision made in the light of a submission that the present Minister had put to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Two issues are involved here. One is the establishment of the Authority itself and the other is the move. I have spoken principally to the reason why it should not have moved and welcome the fact that the Minister has now indicated that it will not move. I was particularly concerned because this would have been one of a series of moves which have occurred in recent years of moving public servants from Canberra, the national capital. The former Human Rights Commission, which was established in Canberra, was moved to Sydney and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was moved from Canberra to Brisbane. Mr Deputy President, you may have been pleased to see that happen, but in my view it flies in the face of the reason for the existence of a national capital. Canberra did not get the aviation college that everybody said should be based here. Instead it was located in Tasmania. People would not be surprised to learn that we feel there is a pattern of taking things away from Canberra when it suits-taking away organisations which ought to be properly placed in the national capital. I am pleased that in this instance the very strong case against moving the staff from Canberra has prevailed. </PARA>
<PARA> All that remains to be resolved now is whether or not it is necessary to establish the Authority and whether it will be of any benefit. In the absence of any demonstrated benefit either to the Sea Safety Centre, the staff of the service, the clients of the service or the taxpayers of Australia, I would assert that the Authority should not go ahead. It is my view that the Government should cut its losses at this stage and abandon the legislation. It has shown that it was willing to reconsider the merits of the relocation and I congratulate it on being prepared to put reason and logic above political considerations. I urge a similar re-examination of the proposal to set up the Authority. I do not believe that it is necessary and I suggest that this legislation be withdrawn. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that we have made some arrangement, Mr Deputy President. The Australian Democrats support the establishment of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. While we do not support the rampant creation of endless statutory authorities, we believe that in the case of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority there are some significant and lasting benefits which more than justify its establishment. These benefits are: the establishment will allow greater industry input into the functioning of this area of marine operation and, as such, it will be far more responsive to the needs of those in the industry; it will provide a more cost effective delivery of service; and it will provide the Authority with the ability to determine short and long term goals outside the Budget cycle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, the Democrats recognise the value of greater input to the operation of maritime safety from the industry itself. The Board of this Authority is to be comprised of representatives from a broad spectrum of government, union, business and industry groups. The Democrats see this as an essential element in ensuring that the new Authority's operations are as responsive to the needs of these groups as possible, and we welcome the opportunity that the establishment of the Authority provides for this increased consultation to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the proposed move to Newcastle, which seems to have occupied a very large proportion of this debate, the Democrats have a firm commitment to decentralisation and have proposed or supported a wide range of local and regional employment initiatives. As such we had an in-principle position of support for this move and it is now history that the Authority is to be established in Canberra. However, having some personal attachment to the Newcastle area, I must say that I do understand the disappointment of Novocastrians now that the Authority will not be moving there. </PARA>
<PARA> But, clearly, the costs of relocation to Newcastle were increasing dramatically, and combined with the lack of appropriate office space in the area and the discovery of considerable levels of asbestos in the one suitable building, this meant that establishing the Authority in the Newcastle area was inappropriate. The cost of the move had got to the stage where it simply could not be justified as anything more than an abuse of taxpayers' money. In contrast, the cost of establishing the restructured Authority here in Canberra will be around $2.5m, and the Democrats believe that the benefits of the Authority warrant this cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this Bill, the Democrats reject the Opposition's view that only the private sector has the capacity and the right to run efficient commercial enterprises. It is this type of thinking that will lead to the Opposition selling off completely Telecom, OTC Ltd, Australian Airlines and Qantas even when, for example, Australian Airlines is easily out-performing its privately owned competitor. The Democrats recognise the strong commercial performance of each of these government business enterprises and remain committed to retaining them in public ownership. Similarly, the Democrats support the establishment of a commercially oriented and highly responsible authority to replace the maritime operations division of the Department of Transport and Communications. We believe that it is appropriate that the Authority be largely funded by levies on commercial shipping, navigational aids and oil pollution prevention and recovery. At the same time, however, we believe that it is vital that the funding of search and rescue operations in this area be absolutely guaranteed. As such, we support the maintenance of government funding to safety communications and the cost of search and rescue operations, and to improved coastal surveillance facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats do have a couple of concerns about the legislation. Our first concern was highlighted in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report No. 5. This concern relates to the delegation of power as outlined in clause 58 of the Bill. Our second concern relates to clause 11, as we believe this may allow a back door way for the Authority to form a company, the shares of which may be sold. At present, the clause simply requires the Authority to inform the Minister of its actions, and the Democrats are concerned that this does not provide a sufficient safeguard. I will seek clarification of these issues at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will also be closely monitoring the regulatory functions relating to the safety of ships and the qualifications of marine personnel. We do not want to see a total devolution of scrutiny of these matters to the industry itself, as may be happening in the aviation industry through the Civil Aviation Authority. So, on balance, the Democrats believe that the benefits of establishing this Authority and locating it here in Canberra far outweigh any liabilities raised by any of the previous speakers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate, and I will not detain the Senate for very long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is opposing this legislation on philosophical grounds and it is certainly entitled to do that. Opposition members do not believe in principle in government business enterprises; the Government does. This organisation is currently a relatively small Commonwealth government department. It is not a very large operation at all and its entire function is related to safety at sea. I mention that particularly in respect of a number of very recent statements which appear to have had the effect of brushing that purpose aside. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Australian Democrats for their indication of support for this legislation. I note, however, the comments of their spokesperson about the Newcastle option, which has occupied much of the debate in recent times rather than the purpose of the organisation itself. Therefore, I wish to say something about that. Accusations have been made that when the Government took its original decision to locate the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) in Newcastle, it did so for reasons of pork-barrelling in Newcastle. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to refer to that. But that simply is not correct. In fact, this organisation originally existed in the Port of Melbourne, until it was moved to Canberra by the previous conservative Government. I am not suggesting that was an incorrect decision at the time. It has operated here in Canberra for the eight years since then. When the Government determined to establish the organisation which currently operates as part of the Department of Transport and Communications as a separate entity to allow it to have that degree of flexibility that it needs in decision-making for cost recovery from the industry-with the exception of maritime search and rescue-it was decided for operational reasons that it was desirable to have this organisation based in a port. That is a perfectly reasonable intent considering that this is a maritime operation relating to maritime safety and that it is, all other things being equal, appropriate to have its headquarters based in a maritime setting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress `headquarters' because what seems to have been totally overlooked in the recent debate is that this is a regionalised service that does have significant port-based operations. It is the head office we are talking about that is here in Canberra and not its entire operation. I have read comments made recently in the New South Wales Parliament in a debate recently supported by the colleagues of Senator Parer. They paid no attention at all to what their colleagues here are saying about it in supporting a motion put forward by the Opposition that the impression has been created that this organisation was entirely Canberra-based, hundreds of miles away from a maritime setting. That is not correct. The Authority is currently located in six regional ports, but when its operations are streamlined they will be cut down to three port-based regional operations and its head office here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision was taken to base that on sensible grounds. There was a long term benefit attached to that as well, in that it certainly would have improved the long term opportunities for the organisations to enhance its recruitment capacity for specialist marine people knowing that it was based in a port. I was very honest, open and frank about that in the Estimates committees where it was raised previously and in other debates. So that was the operational basis. It was costed at that time at $7m. The cost of establishing it in Canberra was estimated as between $1m and $2m at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> On becoming Minister, I was anxious to expedite this decision. I discovered that costs had risen, for entirely valid reasons. I want to make two quick points about that. There has been a lot of discussion of this matter in recent days. There is understandable angst on the part of Novocastrians. Indeed, I share my roots with Senator Kernot in that I am also a Novocastrian. I was born in Newcastle and educated at Newcastle Boys High. I took no particular pleasure out of being faced with what I was faced with when I became Minister. What had happened, for reasons that were largely out of the control of the Government in terms of the delays that were caused-the Federal election, the earthquake in Newcastle, limitations on accommodation options available in Newcastle, and the subsequent discovery of asbestos in NESCA House, which was the only available option in Newcastle-was that, whichever way one looked at it, all the options constituted a particularly inedible form of sandwich. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it was necessary to make a decision. Costs had risen from $7m to $11m. They subsequently rose again from $11m to $16m. I want to make two points in relation to those rises, and I have no doubt that anyone who is interested enough to pursue this matter will be able to pursue it during Estimates committee hearings, which is the appropriate place to discuss that sort of complexity, rather than taking the time of this chamber. I will save it until then if anyone is interested to pursue it. </PARA>
<PARA> An impression has also been created about the employees of AMSA who were affected and who did not want to move. One could hardly blame them, but again that is no reflection on Newcastle. I share Senator Reid's view on that. It is simply that the employees who have lived and worked in a community for eight years, who enjoy living in their own houses and having their kids go to schools in that area, did not like the prospect of having to move. That is perfectly natural. I am sure they did not like it when they were moved from Melbourne eight years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures that were put together by those who were affected by this decision were largely put together by the range of Commonwealth government departments that normally operate in the area of moving public servants. There were the Transport and Storage Group, the Department of Administrative Services, the industrial relations people, and senior executives of the Department of Transport and Communications who were not directly affected by the move. Despite the fact that my office carried out its own independent examination of these figures, I asked the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to carry out his own independent examination of the figures, which he did. The only difference between the Transport and Communications estimates and the Department of Finance estimates of the cost of the move to Newcastle was that the estimate of the Department of Finance was slightly higher than that of the Department of Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA> A second matter then intruded which was important. I refer to the staff loss from the headquarters here in Canberra. This has not intruded to a significant extent in the viability of the operations of this organisation. However, it was clear that, if those operations kept going, and whichever option was adopted in terms of accommodation in Newcastle by early next year, it would be difficult for this organisation to sustain a viable operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I say, with no disrespect to my colleagues, that at the end of the day the person who has to stand in this place and bear the responsibility for loss of life at sea is me. It is not the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) or the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Bob Brown). It is I. I could hardly in good conscience responsibly proceed with a decision when my own judgment, entirely unrelated to the cost of this exercise, indicated that that organisation would face significant difficulties with either the Nestor House option or the only other available option-a brand new building which currently does not exist in Newcastle-if there were a further year's delay. I was not prepared to place the organisation, which is entirely related to the subject of the preservation of life at sea and safety, in that position. </PARA>
<PARA> It was on that basis that I took the decision back to Cabinet. All the arguments were canvassed in Cabinet, and it is important to understand that. The contrary figures that were prepared on the cost of the move were presented to Cabinet. The estimates of the Department of Finance were presented, as were those of my Department, and the point as to operational efficiency was also put. Cabinet, with all that material before it, took the difficult decision-and it was a difficult decision-in view of all the circumstances to reverse its original decision and to retain the organisation here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that after 1 January next year the decisions as to the future location of the operations of this organisation will rest not with the Government, but with the Board of AMSA. That is important and is worthy of note. With the exception of search and rescue, this organisation will extract the majority of its income from charges that it levies against the industry for services such as marine survey that it provides. Therefore, any decision subsequently made by the Board of AMSA after 1 January when it commences operations will have to be justified to the industry from which the Board derives its income. I think that that is an appropriate way to proceed. I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990. Dried fruits are not big in my electorate-in fact, if I am pinned down, I would have to say that I do not have any. But what I do have is a very large number-and I would be a prime example-of what are far more important, namely, constant and dedicated consumers. Any industry that is concentrated on production ahead of consumption inevitably must have major difficulties. Over the years there have been problems in this area from time to time. Besides that, I like the people involved in this industry and I have spoken in this chamber a number of times on this industry-indeed, at least a dozen times since I came to this place. It is a great Australian industry. It produces an excellent product. It is a most important adjunct to the other industries of the area. On a world basis the growers are highly productive and they are working to become even better. On a quality basis, the Australian producers are second to none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it is not all straight sailing. Even though one would expect that an industry that is doing everything right would have no problems, that is not the case. For instance, the European Community (EC) is opening up to new entrants and has allowed in Greece, which produces substantial quantities of dried fruits and which as part of the deal is heavily subsidised, and I mean heavily. Mr Lloyd in another place mentioned $70m a year. Let me quote what he said on page 1343 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 22 August:</PARA>
<PARA>The campaign against Turkey has been easier, I understand, than the problem with Greece. Greece is a part of the European Community and is receiving huge export subsidies. According to the Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, it is costing the European Community $70m a year to protect the Greek product. In Greece the grower sells to the packer for $2,100 a tonne. Then the packer sells to the buyer for $1,700 a tonne and the EC pays assistance to the packer of $1,300 a tonne, as well as $25 a month storage charge. So after all that subsidy, Greece last year had to feed 25,000 tonnes of its 78,000 tonnes of production to livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are up against. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the United States of America which also has large production subsidies. That is what happens overseas. At home we have to contend with the fancy value of the Australian dollar, the interest rates regime, the costs of the Australian waterfront, and so on and so forth. Then there are Australia's normal social costs which countries like Greece and Turkey do not have to meet. The Australian majority-that is the noisy majority-who do not have to compete with overseas industry have no reason to be concerned as to whether there is an Australian dried fruits industry-or any other industry if it comes to that. But every time that some other extra cost is added in Australia, someone else in the competitive, productive sector loses more of his livelihood. In this case it is the dried fruit growers. </PARA>
<PARA> We should all be proud of the people involved in the dried fruits industry. They are leaders in the world, although only small in world tonnages. Our industry has made good inroads into New Zealand, Germany, Canada and, more recently, Asia and in every case has done so on the basis of quality. For example, one has only to look at a pack of, say, `Angas Park' apricots against those awful little``el cheapos'' of the supermarket chains in their own packages to see what I mean. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently my colleague Senator Calvert carried out a survey on imported foodstuffs, and dried fruits was an example. Why, for goodness sake, should we want to buy commodities such as strawberry jam from Egypt, dried fruits from Greece and Turkey or potatoes from Japan? I just wonder about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> We know the standards of production here. We know the care and attention in processing. I never feel as sure about products such as the ones I have mentioned that are imported from countries whose approach to presentation and operation is much different from ours. I ask the Minister to pass on to Cabinet the general and increasing concerns of the community about the importation of foodstuffs from countries where there may be less than an equivalent standard of production, presentation, packaging or labelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we can start by making a bigger effort on labelling. Initially we can require the country of origin to be much more prominent than it currently is. I make a regular practice of looking for this in supermarkets. Particularly of late I have been looking around the dried fruits section. If, on the first inspection of a dried fruit pack, someone can find the country of origin he has had a very good look or he has just got new glasses. In the meantime, we need to examine this matter more thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no objection to people being able to buy overseas products, but I do want them to be fully aware that the choice they make is for the imported product. I want them to understand fully from which country they are buying. Contents need to be more fully described and packaging must conform to what we have determined Australian manufacturers must provide on the basis of what Australian consumers are entitled to. We must make adequate provision to attend to cases of alleged dumping. What we have now certainly is not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for quite substantial increases in growers' levies to go to research. It has the support of the growers. I congratulate them for doing this. Of the levy, currently approximately one-third goes to improving fruit quality, about one-third to improving the efficiency of dried vine fruit products, about one-sixth to developing new products and the balance to various sundries. With our small quantities, there can be no doubt that quality is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We produce 57,000 tonnes of sultanas of a total world production of 720,000 tonnes. As honourable senators can see, we produce a pretty small proportion. I also note that we produce 3,000 tonnes of dried apricots. We are second in the world in this area. Turkey, which is ahead of us, produces 35,000 tonnes a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have left their mark on the dried fruit industry. Through research in drying and growing, irrigation and trellising, breeding and handling, all of which have been important to this industry, from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s production more than doubled from a little over two tonnes to almost 4 1/2 tonnes to the hectare. That is a very good increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the industry for its path along the road to higher quality and increased productivity. I trust that its extra contribution will be spent wisely. It is a very good little industry. In fact, it is a great little industry. It certainly has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990 I am pleased to endorse the levy. I agreed with a lot of what Senator Archer said. I am surprised that he has not familiarised himself with the operation of Franklin Evaporators Pty Ltd-a very small industry located south of Hobart which dries fruit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the result of this proposed measure will be that more funds will be available for research both from within the industry and, as a result of the Government's dollar for dollar support, from outside the industry. As has been said before, we can only hope that that will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> As was noted in the debate on this matter in the other place, one of the reasons that this industry retains its superior productivity and quality is that the industry itself has dedicated funds to research. It is that sort of research which has presented us with an industry which, as Senator Archer described, is a very good industry for Australia. The industry contributes to our domestic market in terms of quality. It also contributes quite a considerable amount of money in terms of the export market. It is a strong industry which, over many years, has been beneficial to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that this industry is subjected to conflicting government policies. I believe they are conflicting because they have brought about some frustrating contradictions. The Government and the primary industry itself have funded research and other programs which have brought us wonderful varieties. They have brought us clean, uncontaminated and pesticide-free products which are virusfree, packaged as Senator Archer wants, date stamped, hygienically tested, and examined and produced using labour paid at award rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the programs and research in this country we have something to be proud of. That is all to no avail if we allow entry into our market of producers who have not had these very constraints and, to some extent, these advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> In debates about trade policy, tariffs, et cetera, we hear a great deal about level playing fields or some other such cliche which sounds attractive. But when it is translated we hear about removing market barriers; we hear about allowing true market forces to determine trading levels. That is not the real world at all; it is just as much a fiction as the idea of level playing fields. It is all nonsense. While ever we have such a multitude of factors affecting the selling price of our farm produce, while our producers carry the constraints I referred to earlier, overseas competitors are being cosseted into our markets. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a provision which differentiates between developing and developed countries for the entry of imported dried fruits, for example. Such a provision is ridiculous if it is exploited by callous multinationals which locate in developing countries to qualify for Australia's lower tariff rates and owe little or no allegiance to their country of convenience. They have used it in the same way that for some decades now shipping agents have used a port of convenience as their registration point. These operators owe little allegiance to their country of convenience. They then rip their profits off back to owners in the developed world. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this situation, which is more prevalent than we might imagine, we have other problems with the definition of developing countries. According to our present definition, Turkey qualifies as a developing nation and takes advantage of the lowest tariff rates we offer for dried apricots. Surely we all know that Turkey has been developing its dried apricot industry for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, and it still has not got it right. Its product, as Senator Archer said, is still inferior, contaminated and of dubious nutritional value. That is apart from the production area's proximity to Chernobyl and the hazards which might be associated with that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Thankfully, our dried fruit industry has shown a great capacity to market its product based on quality. The marketing arm of the industry has been able to stave off the threat that the Turkish product has mounted, based mainly on price and assisted with our generous provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Our dried fruit producers are still saddled with having to compete within the jungle out there, and it bears no resemblance to a level playing field. It might be level at our end but up the other end, where the other producers are operating, there are hurdles, ramps, supports and sandpits of all descriptions. Occasionally we even have boulders dropped in our end. Our producers, our team, have to pick them up before we even start playing the game. </PARA>
<PARA> I do endorse sincerely a great deal of what Senator Archer said, especially with regard to packaging and alleged dumping. As he is, I am concerned about the sort of competition we must battle against. In no way do I want to imply that the provisions of this Bill will make things harder. In fact, I think the very fact that the producers have supported the change to the levy as contained in the Bill emphasises their knowledge that it is only through research and the refinement of the quality of their product that they will be able to rise above all the difficulties that I have mentioned to the extent where we will continue to have a viable and very successful industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to join in this debate because the smaller horticultural primary industries in Australia are suffering extreme difficulties at the moment. This Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill allows us to address some of the problems facing these very important minor horticultural industries. The Bill lifts the research levy in the first year from $10.25 a tonne to $13.25 a tonne and to $17.00 a tonne the year after. These are the maximum limits and will be set by agreement between the Government and the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most Australian farmers realise they must have research to develop the best products in the world. No-one could disagree that our growers produce, pack and process the best products which are prepared under extremely hygienic conditions and then go into the marketplace and face competition that is heavily subsidised by direct subsidy from governments and also by indirect subsidies such as tax breaks and other help that is passed on to industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We are losing a tremendous amount of ground. Not only is it difficult to go into the international market and face tremendous competition that is heavily subsidised in various ways, but the problem now is that we are allowing products into Australia that are being dumped, subsidised and countervailed. Our farmers are now having to compete on their home market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult for those farmers to compete in the international market against corrupted world product markets. I cannot see any reason at all why our Australian farmers have to allow these corrupted world products to come in and take over the domestic markets. We have to do something about this or we will not have a horticulture industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before in this place, and will say it again, most horticulturalists in this country are in desperate trouble. I will refer to figures which I have obtained from a couple of industries. For the year 1989, 451 tonnes of imported currants were imported from Greece and 115 tonnes from other countries; a total of 566 tonnes, against a total Australian market of about 4,000 tonnes. In 1990 that figure has nearly doubled. We imported a total of 957 tonnes, of which 827 tonnes came from Greece-nearly a 100 per cent increase-and 130 tonnes from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We have lost a quarter of our market. Some of the major grocery chains have to adopt a little responsibility in this. Many of them buy these heavily subsidised products from countries such as Greece that allow a $1,000 a tonne subsidy, pack them overseas, bring in the products in containers and sell them as generic brands. In one particular case the products are marketed under the Home Brand label. I suppose that by association the shopper believes that these products that have a Home Brand label must be grown at home. Of course, that is not the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just look at imported sultanas. In 1989, 4,813 tonnes were imported from Turkey. In 1990, that had increased by 1,000 tonnes. Again, we have lost 25 per cent of our market. Each month Australians are consuming imported grocery items worth $150m. That is a lot of money. We imported $30.46m worth of fish products, $7.93m worth of cereals, $4.70m worth of sugar and honey-fancy importing sugar into Australia-$28.6m worth of coffee, tea and spices, I suppose there is some reason to bring in tea and spices, and $14.34m worth of miscellaneous edible preparations. At a time when we have to reduce our overseas purchasing, we are facing these dumped products coming into Australia. We have to do something about it. </PARA>

I know that if Senator Collins went to his workers and told them that their wages would increase over five years by 4 per cent, the Australian Council of Trade Unions would be jumping up and down. And rightly so. Unfortunately, that is the type of problem that is facing our horticulture industry. There is a way out of this and we must very quickly face the prospect of investigating our anti-dumping legislation. It takes nearly one year to get an anti-dumping case up before a decision can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to make some observations on the National Museum of Australia. At the outset, I would like to join those in this chamber who have supported in principle the concept of a museum that serves all Australians and visitors to this great nation as a focal point and unifying symbol of the great achievements of this country; a museum that brings together the diverse elements of our common past, both prior to settlement and since; and, above all, a museum that will serve to encapsulate the achievements of our country, by all its peoples, towards common prosperity, freedom and the quality of life that so many sections of our community so often take for granted-a museum that honours the achievements of great Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right. It is with some concern that I have observed recent community debate on the treatment of the themes chosen for the National Museum of Australia. I draw the Senate's attention to a recent article in the latest edition of the excellent monthly Quadrant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three main themes of the museum as stated in the annual report for 1988-89 are Aboriginal Australia, history of settlement post-1788, and the interaction of the Australian people with the environment. In the treatment of these themes the museum must not only present a balanced overview of the cultural diversity of this nation but extend its brief to the heritage, institutions, common aims and beliefs and untiring commitment to the betterment of all its people that have united this country. The agenda of the museum speaks of the cultural diversity of this nation, but I have to say that to focus on diversity while avoiding the major sources of unity in our society is to betray the very nature of some of this country's greatest achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> The path to the development of the National Museum has not been an easy one. In recognising the uncertain climate surrounding the museum, created by the less than consistent support of the current Government, which has posed some problems in the planning of the museum, I would like to canvass some of the elements that I see as being essential to the creation of a truly representative and unifying national museum. </PARA>
<PARA> I have obtained some of the promotional brochures of the museum and on reading these brochures I am concerned not so much at what is said in the material-although I have some qualifications there-but at what the material is silent about. For example, the material is silent about some of the most fundamental institutions, cannons and traditions of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> No mention is made of the Constitution, the monarchy, the judiciary, the rule of law or our armed forces, and only cursory attention is given to the political history component of the museum. Yet these institutions have served us as a unifying force and underlying strength, holding the diverse elements of this nation together through depression, drought, war and all of the hard times to create a society that many in the rest of the world look upon with some envy. </PARA>
<PARA> The museum's publications at times take an overtly negative stance towards this nation's English heritage. A negative reference to the British tradition is made in one of the pamphlets. As a person with Scottish blood and Scottish heritage, I presume that by British it means English. It represents an example of the alienation that we see so often in this type of material of the majority of Australians, who recognise the enormous debt this nation owes to the first settlers and the structures they gave this nation as a foundation for our future development-a foundation that has allowed the nation to prosper as one of the world's first democracies. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the emphasis in this material on the tremendous development of our economy in the last century or so, which in just 200 years has provided a level of material well-being, security and comfort to which many other nations of the world can only aspire? We have achieved this position by developing a harsh and formidable environment through our wheat, wool, mining, beef and manufacturing industries, but, above all, through the back-breaking and tireless efforts of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I could find in the material that I was able to obtain no mention of our system of free enterprise, freedom of endeavour and entrepreneurship which has provided the impetus for the triumph that is the development of Australia. Where are the references to Australian literature? Where are the references to our film industry, our wealth of musical talent and our significant and substantial schools of painting? These rate barely a mention. </PARA>
<PARA> To take stock of all the elements which have interrelated to create the nation we have today and would like to see in the future would be a task beyond the time limits which I have this evening. Yet in the creation of a truly national, unifying museum that will stand as a proud symbol of this nation, such fundamental elements as I have touched upon this evening must be given some emphasis. Above all, we must be cautious to avoid the highly selective and consequently divisive atmosphere that characterised the early planning of our bicentennial celebrations in 1988. We cannot allow the national symbol that will be the National Museum of Australia to be compromised by sectional interests or unbalanced views. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like Senator Richardson, the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment Tourism and Territories, to look at the issues I have raised here this evening and to ensure that the National Museum will represent all Australians, not just a narrow, ideological agenda. </PARA>

<TITLE>Multifunction Polis: Townsville Area</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.37)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a proposal by a group of north Queensland people for a multi-function polis in the Townsville region, something that will come about although the group was not a successful bidder for the multifunction polis for Australia. It is a significant project because it has got as far as it has and continues to go on with its own money. It has been privately funded and has not had any assistance whatsoever from the Queensland Government, either monetary or moral. But it has continued and it continues still.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The group proposes to establish a hi-tech city at a little place called Bluewater just north of Townsville. It has none of the environmental problems that Adelaide has and it is very close to the Japanese and South East Asian markets. It is also easily accessible by the enormous number of Japanese businessmen and scientists who are coming into Australia at present, many of them through northern Queensland via the air links in Cairns and Townsville, and cooperating with the James Cook University of north Queensland. Although that is a very new university, it is a well regarded one and one that has some unique and innovative programs and some fairly entrepreneurial directions in its movements. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal by this Future North Queensland syndicate, as it is called, has the cooperation of several cities in north Queensland. There is at times some parochialism between Townsville and Cairns and Mackay and Mount Isa, but this syndicate is made up of people from all of those areas and it is put forward as a genuine north Queensland project. The land has been set aside. The ideas are there and almost $100,000 worth of work has been done through the James Cook University and through consultants, which to date has been privately funded. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the aim of the Future North syndicate to work in close cooperation with the Adelaide multifunction polis. There are apparently some projects that will not proceed in Adelaide because of its climate or latitude, or for other reasons, so there is this linking of the proposed little multi-function polis in the north Queensland area near Townsville and the one in Adelaide. It is of some significance that the multifunction polis and the high-tech city will link with James Cook University and the proposed Cape York space base, which will be of great significance to north Queensland-and of great significance to Australia. All of this high-tech can happen and will happen in north Queensland, on land that has been set aside and is currently available. It has the right sort of people behind it, joining together and doing something good for Australia and for north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding so far has been private, as I mentioned. In conjunction with the South Australian Government, the Government has allowed approximately $4m for further investigations to be made in Adelaide. I imagine that the Future North syndicate will be looking at some stage for some form of assistance from the Government-not necessarily in monetary terms but a little material help in planning. Hopefully, when those approaches are made at some time in the future, the Government will consider them very sympathetically. It is a project that is well worth noting and one that I have a lot of pleasure in bringing to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>

As I am not the Minister responsible for the Bill and may not be in here, I simply give Senator Archer an indication that I will do that. I was very interested to hear the comments made by both Senator Archer and Senator Boswell. I have to confess I did think that Home Brand products were Australian manufactured. Now I see Senator Reid confirming that they are not. I will check out that matter with some personal interest because I am aware of the problems that are caused by the very heavy subsidies that are applied to the manufacture of these products overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The bulk of waste material produced in Parliament House is processed through the central waste system (CWS). The waste material consists mainly of the contents of office waste bins and large amounts of newspapers, reports and other waste paper. The waste is collected by contract cleaning staff and fed into the CWS chutes which are positioned at strategic locations on each floor of the building. Non-recyclable waste (eg. Kitchen waste and building materials) is fed into the garbage compactor at the loading dock and subsequently taken to the tip. The answer to question 2 addresses specific details relating to procedures for the disposal of paper; metal; glass; plastic; organic waste and food scraps.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Paper-this is divided and separated into two categories:-</PARA>
<PARA>contaminated non-recyclable paper waste (i.e. Newspapers/paper collected with plastics and food scraps) This is processed through the central waste system, baled and taken to the tip.</PARA>
<PARA>Uncontaminated recyclable paper waste (i.e. computer paper, reports etc)-processed through the CWS (on a special run) baled and sold to a contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>Metal-collected separately, placed into a special container at the loading dock and taken away for recycling by a contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>Glass-collected separately, placed into containers (brown, clear, green glass) at the loading dock and taken away for recycling by a contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>Plastic-processed with contaminated non-recyclable waste and taken to the tip.</PARA>
<PARA>Organic waste and food scraps-organic waste is taken to Mugga Lane recycling depot to be turned into compost. Wet food scraps are disposed of down the insinkerators and dry food scraps are deposited in the garbage compactor at the loading dock and taken to the tip.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A 2-year contract was awarded to Pacific Waste Management Pty Ltd on 26 August 1988 for a total waste removal and recycling service.</PARA>
